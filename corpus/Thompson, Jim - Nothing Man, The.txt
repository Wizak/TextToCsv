the nothing man by jim thompson copyright well they are all gone now all but me all those cleareyed clearthinking people people with their heads in the clouds and their feet firmly on the ground who comprise the editorial staff of the pacific city courier warmed with the knowledge of a days work well done they have retired to their homes they have fled to the sweet refuge of their families to the welcoming arms of brave little women and the joyous embrace of laughing kiddies and with them has gone the clearesteyed clearestthinking of them all dave randall none other than the couriers city editor he stopped by my desk on his way out his feet firmly on the ground or i should say the city room floor but i did not look up immediately i was too shaken with emotion as you have doubtless suspected i have a poets heart i think in allegories and in my mind was an image of countless father birds flapping their weary wings to the nests where the patient mother birds and the wee little birdies awaited them and and i say this unashamed i could not look up all the papa birds flapping toward their nests while i ah well i forced a cheery smile i had my family i was a member of the happy courier family cleareyed clearthinking and what bride could be finer than my own what better than to be wed to ones work dave cleared his throat waiting for me to speak then he reached over my shoulder and picked up an overnight galley on my column around the town with clinton brown the courier is generous in such matters i should say the courier believes in giving its employees an opportunity to grow thus desk men may do reporting reporters may work the desk and rewrite men such as myself may give the fullest play to the talents which on so many newspapers are restricted and stunted by the harsh mandates of the newspaper guild we take no dictation from labor bosses our protector our unfailing friend and counselor is austin lovelace publisher of the courier the door to his office is always open figuratively speaking one may always take ones problems to mr lovelace with the assurance that they will be promptly settled and without outside interference but i shall touch on these things later i shall have to touch upon them since they all figure to an extent in what the headwriters term the sneering slayer murders and this is the story of those murders for the nonce however let us get back to dave randall he laid the column galley back on my desk clearing his throat again he has always well almost always had trouble in talking to me and yet he insists on talking one almost feels at times that he has a guilty conscience uh working pretty late arent you brownie late colonel i said i had gained control of myself at last and i gave him a brave cleareyed smile well yes and no yes for a papa bird with a nest no for a restless nonpapa bird my work is my bride and i am consummating our wedding uh i notice your picture is pretty badly smudged ill order a new cut for the column id rather you didnt colonel i said i think of the lady birds drawn irresistibly by my chiseled unsmudged profile their tail feathers spread in delicious anticipation i think of their disappointment in the end you should excuse the pun colonel as a matter of fact i believe we should dispense with my picture entirely replace it with something more appropriate a coat of arms say brownie he was wincing i had barely raised the harpoon yet already he was wincing and there was no longer any satisfaction in it for me if there had ever been any but i went on something symbolic i said a jackass say rampant against two thirds of a pawnbrokers sign a smug allwiselooking jackass as for the device the slogan how is your latin colonel can you give me a translation of the phrase i regret that i had only his penis to give to my country he bit his lip his thin face sick and worried i took the bottle from my desk and drank long and thirstily brownie for gods sake wont you ever give it up yes i nodded word of honor colonel once this bottle is finished i shall not drink another drop im not talking about that not just that its everything else youre getting too raw mr lovelace is bound to mr lovelace and i i said are spiritual brothers we are as close as two wee ones in the nest mr lovelace would think my motives lofty even should i turn into a pigeon and void on his snowy locks youll probably do it said dave bitterly i hate to see a man bitter how can you have that calm objectivity so necessary to literary pursuits if you are bitter yes youll do it he repeated you wont stop until youre fired youll keep on until youre thrown out and i have to yes i said you mean youd feel it necessary to leave also how touching colonel my cup runneth over with love of need i say a strictly platonic nature i offered him a drink jerking the bottle back as he tried to knock it from my hands i took a drink myself and advised him to flee to the bosom of his family that is what you need colonel i said the cool hand of the little woman soothing away the days cares the light of love and trust that shines from a kiddies goddam you shut up he yelled it at the top of his lungs then he was bending over my desk bracing himself with his hands and his eyes and his voice were tortured with pleading and helplessness and fury and the words were pouring from his mouth in a halfcoherent babble goddamit hadnt he said it was a mistake hadnt he admitted it was a boner a thousand times did i think hed deliberately send a man into a field of antipersonnel mines it was a tragedy it was a hell of a thing to happen to any man and it must be ten times as hard when the guy was young and goodlooking and and it was his fault but what more could he do than hed already done what did i want him to do he choked up suddenly then he straightened and headed for the door i called after him a moment colonel you didnt let me finish youre finished he whirled glaring at me thats one thing youre finished with i warn you brownie if you ever again call me colonel ill ill well take my tip and dont do it i wont i said thats what i wanted to tell you im cutting it all out everything after all it was just one mistake in a war full of mistakes youll never have any more trouble with me dave he snorted and reached for the door he paused and looked at me frowning uncertainly you you almost sound like you meant that i do every word of it dave well he studied me carefully i dont suppose you do but he grinned tentatively still studying me slowly the suspicion went out of his eyes and the grin stretched into a broad facelighting smile thats great brownie im sorry i blew my top a moment ago because i do know how you feel but sure i said sure you do its all right dave why dont you knock off for the night come out to the house with me ill open a bottle have kay cook us up some steaks shes been after me to bring you home to dinner thanks i said i guess not tonight got a story i want to finish something of your own weell yes i said yes its something of my own a kind of melodrama im building around the sneering slayer murders i suppose itll baffle hell out of the average whodunit reader but perhaps he needs to be baffled perhaps his thirst for entertainment will impel him to the dread chore of thinking great dave nodded earnestly he hadnt of course heard anything id said great stuff he was looking happier than id seen him for a long time i think hed have looked happy even if id taken him up on the dinner invitation well ha ha dont work all night he said ha ha i said ill try not to he clapped me on the back clumsily he said good night and i said good night and he left i studied the page in my typewriter ripped it out and put in another one i had got off on the wrong foot i had begun the story with deborah chasen when naturally it had to begin with me me sitting alone in the city room with a dead cigarette butt in my lips and an almost full quart of whisky on my desk the two teletype machines began to click and clatter first the aps then the ups i strolled over and took a look at them pacific city in the words of our publisher is a city of homes churches and people which translated from its chamberofcommerce lingua franca means that it is a small city a nonindustrial city and a city where little goes on ordinarily of much interest to the outside world the courier is the only newspaper the wire services do not maintain corespondents here but are covered when coverage is necessary by our staffers i ripped the yellow flimsies from the teletypes and read los ang pm spl ap to courier pacity chf det lem stukey reptd missing over twentyfour hours true unusual possible connection sneering slayer case lets hear from you courier thatcher ap la la cal pm up to cour radio repts detec chf lem stukey missing how about this courier why not mentioned any your editions unimportant often missing answer dale los ang up i tossed the flimsies into a wastebasket and strolled over to a window true yes the report was true enough pacific citys chief of detectives lem stukey had been missing for more than a day unusual weeli hardly the police department wasnt alarmed about it they hadnt been able to locate him in any of the blind pigs or whorehouses where he usually holed up but he could have found a new place or perhaps someone had found a place for him anyway the wire services couldnt expect us to follow up on a query at this hour we were an afternoon paper our noon edition hit the streets at ten in the morning our home at noon and our late final a replate job at three in the afternoon that was more than three hours ago so to hell with ap and up to hell with them anyway i stared out the window out and down to the street ten stories below and i was sad more than sad even bitter and all over nothing nothing at all really merely the fact that the last line of this story will have to be written by someone else i turned from the window and marched back to my desk i successfully matched myself for two drinks and received another on the house i looked back through what i had written then i lowered my hands to the keys and began to type the day i met deborah chasen was the same day i got the letter from the veterans administration it was around nine of a morning a couple of months ago and dave randall dave had on that morning brought it over to my desk he stood lingering a moment afterward trying to look friendly and interested he mumbled something about good news i hope and i opened the letter it was as ive said from the veterans administration it announced that my disability compensation was being increased to approximately eighty dollars a month i shoved back my chair i stood up clicked my heels together and gave dave a snappy salute official communication sir sergeant brown respectfully requests the colonels instructions carry on he looked nervously around the office that sickly smile on his face brownie i wish thank you colonel the hour for the morning patrol approaches do i have the colonels permission to do any goddamned thing you want to he said and he strode back to his desk i sat down again i winked at tom judge who worked the rewrite desk opposite me i gave him a smile a very cheery smile considering that i hadnt had a drink since breakfast tom didnt smile back why do you keep riding him he scowled why make things tough on a good guy why tom i said you mean you and the colonel are like that i mean i like him i mean if i were in his place id straighten you out or kick your ass out of here boy he shook his head disgustedly talk about justice where the hell do you get off drawing a pension anyway it is puzzling i said isnt it obviously i am not disabled for employment obviously i have suffered no disfigurement i am even more handsome than on the day i was born and my mother boasted with considerable veracity i believe that i was the prettiest baby in town his eyes narrowed i get it youre a fairy huh is that an assertion i said or merely a surmise dont think im afraid of you brown arent you i said then perhaps youd like to do something about my statement made herewith that you are a nosy dullwitted sonofabitch and a goddamned lousy newspaperman his face went white and he made motions at getting up from his chair i got up and walked into the john a moment later he followed me in i could see that he was still sore but he was trying to cover up he would wait for a better time to pay me off look brown i didnt mean tto and i i said apologize for calling you a sonofabitch about the pension brownie not that its any of my business but well i guess it must have something to do with your nerves huh thats it i nodded soberly thats it exactly tom a considerable portion of the nerves kind of a nerve center was completely destroyed i watched him carefully afraid for a moment that i might have said too much wondering what he would do and what i would do if the truth did dawn on him because there is something hideously funny about a thing of that kind people laugh about it privately perhaps but they laugh they give you sympathetic smiles and glances their faces tight with laughter restrained and even when they do not laugh you can hear them poor guy what a hell of a ha ha ha i wonder what he does when he has to you cant work you cant live you cant die you are afraid to die afraid of the complete defenselessness to laughter that death will bring but i neednt have worried about tom judge he lacked the inquiring mind the ability to follow up on a lead he was to mention a statement i had not retracted a goddamned lousy newspaperman gosh im sorry brownie i guess that would make you pretty edgy i still think youre pretty tough on dave but i told him i didnt mean anything by it not only is he my friend i said but i respect him professionally i wouldnt want to embarrass him by repeating the compliment but dave strikes me as typifying the genus courier cleareyed clearthinking his feet firmly on the ground and his head tom laughed halfheartedly okay he said you win he returned to the rewrite bank i because the couriers first deadline was past went out on my morning patrol it was one of my better patrols the officer of the day was at his post and the heavy artillery stood waiting and ready all secured i said all secured said jake the press club bartender proceed with maneuvers i said he bent his wrist smartly bottle tilted over glass in a beautifully executed movement excellent i said now i think we shall have closeorder drill beggin your pardon sir but yes you only had i mean you aint completed the barrage a new tactic i said the remainder of the barrage will follow the drill okay but if you fall on your face dont forward harch i said he lined three oneounce shot glasses up on the bar placed a twoounce glass at the end of the line and filled all four i disposed of them with dispatch and dipped into the bowl of cloves reports or inquiries i said i dont know how you do it he said i swear mr brown if i tried that id ah i said but i have youth on my side wondrous youth with the whole great canvas of life stretching out before me you always drink like that whats it to you i said and i went back to the office i was experiencing that peculiar twoway puil that had manifested itself with increasing frequency and intensity in recent months it was a mixture of calm and disquiet of resignation and frantically furious rejection simultaneously i wanted to lash out at everything and do nothing about anything the logical result of the conflict should have been stalemate yet somehow it was not working out that way the positive emotions the impulse to act were outgrowing the others the negative ones the calm and resignation were exercising their restraining force not directly but at a tangent they were not so much restrictive as cautionary they were pulling me off to one side moving me down a course that was completely out of the world yet of it i wondered if i was drinking too much i wondered how it would be how i would manage to eat and sleep and talk and work how to live if i drank less i decided that i wasnt drinking enough and that henceforth i should be more careful in that regard dave randall looked at me nervously as i sat down tom judge jerked his head over his shoulder in a way that meant that mr lovelace had arrived and brownie he leaned forward whispering you shouldve seen the babe he had with him how now i said much as it pains me i shall have to report the matter to mrs lovelace the marriage vows are not to be trifled with boy for some of that you could report me to my wife let me catch you i said sternly and i shall it was an average morning newswise i did a story on the annual flower show and another on the county dairymens convention i rewrote a couple of wire stories with a local twist and picked up a few items for my column so it went that was the sort of thing and about the only sort of thing that got into the courier mr lovelace frowned on what he termed the negative type of story he was fond of asserting that pacific city was the cleanest community in america and he was very apt to suspect the credibility of reporters who produced evidence to the contrary i could have done it and got away with it for reasons that will become obvious i held a preferred place in the happy courier family but i was temporarily content with the status quo and there was no one else it had been years since any topflight reporter had applied for a job on the pacific city courier with my last story out of the way i began to feel those twinges of mental nausea that always herald the arrival of my muse i felt the urge to add to my unfinished manuscript puke and other poems i rolled paper into my typewriter after some preliminary fumblings around i began to write lives of great men lives en masse seem a stench and cosmic ruse take my share ill take a glass of booze not good definitely not up to omar or perhaps i should say fitzgerald i tried another verse sentience my sober roomer steals my warming cloak of bunk leaves me an impotent assumer of things that i can take when drunk very bad far worse than the first stanza assumer what kind of word was that and when was i ever actually drunk and the wretched sniveling selfpity in that sunk sunk sunk i ripped the paper out of the typewriter and threw it into the wastebasket i didnt do it a bit too soon either mr lovelace wasnt a dozen feet away he was heading straight toward me and the babe tom judge had mentioned was with him i dont know i never will know whether she was a little slow on the uptake a little dumb as at first blush i suspected her of being or whether she was merely tactless unusually straightforward careless of what she said and did i just dont know i gave mr lovelace a big smile including her in the corner of it i complimented him on his previous days editorial and asked him if he hadnt been losing weight and admired the new necktie he was wearing i wish i had your taste sir i said i guess its something you have to be born with no im not overdrawing it it doubtless seems that i am but im not he couldnt be kidded however good you said he was it wasnt ever quite so good as he thought he was i poured it on and he stood beaming and rocking on the balls of his feet nodding at the woman as if to say now heres a man who knows the score even when she burst out laughing he didnt catch on he looked at her a little startled then the beam came back to his face and he chuckled uh just finished telling mrs chasen a little story kind of a delayed punch eh mrs chasen she nodded holding a handkerchief over her mouth im ssorry but nothing to be sorry about often affect people that way uh by the way mrs chasen this is the mr brown i spoke to you about come along with us eh brown i followed them out into the reception room mrs chasen he explained is a very dear friend of ours uh of mrs lovelace and myself unfortunately uh we did not expect mrs chasens visit and mrs lovelace is out of town and uh well you know my situation brown tied up every second of the day i said promptly not a moment to call your own perhaps its not my place to say it mrs chasen but there isnt a busier man in pacific city than mr lovelace the whole town leans on him because he is strong and wise they she started laughing again staring at him with narrowed unblinking eyes and it was a nice laugh to hear despite the undertone of contempt and the way it made her tremble what it trembled was pleasant to watch mr lovelace waited smiling of course but with a nervous glance at the foyer clock so if youll uh take over brown he resumed you know show mrs chasen our local points of interest and uh play the host eh i knew what he meant i knew exactly where mrs chasen stood she was an acquaintance of his and his wifes a friend perhaps of a friend of theirs and as such she could not be given the fast brushoff but she was certainly not their very dear friend she wasnt because mrs lovelace was not out of town and he mr lovelace was about as busy as the zipper on an old maids drawers the gradec tour that was what mrs chasen was supposed to get a drive around the city a highball or two a meal in a nottooexpensive place and a firm shove onto her train i understand sir i said ill show mrs chasen what we mean when we call this the friendly city just leave everything to me mr lovelace and dont worry about a thing you have far too many cares as it is uh ha ha excellent brown oh dont bother to come back today make a holiday of it you can make the time up some other day do you see i turned to mrs chasen spreading my hands is it any wonder we all love mr lovelace lets go she said i need some fresh air if shed been balancing a glass of water on her head she wouldnt have spilled a drop with the nod she gave him she turned abruptly and stepped onto the elevator i studied her as best i could on the way down to the street and i liked what i saw but i couldnt say why i liked it she wasnt any youngster around thirtyfive id say added up feature by feature she was anything but pretty corncolored almostcoarse hair pulled back from her head in a horses tail green eyes that were just a shade off center mouth a little too big assessed individually the parts were all wrong but when you put them all together you had a knockout there was something inside of her some quality of well fullness of liveness that reached out and took hold of you when she stepped from the elevator i saw that she toedin a little her ankles were overthin the calves of her legs larger than the norm but it was all right on her on her it looked good she preceded me to the street the outsize hips swinging on the tooslender waist or was it the slenderness of the waist that made her hips seem outsize one thing was certain there was nothing at all wrong with mrs chasens bank balance not that is unless shed given saks fifth avenue and i magnin a hell of a kidding we reached the sidewalk and i started to take her by the elbow she turned and looked up into my face have you she said been drinking mr brown why i said drawing away a little what makes you think i why do you ask that i didnt know what to say the question had caught me completely off guard and i still couldnt make up my mind whether she was stupid or only appeared to be as i say i never could make it up its pretty early in the day to be drinking i hedged not for me she said under the circumstances im going to have a drink mr brown several drinks in fact and you can come along or not come along just as you please as far as im concerned you and your dear mr lovelace tut i said tish and pish mrs chasen you have just said a naughty word and there is only one thing to be done we shall have to wash out your mouth what she laughed a little nervously what do you come mrs chasen i said come with me to the press club i made a charles boyer face and she laughed again not nervously now rather i thought hungrily well come on she said she leaned back in the booth her green eyes crinkled and shiny with laughter her breasts under the sheer white blouse shivering and shaking id used to visualize breasts like those but i never thought id live to see any id considered them well you know physically impractical something that looked very good in the blueprint stage but impossible of achievement it just went to show as mr lovelace often remarked yes sir here was the proof there was no problem too big for american genius and knowhow you crazy thing brownie do you always talk so crazy only with people i love deborah only with you and mr lovelace you said it brownie you said it that time so i did i said and i shall take my punishment with my elbows firmly on the table closeorder drill with a barrage brownie a big barrage jake i called advance with artillery perhaps she hadnt been too tactful about it but shed had a right to be sore at mr lovelace her late husband late and elderly had been an oil man the lovelaces had often visited them at their place in oklahoma then six months ago her husband had died and she had found herself with a great deal of money and even more than she knew what to do with money and time and a growing suspicion that she was not highly regarded in the circles she had formerly moved in she had fought back she had delivered two snubs for every one she received but you lose at that game even when you win there is no satisfaction in it finally she had begun to travel she was on her way to the riviera now and today she had stopped off here and lovelace of course had given her the firmest brushoff of all she was lonely as hell though not the kind to admit it the chances were that she would always be lonely because that manner of hers whatever its motivation was not something that would ordinarily win friends and influence people i had a hunch that she had even got under the lovelace hide i stole a glance at my wrist watch and looked back at her thus far she was holding her drinks very well but train time was four hours away she was catching the fourfifteen into los angeles so it seemed to me that some food was indicated i picked up a menu turned it right side up and started to pass it across the table ill she said have the hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and buttered asparagus i nodded that sounds say how did you know that was on the menu i read it she smiled pleased as a child with herself upside down and sitting way over there uhhuh my eyes are wond i mean i have very good eyesight in that case i said you had better order the steak you will be the only person in history ever able to see a press club steak we had the turkey sandwiches i bought a bottle from jake and we got my car off the parking lot where are we going brownie she said then before i could answer i know something about you i was afraid of that i said yes officer you have the right person i am actually tinka tin nose girl insect exterminator youre sad why wouldnt i be with a name like that i know you want to know how i know ive already told you crazy she gave it up where did you say we were going well we have several points of interest ensconced in the basement of the public library is the largest collection of indian artifacts in southeast pacific county why they have a metate there that actually makes your hands itch for a pot and pooh check youre a thousand per cent on the ball dc and let me be the first to congratulate the new manager of our pooh division how about a sonofabitch would you like to see the worlds biggest sonofabitch deborah i thought id met him this morning sharp or was she but this guy is in another class hes our chief of detectives here and no sale it wasnt obviously and i say this in all modesty she was quite content with the company present well i said ill have to take you some place i may be asked to account for my time what about a visit to our city animal shelter animal shelter she wrinkled her nose double pooh its a nice long ride i said carelessly way out in the country you know i think you might enjoy it oh she sidled a glance at me then nodded firmly i think i might too that then was the way it happened and as you can see there was nothing sinister about it nothing premeditated that trick shed pulled in the press club reading upside down and backward had made no real impression on me i hadnt been even mildly interested in why she thought i was sad we drove out to the shelter well call it dog pound if you like stopping at intervals for drills bombardments and barrages by the time we reached our destination the bottle was empty and saks magnin et al knew little about the anatomy of mrs chasen that i didnt know she was a little mussed she was happy as all hell id brought her back into the human race again and her heart was right in her eyes she could carry on by herself from now on the ice was broken and shed be all right as right at any rate as she could be much righter than she had been the shelter was and is supported by donations rather i should say it was supposed to be supported by them because the cash that came in wasnt half enough to operate the place decently if mr and mrs peablossom the old couple who superintended the shelter hadnt donated most of their wages the dogs would have been completely starved instead of the two thirds starved that they usually were mrs peablossom insisted on fixing tea for us and afterward the old gentleman walked us out to the gate of the compound i just dont know what were going to do mr brown he fretted the kennels have fallen to pieces we have to let them run loose there in the court and they keep coming in more and more of them and i cant bear to have them put to sleep poor homeless fellows but hardly anyone adopts a dog any more and he rambled on worriedly while deborah and i stood looking through the wiremesh gate there must have been two hundred dogs in there closed in by the sixfoothigh wall they lay panting on the hot shadeless pavement or milled around listlessly pawing and sniffing hopelessly at the twigs that had blown over the wall i fumbled at my wallet then shoved it back into my pocket im a little short of funds today mr peablossom but thats quite all right mr brown youve done far too much already but i havent done anything said deborah and she opened her purse she took out a fiftydollar bill and handed it to him bless you the old man almost wept thank you so much mrs chasen do you have dogs of your own no she said i dont like dogs she saw my frown i mean im afraid of them a big dog knocked me down when i was a little girl and i never got over it ive been terrified by them ever since i reached up to lift the hasp of the gate but mr peablossom caught my arm i dont believe youd better go in today mr brown the dogs are so hungry and you think theyre that hungry well he hesitated looking apologetically at deborah you know how it is with dogs mr brown they can smell fear it makes them worse than they might be ordinarily i know i said well weve got to be going anyway mrs chasen has less than an hour to catch her train the old man saw us out to the car and stood waving until we were out of sight deborah leaned back in the seat looking at me out of the corner of her eyes brownie yes i said do you do you think im pretty no i said youre too big too little too something every way i look at you so you cant be pretty what you are is just the damnedest delightfulest chunk of woman i ever laid eyes on she sighed comfortably you really mean that dont you every word and you like me you know brownie like like isnt quite the word i said im crazy about you almost any man would be if you didnt scare him off which reminds me deborah i suggested several ways by which she could do herself a favor thinking before she spoke aiming her laugh in some direction other than a persons face would you like me better that way brownie i like you just as you are i said but im out of the picture youre leaving and leave with me brownie whaat i jerked the car back onto the road in the nick of time why mrs chasen are you suggesting anything any way you want it darling id like to have you marry me but but but honey i shook my head thats crazy you dont know anything about me yes i do all i need to know i laughed shakily the whisky was wearing off my nerves were rising on edge slicing up sawtoothed through the skin all you need to know eh what do you know anyway that i can spiel the crap until your head spins why not that im hot as a twodollar pistol why not i spiel it out to keep from drowning in it and i was only emasculated only not castrated youll feel different tomorrow i said lets face it deborah weve had quite a bit to drink today i want you to come with me brownie no i said now drop it will you its too damned idiotic to talk about then ill stay here i wont take my train i said to drop it i snapped of course youll take your train youve got a drawingroom bought and paid for youve got your steamship passage youre going to get on that train and not without you she said calmly either you go or i stay i tell you you cant i cant we hardly know each other i havent got anything but my job and you uhhuh she nodded pleasantly i have plenty for both of us bbut dammit people just dont do those things pooh on people she said it was like fighting something that wasnt there something you couldnt believe in fighting fighting yourself shed seemed as lost as i was and it had been so long so very long since id let myself touch a woman id wanted to help her shove her back into the mainstream of life that i could never be part of and we were entering the edge of town i slowed the car slightly i made my voice harsh all right mrs chasen you wont let me do it the nice way so well have to make it the other i dont like you i dont like your looks youre stupid youre cockeyed i havent seen hair like yours since i stopped riding horses youve got a can on you like a whale and i wouldnt get near that topside of yours in a high wind for all the bbrownie sstop i stopped im sorry i said i dont enjoy talking to you this way you were just a job with me an assignment and i tried to goddam you i said for she was laughing her head was thrown back and the green eyes were crinkled and flashing and that topside id mentioned was trembling and shivering she was laughing all over i could almost see the naked rippling flesh feel it shivering against mine while the green eyes looked up into mine hot then curious and at last pitying and disgusted my hands on the steering wheel were wet with sweat youre so funny brownie yeah i said very funny i even keep myself in stitches she put her hand on my knee gave it a quick firm squeeze funny and sad she said but you wont be sad with me ill make you the happiest man in the world theres just one way you can do that i said get on your goddamned train and get out of town and dont come back huhuh she said now you park right here and well go in and get my bags we parked i took her by the shoulders and turned her around facing me no brownie she tried to squirm away theres not a bit of use in telling me that my my im not i said im telling you im nuts about you i think perhaps i even love you but well call me any name you like think what you want to i thought wed just have a high old time together and then youd go your way and id go mine so i didnt see how it would make any difference but i didnt have to say it all the laughter went out of her eyes and she turned slowly away from me thats she changed the question into a statement thats true brownie its true were separated but were still married shed never give me a divorce well she fumbled for the door handle im sorry deborah she shrugged and the horsetail of corncolored hair brushed against her shoulders ddont be she said dont be sad brownie thats the way it is so ththats the way it she got out and walked toward the station and she didnt look back i may be wrong i have been wrong about so many things but i cant recall ever hearing or knowing of a sonofabitch who did not do all right for himself im talking about real sonsofbitches understand the gradea doubledistilled steamheated variety you take a man like that a sonofabitch who doesnt fight it who knows what he is and gives his all to it and youve really got something rather hes got something hes got all the things that are held out to you as a reward for being a nonsonofabitch for being unlike lem stukey chief of detectives of the pacific city police department he poured himself another drink shoved the bottle across his desk toward me and gestured with his glass he was a goodlooking guy gigoloish goodlooking with a little less beef on his belly and a lot less larceny in his heart he might have been an instructor in a dollaralesson dance academy i dont make you brownie he said i just dont dig you at all keed aint i always treated you right you ever ask me for anything you didnt get hell i try to be a pal to you and stuke i said will you shut up for a minute but well sure brownie go right ahead its this way stuke im immune know what i mean ive developed a tolerance for sonsofbitches i can drink with you and enjoy it i can let you do me a little favor without having the slightest desire to puke in a sort of hideous way i actually like you but i like you too brownie youre my kind of people now lets not carry this too far i said but speaking of favors stuke i do you one every day every time i sit down at my typewriter without writing that lem stukey is the chief pimp gambler allaround and overall racketeer of pacific city im doing you a favor and any time you think im not brownie he spread his hands did i say no i know you could blast me youre the only guy that could from what i hear you could maybe write a story that old lovey drawers was beating his own wife and hed see that it went on the front page i know see i got the highest appreciation for you friendship i know what you can do or i wouldnt be asking dont i said dont ask im too tired even to tell you to go to hell hard day huh he shook his head sympathetically ill give you a couple bottles when you leave anything i can do keed anything at all just put a name to it i sighed and picked up my glass he was a hard man to say no to but no was all you could say once you said yes youd keep right on saying it the rest of your life all right stuke i said lets get back to the beginning i said i was immune i can drink your whisky talk with you spend an evening with you now and then i can do you the negative favor of doing nothing but thats all i can do thats all i will do i will not as you put it give you the smallest boost i will not either by word or deed do anything which might even remotely assist in making you county judge aw brownie why ive told you youre a menace a plague a sonofabitch you do enough damage where you are but at least youre bracketed within fairly narrow boundaries i shudder to think of you operating in the almost unlimited periphery of the judiciary okay throw the big words at me show me up i aint had no education im just a poor boy who worked hard and brother i said when you say that smile well he smiled a little sheepishly i got an idea how you feel brownie you think a man ought to be a lawyer to not necessarily i said the job doesnt require it and ive known some pretty good judges who werent lawyers it could work out although it violates general precedent if if my dear lem a man was sincere honest and devoted to the publics interest which you are not no stuke you stay where you are and therell be no trouble from me mr lovelace wants the courier all sweetness and light no scandal no exposes nothing that would reflect on the fair name of pacific city thats the way he wants it and thats the way he shall have it up to a point you wont be knocked you wont be blasted out of your present job but neither will you be boosted upstairs he was silent a moment his black beady eyes fixed on me in an unblinking stare then he shrugged with pretended indifference suit yourself brownie i was just trying to be a pal to you the bandwagons already rolling and i thought maybe youd want to hop on i choked and coughed i laughed so hard i almost fell out of my chair stuke please you think im lyin huh of course youre lying when did you ever do anything else i got plenty of influential friends how you think i climbed into this job like you say i said by working hard you brought your little redhandled shovel to work with you and you dug twentyfour hours a day before the alarums and excursions were sounded you had uncovered any number of figurative but exceedingly smelly bodies now huhuh alas poor stuke they know you well no more bodies no county judgeship no and im probably offending etiquette in mentioning it whisky in this bottle he laughed and popped the cork on another quart the whiz dont do anything at all to you does it keed just makes you spout a little smoother that i said is because i am a courier man i have my head in the clouds and my feet firmly on the ground yeah he grinned aint it the truth he stopped arguing about the county judge deal we sat drinking and kidding listening to the slash of the rain against the windows it was only a little after five less than an hour ago id taken deborah to the station but it was almost pitch dark outside with the sudden and violent storm that had struck the city stuke shook his black oily head cocking a hand to his ear dig them waves will you almost three blocks away and youd think the ocean was coming right through the door i nodded absently thinking of deborah wishing i could stop thinking of her i wondered why shed said how shed known i was sad right when i was kidding the hardest what you doing tonight keed what you say we step out and play some babes i shook my head that was an easy one to duck go over to rose island tonight in this storm yeah he sighed thats right no ferries runnin tonight and no one would take a charter boat out even if you was crazy enough to ride with em maybe i could now stuke you should know better than that no loose women in pacific city not in the respectable mainland sections of pacific city well he broke off abruptly frowning he cursed and snapped his fingers christ pal i almost forgot to tell you i ought to have my ass kicked ill go along with the last statement i said what about the first one im sorry as hell keed i meant to call you at the time but it was almost three oclock see and i figured youd already be gone from the office he swallowed and his eyes shifted away from mine she came in on the twothirty bus brownie one of the boys spotted her it was too well done too carelessly done mrs clinton browns arrival wasnt something that stuke would forget by pretending that he had he was proving the opposite it meant plenty to him my wifes over on the island i said i dont suppose you know the address well lets see now he frowned its oh yeah its the golden eagle cottage seven it aint so bad as most of em keed little tourist camp on the south shore i know what it is i said you can bring your own whore instead of renting theirs he clucked his tongue sympathetically i set my glass down and raised a hand to my temples i had to do it i had to cover my face sick and stunned as i was i was choking with laughter its a damned shame brownie i thought shed given up bothering you yyeah i said shakily its certainly strange how come you put up with her anyhow a mans got to support his wife but he dont have to live with her one of those things i mumbled i lowered my hand and stood up he jumped to his feet also where you going brownie you cant go over to the island tonight i aint gonna let you even try it the hell he said hed have given his eyeteeth to have me try it dont worry i said theres no way i could get over there tonight i just want to go home ill go with you i can see this has hit you pretty hard keed a time like this a man needs someone to talk to ill take us along a couple bottles and ill take the bottles i said and go by myself he looked at me trying to appear concerned and worried while he sized me up but there wasnt anything for him to see the twoway pull had taken hold and he wasnt looking at the real me the meinchargeofme id moved off to one side and i was moving faster every second i was miles away and ahead of him okay brownie he shrugged if thats the way you want it he took two quarts of whiskey from a filing cabinet and twisted a newspaper around them we said good night and i left i walked out to my car walked not ran and i was soaked to the skin before id gone twenty feet i slid into the seat shivering yet not really conscious of the cold i uncorked one of the bottles and raised it staring blankly through th streaming windshield until the last time her last hellraising visit to pacific city id been as easy on her as a man could be who was through with his wife id put it to her as i had in the hospital that it was just simply a case of not loving her any more but it hadnt worked and id seen it wasnt going to work in a way i was actually holding out hope to her so the last time id got tough tough and nasty and it seemed to have done the job she hadnt been in pacific city for three months id have sworn that in another three months or so shed be filing for divorce that shed made the break final and marry someone else that was what she would have done that i was sure was what she would have done except for lem stukey lem wanted something that only i could deliver hed been looking for a way to force me to deliver so i figure hed started wondering about her and hed got in touch with her and started her to wondering think it over keed there aint no other woman you cant get him to go out with a babe and the guys drinkin himself to death somethings botherin him see maybe he done somethin wrong while he was in the army and he split with you to keep from mixing you up in it well ellen would know that i hadnt done anything wrong shed know that her brownie wasnt the kind to commit bigamy or get himself an incurable dose or engage in espionage or involve himself in any similarly shameful situation or activity still id seemed quite contented with our marriage before i entered the army yet afterward as soon as i was shipped back to the states id insisted on splitting up and since there wasnt another woman since i wasnt in love with someone else why stukey had prodded her hed kept her mind on the puzzle and the truth must have finally dawned on her or she wouldnt be here it was rather strange of course that hed told me she was back but i shook my head it wasnt strange very little went on in pacific city that lem didnt know about id know that he knew she was back and his failure to tell me would have seemed suspicious as it was he hadnt carried the matter off too well hed overacted been a little too offhand i hadnt thought him capable of embarrassment but obviously he had been i held the bottle to my mouth swallowing steadily swallowing and swallowing a hammer seemed to swing against my heart numbing it and another hammer swung against my back driving through from my back to the heart and it seemed to push forward numb and lifeless and press out through the skin then it slid back into place the numbness went away it beat slowly but firmly i lowered the bottle it was more than a third empty id just killed myself but i wasnt dead there wasnt i thought listening to the roar of the ocean anything that would kill me i was going to go right on living forever and ever and how could i how could i live in a world of snickers and whisperings and amused pity i corked the bottle and started the car i drove up to the center of town circled the civic center and turned back in the direction id come from but on another street it was probably unnecessary this maneuvering but you could never be sure with the lem stukeys of the world they operated with a peculiar shrewdness that transcended intelligence they had climbed to their pinnacles by doing the unexpected at any rate i had plenty of time time with me was endless there was no tail on me i made sure of the fact i drove through the windhurled downpour to the piers wound the car through the dark chaos of sheds and warehouses and parked in the shadows if shadows there were in this blackness of a sheetiron storage building i uncorked the bottle and dug some dry cigarettes out of the pocket of the car i sat drinking and smoking thinking how strange it was that the thing that had to be done was always the hardest to do she wasnt bad you see she was weak spiteful stubborn shed made her own life a hell as a means of making mine one but except for what had happened to me she wouldnt have done what she had the flaws of character and spirit would never have appeared i think the truest maxim ever coined is the one to the effect that untried virtue doesnt count years before when i was a kid i owned a little ford runabout a model t and i took care of that car as a man takes care of his love for i did love it i was and remain a model t guy more comfortable with imperfection than its opposite cherishing the ability to discern and shore up a latent weakness i knew the car wasnt a cadillac hell what would a guy like me do with a cad it was a model t and i treated it good and it treated me good when i sold it after two years of troublefree driving it was actually in better shape than the day i bought it two months later it was on the junk heap less than two months after i split with ellen she was whoring i belched and kicked open the door of the car it was too bad but thats the way it was if i had to live i had to work and if i had to work i had to be around people and if i had to be around people i had i had to be around people they mustnt know mr clinton brown regrets the necessity of murdering ellen tanner brown i stuffed the full bottle into my pocket and carried the other under my arm i staggered down the pier to the community dock and climbed down the ladder somewhere near the foot of it i paused and peered around in the darkness then i said eeniemeeniemineymootoodlededoo and let go everything was a little confused for a moment my head was planted firmly in a boat but my feet were in the clouds having great faith in the wisdom of providence particularly that section dealing with the laws of gravity i remained unperturbed i am a courier man i thought and a courier man does not miss the boat my feet came down and my head came up and my ass end was planted firmly in the water cleareyed i let it remain there while i got the bottle from under my arm and bought myself a drink then i pulled it over the side untied the mooring rope and picked up the oars i have never been able to understand the high regard that leaders of dangerous missions have for sobriety sober one challenges the fates unsober the fates cannot be bothered with you while the drunk wanders unharmed amid sixlane traffic a car swerves up on the sidewalk to pick off the sober man while the drunk walks away from an eightstory fall the sober man stumbles from the curve and breaks his neck it never fails thats the way it is so thats the way it is take me which you are doomed to do for some two hundred pages take me i know nothing about boats i had never been in a rowboat before and while i wasnt drunk naturally since i cannot get drunk i was very far from sober a sober man would never have got fifty feet from the dock not being sober i got a mile and a half all the way to rose island due to my falling or being thrown out of the boat a couple of times and subsequent willynilly driftings while the boat found me again my trip was something less than speedy but i got there i pulled the boat up on the beach and finished the opened bottle then having got my bearings i headed for the golden eagle cottages they were only about a block away i couldnt have debarked much nearer to them if id ridden the ferry and taken a taxi there were twelve of them laid out in a triangle with its base to the ocean number seven was at the end its shades were drawn but i could detect a little light inside i seemed to hear a faint stirring and splashing i tapped softly on the door there was silence for a moment then a splash and a muted yes brownie i said brownie what in the the door flew open she pulled me inside stood against me naked her arms around my neck her thick black hair buried against my chest gosh honey gee its good to see you i but youre soaked let me take im all right i said and i pushed her away im going to keep on being all right i walked on into the room and sat down in a chair for a moment she stood where i had pushed her then she came and sat down on the bed opposite me she smiled at me timidly swinging her bare legs to and fro holding her knees together while she swung her legs out from each other youre youre not mad at me brownie i wish you hadnt come back ellen i said its going to make things very hard for both of us no it wont honey i did you know i only called the office one time today just once they said you were gone for the day so i said thank you ill call again tomorrow and and thats all i did honest she nodded her head vigorously her eyes fixed anxiously on my face i said so you called one time why did you call at all hhavent you any idea brownie sure you had a dime the smile faded and a sullen look edged into its place then the look faded without disappearing and the smile a semblance of it returned maybe i guess maybe youve got a right to talk that way but but think of me honey i hhadnt done anything and hadnt done anything i jeered you didnt need to do anything i didnt know my way around when i married you id never been anywhere or seen anything after i did i wised up i saw i was married to a goddamned flabbytailed dumbbell with a fried egg for a brain you dirty bas oh brownie dont dont honey you dont mean the hell i dont ive seen better tail on a mule she stuttered and spluttered trying to curse and beg me at the same time trying to fight down her temper id touched her on her sore spots she didnt have much in the way of an education her rear end was a little on the wriggly side yyou burn me up you not me i said that hot little business of yours remember that poem i dedicated to you youre goddamned right i remember of all the dirty by the way what did you do with the rest of those sonnets i was thinking perhaps youd like to have them autographed she told me what shed done with them something indelicate but completely practical they didnt catch fire you burn me thats right sit there and laugh you done you did all this why shouldnt you laugh about it jesus i said what a freak you turned out to be do the boys make you put a sack over your head it was going swell she was getting angrier and angrier i had her sold and if i could just keep her that way shed live i she began to cry shed very seldom done that really cried shed grown up in pretty rugged circumstances and shed never got the crying habit but on those rare occasions when she did break down she pulled all the stops she cried like the child shed never been she didnt cover her face with her hands and all of it was puckered and reddened her eyes were tight shut her nose ran her mouth with the ludicrously drawndown corners opened so wide you could see her tonsils i tried to laugh and i couldnt i jerked the cork on the second quart and took a big slug and it didnt do any good it had always got me to see her cry it did now you do not have your head in the clouds brown i thought your feet are of clay and the arches are falling i took another drink i gripped the arms of the chair i said look now now see here dammit theres no sense in in and she shuddered and sobbed yyou you hhurt my ffeelings and suddenly i was on the bed with her dabbing at her eyes with my handkerchief telling her to blow her nose dammit and she shuddered and choked back the tears aw rright brownie i i wwill she clung to me shivering with my wetness but clinging tighter when i tried to draw away she curled up on the bed drawing me down with her burrowing and snuggling her head against my shoulder after a while she said hhoney yes i said another silence then i know what what happened i dont know why i didnt guess in the beginning because you couldnt be mean to anyone and all right i said you know why didnt you tell me honey it wouldnt have made any difference theres more to marriage than than that a great deal more i said theres more to a house than a roof but youd find it impractical to live without one youd move from one room to another and theyd all be fine and not worth a damn finally youd have to move out you dont know you cant be sure it you think this is better it doesnt need to be like this i hoped youd remarry i cant hhow can i when i still love you my hands trembled on her bare back i had to keep on but i knew it was no use she was a child weeping for a broken doll stubbornly refusing any other look i said listen to me ellen a lot of people have thought i was a pretty smart guy you always thought so have you changed your mind no brownie but wasnt i always good to you didnt i always do what was best for you now answer me isnt that so yes why do you think i did it this way do you think it was easy for me ridiculing you breaking every bond between us so that you could form new ones with someone else do you think its something that popped into my mind on the spur of the moment of course not honey but i thought it over for weeks i studied the record of what had happened in similar cases i talked it over with two damned good psychiatrists i told them what you we were like and her head jerked back like what am i supposed to be like dont i said lets not get started on another row i told them the truth that you were anything but a nympho but also very far from frigid i told them that youd always well skip it there wasnt any real best thing to do but i did the best there was and look how it turned out it would have turned out this way anyhow if you cant face facts my telling you the truth wouldnt have made any difference dont you we could have tried couldnt we how do you know how it would have turned out when we didnt even try you dont know everything you oh she hesitated and i heard her swallow heavily its its ttoo late brownie you dont want to come back to me now after what ive ive i kissed her on the forehead wondering abstractedly why the weakest of us seem always subjected to the greatest stress good and evil were there such things or were there only weakness and strength was a car bad because it became junk was a woman bad who became a whore brownie is ththat the reason why i kissed her again you havent done anything i said not a single thing lets try it brownie why honestly i wont mind a bit really i wont well have all those nice funny talks together and you can read to me in the evenings and and maybe we can get skipper back from those people or we can get another dog why we could even adopt a baby honey and it would be just like dont i said for christs sake dont but she wouldnt stop she went on and on over and over that one refrain earnest tearful laughable maddening it wouldnt honey it wouldnt make a bit of difference my heart began to beat time to it the blood roared and raced through my brain beating time brownie she said brownie i drifted back from a faraway place a place where all the straight paths were blocked off and everything moved at a tangent her voice had become firm you understand brownie were stopping this foolishness right now we need each other and were going to have each other ive tried your way now youre going to try mine im going to im going to make you brownie spread it all out i said lay the cards down i cards card then lem stukey either i do as you say or you get tough you get me or you have a little talk with lem she drew her head back looked into my face frowning i ddont understand what would i hes been in touch with you hasnt he he sent you the dough to come back here on weeli he he she blushed well he was just being nice just because he liked me i laughed well he was he does she snapped whats so funny about it nothing i said but thats the deal isnt it el you have to tell me you know you cant make threats without showing what youre threatening but i havent she paused she was silent for several seconds what if i how could i threaten you with that she said in a halfshamed voice it isnt any crime you couldnt help you know what i mean i said you know what im like you know what newspaper business is like its a closed world theres no place you can go where youre not known put it in plain language put yourself in my place how long could you live in a world where everyone knew you didnt have a pecker brownie thats dir you mean its funny i said sure it is you could even catch the doctors and nurses in the hospital grinning about it you know i couldnt take it el you may not know that i might not get the chance to take it because there are a hell of a lot of places that wouldnt hire me thats right thats straight from the case histories theyre afraid of you they figure youre not normal but listen to me brownie i thats what youre threatening me with i said youd do that to me or youd let lem do it put me under his thumb for keeps youd take away the only thing i have left the little pride and integrity that gives me an excuse to go on living you love me you cant love anyone else you say and youd do that to me no she gripped me fiercely no i wont brownie i wont have to because no i wont do it honey i didnt know what i was thinking about ive just been kind of crazy and lonely and hopelessfeeling and her voice trailed off after a moment she said reproachfully a trifle angrily after all i could get a divorce on those grounds that would be a lot worse wouldnt it you see she didnt know what she was going to do how then could i yes i said that would be worse you wouldnt get the nice chunk of change you can get out of lem i youve got a lot of right to talk about him she said after the way youve acted youre the one thats always running people down even if i did tell him what makes you think hed for gods sake i said what are you saying ellen first you dont have anything to threaten me with next you have something but youre not going to use it then youre going to use it youre going to pass it on to lem but he isnt going to you dont make sense from one minute to oh sure she said sullenly youre a genius and im a dumbbell well maybe im not as dumb as you think let it go its no use i said whatever i got out of stukey it wouldnt be enough after all ive been through no i said it wouldnt be enough i sat up and uncorked the bottle i took a drink replaced the cork and fumbled for a cigarette i didnt have any with me of course any dry ones they were back in the car i reached out to the reading stand took a cigarette from her package and lighted it brownie she sat up too half sat up with her legs folded under her yes i said you know i wouldnt do that dont you she smiled at me brightly its like you say how could i when i love you so much and but oh brownie lets go back together please darling it wont make any difference and even if it does a little itll still be better than this i just cant go on like no i said you cant and you wont and i brought the bottle down on her head i stood looking down at her and my head swam and i weaved slowly on my feet the wetness and the exertion and the long talk were sobering me and when i sobered i became drunk far drunker than any amount of whisky could make me all my sureness was gone and the ten thousand parts of an insane puzzle were scattered to the winds she lay twitching a bit and moaning with her head and shoulders slumping toward her knees her thighs in a tangent curve to her legs a question mark she was a question and she had to be answered had it been necessary or had i done it because i wanted to was every move i made as dave randall had once angrily declared designed to extract payment from the world for the hell i dwelt in had i tried to destroy slowly and failing that killed wantonly it was a nice question it was something to think about on these long rainy evenings i took another stiff drink the terrible sobrietydrunkenness with its terrible questions began to fade i slid back into the sideways world this was the way it was and the way it was was this yet it was hard to leave her like this something seemed to need doing some small thing something shed always wanted perhaps without conscious awareness of the want i could think of only one thing i pulled the sheet over her now semiconscious body i upended the bottle of whisky and sprinkled it over the sheet i jerked several matches from a pad and struck them you said to i said remember ellen you always said to burn you up and i let the matches fall it was still pitch dark outside still raining a downpour but the wind was dying and the worst of the storm seemed to be over i pushed the boat into the bay and hopped in i started to row and then slowly i let the oars slide out of my hands and drift away into the darkness let the boat decide i thought leave it to the ocean they brought me here now they can return me or not return me i wash my hands of all responsibility i leaned back across the thwarts letting my fingers trail in the water i closed my eyes feeling the boat rock and roll feeling it turn round and round gently as it moved out into the bay it was very peaceful for a time very restful i had had nothing to do with anything and now i had nothing to do with this i was a man following orders cleareyed clearthinking and if those orders had led me led me she had looked very beautiful she had glowed oh but definitely she had glowed she had been all lit up burning with a clearblue flame and then the mattress had started to smolder and i screamed but there was no sound i was throwing up the boat had begun to spin it was caught in the trough between two tall shorebound rollers pulled by one and pushed by the other and it spun faster and faster suddenly it reared up on end and shot to the crest of the first wave it hung poised there for a moment then it dropped down spinning to the other side tons of water plunged into it it went down vanished as completely as though it had never existed and i went on there was a thunderous roar an incessant crashing and then i was gripping something hard and slimy one of the piles of the pier thats the way it was to be then the decision had been made i pulled myself from pile to pile until i found the ladder i climbed up to the pier and returned to my car i drove away my house to use the noun loosely is some six miles north of pacific city years ago it was occupied by a railroad section gang in the days when section hands were largely itinerant mexicans when i discovered it it was a lopsided ruin headquarters seemingly for the countys population of creeping and crawling things the railroad gladly rented it to me for five dollars a month a hundred dollars and a few hundred hours work had made it reasonably habitable it is a little noisy perhaps since it sits on railroad rightofway and it is more than a little sooty but as rental properties go in pacific city properties within the financial reach of the modestsalaried man it is still very much a bargain we do not believe in government handouts here you see we scorn socialistic housing programs we hold to the american way of life the good old laws of supply and demand that is the landlords supply what they care to in the way of housing and demand what they feel like and the tenant bless him oh hail his rugged independence is perfectly free to pay it and like it or sleep in the streets where of course he will be promptly arrested by lem stukey for vagrancy i will say this for stukey he is absolutely fearless and relentless where vagrants are concerned let lem and his minions apprehend some penniless wanderer preferably colored and over sixtyfive and the machinery of the law goes into swift and remorseless action sixty days on the road gang six months on the county farm so it goes nor is that always as far as it goes in an amazing number of instances the vagrant appears to be the very person responsible for a long series of hitherto unsolved crimes good old lem and his rubber hose unless i missed my guess id be seeing him shortly i parked my car at the side of the house and went inside i filled a water glass with whisky and put it down at a gulp fire blazed through me my heart did frantic settingup exercises for a moment then steadied off into a slow steady pounding all at once i felt almost happy for the first time in a long time life seemed really interesting there was a rift and a widening one in the deadgray monotony of existence i went into the bedroom and shucked out of my clothes the phone rang and i trotted back into the livingroom to answer it pulling a robe around me brownie clint it was dave randall why colonel i said how nice of you to call how are all the wee ones and brownie for gods sake have you seen lem stukey frequently i said as a devoted courier man i am brought into contact with many strange please brownie he hasnt been in touch with you in the last hour or so no i put a frown into my voice whats up dave its about where have you been all evening clint lems been tearing up the town to find you he called me he even called mr lovelace but why what about i smiled to myself it was wonderful to be interested again i i think id better come out there brownie i think perhaps id better bring mr lovelace with me oh i said and i made the voicefrown a little stronger whats the trouble dave i cant i think id better tell you in person brownie yes where have you been tonight drinking riding and drinking walking and drinking sitting by the roadside and drinking were you with anyone is there any way you could establish your whereabouts no i said to both questions look dave i didnt run over anyone did i i was pretty woozy but ill see you he said ill be right out we hung up i sat down on the lounge and went to work on the bottle i was feeling better and better there was nothing in my stomach but this clean fresh whisky and there was nothing in my mind but a problem no ellen no oblong of brightblue flame only an interesting problem about ten minutes had passed when a car roared up the lane from the highway and skidded to a stop in the yard it was lem stukey and he was by himself naturally on anything as good as this he would be by himself i looked up as he walked in i blinked my eyes frowned and took another drink from the bottle he stood in the doorway his hands on his hips his hat thrust back on his oily head and there was an expression of sad reproach on his sleek round face he waited for me to speak i let him go right on waiting finally he crossed the room and pulled up a chair in front of me keed he said sorrowfully you shouldntve done it you should have knowed you couldnt get away with it well i shrugged nothing ventured nothing gained she wasnt worth it brownie no i said i dont suppose she was but then who is i dont see no way out for you keed not unless i was to kind of take a hand personally if i was to do that now call it an accident why dont you i said after all a pals a pal i always say you mean that brownie youll play ball with me like i been askin you to well i hesitated isnt it pretty muddy outside muddy i dont dig you keed to play ball look he snarled and his hand closed over my arm what the hell are you talking about i dont know i said what are you talking about he jumped up and stood over me i started to rise and he shoved me back hard im talking about murder you smart bastard you were over to the island tonight you killed her you coldcocked her and set fire to her left her to burn up in the bed only she didnt burn up see she didnt die right away i figure her hair probably cushioned the blow and she came to when she felt herself burnin anyway she got up and got to the dresser she got something out of her purse she had it balled up in her hand when the island cops found her i looked at him blinking a little owlishly sifting through the situation one fact at a time it wasnt particularly startling although i suspect that i was guilty of at least a small start id been pretty wobbly on my pins when i swung the bottle and she did have a thick head of hair and the whisky would have tended to burn away before the bedclothes themselves caught fire now as to this something shed taken from her purse to borrow an expression i said i dont dig you keed just who am i supposed to have killed dont pull that innocent crap on me who the hell else would have killed your wife she wasnt robbed its a cinch it wasnt a rape murder anyone that wanted any of that could have had it for i came up then and i came up swinging i hit him an openpalmed slap across the jaw hit him so hard his hat sailed from his head his hand darted to his hip but he didnt draw the gun i sat back down again and buried my face in my hands after a while i said are you sure it was murder it couldnt have been an accident who you kidding he said you goin to tell me that she fell on top of her head that she wiped the place clean of fingerprints herself wi i caught myself choked the word into a meaningless grunt this object she had in her hand what was it a poem kind of a poem she put the finger right on you keed shed had it a long time it was practically worn out with all the folding and refolding it had gone through you wrote it for her and shed been carrying it around all this time ever since you split up yessir she knew that when we saw it wed it had my name on it it didnt need no name on it she never really went for no one but you anyway she sure wasnt going for anyone three four years ago when this mustve been written when you an her were still tied up maybe she wrote it herself huhuh she wasnt up to anything that sharp and what the hell a dames dying and she goes for a poem shes written you know better than that keed you wrote it it sounds like you to a t and she knew id see that what was it i said have you got it with you it figures brownie it all adds up to just one guy no one else had any motive no one else would have written a thing like this it had to be someone that lives here someone id know and palsy that aint no one but id like to hear it i said do you mind i dont mind a bit keed he took a notebook from his pocket and opened it catch a load i dont know that i can pronounce all the words just right but go ahead ill try to interpret sure he said and he read lady of the endless lust itching lips and heaving bust lady save it lady scram lady hang it on a nail get thee hence nor leave behind you any vestige of your tail he finished reading and looked at me sharply i looked back at him indifferently id written it of course it and some fifty or sixty similar bits of doggerel but that had been long ago and theyd been done on various odds and ends of paper and on a variety of typewriters on the red cross machines in hospitals in newspaper offices in dollaranhour typeyourownletter places they couldnt be traced to me id written them out of bitterness and brooding at a time when i was still bitter and brooding out of hate and resentment and restlessness and finally i had presented them to ellen i had dedicated them to her id shown them to no one but her no one but she knew that i had written them i wondered what masochistic urge had led her to save this one after destroying the others well keed stukey grinned at me what you say i gather that thats a copy i said wheres the original the cops over on the island have it they read it off to me over the telephone you havent seen it yourself then you dont actually know that its as they described it old and creased and what the hell you gettin at ive already arrived but you my dear stukey are very far behind you didnt see the poem you didnt see her you dont know theyre kidding me huh he let out a snort they made it all up just to cause some excitement youre chief of detectives you seem to regard this as a pretty important case so important that you had to bother my publisher and editor about it yet youve got your evidence by telephone why why didnt you go over there well uh he licked his lips you know keed the bays been kinda choppy aint no real reason why i couldnt have gone if id figured it was necessary but uh a little choppy eh the ferries and charter boats arent running and its just a little choppy cut it out stuke you didnt go because you couldnt no one could have thats what you say i so did you earlier this evening remember our conversation at your office no one could have crossed that bay tonight no one certainly he couldnt have crossed it twice if you dont know that you ought to be back walking a beat which now that i think of it might be an excellent idea his face reddened his round overbright little eyes shifted nervously now look brownie its just as plain as day or the nose on your face i nodded but you cant see it you were so red hot to get something on me that you overlooked the plain facts of the matter you say that she got up and got that poem out of her purse how do you know she did how do you know it wasnt simply made to look that way by the person who killed her well his tongue moved over his lips again but why would the poem belonged to him the murderer not her obviously he was a man with a perverted sense of humor a maniac in the broad sense of the term he visited her doubtless as a client he murdered her then he arranged for her to be found in such a way as to throw you off his trail yet satisfy his ego and stupid man that you are he was entirely successful i smiled at him pleasantly and took another drink i lighted a cigarette coughing slightly on the smoke as i choked back a laugh this was far better than i had thought it would be there were truly wonderful possibilities in it thats what happened lem i said it had to be a maniac you cant make sense out of it in any other way you call that sense he growled for a maniac a sadistic killer yes by the way i assume the ferries have resumed service well then youve let him get completely away from you hes not even on the island any more there was something very close to fear in the toobright eyes fear and wonder and awe youre he cleared his throat hoarsely youre takin it pretty calm keed your wife gets killed in just about the most godawful way a woman could and you sit there grinning and she wasnt my wife i said she hadnt been my wife in a long long time as for my reaction to the the well i dont wear my emotions on my sleeve stuke my actions dont necessarily reflect my feelings yeah he grunted ill buy that ill go right on down the line on that one i sit listenin to you sometimes chewin the fat with you and i get to wonderin what the hell i held up a hand interrupting him ill tell you what youd better do stuke what youd better start wondering about youve botched this thing from beginning to end my wife has been brutally murdered by a maniac and youve let him get away youd better start wondering about how youre going to keep your job i had huh he laughed nervously now look brownie like i said a moment ago she just wasnt worth any bad trouble i disagree with you what did you say when you talked to dave randall and mr lovelace tonight something rather suggestive eh laden with nasty implications me me knock a pal he made a gesture of hurt denial you know i wouldnt do a thing like that all i done was mention that your wife had been killed an that i well i was trying to get ahold of you to break the bad news thats all i said brownie so help me i shrugged i didnt particularly care what hed said i still wasnt letting him off the hook mr lem stukey was going to go to work at long last he was going to give the city a longdelayed cleaning up not strictly because of the entertainment it would provide me not entirely through him i could make atonement i could offset with good the evil of ellens death im telling you brownie he said i didnt knock you there aint nothin for either of us to get in an uproar about now i been thinkin and the way i see it were both off base it was an accident it couldnt have been you said so yourself i cant change my mind an accidents got to be logical she was drinking she spilled booze all over herself she catches herself on fire lighting a cigarette she falls down and knocks herself out she before or after igniting herself and what about the poem look brownie he leaned forward pleading we get cases like this all the time just about like this someone gets stiff in his hotel room he bangs himself up an flops down on the bed smoking and he wakes up burning an the rooms so full of smoke he cant see an well you know how it is he tried to get out of the place but he wants to take his money with him so i see i nodded slowly you think thats what she intended to do huh she tried to get her money but got the poem instead mmm i suppose it might have been that way but that still doesnt explain the poem whats there to explain lots of people carry poems around we got a fellow down at the office you know him stengel works over in identification and he does it he clips em out of newspapers or maybe he hears em over the radio and copies em down never seen him yet when he didnt have some verse in his wallet ready to spring it on you but this particular little item look brownie pal his eyes flickered with annoyance youre fighting me it was pretty cute wasnt it something a dame like something she might have got a big bang out of maybe she copied it off a privy wall maybe some place where she was working slingin hash say and one of the waitresses passed it around and she got hold of a copy the point is it dont mean nothing so we dont even have to consider it i aint even going to mention it in my report well i stared at him absently well he said it was an accident huh we let it go at that i dont give you no trouble you dont give me none i hesitated i was trying to remember something everything was reasonably clear up to a certain point i could remember swinging the bottle spilling the whisky over her dropping the matches but after that after that from that time until i reached the boat nothing only the long blue oblong of flame and then nothing if stukey hadnt been so sure of himself if he hadnt gone off halfcocked he might have tripped me up in a dozen places you were very sure i said that shed been slugged there wasnt any doubt in your mind what made you so certain stuke just the fact that she couldnt have easily struck the top of her head against something that was a big part of it sure but there was this quart whisky bottle layin in the bed an i see you thought shed been hit with that what brand of whisky was it couldnt say it was all charred see the label burned off and and the fingerprints did you dust the place uhhuh the boys went over it from top to bottom and the only prints they found was hers an a few of the maids i figure she mustve cleaned the place up good before she started her party nice clean little lady huh he drooped a lid over one eye looks like she even wiped off the doorknob i suppose the boys also looked for tracks around the outside tracks why keed there could have been a herd of elephants around that place and their tracks wouldnt have lasted five minutes in that rain now that poem forget it put it out of your mind pal typewritten god knows when or where the paper it might have come from anyplace a dime store or a drugstore or you were completely wrong then in your initial suspicions there is absolutely nothing to connect me with this murder absitively and possolutely brownie i was all wet up to here but dont use that word huh dont say murder it was an accident and a car was pulling into the yard he pausedshooting me a look of inquiry that would be my publisher i said and my editor they have come to condole with me also i suspect at least on the part of mr randall to lend me moral support yeah well thats nice he stood up brushing at his pants i guess ill just trot along then an you i said will stay right here but pal oh well sure you want me to square you up with em huh i dont remember saying anything out of the way but you will square yourself up i said you will explain just what you intend to do about apprehending my wifes murderer mr lovelace was patently not in the most pleasant of humors a man of regular habits was mr lovelace a man who like so many of the lower loweranimals liked his full ten hours sleep each night now that sleep had been disturbed he austin lovelace had been disturbed twice in one night and without as he saw it any very adequate cause it was the old old story because he was strong and wise a tower of strength among pygmies he was constantly overburdened everyone loaded his trifling troubles upon him he was sleepy puzzled fretful very very fretful for me the loyal hardworking and appreciative servant he managed a mumbled word of sympathy and a semifatherly handclasp but it was obviously an effort very sad tragic insist you take the remainder of the week off understand take as much time as you need uh within reason thank you sir i said i believe two or three days will be sufficient i own a burial plot in los angeles and i thought by all means certainly much better than a local burial incidentally mr brown his lips pursed pettishly i was rather shocked to learn that nh that a man of your caliber was married to to i understand sir i said but i was very young at the time it was long before i came to the courier i hadnt yet had the chance to profit from my association with you well ahem i uh certainly wouldnt want to chide you in your hour of bereavement am i correct in understanding that you had not lived together as man and wife for some time not for several years sir not since i entered the army ummm i see the stare he gave me was considerably less peevish a marriage in name only eh a youthful mistake from which you were unable to extricate yourself yes sir i said you might call it that it was bad shameful to speak of her in this way but you see there no longer was a her now there was merely a problem and out of the bad much good could come he gave me a forgiving clap on the back then after a look of puzzled distaste at lem stukey he turned annoyed to dave randall well randall i believe theres nothing more to be said or done eh nno sir dave started nervously i i guess it wasnt necessary for you to i guess i shouldnt have bothered you to come out here sir my own thought why did you randall i seem to recall that you mentioned that you would later explain the need for my presence well i i yes speak up man lovelace fed on nervousness even as he did on flattery let him catch you jumpy uneasy and he would be after you like a hungry hound and dave couldnt explain of course he couldnt say what hed thought that he was sure i was in a bad hole and was apt to need plenty of help to climb out hed been positively pale with fear when he arrived and hed been almost pitifully relieved when it dawned on him that i was very far from the shadows of the gas chamber that was all he could think of that i wasnt guilty that what he had done to me through a serious error in judgment when he was my commanding officer had not resulted in murder now he had to think of something else the old man was demanding an explanation and dave could only stand and squirm stammer helplessly mr randall are you keeping something from me nno sir i i guess i was just a little excited sir yes i would not have said that you were an excitable type mr randall are you uh are the duties of your position too much for you would you like to step down for a time i decided to intervene not you understand that i greatly minded daves squirming the good colonel he who had been so cocksure so peremptory with his orders would do much more squirming before i was finished with him i intervened because it suited me it was time to start taking the good from the bad i believe i can explain sir i said well want the story for our first edition i imagine dave thought wed better discuss the handling of it oh well why didnt he say so then no reason to story he gulped his eyes widening in a horrified doubletake did you say story mr brown surely you dont plan on well have to sir this is one we wont be able to bury its another black dahlia case the los angeles papers will give it a whopping play itll be a frontpage story in every paper between here and la we couldnt pass it up even if we wanted to if we wanted to if mr brown you know the policy of the courier a family paper for family people if i repeated and lem stukey cleared his throat them other papers he said they wont play up the story if there aint one we keep quiet about it here call it an accident and what are they gonna but it wasnt an accident i said it was murder and knowing mr lovelace as i do i feel certain that he will not blink at it he will not hush it up and thus leave unchanged the conditions that gave rise to the crime lovelaces jaw sagged slowly he sank down on the lounge im sorry sir i said im sure you must see that i am right bbut the courier pacific city i just uh what did you mean brown about the conditions which gave rise to it i didnt answer immediately i poured a drink and pressed the glass into his hand and he took it like a child taking candy he swigged it shuddered and swigged again i sat down and began talking stukey scowled down at the floor dave listened watching me curiously but nodding occasionally at what i said a very unhealthy situation here for some time mr lovelace the sort of situation that breeds murder riffraff drifting in from everywhere because of the climate thieves pickpockets prostitutes confidence workers keep that them in mind and then bear in mind that we have a large floating tourist population people with money and but but i dont understand lovelace frowned querulously at lem why have you allowed this sir werent you aware of these undesirables in our midst what kind of chief of detectives do you call yourself as a matter of fact i said carefully mr stukey has kept them under quite good control but hes only one man not the entire department and i think weve made his job seem a pretty thankless one theres been little or no recognition for work well done theres been no incentive to give the city the wholesale housecleaning it needs incentive recognition he continued to frown at stukey he draws a very handsome salary as i recall why should he dont we all sir dont we all need more than mere money for that matter weve had something worse here than a lack of incentive theres not only been no encouragement to do something about local crime theres been every encouragement to do nothing i think you know what i mean sir youre sensitive about the good name of pacific city the police department knows it as do we all naturally the tendency has been to keep the lid on crime rather than to expose it and cast it out he didnt like that mr lovelace need it be said liked no criticism either implied or direct so after letting him hang for a moment i lifted him off the hook of course im not excusing mr stukey in the final analysis the fault is largely if not completely his he chose the easy way out the course of least resistance after all sir it hasnt been exactly pleasant for me to lay these facts before you but i felt that it was my duty to do it i did not see how i could delay longer in view of tonights happenings and i knew that you sir regardless of your personal feelings have nothing but respect and admiration for the man who does his duty he puffed up a little some of the sag went out of his shoulders quite right mr brown and uh thank you for the compliment i hope naturally that the situation is not as bad as you believe what do you recommend solving this murder i said should be the first item on our agenda at least we should leave no stone un turned in trying to solve it we want to serve notice to the world at large that murder is not taken lightly in pacific city he sighed hesitated nodded firmly yes yes by all means you sir stukey is it what are you doing about this murder what murder lem grunted sullenly he says its murder i dont hows that mr brown mr stukey is a conservative i said hes jumped to the wrong conclusions a time or two and its made him ultra cautious i wish it were an accident sir but im sure youll agree with me that it couldnt have been i explained the circumstances under which the body had been found bearing down heavily on the wipedaway fingerprints he nodded grimly scowling at stukey certainly it was murder some mentally deranged person you dont agree sir you intend to persist in your quaint theory that i aint overlooking any bets said lem hastily i got the island boys workin on the murder angle i thought maybe maybe i might have a line on the killer myself but but ill keep em on it mr lovelace well turn that place upside down well i should think so snapped lovelace an accident whatever led you to think for a moment that i was just tryin to keep an open mind mr lovelace stukey was almost whining like i said i aint passing up any bets lovelace harrumphed angrily and glanced at me i said i had complete confidence in mr stukeys ability to handle the case im not sure that he needs or wants any suggestions from me but certainly he does why shouldnt he well i went on it seems to me that the two things tie in together that is the solving of the murder and the citywide cleanup i believe that every known or suspected criminal every person who has no legitimate reason for his presence here should be brought in and questioned probably the murderer will be among them if not well we will have done our best at any rate as rapidly as the suspects are eliminated they should be ordered out of the city and kept out excellent said lovelace firmly is that all clear to you chief stukey hesitated but only for a fraction of a second mr lovelace might be a fathead but you didnt say no to him in pacific city when he asked for a yes i got it he said me and clint understand each other real well mr lovelace stood up he shook my hand again then sauntered toward the door with his arm around my shoulder i uh he paused i it has occurred to me that we have been rather inconsiderate here tonight you have lost your she was your wife after all and under such tragic circumstances yet we have allowed you to we have called upon you to i am a courier man i said simply i have tried to act as i know you would have acted i uh ahem i am afraid you do me too much credit in your case i are you feeling entirely well i was thinking that uh well shock you know i would be happy to refer you to my own physician if thank you sir i said but i believe the worst is now over now it is largely a matter of prayer of consulting the spirit of rising above personal tragedy into a newer and finer life well uh onward and upward i said that is the answer sir my head in the clouds my feet firmly on the ground i helped him into the car and closed the door dave took me by the arm drew me away a few feet im sorry as hell brownie i know how much how you felt about her a woman that wasnt my wife i said a youthful mistake a floozy a brownie yes colonel is there anything at all would you like to have me come back and stay tonight why dont you i said we can talk over old times our joyous carefree days in the army when he let go my arm he almost threw it away from him then he got a grip on himself and made one more try you did a swell job on stukey fellow what youre doing ellen would have been proud of you i wonder i said ill have to ask her the next time i see her well get the guy who did it brownie by god well pour the coal on stuke until yes i said well get him someone will get him well think youll make it all right you wouldnt like to have me send out a doctor send out a surgeon i said i am heavily burdened and wouldst shed my balls he whirled and walked away i went back into the house lem stukey had moved over to the lounge and was taking a drink from the bottle well keed he didnt seem particularly discomfited now if anything he appeared pleased and i was confident i knew why it looks like we got to find ourselves a murderer dont it not necessarily i said we or rather you have to look for one you have to round up our local riffraff and eliminate them as suspects also eliminating them from pacific city for nothin huh i drive all the easy dough out of town and i dont get nothin out of it that aint reasonable brownie im willing to play along with you hell dont i always go along with a pal but you got to i dont got to i said ive played along with you too long lem now im through but why youre sore about tonight jesus pal you cant blame me for i dont blame you im not sore i said not in the way you mean something very bad has happened that bad has to be offset thats as close as i can come to explaining what i mean and where do i come in what do i get out of it nothing more than you deserve to put it succinctly you do not get a murderer who is not one you do not get some haifwitted oddjob man and sap him into making a confession it wouldnt work stuke even if i were willing to let you do it we know the murderer is someone of fairly high intelligence youd be laughed out of town if you tried to pin the job on one of your typical fall guys yeah his eyes glinted so suppose i hang it on some smart baby someone like you you do that i said and well discuss the matter again he stood up slamming on his hat he walked toward me slowly and i crossed my legs bringing one foot up in line with his crotch i hoped he would try something but i was sure that he wouldnt he didnt look brownie dont you see what youre doin to me pal it aint just a matter of gettin no credit of knockin myself out and losin out on all the easy dough and not getting no credit for solving the murder thats bad enough but it aint just that no i said it isnt just that you see it huh if i dont get the murderer if you dont get the murderer or let us say until you do get the murderer you have to keep on looking for him you wont be able to let things get back in the shape theyve been in yes i see that lem and now that you see it i think youd better leave he left cursing i waited until i heard him drive away and then i got up and stood in the doorway a few minutes it had stopped raining about an hour before and now the moon had come out and a few stars and the air was clean and balmy i stood drinking it in in long deep breaths i turned and craned my neck looking in at the kitchen clock it was only one a few minutes after one it seemed like years had passed since and it was only a little after one i closed and locked the door i went into the bedroom and turned on the light i came back and turned off the livingroom light i started back into the bedroom i went a few steps and then i dropped down on the lounge and began to cry about nothing really i suppose you would call it nothing certainly not over a problem how can one cry over a problem or an answer if there was an answer i cried because just because as kids cry as she had used to cry because things were a certain way and thats the way they were after a while i got up and went into the kitchen i cracked four eggs into a glass filled the glass with whisky and tossed them down i stood very still for a moment swallowing fast letting them get anchored when i was sure they were going to stick i took another drink and lighted a cigarette another long time had passed at least ten years but the clock said twenty minutes of two i refilled my glass with whisky and began cleaning the kitchen there was not a great deal to be done since the soot is more or less ineradicable and my meals at home are confined largely to eggs milk and coffee but i did what little there was to do scrubbing the sink wiping off the drainboard and stove sweeping the floor and so on i put the egg shells into the garbage pail and carried it out to the incinerator i lingered a minute or two after dumping it looking down at the railroad tracks i often stand there at night on the bluff overlooking the tracks watching the trains go by wondering if it wouldnt be better to but the last train for the night had passed more than two hours ago the last one was the milk train a combination freight and passenger that left pacific city at eleventhirty and loafed into los angeles some seven hours later there wouldnt be another train until six fortyfive i went back into the house and returned the garbage pail to its container i filled my glass again and went to work on the livingroom i cleaned it up twofifteen i cleaned up the bedroom two thirtyfive i made a stab at cleaning the bathroom two fortythree i had put a big pan of water on the kitchen stove and lighted a couple of burners under it when it had heated i carried it into the bathroom climbed upon the ancient castiron stool and reaching upward and outward dumped it into a fivegallon can that rested on a shelf near the ceiling i undressed and stepped under the can i pulled a rope and the water rained down from a nozzle in the bottom of the can i put some clothes back on and mopped up the bathroom i finished at seven minutes after three and i had never been more wide awake in my life obviously it was time for stern measures i took them two full glasses one behind the other i went to sleep then or i should say i lost consciousness i didnt come out of it until a little after seven when the phone started ringing i sat up and looked at it i mumbled what the hell and cut it out for gods sake and it went right on ringing i rubbed my eyes and reached for the whisky the bottle was empty so i went out into the kitchen and opened another one i came back into the livingroom and sat down on the floor in front of the phone i slugged down a few drinks lighted a cigarette and eased the receiver off the hook i shouted hello at the top of my lungs i heard a clatter at the other end of the line then someone breathing heavily the someone was dave randall brownie hello hello brownie dont yell so loud i said it hurts my ears colonel i hated like hell to bother you clint but can you come down for a while come down you mean to work dont do it if you dont feel up to it but im shorthanded as hell ive got three people working out of the police station our friend stukey is really bearing down on this cleanup campaign and what with tom judge off sick i hes sick i said i hope its something serious it will be dave promised when i get hold of him his wife called in to the switchboard this morning before i got down ive been trying to call him back but i havent been able to raise anyone at their place how about it brownie if you could just lend a hand for a couple of hours just until some of the people in society and sports show up i let him wait while i took a drink then i said well ill tell you colonel i am a trueblue courier man i flinch from neither rain nor sleet nor chamber of commerce luncheons but never mind sorry to have bothered you he said take it easy and oh yes brownie are you still there yours to command colonel up to a point i thought youd want to know theyve got a redhot clue to the murderer so soon i said i think id better have a little talk with mr stukey he isnt pulling anything this time clint its the real thing you know how those golden eagle cottages sit up on posts dont have any real foundation under them y no ive never been around the island much well some guy was crawling around under them last night the cops figure that he may have been hurt when he when he was struggling with her and crawled under there to pull himself together or perhaps he was just too scared or drunk to know what he was doing anyway it looks like he must have been there not too long after the murder why does it look like that why well because of the imprint of his body his hands and knees they picked up several almost perfect handprints how do they know they were made last night because there wouldnt be any imprints otherwise last night was the first time its rained in weeks theres a little seepage under the cottages and look brownie i cant talk any longer now ill call you back the first chance i get dont bother i said on second thought i think ill come down i hung up the phone i sat there crosslegged on the floor staring blankly into the black perforations of the mouthpiece as i reached for the bottle i tried to remember and as i had last night i drew a blank i was bending over her then i was at the boat and in between there was nothing my clothes no all that water would have washed them clean in seconds i couldnt remember and there was no way i could find out the finding out would have to be done by someone else thinking or rather trying to think i put coffee on the stove and went into the bathroom to shave i didnt believe i had crawled around under there surely or so it seemed to me i would not have wiped away my fingerprints only to leave a much broader clue then there was the matter of time i had no recollection of events between my setting the fire and my arrival at the boat but i did have a very strong impression that they were but briefly separated i hadnt done it i was sure almost that i hadnt it had been someone else but why would anyone else probably some drunk had wandered out of a bar or been tossed out and he had holed up under the cottages for a snooze hed awakened when the cops arrived hed heard the ruckus and decided it would be a damned good idea to take a powder and that was what had happened i hoped i got cleaned up and went into the kitchen i poured whisky into an outsize cup and filled it with coffee i leaned against the sink sipping it taking an occasional long look at my hands what i dont know about criminology would fill a fivehundredfoot bookshelf but id learned at least one thing in my policebeat years leaving or picking up a recognizable set of fingerprints is not as simple or easy as it is reputed to be i talked to a detective one time who on one of his off days dusted and picked up prints throughout his fiveroom house he didnt get one of himself or his wife or their two kids that would have served to identify them this under socalled favorable conditions in mud now in anything as coarse as earth well there might be handprints but fingerprints huhuh i didnt think so i hoped not if stukey had picked up a decent set of prints even one good fingerprint id have heard about it by now hed have been printing me unless of course he was afraid of what i would do if he was wrong and he intended to do it casually that would be stukeys way no doubt to build the thing up big and himself with it then say to invite me to have a drink from a nice clean glass it was strange the way i felt i hadnt given a damn for years not a good goddamn whether i lived or not and last night i had sort of tried to get the whole meaningless mess over with i had taken a handsoff attitude in a gonetohell situation and i had gone to hell and come right out again and now i cared now i wanted to live i wanted to badly enough to be afraid i turned the matter over in my mind examining my emotions probing their perverse strangeness and need it be said consulting frequently with the whisky bottle and so gradually i became cleareyed and keen and i could see my feelings for what they were not abnormal but normal normal to a degree which where i was concerned would never do but there was no cause for alarm i had known such feelings in the past and down through the years their duration had become increasingly brief they were in the wrong soil they bloomed and withered almost simultaneously i cared yes but only about a game only about a problem not about living or dying it was an interesting game the one interest without which there would be emptiness and i wanted to win i wanted to make them lose but it was nothing to become fearsick about let them worry with me it was only a game the old twoway pull began to assert itself i headed for town sitting very straight and circumspectly in the car seat but moving sidewise mentally moving off to one side off into a world known only to me where i could see them without being seen just a game that was all i could win or lose that was all i could do i parked the car in front of the press club and went upstairs jake the officer of the day was at his post we went through maneuvers we held closeorder drill ending with a barrage i stood back from the bar and we saluted all secured officer all secured sir an excellent patrol i said everything is shipshape jimdandy and crackerjack and i hereby decorate you with the highest order of the land the most coveted of awards the on the house he said and he shoved my money back look mr brown maybe it aint none of my business but shouldnt you be i brought him to attention with a crisp command i marched out and proceeded to the courier dave randall hadnt exaggerated his need for help he had taken a typewriter over to the city desk and was trying to do rewrite and his own job the only regular rewrite man he had was pop landis and pop nice guy that he was was slow as all hell and he was more than swamped with the running story of the murder and the crime cleanup i took his carbons off the hook and sat down at my desk i began to read briefing myself to take over stopping now and then to write some minor but must story they had handled ellen as delicately as they could without distorting the facts our relationship was barely mentioned the dirt would fly in the outoftown papers but here the emphasis was all on the murderer and the consequent criminal roundup i skimmed through the dupes longestranged wife of courier reporter clinton brown burial to be in los angeles death attributed to asphyxiation asphyxiation i read back through that part again somehow glad that it had been that way painfully but by no means critically burned according to the coroners office the relatively minor nature of the burns coupled with the fact that the mattress was almost completely consumed indicates that mrs brown must have revived soon after the maniacs departure panicstricken and dazed she was unable to find her way out of the smokefilled cottage before succumbing to it was surmised that the murderer had crawled about beneath the cottages there were handprints kneeprints elbowprints there was the imprint of his body where he had apparently lain prone i paused my heart did a small flipflop strictly of course because of the excitement of the game i looked down at the typewritten page again i read and sighed with relief about five feet seven inches tall and rather heavyset shoes approximately size eight it wasnt me then not by more than five inches and two and a half sizes there was no way it could be twisted into being me and whoever it was some stumblebum doubtless he was safe he wouldnt suffer for what i had done stukey would never find him he didnt know enough about the guy and what he did know fitted too many people id been working less than an hour when mr lovelace came in he gave me a startled look then passed on by he said something indistinguishable but obviously sharp to dave randall and dave followed him into his office he came out after about five minutes and scuttled over to my desk redfaced almost cringing he told me to beat it right now brownie the old man gnawed me out to a faretheewell i knew it was a hell of a bad thing to have you come in to work right after to handle a story about it but i didnt know who the hell else to i would have been grieved i said if you had not called me i am wed to my work and stand ready at all times to do my husbandly duty and i shall so inform dont for gods sake clint just get out of here if you want to do something go out and see if you can get hold of tom judge tell him i said by god to get in here and do it fast suppose he is locked in nuptial bliss with his wife do i have the colonels permission to brownie please i stood up and slid my coat off the back of my chair put it on and picked up my hat i i dont know what prompted me to say it perhaps something in pops stories jogged my memory or perhaps it was the constant jangling of the telephones i dont know why but i said by the way colonel did you talk to did ellen call in here yesterday not that i know of why no reason i shrugged she usually did call as soon as she hit town well she didnt call yesterday to my knowledge no one said anything about it why dont you ask bessie ill do that i said but i didnt do it i left the city room walking right on past the cubicle where bessie and her switchboard sat i didnt want bessies memory jogged i wanted her to forget that ellen had called and that the call had been answered it was evidence you see or rather it would be evidence if the person who had talked to ellen could not satisfactorily explain his whereabouts on the night before and little as i liked tom judge lem stukeys office was so crowded that i could hardly get in the door he had two secretaries answering telephones he was surrounded by reporters our boys and those who had flown in from out of town a dozenodd cops and detectives milled around his desk being lem of course with an eye ever to the main angle he spotted me at once and he pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed me by the hand jesus keed im glad to see you been thinkin about giving you a ring but lets get out of here huh he propelled me across the hall into an unoccupied jury room he closed the door and leaned against it mopping his brow with exaggerated dismay you ever see anything like that in there pal i ask you now aint that something let me ask you i said you mean you aint heard the news yet i figured the boys at the courier would be keepin you ive heard but it doesnt look like something yet it looks like the old giant economysize frammis the old hoopteedo with a full years supply of hot air any minute now youll be announcing that you expect to make an arrest within twentyfour hours uhuh its going to take me a little longer than that why should it i can spot you fifty mediumsized heavyset guys of no specific age or coloring in five minutes pally he gave me a placating tap on the arm you sit right down there huh thats the keed now youre still sore aint you i jumped you last night i tried to push you around and and you got pushed around i said and im not sore im apologizin brownie let a guy apologize wont you i was all wrong and whatever you handed me i had comin jesus id have been sore myself a guys wife gets killed and the first he hears about it someones tryin to pin it on him all right i sighed i was sore youve apologized now all is forgiven and we love one another like brothers you aint just awoofin keed he nodded firmly jesus it almost makes me shiver when i think how i almost missed out on this and i would have missed out on it if it hadnt been for you if you hadntve thrown the old hooks into me i what have you got i said just by god what have you got anyway nothing a bum crawls under those cottages to get out of the rain and huhuh a bum with good shoes and a full suit of clothes huhuh anyway you dont find no bums over on the island it takes a buck to get over and back on the ferry and there aint nothin over there for them without dough so it wasnt a bum then just some guy whod had too much to drink that ill buy he now wait a minute keed he held up a hand let me give you the whole picture you got a right to know and im goin to give it to you but under the hat get me i dont want to tip the guy off you mean you picked up some fingerprints fingerprints what gave you that idea nothing go on i said first of all well we done it last but ill give it to you first we raked the island from one end to the other we went over that place with a uh finetooth comb yeah a finetooth comb and we didnt turn the guy up so we know he came over on this side okay now get this the ferry didnt begin running until tenthirty last night it didnt start back here with a load until tenthirty then it didnt make another run until one in the morning when it made its last trip of the day well that last trip lets skip the last one i said the roundup was on by that time the passengers were all checked and cleared before they were allowed to get on board right right on the nose so that put our boy on the tenthirty ferry now wait a minute keed i know what youre going to say there was plenty of people waitin to get back to this side two hundred and four of em according to the ferry receipts and youre going to say that stops us but it dont brownie it dont make it nearly as tough as it sounds first you rule the women out then you rule out the couples that cuts the total down to maybe sixty or seventy just the stags which is still i said no small number of people did i say no but it dont look so tough no more does it let me give you the rest of it we checked the hotels the guy didnt show at any of em we checked on the buses and trains he didnt leave town we checked the bayside parking lots he didnt pick up a car he could still have had one he could have parked on the street not near the ferry not unless he wanted to walk three blocks and a guy on a party wouldnt do that to save four bits that leaves us the streetcars and taxicabs the streetcars well thats kind of a toughie we got to work from the fare zones maybe check out whole neighborhoods i say we got to but i dont think we actually will the guys soaking wet everyone on the ferry was he wouldnt want to screw around with no streetcars i figure what about walking well stukey frowned grudgingly maybe but it aint very likely it was pouring down rain hed be afraid of being picked up no i think the taxis is where well get him course he probably didnt get out right at his house and maybe he didnt go home right away but in other words i said if you check everyone in pacific city you may find him now it aint that bad he protested its going to take some time sure but we can do it and after you do then what what have you got i got a killer i got a guy thats got some goddamned tall explaining to do if he aint a killer and youll have some to do youre asking for it stukey youre setting yourself up for the towns number one horses ass he looked at me puzzled still looking at me he took out a cigar and lighted it took a slow thoughtful puff i guess i dont dig you keed we been knockin ourselves out on this i thought youd be tickled pink well i forced a laugh i appreciate it of course but if it doesnt lead to anything you said yourself the guy was probably some drunk he probably had a load on its pretty hard to hang around the island without taking on a load but bein drunk dont make him innocent its a hell of a lot more likely to make it the other way a crazy killing like this its just the kind of a thing but theres so damned many loose ends stuke the poem and well so what we just forget him because we cant dope it all out no of course not but yeah his head was cocked to one side his voice was a little too smooth is that what youre sayin pal you want us to lay off the only hot lead we got i laughed again making it sound fretful and tired and jibing i guess im just not my usual cheery self today stuke im not thinking like a courier man my ass is dragging and the compass is pointing south well sure i can understand that but frankly i said i think that seeing you engaged in honest work has thrown me into a state of shock you have stunned me stuke such industry such brilliance in one whose chief activity heretofore has been he grinned chuckled and the puzzled look went out of his eyes thats the old keed thats the old brownie boy all foolin aside though pal im doin all right huh you got any suggestions you just say so i wouldnt think of giving you any i said youre doing too well by yourself i meant every word of it i didnt have the slightest doubt that he would catch the guy he hooked his thumbs in his vest trying to suppress a smirk of pleasure i got a hunch on this one keed id lay a case against a cork that hes our killer maybe you may be right but i imagine youll have a hard time proving it huhuh a guy like that wouldnt be a pro he wouldnt make you prove it all we got to do is grab him and sweat him and hell cave in like a whores mattress that sweating i said i would be very very careful about that stuke am i crazy he leaned forward earnestly i got a plateful of gravy and i spit in it not me pal strictly legit thats me you put me on the right track and im ridin it clean to the end of the line incidentally brownie yes ill see that you get the story first you personally ill keep the guy under wraps until you dont need to do that i said dont need to hell aint we pals didnt you he broke off abruptly blinking at me then his lips stretched in a slow surprised grin well say now i thats right if you get this man and if he is the killer you can write your own ticket right on up to and including county judge i couldnt stand in your way if i wanted to he was in a generous mood moreover i suspect he was not at all sure that i wouldnt be of use to him so he declared that purely out of friendship he would still see that i got first crack at the story just because i love you keed but dont let out nothin i told you this morning if the killer got wind of it it might blow the whole deal i wont tell a soul i promised in fact it has suddenly dawned on me that i dont know any souls he snickered and said that was the keed the old brownie boy do you know any souls stuke they dont have to be anything fancy just a good oldfashioned soul who would like to go steady with a badly frazzled id the keed he said a trifle impatiently the ol brownie boy be seem you pal i left the police station and bought a fifth of whisky then i headed my car toward tom judges house he lived in the corner house of a blocklong double row of identical structures all four rooms all painted brown all tarpaperroofed with a little tin chimney near the back and another up front back when i was a youngster and not a very young youngster we called these affairs shotgun houses and they rented for about twelve dollars a month toms rent was ninetyfive which was just a little less than half his takehome pay the phone was ringing as i stepped upon the porch and dimly apparently in the rear of the house a baby was crying i knocked and the crying stopped abruptly then after a moment or two the ringing stopped also i knocked again long and loudly i tried to open the screen it was locked the shades at the window and door were drawn i leaned back against the porch rail opened the bottle and slugged down a stiff one it was the first drink id had since my morning patrol and it refreshed me wonderfully i bought two more and then of course accepted one on the house i left the porch walked around to the rear and pounded on the back door the baby cried again for a split second otherwise silence i took a drink i drew back my foot and kicked the door as hard as i could it flew open and i walked in mrs judge was standing in a corner near the stove holding the baby to her breast she wasnt twentyfive i knew but she looked ten years older flatchested unhealthily fat through the hips thinnecked you dont live very high on the hog when youre married to a semiincompetent reporter on a smallcity newspaper you age fast her face was made up her hair was in curlers and both jobs had obviously been done in a hurry she looked at me trembling wideeyed i gave her a reassuring smile and looked at tom an open trunk stood on the kitchen floor he had been packing it and he was still holding an armful of clothing slowly he let it drop and his mouth opened and closed silently going somewhere i asked nno nno brownie he gulped and shook his head jjust sstoring a ffew he wanted to act sore he knew he should but he just wasnt up to it he looked haunted as graypale as a sheet of copy paper i i he gulped again i heard about your wife brownie mmidge and i hheard it over the radio and im ssure ssor easy i said just take it real easy youve not been particularly fond of me the feeling has been reciprocated but this is a friendly visit now how about a drink i i ddont i uncapped the bottle and pushed it at him take it i said take a big one you take it tom mrs judge spoke for the first time giving me a halfdefiant look tom doesnt drink much hes not used to drinking he hehe i know i said your drink tom he almost snatched the bottle from my hands he tilted it thirstily gagged and shivered and thrust it back at me a little a very little of his usual belligerent assertiveness returned well brownie he hiccuped i know youre probably upset about your wife but thats no reason to friendly i said i said it and i meant it im here to ask you some questions and give you some answers yeah you are huh what makes you think maybe you dont want to but i think youd better listen before you make up your mind he hesitated looked at his wife her eyes moved to my face and her lips began to tremble hes good she said yyou hes told me about you he ttries so hard hhe works twice as hard as you do aand all you can do is make fun of him hhe i its your fault yyou can pplay around and everything is sso easy for you and hhe no i said no it isnt easy for me mrs judge it is he told me how it is you make fun of him because its easy for you and and you can blow in all your money on yourself and all he can do is is her voice broke and she began to sob tom said midge honey you shouldnt i said its all right i understand how mrs judge feels i think i understand how youve felt but im trying to be your friend now she brushed her nose against her arm and gave the baby a little pat she looked from me to him and nodded you talk to him tom you take another drink then she shuffled out of the room and elbowed the door shut behind her i sat down at the table and he sank down across from me i had a drink i waited until he had taken one all right i said heres the first question my wife called the office yesterday afternoon you talked to her what was the substance of your conversation wwhat what makes you think she always called as soon as she got in town she didnt talk to anyone else or theyd have told me about it your desk is right across from mine youd have answered my phone bbut but im not always there shed have kept ringing until she got an answer and if she hadnt got one shed have called the city desk he stared down at the cracked oilcloth of the table his fingers fumbling at the pocket of his shirt i took out my cigarettes put one in his mouth and held a match for him im not sore tom i said if i were sore i wouldnt be sitting here and you wouldnt be either very long wwhat his head snapped up what do you mean you know what i mean but lets take it from the beginning you talked to her you got her to give you the number of her cottage then you told her i was gone for the day and you suggested something to the effect that you would be happy to take my place his dull chubby face reddened and he spread his hands brownie i i christ what can i say its all right you behaved quite normally you havent had much of what passes for good times no later than yesterday morning id called you a lousy newspaperman and a sonofabitch why not put one over on me through the pleasant medium of laying my wife he shook his head miserably brownie it thats not quite its close enough what did she say to the proposition well she didnt really say anything she just sort of laughed and you construed that as an invitation go on go go on spill it tell me all go and on a phrase meaning to proceed i felt sorry for him responsible for him but he didnt need to make it twice as tough as it was by acting like a piltdown moron you went over to the island i said take it from there and keep going i well i went over around four a little after four i guess it was a little while before the storm started it was still light then of course and i didnt want to to go down there yet so i stopped in a bar i had a couple of drinks and did you see anyone you knew huhuh i mean i dont think there was anyone there that knew me i didnt talk to anyone or well it started raining pouring down but drinks were awfully high in there and someone said the ferry had stopped runfling and i didnt know quite what to do id been kind of nerving myself up id got to thinking about how crazy this was me with a wife and kid and you a guy i worked with how it might get me in all kinds of trouble and and id just about decided to drop it i mean it brownie if the ferry had been running or if id had enough dough to hang around there in the bar i jesus jesus why couldnt it have been that way why i wonder i said go on tom there wasnt anything else to do so i did it i bought a fifth at the bar tequila the cheapest thing they had then i went down to her cottage i figured wed we wed just drink and talk and as soon as the storm was over all right all right he paused and sighed go ahead and laugh that was a grimace i said of unadulterated pain yeah well anyway i guess you know what happened she wouldnt let me in she bawled hell out of me said id taken a hell of a lot for granted and slammed the door in my face i god brownie it wasnt right if she hadnt wanted me to come she ought to have said so she shouldnt have laughed and acted like well it would be all right very few of us i said behave as well as we should perhaps youve noticed that i take it that having no other refuge you retired beneath the cottages yeah hell what a mess soaking wet and damned near broke and i had to lay under there like a goddamned rat or something couldnt even sit up straight and it wasnt a hell of a lot dryer under there than it was outside i kept crawling around trying to find a dry spot i guess most of those places were empty but there was one well you could hear the bed going up and down and then the people getting up and going to the bathroom and and and me under there like a rat like a goddamned drowned rat you i guess it wouldnt have meant anything to you brownie but hell what difference does it make i opened up the tequila and started hitting it i kept pouring it down i was so damned miserable and wet and all at once i went out like a light it was just like something had hit me over the head i dont know how long i was out i came to all of a sudden and i couldnt figure out where i was i was scared as hell and i heard someone pounding and a bunch of guys calling back and forth and i could see flashlights shooting around on the ground i remembered where i was then and that really chilled me all i could think of was that the place was being raided and what the hell i was going to say if they found me i crawled up to the end where the street was and then i ran across into that little park and i dont know where all i did go it was still so damned dark and raining so hard i think i passed out a couple of times then i dont know how long it was but finally i heard the ferry whistle and i cut down to the landing there was a big crowd there and they were all wet too i mean theyd got pretty wet in the rain and most of em were stiff or half stiff from hanging around the bars all evening i squeezed onto the ferry with em and went straight down to the john i was down there in one of the stalls having a few drinks when youd kept the tequila with you then thats good yeah id held onto it somehow so i thought id got out of the mess without any real trouble and i was trying to pull myself together when these two guys came in boat hands they were they were talking about a woman being killed over in the cottages and and i didnt think about it being her bbut god id been there and id been crawling all around and and and then i got home and midge and i turned on the radio and how did you get home i took a taxi all but the last five blocks i only had sixty cents see so i rode out fifty cents worth and gave the driver a dime tip and walked the rest of the way you didnt give him your address no i just had him head up main and down laurel until the meter showed four bits and then i got out that was good in a way and bad in a way the driver didnt know where hed gone but hed remember him and a neighborhood like this particularly a neighborhood like this would receive a thorough goingover by stukeys boys yyou two big tears were in the corners of his eyes ive ttold you the gods truth brownie i ddont need to you know i didnt kill her dont you yes tom i said i know you didnt kill her bbut they think i did theyve got evidence they know i was there they know what i look like they they dont i said get me they dont they know a guy of about your build and size was there but thats all they know thats all they need that cab driver and knowing what i look like and ive got to get away brownie its the only thing i can do its the one thing you cant do i said theyll be watching the trains and buses if you did manage to get out of town theyd trail you down youd be hanging a sign on yourself b but the cab driver will be mistaken if and when they turn you up itll be your word against his yours and what about your wife she knows about this shed swear that you were at home all evening shshe his voice dropped to a whisper she knows shshed swear to it but good thatll be good enough you both stick to that story and theres not a damned thing they can do theyll try to of course if they find you if hell theyd find him all right but i didnt want him any more frightened than he was just deny everything and keep denying and theyll have to let you go he lifted the bottle slowly set it down untasted i i ddont think i can do it brownie they get to questioning me and youve got to once they place you on that island at the time of the murder once they get you to admit you saw her that she refused to let you in and you laid around under those cottages drinking i know jesus he shivered its all ive been thinking about theyll think i was sore at her theyll think i hung around to to right so you do what i told you to do dont admit a damned thing bbut but theyll get me all tangled up i i dont think i can take it how about the gas chamber can you take that he buried his face in his arms and began to sob i watched him for a minute and then i reached across the table grabbed him by the hair and jerked his head up now listen to me i said you didnt kill her and youre not going to let anyone talk you into thinking you did youre absolutely safe a rough seventytwo hours is the worst they can give you thats all and then its over you can take it i know you can know it tom get me if i didnt think so i wouldnt say it he tried to work up a smile not much of one but it was a large improvement on blubbering yyoure swell brownie you really think i can didnt i say so now get yourself shaved and whatever else you have to do and come on with me ill drop you off at the office office oh god no brownie not to yes to the office they need you it looks bad to lay off i stood up and pulled him up get moving you can tell the colonel your phones been out of order if he gives you any guff hell probably be so glad to have some help he wont say anything it was like pulling teeth to get him started and even after we were in the car and on our way downtown he kept on arguing and pleading begging to be let off he just couldnt do it and everyone would know and im ssick brownie and so on until i almost decided to take him home and let come what might not because i was irritated by him although i was but because i was afraid my efforts were being wasted for if he had no more stamina than this if he behaved this way now he wouldnt hold out five minutes against stukey hed cave in right away and since that was the case but perhaps he would stiffen up perhaps given a day or so he would become his usual resentful self a man dedicated to the proposition that what was demanded of him should automatically be withheld perhaps the very arrogance and inturned sullenness that had got him into this mess would get him out of it it seemed logical that it would fate would have to be very cruel indeed to reform his dully dogged spirit now so i resisted his begging i gave him drink for his stomach and steady pep talk for his nerves and if the bottle was exhuasted and it was by the time we arrived at the courier building it had nothing at all on me sighing heavily tom opened the door and slowly eased one foot out to the curb he hesitated then suddenly turned around again brownie i no i said no no no no think of the brave little woman think of the wee kiddie and drag yourself to hell upstairs im going brownie but i may not see you again and youve been so swell i groaned i removed my hat and slapped myself on the forehead he frowned slightly but he didnt budge its about dave hes always been nice enough to me and you well you know how youve been but things are different now maybe daves never done anything against me but youve done plenty for me were on the same side and anyone thats got it in for you got it in for me i said not that there is anything serious in my sniping at the colonel the colonel understands my playful nature but arent you just a little confused i know he nodded youre all the time riding him and maybe youve been asking for it but that doesnt cut any ice with me you start noticing him brownie notice how hell load you up try to swamp you with work when hes got other guys doing nothing and hes always getting you out of the office shooting you out on assignments he doesnt want you around where you can shine up to the old man hes jealous and i stopped him strangely or perhaps not so strangely i was angered by what he said dave was my own particular little target and i wasnt going to have anyone else tossing darts at him they had no reason to there was such a thing as being fair if dave kept me loaded with work it was because of the high percentage of incompetent staffers such as tom judge if he tried to keep me out of mr lovelaces way it was because of a wellwarranted fear that i might do or say something irreparably embarrassing i said as much in a properly oblique way i want to set you straight on this tom i said firmly dave would be the last person in the world to do anything to harm me hes so constructed that hed feel strongly responsible for any misfortune i suffered i know hes proved it every time ive lost a job hes quit also and hired me on at his next paper maybe he was afraid not to you might have hung around drinking and needing him giving him so much trouble hed get fired himself i wouldnt have done that dave wouldnt have had to put up with it if i had done it all he would have had to do was reveal a certain secret and i would never have shown my face in another newspaper office of course if he did reveal it it was as though tom were reading my mind reading a thought that had never been there until now its none of my business brownie but you got something on him i mean did he pull a bad boner somewhere or i shook my head to myself as well as him a boner yes but thered been hundreds and thousands of boners and the war was a long time over it was simply a mistake no culpability had attached to it then and certainly none could now dave had nothing to fear from me he put up with me only because of his own stricken conscience naturally he didnt want daves all on edge brownie it wouldnt take much to throw him completely hes got a lot of dough tied up in a house here and hes not a kid any more and newspapers are folding all over the country if he thought he might lose out here he wont theres no reason why he should i said youre utterly and completely wrong tom dave and i are actually pretty good friends if we werent hed have fired me long ago no he wouldnt the old man wouldnt let him why ill bet if you took a notion to knock him to lovelace hed go on i said just get the hell up there and get to work youre the boy with the troubles remember well dont forget it just forget about me and remember what you have to do he nodded grudgingly climbed out then leaned back inside again you watch him he said sneak a look at him sometime when he thinks your back is turned youll see that guy could kill you and enjoy doing it i held midday maneuvers at the press club early in the afternoon i stopped by the coroners office he was a stuffy conceited bastard he wasnt at all sure when he could release ellens body but he thought he might be able to do it by friday i pointed out that this posed a difficult situation it would mean that the burial couldnt take place before sunday which might be impractical for the undertaker and undoubtedly would increase his charges moreover it would crowd me seriously for time if i was to be back at work on monday morning he shrugged my troubles he indicated were no concern of his i have never got along with coroners they are either laymen of the lower orders who must pretend to be much or they are fatheaded medical failures who are sore at the whole world for that which only they have wrought our discussion continued on an increasingly less amiable plane i finally suggested that if he simply had to have a body around i would buy him one from the local rendering plant a cow horse or anything he named and when he tired of playing with it he could stuff it he personally and not a taxidermist that did it ellens body would be released saturday he said and not a goddamned day before meanwhile i was to get out of his office and stay out i got out and called dave as i saw it the funeral couldnt be held before late monday or more than likely tuesday in other words i would probably be off until the following wednesday dave hesitated studying the calendar i imagine he said it would be all right he guessed hed have to get lovelaces okay but he was sure it would be all right how about coming out to the house for dinner before you leave he added do you good to get some homecooked food kay told me to ask you good sweet kay i said dear kind kay tell me colonel wouldnt you say she has a truly wonderful soul goodby he said shortly ill talk to you when youre not half stiff you misunderstood me i said i said soul not look brownie he snapped im trying as hard as i know how to youre fed up with me arent you i said youve had it up to here it would suit you fine if i dropped dead it slipped out involuntarily dave made a sound that was midway between a grunt and a gasp i didnt blame him for being startled i was myself he was silent for a long moment then his voice came back over the wire worried warm with concern look boy where are you calling from ill come and get you and take you home im sorry colonel i said sergeant brown presents his apologies i have become patrol happy the maneuvers have got me clobbered they must have when you talk like that where are you calling from im all right i said forget it forgive it and god bless you twas a slip of the tongue and nothing more but i just dont understand of course i get a little annoyed with you at times but i thought you knew how i felt about you entirely aside from friendship youre the best man ive got i couldnt run the place without you thanks i said thanks a lot dave i said a damned foolish thing and im sorry and lets leave it at that well look he was still troubled i was thinking about that dinner invitation naturally you dont feel up to social occasions so soon after afterward why dont we make it next week sometime after you get back from los angeles i didnt want to make it any time my idea of an agonizingly misspent evening was one in the company of kay randall i was afraid to refuse now however in view of what i had said to dave he would think i had meant it and somehow whatever i felt about him and however i acted i did not want him to think that so i accepted with thanks and a mental note to kick tom judges tail i went home knocked myself out with booze and fell asleep the next day thursday i had another talk with lem stukey he hadnt turned up anything with the streetcar company and hed had the same result with the taxi operators but he was by no means discouraged we didnt expect nothing on the streetcars he shrugged just checked them out as a matter of form the bastard took a cab and dont think hell aint going to pop when i turn it up but youve already weve checked the trip sheets weve talked to all the drivers who worked that night now we pull em in one at a time and find out which ones lyin dont you worry none keed hes makin it tough for us and hell sure as hell regret it but he aint making it impossible i dont get you i said why would he lie about it probably got a criminal record afraid of getting mixed up with cops or maybe his license has run out hell theres all kinds of reasons maybe he knocked the fare down maybe he did a hitandrun and doctored his trip sheet to put him in another neighborhood you amaze me stuke i said i had thought you cunning but never intelligent and i realized with further amazement that stukey was constantly coming up with little things like that things that maybe didnt stamp him a genius but that sure as hell proved he was no slob well get him he promised were just gettin warmed up i left lem and paid a visit to the express company and an undertaker i made a longdistance call to a los angeles undertaker and repaired to the press club dave had been trying to reach me i called him immediately following maneuvers he had talked to lovelace and it was all right for me to lay off the extra time perfectly all right however ohoh i said pray proceed colonel while i hoist my pack and rifle i wouldnt ask you myself clint the old man wants you to handle it if you possibly can its a pretty big thing and he gave me the essential details the president of one of the mexican federal banks immediately across the border had embezzled several million pesos the fraud hadnt been made public yet and the president who was en route from new york after a vacation was unaware of its discovery but he was due to be arrested as soon as he stepped off the plane in the morning i was to be on hand to get the story i should point out here perhaps that the yarn wouldnt have been a big one in new york or chicago for that matter it wouldnt have got a very big play in los angeles but because of our geographical location because it concerned a neighboring city although a mexican one it would be of prime interest to our readers i agreed to handle it i got up at six in the morning at seven i was at the border citys airport where i met the plane the president was on it but so also were two federalistas they had got on at los angeles and they took charge of senor presidente as soon as the plane touched in mexico they hustled him into a waiting limousine and sped away i learned that they intended taking him fifty miles down the coast to another city but that was all i learned i called dave he talked with lovelace while i waited the decision was for me to continue to the second city i did the president had been put aboard a government plane and was on his way to mexico city so there went my story for the local authorities could give me no information on the case the chief of police a surprisingly young friendly guy sympathized volubly and insisted on drinking his lunch with me we drank and drank and drank tequila mainly with an occasional mescal and chasers of that wonderful creamy cerveza beer such as i have seldom tasted outside of mexico the chief became very gay it was too bad he said that i was driving a car otherwise he would take his car and we would go to the island together your rose island cleent and then i could cross over to pacific city on the ferry i blinked rather owlishly according to the mirror in the back bar i said now wait a minute amigo caro just how in the you do not know yes you think i keed no he grinned delightedly come i show you he led me over to the wall stabbed a shaky finger at a framed map of baja california the finger weaved slid and came to a stop at a point near the mexicocalifornia border here is hi c is how you say pen penin peninsula yes penin well you see eet yes how way out here eet come yes and here is teep of island and here what you say is here cleent something never to be taken internally i said an insipid beverage somewhat salty in this instance ha ha is water you say yes you be wrong cleent poquita si two three inches yes but no more underneath is beeg how you say reef rock like pavement youre joking i said you mean to tell me you can drive a car from here to here si many time i have many peoples they do like i say is rock muy bueno camino ver fine road many peoples they do but i never had in fact i had never heard of the reef it wasnt so surprising i guess i seldom got over to the island i could do all the drinking i wanted to at home or in the pacific city bars and as far as the cathouses went so you see i had no reason to know much about the island and how you got there other than by ferry or charter boat but still the information disturbed me it was an extra little item in a story i thought i knew pretty well letterperfect now i saw i didnt know it all it was another piece of jigsaw puzzle that i thought i had all locked together the information shouldnt really have disturbed me since stukey knew everything else that might possibly be of use to him he doubtless knew of this land route to the island and he had quite properly ignored it as a factor in shaking my alibi i couldnt have made this roundabout round trip on the night of the murder i wouldnt have had time for that matter no one could have done it during the storm to have driven across almost four miles of reef almost three times the width of the bay to have done that on a pitchblack rainy night with a heavy sea running well it was simply out of the question it was many times as fantastically dangerous and impossible as what i had done it had no bearing then otherwise stukey would have mentioned it and have looked into it it didnt affect me it didnt affect tom judge it didnt it was meaningless but somehow it bothered me it lingered in my mind nagging me long after i had shaken hands with the mexican police chief and headed back toward the border it reached the us customs station early in the afternoon i knew several of the guards there and i asked them about the reef they knew about it of course it wasnt worthwhile to keep a customs officer there but it was kept under observation by the border patrol i wondered about that whether any very close watch had been kept on the night of the storm i doubted it like hell we talked a minute or two more and i mentioned casually that they had probably had an easy time of it during the storm they admitted as much sat around on our cans all evening brownie didnt a thing cross over but one taxi do you re i cut off the question abruptly i didnt want them curious and anyway they couldnt have told me anything a dark stormy night outside and a snug comfortable guardhouse and cabs always got a very fast check they werent searched as private passenger cars were there would have been a quick glance through the window and fast birthplace us citizen and then a wave onward dismissal i drove on still vaguely disquieted i stopped in pacific city for a few groceries and some bottles and went on out to the house i mixed eggs and whisky i drank them took a bottle into the livingroom and sat down on the lounge i got up and sat down on the floor i stared at the telephone tom judge was on a very bad spot stukey was certain to find him soon unless he was diverted from him an element of doubt should be introduced another person should be brought into the case why not push that reef business at lem talk it up to him why not sic him on that lone taxicab that had crossed the border point out that a man might have gone down in a cab and walked across on the reef no no no that was stupid lem would already have thought about it crossing on foot would have been even more hazardous than by car and what would have been the purpose in it anyway what could he dave randall have hoped to accomplish by it to catch me there perhaps to go in after i had left and and and nothing it was reasonless it was impossible absolutely without basis how in the hell had i started thinking about this why did i persist in so thinking a taxicab had crossed the border there was a submerged reef connecting with the mainland and that fathead tom judge had said dave had it in for me that was all i had to go on the reef the cab and the twisted imaginings of tom a guy who was always trying to stir things up dividing the world into enemy and friendly camps and attaching to first one side then the other and out of that and despite the fact that i knew who had killed ellen but did i know shed got up after i left somebody had wiped away fingerprints shed died of asphyxiation not suddenly i laughed out loud i laughed so hard that the whisky slopped out of my glass for at last id remembered and i was almost foolish with relief dave had been at home that night stukey had called him there and then dave had called me everything had been happening at once and i guess id been halfway off my rocker but now i remembered dave had been at home the colonel had been in the bosom of his family tossing the wee ones on his knee perhaps while the little woman hummed a happy roundelay i sat drinking and thinking musing idly trying to sort out my feelings about dave they were pretty confused in a way i liked him i felt sorry for him yet there was another side of me that hated him that was determined to make him go on suffering for what he had done to me i wanted him to steer clear of trouble for two reasons because i liked him because i hated him he was a nice guy and i wanted him to stay right where he was where i could get at him dig at him day after day until i dont know it is hard to be specific about ones emotions it is difficult to stop a story at a certain point and give a clearcut analysis of your feelings explain just why they are such and such and why they are not something else personally i am a strong believer in the exposition technique as opposed to the declarative it is not particularly useful of course when employed on an ofthemoment basis but given enough time it invariably works study a mans actions at length and his motivations become clear i drove up to los angeles on sunday and took a room at the press club the pacific city undertaker got the lead out of his can and the one in la did likewise and the funeral was held late monday it was a nice funeral i thought stukey and the randalls sent flowers also mr lovelace and the courier staff too the newspaper lads i knew in los angeles had bought a couple of big bouquets and there was one giantsized wreath without a card on it i didnt think much about it i supposed that it had been bought by the city hall crowd in pacific city and that the card had been lost there were four press cars in the funeral procession they were there on business the boys were since the story was still news they had to shoot pictures and get me to do some surmising about the killer and so on enough to pad out into a few paragraphs but i was acquainted with most of them and having them there was good it made the thing seem more like a real funeral they were on overtime at the end of the ceremony so the reporters phoned in their stories and the photogs sent in their plates by motorcycle courier and we all went to the press club we bumped a couple of tables together and started drinking we had dinner and continued drinking luckily they wouldnt let me pay for anything i had to borrow on my car to bury ellen and i was very very short of money a waiter came up with a telephone call slip i looked at it casually and shoved it into my pocket i didnt recognize the number i couldnt recall knowing anyone by the name of d chase it was probably some friend of ellens i thought someone who wished to offer condolences the party broke up about nine and i bought a bottle and went up to my room as a tried and true courier man one who did not need to be watched to do his duty i suppose i should have driven back to pacific city that night and gone to work tuesday morning but i was tired and there was much heavy thinking to be done and something told me it could not be done amid the hustle and bustle of pacific citys greatest and only daily i stood at the window of my room gazing out and downward a fog had settled over the city and the lights bloomed up out of it blurred and hazy now and then there was the muted scream of a siren as an ambulance weaved northward through the traffic to georgia street receiving los angeles sprawling noisy ugly dirty and completely wonderful it would always be home to me this place and no other it would never be home to me i turned out the lights and dragged a chair up to the window i cocked my feet up on the radiator and leaned back tom judge at the outside stukey would have him in a day or two logically he should have run him down before this and exactly what was i going to do about it tom might be able to hold out he might be able to take a seventytwohour sweat the threeday investigation period in which his sole hope and defense would rest on his own personal guts as i say he might but there was at least a fiftyfifty chance that he wouldnt and once he broke down it would be too late for me to do anything if only the murderer could have been tied in more closely with the poem that is if it could be established that the poet and the murderer were the same man so far the poem had drawn very little attention it had been mentioned by the police paraphrased in various papers and that was all ellen had had it for reasons known only to herself dazed and dying she had grabbed it up doubtless accidentally that was the official attitude and it was too bad that it was that anyone who knew tom would know him incapable of the poem a few paragraphs of plodding prose were toms literary limit so it was unfortunate that the poem had been brushed off so lightly it was unfortunate that there was not some way of proving that the murderer and the poet were one and the same man the phone rang softly in actuality yet it seemed loud and ominous as phones do at night in dark hotel rooms i frowned at it then i stretched an arm out and lifted it from the writingdesk a husky feminine voice said mr brown brownie who is this i said ill bet you cant guess ill bet youve forgotten me already i sighed i said nothing there is nothing much to say to people who ask you to guess their names while betting that you have forgotten them its deborah brownie she laughed a little uncomfortably you know deborah chasen i remembered i said something then but i dont recall what something like well how are you or what are you doing here im fine she said ive been here all the time brownie i was i heard about your wife i see i said yes she said i heard about it so i didnt go ive been waiting here for you did you get the flowers i sent flowers oh the wreath i said i wondered who it was from i sent them for you she said just on your account brownie not hers im not sorry about her im glad well thats very nice of you deborah i said i see youre still your subtle tactful self now if youll give me that horse laugh of yours my evening will be complete and ill go to bed she did laugh then her voice went soft and throaty it was as though she were breathing the words rather than speaking them brownie darling isnt it wonderful i was just sick when i left pacific city that afternoon i wanted to die i would have too i didnt care about anything any more and then the next morning i read that about her it was like being born again brownie honestly i was just so happy i cr jesus god i said what kind of a woman are you do you realize that youre talking about my i dont care you love me i know you do we love each other and she was in the way now well now she isnt i want to see you darling shall i come over there or do you want to come over here to my hotel i cursed her silently it was on the tip of my tongue to say that i was leaving immediately for pacific city but i caught myself in time as surely as hell was full of sulphur shed follow me there deborah i said wearily you are a goddamned pest i dont want any part of you or any other woman ive tried the double harness once and i damned well got a belly full of it and im playing it alone from now on i pooh ill change your mind nothing will change my mind i said now i suggest you take a nice cold shower and eat a couple of pounds of saltpeter and oh brownie she laughed delightedly you sweet crazy thing you ill come over there darling no i said no wait a minute deborah i do want to see you naturally but ive had a pretty rugged week and i well why dont we let it ride until tomorrow baby ill give you a ring and perhaps we can have lunch and a few drinks silence then the sound sounds of a cigarette lighter clicking and a long slow exhalation i could imagine the green eyes narrowing hardening brownie she said quietly try to understand deborah put yourself in my place my wife was killed less than a week ago i buried her today now you expect me to brownie well i said i was doing all right before i met you i didnt have anything but i didnt expect anything then yyou you know what you did brownie you didnt tell me you were married you held me and kissed me and yyou you did a lot of things i wouldnt have let you do if id known and then you now you deborah i said just put it this way just say that i was a heel and i still am and let it go at that no youre not brownie you couldnt be if you tried boy she sniffed im an expert on heels i know all about em and i know so what is it darling is it the money are you afraid ill embarrass you are wait i said wait a minute deborah ill do anything you say brownie anything just ddont dont drive me away from you wait i repeated ive got to think she waited i thought and of course i didnt need to i already knew what i would have to tell her prove to her if necessary that i simply couldnt provide what she above all women would want she would be sorry doubtless perhaps even angry but there would be no further argument she would have no illusions about its importance deborah might have a very beautiful soul but it was no good at all in bed she would be stunned at the idea of substituting a fireside chat for a good hard roll in the hay so i would have to tell her but i couldnt do it over the phone i couldnt i didnt think i could make it stick and i didnt want to i wanted to see her one more time theres a little bar near here i said a couple of blocks south on main its called the gladioli if ill find it ill be there right away brownie right away i said i put on a clean shirt and a fresh tie i combed my hair in front of the dresser mirror and suddenly i drew my arm back and hurled the comb against the glass my reflection tossed it back at me his lips moved and he cursed and he asked why the hell it had to be this way why if he didnt have the other did he have to have all this he said oh youre a pretty bastard you are a knockemdead sonofabitch they turn around to look at you they stretch their goddamned sweet necks to get a peek and and thats all there is only what they can see i dont get it by god why when theres nothing to do with do you have to look like the reflection shrugged he said thats the way it was so thats the way it was then he reached for his coat and turned wearily away and i turned off the light and left she was there ahead of me standing up near the glazed front of the place peering anxiously up and down the street i came up while she was looking the other way and she whirled around startled taking a swift step forward so that for a moment we were pressed against each other i gave her a little hug and she said brownie oh brownie and gave me a harder one we entered the dimly lit bar she let go of my arm and led the way to a rear booth rounded hips swinging slimankled fullcalved legs stretching and pressing impatiently against her skirt horsetail of corncolored hair brushing the small square shoulders she had a mink stole draped over her arm she was wearing a thin white blouse and a tailored fawncolored suit they made her look bigger in all the big places and smaller in all the small ones we sat down on the same bench of the leatherupholstered booth she pulled me down beside her a sleepylooking waiter brought drinks and went away again brownie she whispered brownie darling and her breast shivered against my arm she pulled my face down to hers and we kissed and then gently she pushed me away again im terribly sorry brownie i must have sounded awful it was just that i love you so much and i know how mean she must have been and she wasnt i said foolish perhaps but not mean well anyway im sorry im you wont have to be ashamed of me brownie you just tell me how you want me to be and whenever i get deborah i said listen to me yes darling im theres something i have to tell you i should have told you in the beginning but its not an easy thing to talk about and well i didnt think it was necessary you were leaving i never expected to see you again yes she lighted a cigarette what is it brownie i cant marry you i cant sleep with you oh no that was the trouble between me and my wife why we were separated i couldnt be a husband to her oh i see and all the time i thought the green eyes flashed happily and her face broke into a smile that doesnt mean a thing darling not a thing it it doesnt mean anything i said why of course it doesnt it was the same way with me and my husband you just a certain person simply isnt the right one and you get to where you not only cant listen i said you just dont understand deborah what im i know i know exactly what you mean i no let me tell you brownie youve got a right to know anyway even after he died i couldnt i tried im human and i i well i tried just like you have probably and i couldnt do it it was like there just wasnt any such thing as far as i was concerned id lost all desire for it and i was sure it was gone for good i was sure until that day in pacific city when i deborah i said you dont know what youre talking about what im talking about you think i dont she laughed you just think i dont brownie thats why i was so completely broken up when i found out you were married i knew it had to be you or no one that if it werent you then there simply wouldnt be anyone youll see darling her voice sank to a throaty caressing whisper and her eyes burned like green fires itll be all right for both of us itll be like nothing ever was before you see you do see dont you how very hard it was how even i with stalwart purpose in my heart and lofty motives in my mind might hesitate she had to be told yes and certainly i intended to tell her but she was making it so hard and she was so sure of herself so positive that everything was now all right so happy and in a way i loved her her small hard hand moved under the table and came to rest on my thigh it moved down up down up it stayed up pressed there firm yet trembling she shivered and leaned against me then that sleepysoft whisper again youve made me so happy darling and ill make you so happy youll see brownie youll never be sad again sad i said and i pressed the buzzer for the waiter i needed one more drink i would tell her after the second drink you are speaking in paradoxes deborah i am a jolly courier man a member of the happy courier family we know no sadness only joy in a job well done youre sad she said thats why you write those terribly sad poems the waiter came and went came back with drinks and went away again in the interim while we were waiting for him to get out of the way we made meaningless small talk he left for the second time she sipped her drink her fingers toying with the cardboard menu a faintly teasing smile on her lips surprised you didnt i you thought it was a secret a very rare type of secret i said one dealing with the nonexistent newspapermen dont write poetry deborah never never ever thats traditional oh yees she drawled smiling i know one that does he was writing one the first time i saw him in the office he got rid of it very fast but not quite fast enough not for someone who could read a menu upside down and across the table i lifted my glass i took a very long swallow and set it down again poetry i said it places me in a pretty bad company doesnt it i mean that poem she had they think theres a possibility that the killer may have written it do they she shrugged oh well just oh well meaning nothing meaning a great deal yes i said thats what they think and i have a strong hunch they may be right i think they may have even more reason to think so in the nottoodistant future here was my answer just a matter of minutes before in my hotel room i had been wondering how i could draw stukeys attention away from tom judge how i could prove once and for all that the murderer and the poet were the same person now i knew how i could prove it through deborah if say there was another murder and if a poem similar to the first one was found on the victim lets not talk about it she frowned but you wont write any more of those poems will you i think theyre bad for you i think they could be myself i said i certainly wouldnt care to have them become a matter of public knowledge deborah dont you worry darling she patted my thigh id never tell anyone now you just stop being sad hmmmm because theres nothing to be sad about now perhaps not i said how can one be sad when he has the sky and the stars to gaze upon and gods own green carpet to rest his aching arches mornings at seven deborah mornings at seven the hillsides dewpearled gods in his heaven alls right with the world thats awfully pretty brownie did you write that yes i said i did it under my pen name elizabeth khayyam i wrote it one eventide on a windswept hill while watching a father bird wing home to his wee ones there was a long caterpillar in his beak and he had it swung over his shoulders muffler fashion as a shield against the wintry cold i listen to me deborah for gods sake listen she had been laughing looking at me fondly now she went serious and she said no brownie whatever it is i dont want to hear it not tonight anyway but you just dont you dont know everything about me either whats the difference i just dont care brownie were together and were going to stay together and thats all that matters oh its so wonderful darling just think me finding you getting you back after i thought id lost you the only man in the world i could please i said i the worlds a hell of a big place and please please no no she said i wont listen i only know id die without you i dont want to hear anything that might i dont want to hear anything i dont need to it wouldnt matter nothing about her or you and her or it wouldnt matter brownie i i i wouldnt care if youd killed her she nodded firmly her eyes somehow cold yet burning up near the bar the jukebox suddenly began to blare shaking the walls with its clamor before someone turned down the control i took a cigarette from my package i lighted it and inhaled slowly stalling for time had the poetry meant anything to her had she been hinting giving me a warning when she said that it was bad for me did she know that i had killed ellen and probably she wouldnt care now that is if she did know she could rationalize that ellen was no good ellen would have had it coming to her ellen was nothing to her and i was everything but but what about later when she discovered that i was not everything that i was nothing that i was merely another blank page in her book of life how would blunt straighttothemark deborah chasen behave then she would have no use for me would she and i knew what her attitude was toward people for whom she had no use she was dead and i was so happy wasnt that what she had said perhaps i could tell her the truth and it would be all right but if it wasnt all right if she turned spiteful and vengeful id be sunk it would be too late to draw back too late to try to silence her id have lost the game and there wouldnt be another one so i tamped out my cigarette and swallowed the rest of my drink your fabulous fanny i said is it quite comfortable deborah then keep it where it is while i procure my car and carpetbag and we shall then head south into the dawn she let out a delighted squeal brownie you sweet funny but hadnt i better we will send for it i said whatever you need we will send foi deborah meanwhile with me providing a toothbrush and you providing yourself we shall want for nothing we shall have paradise now she smiled looking a little puzzled through the tenderness but she didnt argue she was right up on top of the load after a hard climb and she was going to do nothing to upset the applecart do you believe in a personal paradise i said a personal hell do you have a soul deborah hurry she said hurry as fast as you can darling we get in your car im going to take this girdle off i hurried but i was quite a little while at that because i had something more to do than get my car and check out at the club there was a hotel up the block and on the opposite side of the street i remembered its arrangements well from the days when i was working in los angeles and covered conventions there immediately inside the lobby entrance a staircase led to the mezzanine a little beyond the head of the stairs was the public stenographerss desk she wasnt there at this hour naturally but her typewriter a silent machine was and her wastebasket hadnt been emptied i sat down dipped into the basket and selected a discarded secondsheet with only a few lines at the top i creased it and tore them off i turned the paper into the typewriter the poem went very fast i suspect that i was lifting it at least in part from my original manuscript when i had finished i laid it on the desk and scrubbed both sides of the page with my handkerchief i folded it using the handkerchief picked it up with same and stuffed it into my pocket i am somewhat hazy in spots about the ride to pacific city but my general recollection is that she enjoyed it immensely not that i didnt although my mind was not exactly pleasurebent but i didnt matter i meant it to be her party and i believe it was a dilly the highway was practically barren of traffic i had had the foresight to lay in a plentiful supply of beverages and i saw to it that she sampled them generously we rode southward into the fog her laughter growing louder and louder she braced her feet against the dashboard and raised her hips off the seat trying to remove the girdle she tried it a half dozen times and each time shed barely get started when laughter overpowered her she flopped back in the seat snickering and sputtering and guffawing she hugged me around the hips giggling and choking shivering against me bbrownie you you sst ha ha ha ha yyou sstop nnow bbrownie you bray like a goddamned jackass deborah i said like a bitch baying at the moon bbrownie now thats not in ha ha ha ha shall i breed you deborah is your tail tingling my prize bitch ha ha ddont talk about ddogs brownie i i oh ddarling ha ha ha ha she was so wonderfully earthy and human eve before the apple circe with the giggles pompadour on a night off about thirty miles out of los angeles i turned the car onto the beach and got out i opened the door on her side and she lay back with her legs stuck out and her skirts up and i got a good twohanded grip on the girdle i gave a hell of a yank well i got rid of the thing the girdle and i found out something about her size however big she looked in certain places she wasnt actually it was simply the way she was built there just wasnt enough of her to be big as a man with some experience in such things id say that she couldnt have weighed much more than a hundred and ten pounds so i yanked thinking there was much more ballast than there was and the girdle skidded off of her my hands shot upward and backward flinging the girdle into the ocean i stumbled and fell flat on my back then she was out of the car and beside me she sat back looking down at me almost gravely and the sand felt peaceful and soft and warm and so did she youre very soft i said very soft and warm deborah i dont have any pants on she said i guess thats why i feel that way ill tell you something i said youll never die deborah there is no death in you only life so long as there is laughter so long as there is warmth and light so long as there is soft flesh fresh and sweetsmelling like no perfume ever made so long as there is a breast to cup and a thigh to caress youll live deborah youll never die thats awfully pretty she said want me to tell you something please do i said i dont care if i do die not now brownie not after tonight we drove on to pacific city we got to my shack just before dawn and i killed her i didnt kill her right away as a matter of fact it was that night more than sixteen hours later just as i was about to decide that i wasnt going to do it you see the twoway pull wasnt working as it should it was pulling on me trying to jerk me out into that other world but she was pulling too pulling me in the opposite direction and she was stronger than it was it was strange very how strong she was how one so small could be so strong i didnt believe that i could kill her i was afraid to do it i wasnt afraid of being caught you understand i was quite sure that i wouldnt be and since i am writing this some weeks later you are aware that i was not it was a fear away from and beyond the purely personal it was as though she were life itself the root of all life and when i killed it that her all life would vanish and i had visions of a parched and withering earth a vast and empty desert where a dead man walked through eternity i didnt think i could kill her it is hard to believe that i did even now now more than ever as i sit here alone in the courier city room and i am above selfdelusion and below reproach now when my one task is to set the record straight it is hard to believe that i did it i find myself thinking that there must have been someone else someone who knew about her and but of course i did do it the act of murder is not to be forgotten quickly and i remember the facts of this one well i did it but not then more than two thirds of a day passed in the meantime and i think you should be told about that i think we should keep her alive as long as we can i parked the car at the side of the house and we went inside she went to the bathroom while i drew the shades and then she came out and i went shed slept for about the last hour of the ride and she was fairly wide awake now she stood in the center of the livingroom smiling at me a little timidly as i came in and she said she bet she looked a sight didnt she awful i agreed and i gave her a kiss on the mouth and a small swat on the rear a hungover hussy if i ever saw one you must have a drink and pull yourself together oh uh she hesitated do you want a drink brownie it gags me to think of it i said but i shall force it down i will not let you drink alone i fixed us two whopping drinks and brought them in to the lounge she curled up at my side pulling my arm around her and we sat there drinking and talking and saying very little a train thundered by leaving the house atremble she pulled my arm tighter pressing my hand against her breast brownie youre youre not still afraid i mean you dont think it might not be all right i am sure it will be i said in such a package only quality could prevail no really darling if youre really i said honest and truly and you have your whole life to prove it to me mmmm she said and she wriggled promise me something brownie dont die before i do i wouldnt want to live without you darling without your love i promise i said and after a moment i added we will die together deborah that is the way it will be when you die i will die will you brownie would you really want to i dont think i said it will be a matter of wanting we drank i kept filling our glasses she asked me if my legs didnt get awfully stiff from driving and wasnt i awfully tired i said that they did indeed and that i didnt get so much tired as tense as soon as i got limbered up and relaxed a little brownie she said yes i nothing several minutes passes five or it might have been ten brownie yes nothing we went on drinking i began to have a hard time keeping up with her finally she mumbled something about getting a sleeping pill and she started to get up then she fell back letting her head slide down into my lap she stared up at me squinting drowsy and dizzy one of her fingers wobbled and wavered pointing at me yyou know what yyou jjus got one eye ppoor brownie ony got one eye the other one is turned inward i said it is examining my soul mmmm she mumbled jus just got her eyelids closed and her lips parted and stayed parted she slept i carried her into the bedroom and put her on the bed i loosened her brassiere took off her shoes and pulled the spread over her then i went back to the lounge i poured another drink but i didnt take it exhaustion suddenly overpowered me and in a split second i was sound asleep when i awakened the phone was ringing and she was kneeling at the side of the lounge shaking me i started to sit up i flopped back down again yawning and rubbing my eyes i looked at her dully wondering who she was and how she had got here the phone darling she said hadnt you better answer it phone its been ringing a long time brownie shall i answer it for you that brought me awake or much more awake than i was it brought back my memory i asked her the time and she said it was a quarter of three probably the paper i sat up yawning let em ring if they knew i was back theyd wonder why i hadnt come in might want me for something even this late all right brownie want to go back to sleep again yes no i said how about some coffee ive got some made darling ill get it right away she went out into the kitchen the phone stopped ringing i sat looking down at the floor at the blanket which must have been covering me it didnt necessarily mean anything neither it nor the fact that my shoes were off and the buckle of my belt unfastened when you have drunk as long and as much as i have you do a great many things without remembering or thinking about them just automatically frequently i have undressed and put myself to bed without ever knowing that i had done it so this the condition i had awakened in was doubtless more of the same but so long as she was awake it seemed like a good idea for me to be she might be getting curious she might become actively curious if she had the opportunity maybe she already had i washed while the coffee was heating and held brief and silent confab with that strange guy in the mirror he looked a little haggard this morning i suspected an incipient case of cirrhosis of soul but withal he seemed reasonably at peace he was strongly of the opinion that deborah should not be killed unnecessary my dear man he advised me i suspect as you did originally that she is not greatly endowed with sharpness she is not stupid of course she can be notsharp and notstupid also she is just a very natural very lovely very simple and straightforward woman yeah sure but she said a manner of speaking we all say things like that but assume that it was not let us say that she saw the connection between the poetry and ellens death it didnt change her love for you she went right on loving and trusting you would she then feeling about you as she does suddenly turn on you because of something you cannot help and to make another farfetched assumption suppose she did you have an airtight alibi havent you you couldnt have crossed the bay that night so what if she should i dont know i said i dont know to all the questions the deals so goddamned screwed up and and i cant take chances and theres tom judge i dont know why the hell they havent nabbed him already what about tom judge anyway the fact that theres another murder and another poem while hes in custody wont necessarily establish his innocence of the first one it will throw considerable doubt upon the matter of his guilt ill do the rest after i talk with mr lovelace and mr lovelace talks with mr stukey mr judge will be released and promptly weell i suppose so but want to make a small bet ill bet you dont kill her you cant you think not huh i know not you cant kill her brownie if she gets killed it wont be by you shed whipped up some toast and scrambled eggs along with the coffee and it tasted better than any food id eaten in a long time shed already had a bite she said but she had coffee with me we sat at the table smoking and drinking coffee making quite a bit of conversation but saying very little she hadnt slept a great deal she said shed had a hard time sleeping in recent years and had come to depend heavily on sleeping pills having taken none before retiring shed been pretty wakeful despite the booze we moved in to the lounge after a while and she sat with her legs drawn up her head resting against my shoulder brownie she said am i keeping you from anything if theres anything at all you have to do im doing it i said this is what most needs doing right now i thought you might get me that toothbrush if youre going out i could use one i may have to go out later on i said ill get whatever you need then it occurred to me suddenly that it might have been stukey calling a while before he might already have tom judge but no it wasnt likely it must have been the paper checking on me stukey wouldnt have stopped with a call knowing me as he did he would have come out to see if i was there we drank or rather i did deborah barely sipped at her glass the afternoon what there was left of it slipped away and darkness came and she never asked that we that we go deborah stirred lazily she stretched arching her breasts and stood up she asked me if i wouldnt like her to fix something to eat and i said well i would have to give the matter some thought we were discussing it when the phone rang i glanced at the clock seven straight up there wouldnt have been anyone at the paper for hours i picked up the receiver it was stukey we got him keed itll knock you flat when you hear who it is he told me who it was tom judge it did not surprise me in the least good god i said putting a good heavy exclamation mark behind the phrase its incredible i never liked the stupid jerk but i wouldnt have thought has he confessed yet stuke there aint hardly been time yet we just pulled him in but hes our boy all right pal he fits all the specifications and hes got that old guilty look written all over him and hes been identified of course by the cab driver weell no he hesitated the taxi angle didnt pan out we picked him up on an anonymous tip came in on the switchboard and that dumb ox we got workin there didnt trace what about his wife i said she admits he wasnt at home that night weell again a pause no but o course shes lyin hes it clint id swear to it on a stack of bibles how soonll you be down it was my turn to hesitate and i did lengthily then i let him hear an uncomfortable laugh this one kind of throws me stuke i said if it was anyone else but him another courier employee i you see what i mean theres no real evidence against him suppose you had to turn him loose and i had to go on working with the guy well yeah but keed i know this baby is you knew the same thing about me remember naw no i didnt he protested i couldnt find you anywhere and i figured you was the only one with a motive and and i was sore but i knew you hadnt done it as soon as i cooled off i didnt have that ol hunch like i got about this guy why hell clint i im not throwing it up to you i said im just pointing up the possibility that you might be wrong about judge i think id better steer clear of this for the moment stuke anyway unless judge cracks before then i want to talk with mr lovelace before i get personally involved well yeah he said grudgingly i see what you mean hed be damned sore you know if judge wasnt guilty hell probably be damned sore in any case the idea of a courier man being a murderer wont sit at all well with the old boy no there was a thoughtful silence i guess he wont like it much but looky keed i aint playing hotsytotsy with no murderer just because youre damned right youre not i said if you did youd have me on your tail all im saying is that id better keep out of the frammis until i talk to lovelace unless judge spills in the meantime you can hold him seventytwo hours cant you well sure but ill let it ride then i said ill talk to lovelace in the morning and get in touch with you afterward id do it tonight but we cant break the story before morning anyway and lovey gets pretty hot if hes bothered at night stukey grunted cursed under his breath he said well i sure as hell hate to what you think keed i ought to go pretty easy on this character until you get the word just kind of leave him alone and let him stew i wouldnt want to advise you i said i dont have much use for judge and well you know my own wife and all i might give you the wrong dope uhhuh sure well he sighed youll buzz me in the morning then as soon as i talk to lovelace we said good night and hung up i was reasonably confident that he would give tom little trouble tonight and by morning by morning she knelt down in front of me resting her elbows on my knees brownie is it is there something wrong they think theyve got the man who killed ellen i said one of the boys from the paper i its hard to believe that hes guilty poor brownie its just one thing after another isnt it want another drink darling something to eat no i said i dont think i do why dont you get out for a while darling ride around and get a little fresh air you must be getting awfully restless well i you do that brownie she cocked her head to one side smiling at me pretty please ill lie down while youre gone i grabbed her in my arms i hugged her burying my face in her hair god i said jesus god deborah if you only knew i do know she said you love me i love you i know that and thats enough i wish it was as simple as that i said i wish it is brownie it is that simple i kissed her i left the house and drove away i drove up on the hill first up into the italian section of town where i had a few drinks at a bar then i bought a bottle in a liquor store pulled the car onto a side street and sat there drinking alone in the dark i drank for a while i wondered about her about ellen about myself why i asked why had i done what i had to ellen that was a mere byphrase with her the you burn me up an imbecile would have known that and i was not by the most exaggerated estimate an imbecile i had had to kill her perhaps and perhaps i would have to kill deborah but the other was it because well hadnt she always been hysterically afraid of fires and deborah wasnt she morbidly afraid of dogs i tried to look at myself squarely to think the thing through i couldnt do it something kept getting in the way bending my vision around into a circle and while i was in that circle i was not of it it did not touch me between the man who wanted to look and the man to be looked at was a heavy curtain drawn of course by the inner man it was now after nine oclock i gave up the searching and started home i wasnt going to kill her i knew that much at least there was no need to no real reason and i wasnt and and suddenly there was a reason many of them and i was going to do it the twoway pull had me to itself all resistance had ended abruptly and i was swung far out into that other world there was nothing to hold me back it was as though she had suddenly ceased to exist i let the car coast into the yard quietly the motor stilled i eased the door of the house open silently i went in the kitchen had been cleaned up and the dishes put away the livingroom had been swept and put in order i hesitated looking around and it was ridiculous to feel that way in view of what i intended doing but i was troubled worried about her to have left her alone in this isolated railroadside shack shed have been helpless although shed have doubtless tried to fight and if thered been a scuffle the house might be like this put to rights and i went into the bedroom i heaved a sigh of relief she was all ri she was there stretched out on the bed on her stomach she was lying with her face in the pillow her arms akimbo on it the horsetail of corncolored hair hanging down to one side so quiet so peaceful and calm and trusting so quiet actually she must have been one of those nervous sleepers you could see how she had been balled up tight you could see it by the way the sheets were wrinkled and the mattress depressed now finally she had straightened out her body stretched out full length but she was still tense her fingers sticking out rigidly her whole body stiff unbending motionless thats how she lay there and i heaved a sigh of relief and i killed her i stood over her staring down studying her position the way her neck formed an unsupported bridge between the pillow and her shoulders i stooped down at her side balling my hand into a fist i raised it brought it down hard there was a dull pop and her neck sagged and her head bent backward i picked up her purse put the poem in it lifted her in my arms and carried her out to the car it was all right it was a game again i had been forced to play and with an inordinately heavy handicap and i had won and she perforce had lost but but already i was feeling the emptiness the lifelessness and off in the nottoodistant distance it began to move toward me the withered and dying world the vast and empty desert where a dead man walked through eternity i reached the dog pound i threw her over the wall i i am going to get through this part very quickly about the next morning that is the discovery of the body what was left of it and and so on i got through it rather well at the time i had the crutch of work pressure and tom judges situation and i had to do it and it was a game now however now i shall have to get it over with quickly i must do so the story broke about five minutes before deadline and i handled it it was short thank god the paper was already made up and there was only one brief yarn that the news editor could yank so this one had to be short also there wasnt a whole lot to say for that matter since the body had only been discovered a few minutes before those halfstarved dogs were always fighting and raising hell and the peablossoms the old couple hadnt investigated the racket until morning by that time of course there wasnt much left of well theyd identified her by the contents of her purse by among other things a nearly empty box of sleeping pills with her name on it i say theyd done it meaning the cops not the peablossoms theyd also found the poem in her purse there was no way of knowing how long shed been dead whether shed been killed there and tossed into the stockade or whether shed been brought there after being killed the only clue to the murderer was the poem the peablossoms hadnt heard a car during the night but then they wouldnt have heard one with the dogs carrying on there were a great many footprints and tire tracks around the place far too many to be of value as clues well i wrote the story then dave and i were called into lovelaces office for a conference he was in a very bad humor and he took it out on dave this judge fellow hed always known he was no good shouldve been fired long before dave shouldve fired him now he was a murder suspect a courier man under arrest for murder shocking inexcusable and deborah chasen that woman she it appeared was also daves fault an editor was supposed to know what was going on wasnt he he was supposed to have news sources people who kept him informed well why then hadnt dave kept track of her a woman posing as a friend of the lovelaces shouldve known she was back in town shouldve known shed get into trouble now shed been killed a woman identified with the proud name of lovelace and shocking inexcusable very bad management randall dave took it squirming and sweating and trying to protest finally he escaped rather he was called out to the desk and i had a chance to work obviously the two murders ellens and deborahs had been committed by the same person the poems established that fact certainly two such poems in the possession of two mysteriously murdered women could not be mere coincidence the man hated them the hard murderous hate shone through the lines so i bore down on the poems so heavily that i almost believed what i said but i dont need to explain all this to you sir i said you felt that the colonel needed a good jacking up and you took this opportunity of delivering it of making him sweat a little if youll excuse the expression but you can see that judge couldnt be guilty he was in jail at the time of the second murder therefore he couldnt possibly be guilty of either one thats your opinion isnt it sir ive stated your own thoughts correctly you feel that judge the courier is in no way involved in this scandal it was it appeared exactly the way he felt i had stated his own thoughts perfectly and he complimented me on my astuteness very uh shrewd of you brown couldnt have put the matter more clearly myself but this this chasen woman i was coming to that sir when you call detective stukey about judge you were going to do that right away i suppose after all a courier man shouldnt certainly he snapped demand his immediate release cant think what the police department is coming to to make such a ghastly error well i went on i was thinking you might clarify mrs chasens position while you were talking to stukey we have our duty to the public sir we cant allow baseless rumors to get into circulation as i see it regardless of her claims mrs chasen was not a friend she was not even an acquaintance in the accepted sense of the term it seems to me sir that she was merely another visitor to the building one of the many sightseers who come here yearly to exactly thats exactly the case mr brown dont know why i uh ill call stukey immediately he called and stukey was far from pleased from what i could gather but he didnt have any evidence against tom and he hadnt been able to make him talk and there was no small amount of logic in lovelaces opinion about the connection between the two murders moreover most important of course was the fact that lovelace was lovelace you didnt say no to him if you could avoid it stukey had no grounds for avoiding it so tom was promptly released and fired almost as promptly just as soon as he could be reached by phone hed not been a very good worker to begin with and now hed had the bad judgment to get himself arrested and but we dont need to go this fast we can slow down a little now i talked a while longer restating mr lovelaces thoughts for him he frowned a trifle but he was forced to admit that i had voiced them perfectly uh yes must be done i suppose public duty and all of course the murderer may have left the city im positive he hasnt i said as sure as im sitting here sir hes still in town yes uh probably doubtless have to get him eh see that this stukey fellow uh keeps out the uh dragnet continues the cleanup right i told him his mind worked like a steel trap i dont know how you do it sir i mean see right through to the point of things you think ahem you really think i do mr brown like a steel trap i repeated firmly dave was just heading for lovelaces office as i came out and i thought he appeared somewhat chagrined when he learned that everything had been settled without him along with the chagrin however was considerable relief at getting the old man off his neck and he seemed pleased at the latters instructions to fire tom judge i should have done it long ago he nodded just didnt have the heart now its out of my hands i started toward my desk he touched me on the arm by the way brownie you spent the better part of a day with mrs chasen youre right i said it all comes back to me now that you mention it im not trying to pry but you thought quite a bit of her didnt you i got the impression that you were pretty annoyed with lovelaces references to her i loved her colonel i said her image is permanently graven on my heart i could have gone for her in a large way if unfortunately i had not lacked certain essential equipment he winced managed a sympathetic smile well well put someone else on this one you keep out of the office today go out to the fort theyre having maneuvers with a lot of vips present you phone in the story maybe an interview or two if its convenient and dont show back here until tomorrow i was startled almost to the point of speechlessness my absence would leave the office seriously undermanned and stukey would certainly want to talk to me to send me off for the day on a relatively unimportant story was virtually idiocy or something you go on dave repeated firmly in answer to my puzzled mumblings ive got a guy coming in used to work on the labor rag here before it folded and stukey can wait he wont know what the hell to do anyway and i can probably give him about as much dope on mrs chasen as you can but colonel i stared at him frowning still too stunned for proper speech i i dont believe i dont want stukey bothering you thats one reason im getting you out of here now go on and take it easy and and look how about that dinner tonight come on out to the house about six huh i said i would i wanted to talk to the colonel outside of the office with its many interruptions there was a terrible price attached to the privilege but i believed it would be worth it broadly speaking of course in actuality there was no proper compensation for the torture of an evening with kay randall i drove out to the fort leisurely wondering how if i ever found the opportunity i should polish kay off the most appropriate way i felt would be to hit her with a father she always called dave father and i think that any wife under sixty who does that should be hit with one again and this would be especially fitting she might be drowned in mayonnaise kay cooked with mayonnaise it was her rod and her staff kitchenwise mayonnaise was to kay as can opener is to newlywed i felt reasonably sure that she had whole hogsheads of the stuff concealed in the cellar if one could surprise her at just the right moment catch her while she was dipping out a couple of tengallon pails for the evening meal well but probably she had become immune to it probably she could breathe in it as a fish breathes in water in any event there were other ways and all very pleasant to contemplate one might ash tray her to death for example you could place her at the end of a vast room while you sat at the other end and you would be equipped with unlimited cigarettes and a thimblesize ash tray and she with a pair of binoculars then well perhaps your own experience will allow you to imagine the rest driven by an insane urge kay would have to empty the tray each time you dropped a speck of ash in it and each time before returning to her post she would have to give you a bright little smile and say my you do smoke a lot dont you as soon as she returned to her post of course you would drop ashes again and kay would no no it was nice to think about but it would never work kay had been in training too long there might be ways of running her to death but you could never do it with the ashtray routine probably no one method would be adequate to dispose of her for that matter you would have to use a combination of all available means you might say join the several hundred doilies and antimacassars in the livingroom into a sack fill it with mayonnaise and tie it over kays head then you could remove her shoes and start dropping ashes on her feet and kay hell to hell with kay how could i think of kay when deborah but i couldnt think about deborah either i was afraid to think about her i arrived at the fort and repaired to the publicrelations office except for brief intervals i stayed there until quitting time sprawled out on a lounge within reaching distance of the bar the story wasnt worth my time the pr men could cover it better than i could and i felt that they should pr men dont work enough they are always pushing you to take a story and when you agree they let it slide and come at you with something else they will give you pictures yes possibly some you can use if you are real hard up they will set up interviews yes possibly with someone quite well known in his own neighborhood but stories no they can talk story but they can never give you one some strange psychological quirk keeps them from carrying through however i got them to work and they produced a fairly good story on the maneuvers as well as two interviews with the vips you can do it men i said as i swung open the doors of the bar you have lingered in the nest too long and now you must fly begone and do not return without youknowwhat otherwise no word anent this occasion shall creep into the courier and your asses shall be ashes it was what they needed firm words and a steely eye they tottered away nervous but determined and they returned triumphant i called their stuff in to the desk at three oclock i sent in some pictures for overnight and knocked off i went home and cleaned up taking no more time about it than i had to then i went to a bar and stayed until a quarter of six when i started for daves house until the last six months or so they had been living in a comfortable apartment at a surprisingly reasonable rental but kay had wanted a little place of their very own so they had got this thing it was little all right all bright new paint and shiny doorknobs and rooms approximately the size of packing crates but it was a very long way from being theirs by the time dave paid off the mortgage his two kiddies four and six would be well past the voting age kay knew that i wanted to see the little ones so i was taken in for a look immediately and that i could have done without the little boy the oldest had said a naughty word it seemed and the little girl had repeated it after him kay beamed down at them primly commanding them to confess their evil to me the confessed sniffling and rubbing their eyes and mother had to punish you didnt she she had to wash your mouths out with soap they admitted it also that poor mother had been hurt by the punishment much worse than they well the poor little devils had got one break anyway theyd been put to bed without any dinner we left and kay led me up the hall to the bathroom where she was sure i wanted to wash my hands just my mind i said ive been thinking some naughty thoughts oh you youre so funny clint she laughed and her eyes said the hell you are bud we went into the livingroom kay produced two handcut glasses and a bottle of sixtycent sherry and gave dave and me a drink she waited standing poised to snatch the glasses from our hands the moment we were finished we did and she did and dinner was served it was mayonnaise and something else something i couldnt immediately identify it was served on individual plates of haviland china well father kay smiled at dave firmly how do you like it dave mumbled that it was very good slanting an apologetic glance at me afraid we should have given you something else brownie youd probably have preferred a steak oh of course he wouldnt kay laughed clinton can eat steak any time how do you like it clint id like to have the recipe i said i dont believe ive ever eaten rubber gloves prepared in quite this way her eyes flashed but she went right on laughing she was a laughing little woman this kay a joyous little mother silly you cant tease me clinton brown its iced frankfurters in hot mayonnaiseparsnip ring no i said i dont believe it mmmmhmmm thats what it is clint dave frowned if you dont now you just leave clinton alone father he can speak for himself its wonderful i said i dont know how you do it kay she wasnt kidding me any not a goddamned bit there couldnt be such a thing as iced frankfurters in hot mayonnaiseparsnip ring this was just what id thought rubber gloves in hand lotion with chopped sponge dressing i ate quite a bit of the stuff id had almost nothing to eat since deborah since the day before and i was hungry it was going to make me sick i could feel the sickness coming on but i went ahead and ate kay brought coffee and something called marshmallow grape surprise i wasnt up to any further surprise nor was dave apparently so she ate her dessert alone oh clinton she said lapping up the last bite of the mess you didnt get our flowers did you i mean the ones we sent to the funeral kay dave squirmed now father i just asked clinton a simple question i know he couldnt have got them we didnt get any card of acknowledgment she smiled at me wideeyed i said i couldnt understand why she hadnt got the card i sent it registered mail i said registered with return receipt requested yyou she stammered you did are you sure the kiddies didnt get hold of it i said they might have mistaken it for a naughty picture clint said dave i was getting tired tired and damned sick i got the flowers i said and thank you very very much thank you for all your kindness kay incidentally i hope you werent disturbed when the police called here that night i could never forgive myself if you were the police kay looked blank the police didnt call here a man named stukey he called here trying to locate me not here he didnt i was home all oh her face cleared father was at the chamber of commerce banquet that night the answering service must have referred the call there answering service i looked at dave i thought mmmmhmmm said kay its awfully convenient for father when he has to be away from home at night he just gives them the number of the place where hell be and they call there direct just as though it were his own number i mean when this number is dialed they automatically call the other very interesting but suppose it was someone who wanted to talk to you oh i never take any calls in the evening all my acquaintances know that i keep my evenings free for father and the kiddies that figured all right she could give her undivided attention to making them miserable of course its one more expense and i well she sighed bravely goodness knows we dont have a penny to spare it seems were always having company and well anyway i feel that it just cant be avoided with father away so much lets see where did you have to go last night father the rotary club wasnt it uh yes dave muttered and he lifted his coffee cup his hand trembled his eyes wouldnt meet mine thered been no rotary club meeting last night thered been no chamber of commerce banquet on the night that ellen was killed i pushed back my chair and stood up im going to have to go i said im i dont feel very well oh no youre not kay cried gaily were going to keep him right here arent we father were going to keep this big bad ol clinty right here where we can sorry i said and thanks for the dinner i have to go i started to turn away from the table she jumped up and flung her arms around me from the rear hugging me around the waist help me father you know what he wants to do hes going off to some dirty ol bar and i brought an elbow back suddenly she grunted and reeled backward batting her fat little head against the wall ffather she whimpered hhe he i saw it dave was looking at me at last very white around the mouth get out clint ive put with ive tried to to get out out of your house father i said out of your life out of your journalistic sphere could you possibly mean that i am fired colonel clint im asking you to i thought you were telling me i said am i fired colonel yes he yelled yes now get out i got out i couldnt have stayed another minute if id been paid to i headed for the car halfdoubled over a thousand hot knives twisting in my stomach i started vomiting and i am an old hand at that game a charter member of the heaveit league but this was in a class by itself i drove homeward my head necessarily out the window all the way and i was going as strong when i got there as when i had started there wasnt anything in me but the heaving went right on i uncorked a bottle and upended it into my mouth the stuff wasnt halfway down before it started bouncing i choked and made another try the same thing happened and more a great hand seemed to grab me in the guts and squeeze the bottle fell from my hands i fell to the floor writhing that one passed that convulsion but there were indications that others were on the way i staggered into the bedroom jerked open the bureau drawers i knew what i had to do but there was something else i had to do first get into some pajamas a pair with all the buttons and no holes even then there was a chance that they might see but but i had to risk it i knew id die if i didnt i was struggling to get my pants over the pajamas when stukey arrived he gave me one startled glance then with none of the questions asked which he had doubtless come to ask he started helping me with the pants jesus keed he panted come on let the screwin clothes go ill take you in my car open up the siren you got any particular place in mind any of them i said any hospital jesus he pulled my arm around his shoulders lugged me toward the door whend it hit you pal what done it i rubber gloves i said an original recipe ats the ol keed the brownie boy he said pile it in pal as you have probably guessed it was a case of acute food poisoning one of the more painful and dangerous kinds since it was the result of spoiled meat the franks had had pork in them and bad pork can be deadly fortunately id expelled the stuff quickly and id wasted no time in getting to the hospital where my stomach was washed and penicillin administered such crisis as may have existed was over within an hour or so my insides were sore as a blister and i hardly had the strength to raise a hand but i was out of danger i was in the hospital two days very dreary ones since the authorities made drinking difficult for me and sometimes impossible there was little to do except lie there and think endlessly unproductively unpleasantly to chase myself around and around in that unbroken seamless circle kay well of course shed done it deliberately id had a standing dinner invitation for weeks and shed known that id come eventually so a few franks just enough for me had been allowed to spoil and their rottenness disguised with more slop id eaten them yes she must have done it deliberately or so i believed and i will admit to some slight prejudice where kay is concerned but just what her motivation had been i was not sure was it merely some more of her sheer orneriness a typical kay randall stunt had the little woman only been demonstrating that regardless of poor ol softiefathers feelings she had no use for me and id better behave if i didnt want to catch whatfor that was probably the case and to be fair to her a painful necessity she probably had had no intention of killing me dave told her everything practically or rather she wormed everything out of him in long jolly evenings beside the mayonnaise bowl she would sit him down amid the antimacassars and pull his sweet ol funny head into the environs of her cute little old belly button and then father would simply have to tell her what was on his mind she would be very hurt if he did not she would be afraid he didnt love her any more and when kay felt that way as father well knew the aforesaid environs went out of bounds there were no larksome expeditions thereto nor invasions thereof nor maneuvers thereon so father who was already yearning for a brisk patrol with a barrage at the end would tell all he would say well its brownie dammit i dont mind personally but im afraid mr lovelace will and kays eyes would grow moist and her mind murderous and she would say oh how awful perhaps if we showed more interest in clinton invited him out for a good homecooked meal exit father and mother to bedroom enter frankfurters parsnips mayonnaise and clinton brown that must have been the deal kay had given clint a lesson and clint would know that he had had one he i would know that the poisoning had been intentional and take the hint i was to lay off of father or else so but there was tom judge what he had told me and there was the fact that dave had been away from home on those two nights that he had lied about his whereabouts and let me think at least in the instance of ellen that he had been at home then there was that reef connecting the mainland and the island and a lone taxicab crossing the border and and most of all there was deborah that strange feeling id had about her that i could never have did i say yes did i say that it did make sense i did not i didnt pretend to know what it all meant if it meant anything nevertheless it existed so much to be explained and i had been poisoned i had almost been killed i went round and round the circle thinking trying to look into myself where the clue to the mystery probably lay what had i overlooked what small factoi that kept me from seeing what i should see i didnt know i dont know now now when this manuscript is approximately two thirds finished and its pages flow higgledypiggledy over my desk but i can tell you this my good friends oh yes and you sorry ignominious foes i have a strong hunch that i will know before it comes time to type or and my hunch tells me that i will be quite as much surprised as you are now perhaps a few words about the doctor are in order i had slept almost none at all the first night but promptly at seven oclock a nurse came in and induced me to wash and presented me with a breakfast tray she was a grimly prim little person unpleasantly reminiscent of kay randall she crisply advised me that i was to partake of the food at once and that it would do me a lot of good i replied that it was just such victuals as these that had put me where i was and that the burned child shuns the fire we were discussing the matter ie the digestibility of cold oatmeal skim milk and stale toast when the doctor came in he told the nurse to leave the tray i could eat or go hungry just as i pleased she left and without preliminary he asked me how much whisky i drank a day i replied that i never kept track of it youd better start in he said curtly the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream now would be lethal for the average person i cant answer for the results if you keep on going as youve been doing thats fair enough i said after all i dont believe i consulted you in the matter may i ask a question doctor he nodded flushing an angry glint in his eye if you make it snappy its a question thats frequently arisen in my mind when coming in contact with the medical profession briefly if treating the sick annoys you so much why dont you get into another racket all right he turned on his heel ive warned you and im telling you this too youll do no drinking while youre here you can crack up and go into dts thats up to you but you wont do it in this hospital he stalked out righteously a trueblue man of mercy a man who took no nonsense from the people who paid him around nine oclock in the morning stukey arrived i thanked him for his help the night before i demanded the pint which i felt sure was responsible for the bulge in his coat well look keed he hesitated they told me downstairs that they are insane i said feebleminded a few of the worst mental cases allowed to play hospital as occupational therapy my word on it stuke also my hand place the pint in it yeah but pal if its going to did it ever have i ever been noticeably affected by it give my friend he gave it to me watching the door anxiously as i drank i had a small one no more than a third at most and tucked the bottle under my pillow now i said now you will have some questions yeah he nodded tiredly i guess goddammit to hell anyway he didnt get down to the questions immediately he was sore about having to let tom judge go and the dragnet wasnt producing anything and he knew it wasnt going to and he was completely baffled as to how to proceed i told him to keep a high heart honest effort was never lost if nothing else resulted from the investigation we would at least have a clean city yeah he looked at me oddly a lot of fun aint it weell i said i do believe there are slight overtones of humor uhhuh sure real funny all right i try to be a pal to you an perhaps i can be one to you i said i was down to mexico the other day and i learned about a reef i know all about it hell there was waves running ten feet high over the damned thing a guy tried to cross that and hedve wound up in key west still its within the realm of possibility i said that realm i dont know nothing about maybe they got a bay up there too and a guy who couldve swum across it in the storm is that an innuendo stuke are you returning to your original evil suspicions he grinned sheepishly and shook his head lay off will you how many times i got to apologize i was sore and i wasnt thinkin straight and well to hell with it what dyou know about this mrs chasen something special i said something extra special stuke i wanted to bring her down to the police station that day but she wouldnt go afraid youd want to fingerprint her i believe very broadly speaking and her rear end was tender from previous attempts no foolin keed where i drove her around for the better part of a day i fed her lunch booze and put her on the train you took her out to the dog pound and back with many a pleasant way stop along the lonely route as i say stuke she was quite a dish a wonderful partner in the ancient and honorable pastime of parking he sat staring at me steadily for a second he frowned and said yeah but keed then he shrugged and went on you know she was supposed to take a boat to europe well how come she didnt instead of hangin around la doubtless she was in love with me i said she couldnt leave california as long as i was in it of course wed only known one another for less than a day but cut it out brownie whatd she say when you saw her in la now now stuke puhlease okay so you didnt see her didnt talk to her either i suppose i did not i said the record of her call to the press club is an outrageous forgery one more link in a communist plan to do me in stukey grinned reluctantly no offense keed just habit i even try to trip myself up whatd she call you about about ellen you know to say that she was sorry and so on yeah what else oh just to say that she loved me and there could never be another man in her life and always clownin he sighed she didnt mention any other guy someone that could have brought her back here or she mightve come back here to see no she didnt as i mentioned a moment ago there could be no other man where she was concerned keed he said im beggin you be serious huh this thing has got me runnin in circles the autopsy well maybe it wouldnt have told us nothin anyway but even that nothin would have been some help we couldve found out what didnt happen to her if wed had anything halfway like a corpus an an its all like that keed just nothin to work on theres fifty buses into here a day and six trains and four airplane flights an how the hell you goin to know when she got here or whether she came alone or or what im telling you let me tell you how it stands i got a couple of pretty good pictures of her from her hometown paper and we duped a batch and showed em around well up to date we got her placed on eight buses and one train and theres a truck driver that swears she tried to thumb a ride out of long beach with him i opened the bottle and had another drink i offered him my deepest sympathy just keep striving stuke i said your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground im laughin he said its funny as hell this is on top of everything else i got those bollixing poems all the something i got is something to screw me up you dont think theyre a clue i said clues schmooz sure theyre a clue and what the hell you goin to do with it the guys got a head on him hes sharp like tacks he aint a money killer thats your clue an you can buy it cheap it aint givin me nothing but ulcers terrible i said now wait a minute stuke im not laugh well he shrugged and stood up i wish i could whynt you kill that jug sos i can take it with me i took the last drink and handed him the bottle he trudged out drearily his snappy hat pulled low over his eyes a pronounced sag in the shoulders of his suit i was a little ashamed for having laughed at him and id honestly tried not to but i hadnt been able to help it poor stuke lord of the pimps and bookies terror of the panhandlers stukey stripped of his last penny of graft and with no prospects but hard work no graft no glory nothing but having to earn his salary if he hoped to keep drawing it poor lem i couldnt help laughing pathetic as he was he returned that night with another pint and the next morning ditto not officially it wasnt business keed he said he just happened to be out this way and figured i could use a little company he came out saturday morning and drove me home and he remained to visit there with rather startling even alarming results you see i was getting just a little weary of him i had had several hours of his moaning and groaning in a mere fortyeight and but lets move back a bit back to the hospital and thursday stukey didnt know about my trouble with dave so as a friendly act hed left word of my illness at the office he hadnt talked with dave just the switchboard operator but i knew that dave would be informed as soon as he arrived at work and i was frankly worried when he didnt call it was just possible that he had fired me that he intended to make it stick or try to and i knew what would happen if he did lovelace was already a little down on dave just as he was very much up on me hed never let dave fire me hed insist that i be taken back moreover hed credit dave with one more error in judgment one more than dave could comfortably stand and if dave got stubborn hed be fired himself i didnt want that i didnt want his position made so shaky that he might fall out of it not yet anyway status quo with naturally reasonable deviations that would do me for the present it was almost noon before he did call but the delay was not it developed due to stubbornness or a lastditch struggle with lovelace it was just that he had difficult and embarrassing things to say and he had put off saying them as long as possible brownie he began i are you all right i mmeant to call you earlier but i thought you might be asleep and the nurse said you were fine a true conservative i said i hope her noncommittal prognosis didnt upset you brownie look fellow as a matter of fact colonel i am doing as well as could be expected a little light in the abdominal area but then i have been for several years one of those things you know or rather the absence of one of those things i yes colonel about last night brownie i that was all my fault you were deathly sick and she we tried to prevent you from leaving im sorry and im sure youre sorry why dont we just say the whole thing never happened all of it the climactic scene where we faced one another across the marshmallow grape surprise our stomachs growling in agony and bitter frankfurterflavored burps on our lips brownie he laughed nervously i well of course you know you arent fired id never have said it if if you hadnt practically forced me to im not saying that i wasnt at fault too but lets just lay it to mayonnaise nerves i said ill be ready to return to work monday colonel according to the latest dispatch so if youre positive you didnt mean it of course i didnt mean it my god brownie how could we break up after all the years weve been together i he hesitated and cleared his throat i have tried to be a friend brownie i i know how you feel about that the accident and ive tried to make up for it the best i could i look will you do me a very great favor such as eating a nice homecooked meal practically anything but that colonel its about lovelace what i want you to tell him about about why youre off work yes i said and suddenly i was frowning just what am i supposed to tell him i had to do it brownie i his voice broke and picked up again shamed embarrassed i maybe it wasnt necessary but i was afraid to take the chance you know how hes been toward me lately and he he and his wife have been down on kay ever since well you can guess they spent an evening with us too i just couldnt risk it clint im head over heels in debt and lets have it colonel i said i didnt damned near die of rotten meat served up by the mayonnaise queen so what is the ailment that keeps me from work at a time when im badly needed creeping clap too much marijuana a slight case of please clint dont make me feel any cheaper than i do already tell me i said and tell me what i do if lovelace decides to check up he wont i told him it was nothing serious but you were supposed to have absolute rest for a few days thats not too far from the truth is it brownie you do need a rest youve been under a terrific emotional strain old reporters home i said roll wide your doors and trundle out the straitjacket here comes brownie all right clint have your own way about it if you dont know me well enough by this time to oh i do colonel i said i dont doubt your motives in the slightest until monday then eh when i shall stagger wan and wildeyed into the courier city room clint i wish you didnt feel so do i i said and a very good morning to you colonel i hung up i dug under the pillow for the bottle before i remembered that it wasnt there well i didnt have to have a drink i could use one but i didnt have to have it my hand wandered under the pillow again and i jerked it back with a suddenness that set the fingers to tingling damn the bottle damn dave yes and a doubledamn for clinton brown dave couldnt hurt me with lovelace he hadnt tried to get me in trouble only to keep himself out of it but still i wished he hadnt done this it didnt mean anything that answeringservice deal didnt mean anything nor the reef nor the cab across the border nor none of them meant a thing by itself but when you put them all together meaningless even then they still added up to nothing that i could see but i wished he hadnt done this i was halfstarved by saturday morning and i made the mistake of saying so as lem stukey drove me home he knew exactly what i needed stuke did it seemed that his middle name was grub he was a chow hound from way back his old lady his mother had taught him how to cook when she wasnt busy droppin another kid and he was kinda hungry himself hed been screwing around on this case for goddamned near twentyfour hours straight and some chow would fit right into the old spot it was no trouble at all keed honest we was pals wasnt we and he wanted to eat himself anyway he didnt have a thing to do he was already half nuts from this screwy deal and he was going to have to pull out a while jesus a guy couldnt keep goin night and day could he a guy was entitled to eat wasnt he and he wasnt gettin nowhere nohow just puttin out and not gettin a goddamned thing back we got to the house and he lugged the stuff hed bought into the kitchen i wasnt to do a thing he insisted i was to park it and let it rest and hed take care of everything he hung his coat over the back of a chair tucked an apron into the belt of his highwaisted pants and rolled up the sleeves of his striped silk shirt i lingered a moment watching him he studied the various packages his hands absently stroking his oily black hair then he nodded deciding to begin with the steaks he unwrapped them and his polished nails trailed over them lovingly aint that something keed you ever whats the matter pal you dont like em they look wonderful i said i was just reminded suddenly that i was out of salad oil not now you aint i got some i got everything we need keed so you just park it and leave the chow to me i went into the living room taking a bottle with me i parked it i was being needlessly finicky i supposed that was probably salad oil on lems hair entirely edible and harmless as for the nail polish well it would cook off the fire would take care of it i called that i was going to take a bath and lem called back to go right ahead there was plenty of time you tried to hurry good chow and youd screw it up sure as hell i wished he wouldnt use that word at least in connection with food more than that i wished hed clear out i wondered why he was hanging around i took a quick cold shower necessarily having to dress and undress in the bathroom i got the cuffs of my pants wet and they clung irritatingly around my ankles i began to feel a little toward stuke as i felt toward kay randall i went back to the livingroom and picked up the bottle we ate in there the livingroom my food on the coffee table stukes on one of the kitchen chairs with another chair pulled up in front of it it was very good i forgot all about the hair oil and the nail polish almost all about it i ate stealing a glance now and then at stukey he was tackling the food with both hands stuffing it down eating as though it might be snatched away from him it made me wince a little to watch him i felt a faint twinge of sickness that was not entirely of the stomach you mentioned your mother a while ago i said something about your family you came from a large one well he gulped swallowed and stabbed another piece of steak kind of six boys and three girls yeah gulp they was nine of us one right behind the other they used to call us the stairsteps over at the ol sixthward school you mean you mean this is your home where you were born i dont know why i was startled by this idea somehow i yeah yeah we was all born and raised here not the old folks yknow but all us kids was all livin here right now no i said no they are not stukey and i say that as a close student of the city payroll he choked on a mouthful of salad chuckled you off the record keed off the record well you look for stowe sometime or sutton or sutke or les see i guess thats about the crop countin the two stowes the girls is married and dont hold jobs he forked more steak and stacked salad on top of it he nodded to me seriously theres nothin crooked about it you understand course i got em all in with the city but there aint nothin funny about the names we just couldnt use the other see and we kind of switched it around to suit ourselves you ever hear of a goddamned name with two zs and an x in it i said i had been spared that your parents are they still living yeah theyre still around i you didnt know that i thought you knew i lived with em kind of funny aint it i mean you see a guy day in and day out and it comes up you dont know hardly nothin about him yes i said yes that is strange stuke yeah i got a couple acres out on west road gives the old man some place to screw around he never had no trade ysee he was a farmer in the old country and about all he could do over here was yard work spading up gardens an mowing lawns an trimming hedges and stuff like that he stukey swallowed and laughed suddenly jesus i just remembered something yes i said share it with me stuke sure his eyes brimmed with laughter i wonder what in the hell made me think of it why christ it mustve been almost thirty years ago i was yeah i was just about seven an or was it eight well anyway the old man was working on a place out in hacienda hills an this dame the lady of the house finds herself short a diamond brooch shed just misplaced the damn thing you know and she found it the same day but meanwhile she just knows the old man hooked it and she calls the cops on him an ha ha jesus keed ha ha ha ha he paused and brushed the tears from his eyes he went on he couldnt talk english see just maybe a few words he didnt know what it was all about an he was scared as hell naturally and all he could think of to do was keep his mouth shut well ha ha you know how that would sit with the cops they dragged him out in the garage of this place and they took turns workin on him hit him with everything they could lay hands on hoehandles rakes spades every goddamned thing if that dame hadnt found her brooch an hour later theydve broken every hand tool on the place you never seen nothin like it clint the old man was black and blue for the next three months and thats funny i said you can laugh about that cryins better what the hell the old man thought it was a good joke too but i aint told you all of it the cops was kind of worried an sorry about makin the mistake so they brought him out to the house and helped the old lady put him to bed they were pretty good guys it turned out kind of tough and stupid maybe but they wasnt makin no one trouble just for the hell of it they turned out their pockets before they left gave the old man every nickel they had came to almost four bucks in all i set my coffee cup down and leaned forward on the lounge stuke i said lem how in the name of god just how with an example like that before you can you be like you are i dont dig you keed a puzzled frown wrinkled his forehead how you mean what example let it go i said what could i mean they gave your father four bucks and that was that that fixed up everything yeah it kind of did stuke nodded the old man took the dough and started to night school learned to talk english real good i couldnt say why i was annoyed by the story i couldnt say for that matter that the story was the source of my annoyance probably it was stukey i was tired and drowsy i had much on my mind i wanted to be alone and there seemed to be no immediate prospect of that he showed no signs of leaving he sat with his chair tilted back against the wall the pointed toes of his shoes hooked through the rungs he was looking down at the food plates frowning thoughtfully and picking at his teeth with a match he raised his eyes slowly letting them come to rest on me he stared at me frowning so deep in thought apparently that he was unaware of his stare he must have studied me for several minutes the small bright eyes never shifting from my face i coughed and cleared my throat and he gave a little start but he continued to look at me and his frown deepened look brownie whats it all about anyhow a very good question i said but im afraid i cant give you the answer offhand i suggest that you consult an encyclopedia the a to z section why keed why you doin it to me we aint goin to pull this guy in in no dragnet you know we aint all this all its gettin is me not solely i said so so were gettin rid of the hustlers and fast boys were cleanin things up what does that mean to you that i said would probably be impossible for you to understand my friend im not implying of course that you are not a highly sentient and understanding soul i wouldnt think of doing that old pals that we are he grinned feebly letting the chair legs down to the floor always clownin he grumbled all the time clownin just the same keed whynt you give it a rest it aint doin you no good if you ask me its gettin to where you dont seem to feel right no more unless youre yes i said for he had abruptly cut off the sentence and there was a trace of furtiveness about him you were about to say nothin he shrugged whats the difference i got two murders on my hands i couldnt lay off of em even if you wasnt pokin at me but youd much sooner i wouldnt poke wouldnt you i said you could be much more leisurely about your investigation and you could drop it at your own convenience well he began another shrug then looked at me in sudden alarm now wait a min ute keed that aint very nice is it you make it sound like like the tiredness and drowsiness had dropped from me like a robe i was still irritated with him but i was no longer in any hurry to have him leave i was just thinking i said about ellen wondering about her do you suppose someone had her come back here sent her the money to come on i how you mean whod want to do that who indeed but it should be easy to find out dont you think the person wouldnt have sent her cash at least i dont believe he would and i doubt very much if hedve sent anything as potentially incriminating as a check so that leaves us money orders records of which naturally should be readily available to us why dont you look into them or would you like to have me do it that he hesitated that wouldnt prove nothin just because he sent her some dough weell i said i think it might stuke particularly if he didnt have a satisfactory explanation for his whereabouts at the time of the murder or murders maybe he couldnt give no good alibi without foulin himself up maybe he was bedded down with a doll or something like that maybe his tongue flicked over his lips maybe the people who could alibi for him are sore at him now he mightve had to push em around since then and theyd like to see him stuck i leaned back against the wall folding my hands behind my head but you agree that she might have been sent some money by one of our local residents why do you suppose he did it stuke whats the difference what if i told could tell you you wouldnt believe me oh come now i said you mean one old pal wouldnt believe another old pal why dont you ill tell you he said ill tell you this brownie youre going to forget all about anyone sendin her a money order you aint going to nose around them moneyorder records a goddamned bit you been pushin me all over the map keed and i been takin it an it kind of looks like i got to keep on takin it for a while but this way huhuh we dont go no further in this direction he had moved over in front of me as he talked and now he was looking straight down into my face he didnt appear threatening only intensely deadly serious im going to drop it eh i said just what makes you so sure of that stuke i got a couple of reasons for one thing you know damned well i didnt kill her her or the other dame i didnt have no cause to it wouldnt have made me nothin huhuh brownie i aint killed anyone and you know i aint you can dig me into this deal an make me look pretty bad you can turn on the heat until i start stinkin and they toss me on the dump but you wont be doin it because you think im the killer and your second reason the remaining half of the why i am not going to nose around those moneyorder records a goddamned bit why dont we let it lay keed lets skip that one lets not i said okay im tellin you you start pushin me on this frammis an ill make you the saddest sorriest sonofabitch on the west coast i wouldnt want to understand id maybe screw myself by doin it but id be gettin it anyway so that wouldnt matter lay off of it brownie dont do no more pushin on it because the old crap will fly and most of itll be yours well he sounded like he meant it it was just possible that sufficiently aroused he could carry the threat out he was a resourceful man when he chose to be and he had connections in various shady places of prime consideration of course was my knowledge that he hadnt committed the murders not only because i had but because they would have got him nothing stukey did not do things which got him nothing there was no point then at least for the present in pursuing the matter there was no point in forcing him out of his job i didnt want him to lose it as with dave the status quo suited me fine lem i said this has been a very nice morning good whiskey inspired food and intriguing conversation two old pals eating and drinking together baring their souls in long significant silences and occasional muted bursts of profanity i think i shall let you ride a while lem twere obscene to do otherwise amid such beatitude the smallest flaw would loom as hideously large as a shotgun at a wedding the keed he grinned you want i should wash up these dishes brownie the status quo continued with almost indiscernible deviations dave was his usual jumpy worriedsick self or more so lovelace was his normal dimwitted self or more so and stukey of course remained stukey i was still his old pal the keed and this goddamned cleanup was killin him and he was gettin nowhere fast on them goddamned murders there was just nothin to go on keed nothin but nothin stories about the murders and the consequent man hunt became fewer and shorter even the big los angeles papers with unlimited space to fill began making it a secondsection item the emptiness that continued too only broadening now widening spreading its deadening atmosphere farther and farther until as far as one could see there was nothing but desert parched and withered and lifeless where a dead man walked through eternity the twoway pull that did not continue it lay dormant within me of course awaiting summons but there was no urgency for the present and so for all practical purposes it did not exist somehow that made the emptiness worse there was no relief from it no excursions into that strange outer world where all things moved at a tangent i was tied to this world and the emptiness the shack represented something absolutely essential to me though completely undefinable i had to stay there and and she had been there i couldnt leave the place where she had been i couldnt disturb it the lounge where she had sat the stove where she had cooked the bed where she had lain nothing could be changed everything must remain as it was it was strange how much she had meant to me and still meant to me so much much more than ellen had although i had known deborah for a total of hardly two days i dont mean that i hadnt loved ellen or that i wasnt sorry about her but i had loved deborah in a different way and i was sorry about her in a different way i suppose well it may have been because of deborahs admitted and undebatable need for me she needed me and no one but me could fill that need i did not feel that ellen had needed me she insisted that she did childishly and stubbornly but i was confident that she didnt i had always felt that i bored ellen a little that she resented my modest mental attributes i was certain that if she chose to she could have been much happier with someone else deborah how could i have done it merely to to win a game i ran into tom judge a couple of times the first instance was about a week after his release from jail he advised me that he was chief rewrite man on the pacific city neighborhood news he was doing all right by god he was pulling down a hell of a lot more than hed ever got on that lousy courier and i could tell that to lovelace the first time i saw him i congratulated him and promised to deliver the message i walked on considerably depressed the neighborhood news was printed in a job shop it was circulated free onceaweek providing the publisher sold enough advertising to make its issuance worthwhile the second time i saw him was something more than two weeks later the same day i heard from constance wakefield the news publisher it appeared had tried to get smart with tom and tom had told him where to get off tom didnt take any guff from anyone a fact which as he pointed out i knew as well as he did he didnt have to take any guff maybe some guys did but he sure as hell didnt he was now working as an account executive for a radio station and could i let him have a tenspot just until the ol commissions started rolling i gave him twenty i returned to the office and went to work on the copy for around the town with clinton brown thinking about tom feeling that i should do something to help him i cant honestly say that i wanted to help him i had never liked him and i still didnt and i had missed few opportunities to give him the needle tom and the needle were made for each other one could not at least i could not see the first without seeking the second apart their situation seemed abnormal and there was an irresistible urge to set it aright they were natural inseparables like lead and zinc or kay and mayonnaise still despite my dislike for him i wished there was some way of getting him back on the courier i was at least indirectly responsible for his discharge and strange as it may seem i rather missed him but there was no way i could think of and if i did manage to get him reinstated he probably wouldnt last long it was too bad but it was that way so thats the way it was my phone rang a straight call from the outside since there was no accompanying hey brownie from the city desk i picked up a pencil lifted the headset from the receiver hook and said brown courier how do you do mr brown said a reedy but somehow resonant voice this is constance wakefield miss yes miss wakefield you may have heard of my our books mr brown i am the ownereditor of wakefield house the los angeles publishers i have ill tell you miss wakefield i said i believe the brown you want is in our advertising department if youll just hold on a i wanted mr clinton brown thats you isnt it yes but im afraid its concerning a manuscript of yours a collection of poems the pencil slid from my fingers i picked it up again slowly turning it end over end miss wakefield i said did you say your wife left it with me mr brown that is to say your late wife constance wakefield age about forty height about five feet eight weight about one hundred and five she was all long bony legs and long thin bony wrists and hands one of those straightupanddown women reminiscent of a stovepipe in almost every detail but warmth erect aloof sallow nearsighted and asthmatic constance wakefield i dont have her catalogued yet and i doubt that i ever will i cant say positively whether she was merely greedy and naive or an outright blackmailer probably but no i dont think i shall make even a qualified declaration on this point our talk was hedged about so much that any conclusion would be largely surmise i can say that whatever her intentions were they boded very serious danger for me also that the subsidy publishing business wherein hopeful amateurs are induced to pay for the publication of their work is riddled with racketeers there was a convention in pacific city that week some fraternal order i believe and the lobby of her hotel was packed i pushed my way through it to the stairs mounted them to the fourth floor and was admitted to her room i didnt think id attracted any attention nor would it matter greatly if i had i look in on all conventions in the interests of the courier i could have been doing that so that was one risk taken care of as for her telephone call to the courier well that i was very glad to hear had not been made from her room shed been looking forward so much to meeting me she said so shed called me from the lobby from a booth immediately after registering she simply couldnt wait until she got upstairs and a pale smirk wasnt that terrible of her we sat down and she fumbled a cigarette into a long imitationivory holder i leaned forward with a match and she jerked away startled then she accepted the light quickly and drew away again she wore two pair of glasses one over the other she peered at me through them her eyes bulging behind the lenses like watery oysters i ive had your manuscript for some time mr brown she coughed and wiped her lips with a yellowish handkerchief its not something that one could publish without a great deal of thought no i said i dont imagine it would be my first decision was to return it to your wife in fact i called her and asked that she come in and pick it up but she never came and when i called again shed moved from that address so another smirk rather nervous i held onto it that was very considerate of you i said youd have been justified in throwing it away the oysters squirmed slightly i gave them a pleasant smile well uh of course i couldnt have done that mr brown manuscripts are precious things always entitled to respect and conscientious treatment regardless of ones approval or disapproval i see i said am i correct in assuming miss wakefield that you wish to publish those poems well uh naturally they would have to have a great deal of editing yes i said i should think they would much more than mrs brown gave them that is i assume that it was she the meter is rather uh unsteady and there are a number of misspellings and uh so on i see i nodded and that was one mystery cleared up id wondered about that how she could have brought herself to show those nasty filthy poems to anyone now i knew poor ellen shed probably slaved all of a couple of hours over the things her childs face puckered in concentration lips moving with the scratching of her pencil shed show mister brownie she wasnt so dumb yes and he wouldnt get a single penny of her imminent riches miss wakefield wheezed suddenly and coughed with a strangled rasping sound her handkerchief moved quickly to her lips excuse me mr brown this low coastal area ahummm i hmmm aah find breathing very difficult now returning to your manuscript i was about to ask i said whether youd shown it around any shown shown it around to your editorial staff say or do you do all your own reading yes she said firmly yes i do all my own reading mr brown to be perfectly frank i have no staff editorial or otherwise my business is such that i can handle everything nicely by myself i was quite sure that it was but i was glad to hear her say so the vanity publisher is generally not so much publisher as printing salesman all he needs to start in business is an office and a printinghouse connection no miss wakefield went on no one has read the poems but me mr brown no one whatsoever i i uh it might be of course that i shall want to seek an outside opinion as to their merit but yes but only in the event i contemplated publishing them on a straight royalty basis as opposed to our cooperative plan you see my position mr brown i naturally couldnt assume the entire financial cost of the enterprise without making reasonably sure of the books salability you shouldnt do it anyway miss wakefield i said in all fairness to you i couldnt let you take such a gamble on an unknown author just what would my share of the cooperation come to under your cooperative plan well she had the grace to blush a little that would be governed by uh various factors just for the printing say and of course your own time and expenses well two thous eighteen hundred fifteen hundred mr brown the fifteen hundred was it apparently she wasnt going any lower and while i didnt propose to give her anything i felt a show of reluctance was in order isnt that rather high miss wakefield i dont think so her voice had firmed i think it is quite reasonable under the circumstances the circumstances the circumstances i have had the manuscript under study for several months i have laid tentative plans for its publication and promotion i have made this trip to pacific city to see you in short mr brown i have already made a substantial investment in the book she nodded righteously emphasizing the gesture with a phlegmish wheeze the handkerchief went up and down again and she went on yes mr brown i believe fifteen hundred dollars is extremely reasonable for that modest sum you retain the undivided rights to the book and all profits accruing therefrom providing i said there are any naturally no publisher can guarantee that a book will be successful i do believe however that this one stands a very good chance mr brown i am so strongly of that opinion that i am almost of a mind to publish it on a straight royalty basis without the customary subsidy after all there has been a great deal of publicity about these hummm socalled sneering slayer murders and a manuscript by the husband of one of the victims just a minute i said lets make a supposition miss wakefield lets suppose that i demand the immediate return of that manuscript do you not at all a mere hypothesis weell i look on it this way mr brown your name is not on the manuscript but mrs brown said it was yours and in the absence of any contrary proof any uh dispute i would feel justified in assuming that you were the author on the other hand yes i said on the other hand miss wakefield i have an investment in the manuscript made in good faith if i should find myself threatened with the loss of that investment if that is you should demand the return of the poems i think i should insist upon proof that they were yours very neat no despite my personal involvement in the situation i felt a sneaky admiration for the old girl do you have the manuscript with you miss wakefield it is in the hotel safe mr brown manuscripts are such precious things i live in dread that one may be burned up or lost or uh id like to go through it with you i said why dont i pick you up in my car this evening and we can drive out some place for dinner i please the oysters did vigorous situps thank you so much mr brown but im afraid it would be impossible im not at all a well woman i require a great deal of rest even after the light sedentary duties of a quiet day and in the dam p ahhhhummm night air unthinkable mr brown now i could have the manuscript brought up here or we might examine it in the lobby its not important i said and i imagine youd rather not wouldnt you as long as any doubt remains about our future relations well yes mr brown i think i would like to have a definite commitment before wheeze cough and handkerchief before turning the manuscript over to you for uh study and revision i understand now i dont know its just possible that i might not be able to do the revisions to my own satisfaction i might prefer to leave the book unpublished rather than have it be a discredit to me oh im sure it wouldnt be im confident you can do a wonderful job mr brown but the other possibility exists miss wakefield what would be your attitude if it materialized wewell she hesitated quite a bit over that one of course i already have an investment in the project my time and uh expenses and of course the typesetting and the time on the printing presses must be contracted for in advance very good again no if it was blackmail and i was by no means sure that it was it would be very hard to prove i uh believe i would have to declare your money forfeit mr brown i would be compelled to naturally certainly i said well fifteen hundred dollars eh im sure you can obtain it mr brown i uh due to the nature of this business i am forced to inquire into a prospective authors financial situation and your wife was quite helpful i understand that you draw a comfortable salary one which might be borrowed against substantially and you have a pension and a car and a quantity of furniture and doubtless there are friends who would yes i said i think i can probably how long were you going to be in town miss wakefield i suppose you want to conclude the transactions before you leave she said that was exactly what she wanted to do travel was expensive and a serious drain on her energies and there was really nothing to be gained was there by delay today is monday i would have to leave here no later than friday night i uh i wouldnt care to go to greater expense and i have an appointment with my doctor in los angeles on saturday morning im sure i can get it by friday i said it may be rather late in the day since i have to work but oh she frowned i hope it wouldnt be very late if i dont check out of my room by five i have to pay for another day ill keep in touch with you i said if it should happen that i couldnt meet you until after five you could check out and wait for me in the lobby or you could have your dinner here while youre waiting yees i could do that but is there a train theres one at sixthirty nine and eleventhirty of course youd be on your way long before eleventhirty i wasnt just woofing as stukey would say constance wakefield didnt know it but she was on her way already well she peered at me carefully nodded that should be all right of course if i could get away sooner possibly you can i said ill do my very best miss wakefield and possibly i can get you away before friday i promised to keep in touch and went back to the office at the first opportunity i dipped into a volume supplied us by the us weather bureau the weather and meteorological conditions in general are must news items in places like pacific city i used the volume regularly and to the best of my recollection there would be no moon i was wrong i stared down at the page weighing the importance if any of my error thursday not friday was the moonless night on friday there would be a crescent moon perhaps then i shook my head and closed the book the light wasnt sufficient to be a factor it would be dark enough on friday absolute darkness would have been preferable of course but constance might not cooperate on thursday she wouldnt be anxious enough shed still have a day to spare and she might decide to use it so friday it would be id send constance along to her maker then and shed need some repairs when she arrived it would be a pleasure there was no alternative as i saw it perhaps she didnt see the connection between the manuscript poems and the poems found in the possession of ellen and deborah but it was there to be seen and sooner or later probably sooner it would be certainly stukey would spot it hed know how to follow it up expand it into evidence two poems were useless to him he might backtrail me for years without ever identifying them with a typewriter that i had had access to or if he did manage to do so what of it other people had used the same typewriters they could have written the poems as well as i with the manuscript however his job would be simplicity itself hed have more than fifty poems to work on hed turn up one typewriter id used after another hed follow me back and back tracing me through the years checking the typewriters in every place id lived or worked no one else of course would have duplicated my trail they wouldnt have been in all or even a great many of the places i had been in by sheer weight if nothing else the evidence would prove me the author of the sneering slayer poems it was unfortunate that the author of the poems was so definitely associated with the author of the murders unfortunate that is for constance id convinced lovelace that the two were the same man and hed forced stukey to adopt that theory at least stukey voiced no other in his public pronouncements and he and we were the chief information sources of the outoftown newspapers the poet was the killer the point was indisputable thanks to me and it was too bad for constance but constance had put herself on the spot constance should have stood in los angeles i called her the following afternoon i told her id been turned down by the bank but that a friend had promised to help and id probably have the money in a day or two i let the next day wednesday slide without calling around four on thursday i gave her another ring the friend would let me have only half the money and only on condition that i was able to raise the other half but i went on there was absolutely no reason to worry i knew exactly where i could get the remaining seven hundred and fifty from an old army pal who would be in town on friday late friday morning or possibly in the afternoon hed been away on vacation and she was just a little perturbed she wheezed and coughed and said she did hope i didnt fail her i said i wouldnt friday came i called her shortly before noon and again at four oclock the second call i told her was being made from the home of my vacationing friend he was due to drive up at any moment as soon as he did wed go to the other friends house and assemble the money all this would take a little time of course theyd probably have to scurry around and get some checks cashed perhaps if she didnt hear from me within the next couple hours shed better go on to the station id meet her there with the money in plenty of time to catch the nineoclock train well she really wheezed and sneezed on that one this was extremely aggravating mr brown all this uncertainty and delay and sitting around a drafty depot in the night air unless i was absolutely sure i was sure at two minutes of nine just as she was heading with angry determination toward the los angeles train i had a redcap page her she hesitated then she trudged after the redcap to the telephone and i returned to the booth in the bar she was boiling angry wheezing like a teakettle i cooled her off fast i told her i was tired and disgusted myself id been on the move all day not waiting around for someone else to do something id finally got my two friends together and they expected to turn up the money within the next couple hours if that was unsatisfactory to her all she had to do was say so and no i wasnt going to traipse way down there with part of the money there was no reason why i should id bring it all when i came a couple of hours at the outside but if she didnt care to wait it was perfectly all right with me she decided to wait i called her at elevenfifteen i simply couldnt make it tonight i said there wasnt the slightest doubt about being able to get the money it wasnt a question of money but time so inasmuch as shed checked out of her hotel and already bought her ticket i suggested that she go on back to los angeles id drive up with the money tomorrow afternoon she wheezed and sighed very well mr brown i understand that this is a perfectly hideous train and but very well tomorrow afternoon then without fail or sooner i said i left the bar and hurried up to the corner of the block i crossed the intersection and went on across the tracks pausing at the end of a string of freight cars the milk train two freight cars and a mail car with an antiquated coach hooked on at the rear was drawn up in front of the station the engineer and the conductorbrakeman were leaning against a baggage truck gossiping while they waited for the time to pull out miss wakefield came out of the station weaving with the weight of her suitcase she had almost reached the coach when the conductorbrakeman saw her he called hey lady and motioned she came toward him and he sauntered toward her letting her do most of the walking he relieved her of her ticket shrugged indifferently at some comment or question and walked back to the engineer miss wakefield struggled up the steps of the coach and disappeared into the dimly lit interior i waited studying the hands of my watch eleven twentyfive eleven twentysix eleven twentyeight eleven the engineer climbed into his cab the conductor boosted himself into the mail car and began waving his lantern it was as id been sure it would be she was the only passenger the railroad loses or claims it loses money on its milktrain passengers and does everything possible to discourage them there was a cry of booard followed by a crisp chootoot the train jerked and began to move i ran down the line of freight cars swung crouching into the open vestibule of the coach i hung there for a few hundred yards until we were well past the last of the station sheds and platforms then i stood up and went inside the car only the lights at each end were burning she was about midway of the car sitting with her back toward me and her legs up on another seat shed taken her glasses off and laid them on the window sill as i bent over her the oysterish eyes blinked in the darkness staring up at me blankly she didnt recognize me i doubt that she even recognized me as another person i was only a shadow among shadows a something which suddenly shoved her down in the seat and flipped the back rest over on her pinning her helpless against the worn plush she coughed and wheezed her mouth dropped open i poured a handful of coins into it and she choked and strangled rattling them dully shed wanted money ellen had wanted to be burned up and deborah had wanted wanted something else and constance wakefield had wanted money so id given it to her and in such a way as to give her the utmost pleasure from it most people never get a chance to enjoy their money you know they strive for it they get it and then they are dead constance now well constance would get some satisfaction from hers it would probably take her an hour or more to strangle shed have the money all to herself with no worries about losing it or someones taking it away from her possibly she could even take it with her when she died part of it at least no undertaker would look at her any more than he had to any money within her would stand a good chance of remaining there yes i had done all right by constance i had given her money and the opportunity to enjoy it all that remained now was to relieve her of the manuscript it was in her suitcase i took it out reshut the suitcase and selected a poem at random with handkerchiefcovered fingers i stuffed the poem into her purse i gave her a pat on the head and ran back to the vestibule the train was still loafing along at approximately twenty miles an hour i climbed down to the bottom step of the car and dropped off within a hundred yards of my shack constance wakefield i scrambled up the embankment to my yard thinking about her how could i have done this so calmly as though it were a relatively unimportant act in a crowded day had i actually reached a point where murder meant nothing to me the problem disturbed me but only in a remote wellishouldbeashamed way actually i could feel no guilt ellen yes i was honestly sorry about ellen and certainly i was something more than sorry about deborah but i had entertained no remorse over constance she had not been alive as they had she would not have gone on living as they would have except for my intervention there had been no life in her only phlegm and avarice and how can one take life where none is present no i couldnt feel sorry for constance i had done the decent thing put an end to her poor counterfeit of life in the most suitable way possible i reached the top of the embankment i dropped the manuscript into the incinerator and continued on across the yard i was very tired tired and just a little sick at my stomach i wanted to get into the house and undress and slug down a few stiff ones id done the only thing i could do id had to kill her so since it had to be done id tried to make the best of it but still where have you been said kay randall you answer me clinton brown where have you been i was taken completely by surprise i didnt know why or how she had come here and for the moment i was too startled to ask i could only think of one thing that i was in a spot and that id have to kill her to get out of it where have you been she repeated where is he what are you up to why why kay i said what do you mean where is youre up to something youve got him mixed up in it thats where hes been all these nights when he was supposed to kay i said i dont know what youre talking about i just stepped out in the back yard a few minutes for a breath of air and you did not ive been parked out in the road for almost a half hour jjust waiting and wondering what to do and you didnt come out of the house youve been somewhere youve now thats nonsense i said where would i go without my car its a dark night and you just didnt see me when i youre lying she shrieked it out you havent been in the back yard yyou i dont know what youre up to but ill find out youll see youre not going to get away with id been edging toward her and shed been backing away and now we were at the side of the house i reached for her and she struck at me wildly hysterically she screamed again that i was lying and that she intended to find out why youll see you cant mix dave up in your dirty the door of the house opened abruptly tom judge peered out hey brownie he said havent you had enough air yet your drinks getting all warm i didnt know what he was doing here either but obviously he hadnt come with kay it appeared rather that he had heard her accusations as anyone within a hundred yards would have and was lending me his support ill be right with you i said more or less automatically fix me another drink huh sure he said giving kay a superbly insolent stare be careful you dont catch cold or something he slammed the door on that so hard that her head rocked back she turned slowly back to me lifted and dropped her hands helplessly i im sorry she said ive jjust been so worried and and frightened i knknow there must be a good reason why hes lied to me bbut why havent you asked him i said you indicated that hes been misrepresenting his whereabouts at night for some time i well i that would be a little too direct wouldnt it a little too straightforward and honest youd rather sneak around and raise hell with well she flared up you are trying to get him into trouble arent you youre mean and rotten and hateful and youre trying to make him the same way well i said at least i havent tried to poison him she gave me a puzzled look then turned and took a step toward the road clint she hesitated im sorry dont pay any attention to me hmmm you can depend on it i said now and upon all other occasions and aand please dont tell dave i was here why not i said the wife of my best friend visits me late at night why shouldnt i as an honorable and upright man inform him of the fact please clint im im aafraid he isnt himself any more like tonight now id checked with the civic league and i knew there wasnt any meeting so so shed told him he was going to stay at home oh she didnt call him a liar or anything like that shed been very sweet and tactful about the matter father had simply been killing himself with work and she was going to put a stop to it meeting or no meeting father was going to go to bed and get a good nights rest and then playfully but firmly shed taken his car keys he wouldnt talk to me clint he just sat and stared looking at me something something awful i went back to the bedroom for a minute and when i came out he was gone i guess he must have slipped out and hailed a taxicab well i said of course im not sure he didnt have to go to some of those other meetings but if he lied about this one i see i said very interesting i could have named her two nights when dave had attended nonexistent meetings but i could see nothing to be gained by it i had a hunch that the affair was one to proceed on with great caution clint what do you ssuppose i dont i said theres probably some very simple explanation for the whole thing kay one that will doubtless surprise you with its simplicity when it finally dawns on you well she shrugged tiredly i hope so ill i suppose i better go on back home good night clint are you going to ask dave where hes been when he shows up that is nno she said and it seemed to me that she shivered i i dont think id better id rather not know if if good night clint good night i said i walked with her to the road and watched as she got into the car and drove off then i went into the house tom had a drink waiting for me judging by his appearance i suspected that he had several in his stomach in addition to the one in his hand hope you dont mind my busting in on you this way he said his chin jutting with a trace of belligerence your car was here and i figured you must be around thought youd just gone for a little walk or something quite all right i said i hope i didnt keep you waiting long huhuh he dumped more whisky into his glass dont think it was couldnt have been more than a few minutes seems like id just got here when i heard miss beauty bitch yelling at you i nodded time does indeed fly by when one is stowing away free drinks boy he went on would i like to give that bitch a good sock in the mush she was at the christmas party last year yknow the one all the wives came to playing up to lovelace and his old lady and giving everyone else the snoot midge well midge was wearing a dress shed made over and i thought it looked pretty nice but miss bitch poked fun at it all evening you know pretending like she admired it and askinghow much it had cost new and so on and all the time laughing about it boy i could have murdered her i said that kay was like the weather everyone talked about her but no one did anything he scowled surlily rocking the ice in his glass she screws around with me therell be something done he promised and that goes for dave too yknow i always kind of liked the guy brownie you know i did an then he turns around and sics that goddamned stukey on me gets me arrested for murder i didnt know that i said and i hadnt known only suspected that randall had phoned in the tip to stukey i supposed that the cab driver had huhuh they didnt have any driver in to identify me like they would have so i figured it had to be someone else and the way i figured it couldnt have been anyone but dave we were the only ones in the office at the time she called see maybe he didnt know it was her but he knew about what time she got into town and he saw me taking a straightline call over your phone and that was enough for him oh he did it all right i was going to let it slide but after i heard about this job in la i decided to tell him off before i left town the bastard admitted hed done it said he hadnt meant to be underhanded just hadnt felt free to give his name to the cops because the paper was involved i shook my head sympathetically im sure he didnt think you were really guilty i said daves just overly conscientious he saw you take the call and so what i saw him take some too but i didnt go running to the cops about it we were alone in the office he could have talked to her through the desk phone im not saying he did understand just that he could have if id wanted to be a bastard i couldve got him in a jam like he did me yes i said very forbearing of you but whats this about los angeles im pulling out me and the family weve sold our furniture and were heading for la in the morning i oh yeah let me give you this before i forget he pulled a roll of bills from his pocket and flipped me a twenty i hesitated wanting to give it back to him then nodded and thanked him he was very much on edge more resentfully watchful than usual he might consider the gift of the twenty an insult you said you had a job in los angeles what paper well uh its not definite they want a top rewrite man see and i said i was entirely willing to come in and show em what i could do so well i can handle it all right they tell me its actually a hell of a lot easier to work on those bigcity dailies theyve got plenty of help you know they dont expect you to knock yourself out like you have to on the courier i wanted to say you wont last a shift boy therell be a deadline every hour and all hell will pop if you miss one theres no time to work your stuff over you have to hit it on the nose the first shot and you cant let everything else slide while youre doing it youll have to keep answering your phones two of them taking down notes on other stories youll have a half dozen stories going at the same time sure theyve got plenty of help they need it and whether you knock yourself out or not is up to you thats strictly your own problem and theyre not concerned with it you but why tell him something that he probably already knew the truth which fear and false pride kept him from admitting tom i said thats swell i know youll make out fine boy yeah he said frowning down vaguely at the floor ive got to so i guess i will i ive got to get out of this burg i cant theres nothing around here for me he took another outsize drink gulped it shuddered and stood up well i guess i better shove off guess i ought to have gone home long ago ive been out wandering around since about six kind of giving the old town a last onceover and midge might be getting worried i offered to drive him home but he declined hed just take a taxi he guessed hed just remembered that there was a fellow in town he wanted to see and i called a cab for him we shook hands and he left i had an idea that i was acquainted with the fellow he wanted to see that one and all the other bartenders in town and i could understand his unease and restlessness he couldnt have got more than a couple of hundred bucks for his furniture with that and a wife and baby and almost no ability he was tackling one of the toughest towns and toughest jobs in the world what would he do when his money ran out what does a man do when he can accept nothing less than the unachievable it was difficult to say i thought there was no telling what tom judge would do something desperate of course something foolish but exactly what subconsciously i think i must have been prepared for an unusual aftermath to my strangling of constance wakefield i must have been for i was not particularly startled when that aftermath came and it seems only logical that i should have been so prepared this was my third murder the third time i had gone through the motions of murder yet in each of the first two cases i couldnt be positive that id killed ellen id slugged her and set fire to her but she hadnt died of the blow or the flames asphyxiation had been the cause of death and it did seem strange that once on her feet she couldnt have escaped from that small cabin i couldnt be positive that id killed deborah id left her alone in the shack and shed been lying so very still when i returned and in my haste to get the hateful deed over well how could i be sure how could i know that she wasnt already dead when i broke her neck so with constance wakefield my murder number three murder in quotes yes for here again there was a strong element of doubt again i couldnt be sure that i had actually killed in fact it seemed quite certain that i hadnt her body was found late the following morning it was lying beside the railroad tracks about thirty miles outside of pacific city there was a handful of dimes in her purse and of course the poem her death was attributed to heart failure with concussion a contributory factor it was believed that she had fallen or been pushed from the train with the emphasis very heavily on the fallen after all thered been no other passengers in the coach the train crew swore to that and the train hadnt stopped until it was almost seventy miles up the line true there was the poem but that had been penciled over and marked up so much as to be almost indecipherable it could not be definitely stated that it was another of the sneering slayer rhymes there was at least a good a chance that intrigued by the other poems she had tried her hand at one herself she was a publisher wasnt she shed be interested in such things wouldnt she of course the police were investigating thoroughly and leaving no stone unturned but what they expected to find under those stones was obviously nothing the old girl was half blind the coach was dark shed gone out to the rear platform for some fresh air a rarity on the milk train and taken a tumble yes i am aware of the holes in this line of reasoning but since this is fact not fiction there is nothing i can do about them if they irritate you sufficiently you might take them up with the police of the next county where miss wakefields body was discovered i wouldnt say they were stupid i am reasonably confident say that they are capable of tracking an elephant through a snow drift they could do it but they wouldnt unless the elephant was traveling more than thirty miles an hour or sneaking fruit from the orange groves they would see no occasion to it would be a needless expense and the cops in the next county like the cops in so many other counties are under firm edict not to waste the taxpayers money so that was the way things stood with constance wakefield the cops believed it was an accident they finished their thorough investigation with its incidental upturning of stones in some fortyeight hours and they were convinced it was an accident the los angeles papers tried to build the case up as murder they whooped it up mixing its meager facts in with rewrites of the previous two cases and they even sent their own special investigators into the county that went on for three or four days and then there was a nice juicy murder right in los angeles a bgirl carved up and hidden in of all places an ice cream cart and you can guess what happened to the wakefield story to hell with that this was something hot although i had seen evidence of great shrewdness in lem stukey i was still surprised at his positive conviction that constance wakefield had been murdered r i should say i was surprised at the insight that brought him to that conviction maybe i wouldnt feel that way if shed died in this county he grinned id probably let it slide just like those guys are doing but i figure they got to see it even if they aint doing anything about it look now just looky here the first one he sets on fire the next one he tosses to the dogs the third one he pushes off a train he hold it i said how did he know it was going to kill her when he pushed her off the train you aint listening keed youre stealing my stanzas he dont know its going to kill her thats what im talking about he couldnt be sure and he couldnt be sure that what he did to ellen was going to finish her and this mrs chasen he couldnt be hold it again i said he could have finished her off before he put her in the i tell you its a pattern stukey insisted i cant lay it out for you like wallpaper but its got to be the same guy he dont carry through see he leaves too much to chance he aint well he dont seem serious about it murder isnt serious so maybe he dont really mean to murder em he thinks he does maybe but all hes really up to is a rough sort of kidding you watch a bunch of youngsters sometime keed theyll start off talking razzing each other and pretty soon theyve used up all the dirty cracks they got and they start punching theyre fed up with the talk see so they start making with the fists it figures pal you really want to kill someone you dont play around at it like this guy you get you a knife or a gun and you do the job fast and permanent i found myself staring at him i wondered if take them dimes in her purse now he was talking about constance again there was thirtythree of them wasnt there and what would a dame be doin with more than two or three dimes in her purse id say that that was all she did have brownie the guy that bumped her put the other thirty there he was razzing her see thirty pieces of silver like judas got paid off with i lighted a cigarette i said i would like to offer him my theory im convinced i said that she was killed by an enraged redcap driven mad by dime tips he followed her onto the train and poured the dimes down her throat with the intent to strangle her then driven by the wild strength born of fear she disgorged the dimes frugally stowing them away in her purse and yeah he waited a moment for me to continue then shrugged so go on and laugh about it for all you know he maybe did exactly that not any redcap dammit the guy that did the other two jobs would fit his pattern i asked him how some of his other theories fitted into the pattern as for example his onetime belief that tom judge had killed ellen you say that the same man killed all three but he was in jail at the time mrs chasen was killed and he was with me on the night of miss wakefields demise yeah i know he frowned doggedly so i cant lay it all out for you i dont know all the answers all im saying is that every killings got the same earmarks and it aint got em accidentally the same guys mixed up in in yes nothing what the hell i was just going to say that it looks almost like two guys one of em this joker he halfasses the job up and the second one makes it stick now wait a minute he held up a hand i said it looked that way i didnt say it was that way you know i said thats a very interesting idea stuke why dont you work on it me now that the guys finally pulled out of the county he shook his head firmly not me keed he aint no skin off my nose from now on the courier carried the wakefield story one day and gave it a backpage squib in one edition the next and that was the last pacific city residents heard of her unless they read the outoftown papers mr lovelace felt that the story lacked local interest he felt that it was negative the sort of news wed been printing far too much of lately wed have to have less of it from now on much much less it was unconstructive it was depressing it took up space needed for worthwhile items he was very firm during our discussion and i made no very large effort to soften him up the cleanup campaign was getting a little tiresome at least i was getting very tired of writing about it it was the same thing day after day dry repetitious completely lacking in any possibilities for humor and with the murderer supposedly gone from pacific city the basis for keeping it alive was gone so i didnt argue with lovelace at any length or with any great insistence perhaps you couldnt legislate public morals perhaps these things worked themselves out if you gave them time and perhaps i knew damned well that it would do me no good to argue there was that in his manner which said as much the discussion was embarrassing to him for some reason he seemed prepared to be angry if forced to continue it all things considered it seemed a poor time to test my influence with him the cleanup story had been getting a daily play in every edition we dropped it to one edition a day then to one every other day then one every three days and very soon we had dropped it completely there was no further mention of it after that no further mention of the murders the paper resumed its puerile emptiness a newspaper in name only as i was a man in name only there was nothing in either of us we were facades for emptiness broadly speaking things became as they were before the murders yet the outlines of those things were becoming dimmer to me it was hard to reach out to them any more lash out at them any more it was difficult to remember why i had ever wanted to dave randall was as he had always been a little more nervous and jumpy perhaps but generally unchanged so likewise with lovelace and stukey and everyone else all the same as i was the same and still a change had taken place they were receding from me growing hazier and wobblier of outline it was increasingly hard to bring them back into focus i wondered if the booze could be responsible and i swore off for twelve of the longest hours in my existence it was not enough of course months would be required to desaturate me but further abstinence was unthinkable perhaps i could not go on as i had without serious consequences but neither could i stop it made me too ill physically the clarity it brought me was not the kind i desired without whisky that circle in my mind began to dissolve i ceased to move around it endlessly and my vision turned inward and while i caught only a glimpse of what lay there that little was so bewildering and maddening and frightful that i could look no more i tried cutting down gradually on the whisky and i have continued to try but these attempts like the other have not been successful when i reach a certain stage in the cutting down the circle begins to dissolve and i must quickly reverse the cuttingdown process i i am not like that that which i caught a glimpse of is not me i will not accept it nor look at it but i am getting ahead of myself again i am rushing toward the end and the end will come soon enough the emptiness the meaninglessness went on pushing the others farther away from me pushing them out of my reach it was unbearable i could not let them go they were the life i did not have my one handhold on existence i had to do something and i did we have a republican postmaster in pacific city and he owes a considerable political debt to the courier he was glad to let me look into the records of money orders issued i went back through them i found what i was looking for within an hour except that i had some idle time to pass i had no reason to look farther nevertheless i did look and what i found was definitely not what i had expected to find i was puzzled startled at first then the puzzledness gave way to excitement and a curious kind of relief so this was it this was why and possibly how well it was the day before yesterday when i made the discovery and as i entered the house the phone rang it was stukey he was up on the hill he said up in italian town hed been kind of takin it easy this afternoon just sorta screwing around and cutting up touches with the boys if i wasnt doing nothing maybe hed pick up some grub and saunter on down to the shack i said that would be fine id been hoping he would call he said swell hed be right down then he was on foot yeah hed sent his car back to the station but it was a nice day and he kind of felt like walkin and fine i said thats perfect stuke he brought steaks et cetera and prepared them as before we ate as we had before myself at the coffee table he from a tray placed upon a chair we finished eating and i reached for the whisky bottle he tilted his chair back against the wall sipping a bottle of the beer he had brought he was giving the beer a play for a while he said hed been hittin the old whiz too hard and a guy could only do that so long before it got him it sneaked up on him before he knew it maybe it didnt show on him but well what was the sense in waitin until you was knocked out aint that the way you see it keed i shook my head nodded shrugged i wasnt thinking about what he was saying i was wondering how i could bring the subject up how to best mention my discovery it should be done obliquely i thought i should come in at an angle letting him see the approach but leaving its terminus in temporary doubt first a small hint then a stronger one watching him smiling at him turning the heat on gradually and and letting him sweat he rambled on aimlessly pausing now and then for some comment from me i nodded and shrugged and shook my head and finally he lapsed into silence that lasted for several minutes or what i believe on reflection was several minutes then he let the legs of his chair down to the floor and announced that maybe hed better go i looked kind of tired like i didnt feel too good so i came out of my reverie i said that i wouldnt think of letting him go we havent been seeing nearly enough of each other i said tell me what great deeds are afoot with pacific citys finest how goes the fearless pursuit of panhandlers and unlicensed peddlers aaaah he raised and dropped his shoulders uncomfortably lookit here keed youre talkin to the wrong boy about that you really want to do somethin about it which i dont figure you do ill tell you who to see yes yeah you talk to the merchants association see how they feel about peddlers you see how the tourist bureau an the chamber of commerce feels about panhandlers theyll say im too easy on em keed i dont treat em rough enough but you cant be swayed by outside influences i said i am confident of it the cleanup campaign is a case in point you are proceeding with it are you not the mere absence of publicity has not deterred you no he said it aint i was sure of it i knew that with one such as you there listen to me keed i want to tell you somethin i tilted the whisky bottle again i raised my glass and gestured by all means i said you tell me something and then perhaps i shall tell you something the cleanups over an done with and i aint sorry but there aint a damned thing i could do if i was you really dont see it brownie i didnt expect old lovey to know straight up but i didnt figure id have to draw a map for you who do you think owns all these whorehouses and policy joints who do you think owns the horse parlors and deadfalls and mitt mills well it aint the grifters keed they just work em and they pay goddamned fancy rents for the privilege and the people that get them rents swing plenty of weight around town sure i graft why not if the dirty money aint too dirty for our best people like they call them its plenty clean for me but i tell you this pal if the stuff wasnt there i couldnt take it i looked down at my glass slowly added more whisky i shook my head firmly thats an old story stuke every crooked cop ive ever talked to has the same alibi hed like to go straight but i aint said id like to i aint no hero im just telling you why its this way and why its going to keep on being this way yeah its an old story all right but i dont figure you know it very well so ill give you the rest theres the fines we take in from those places we pull the grifters in once a week they pay their fines an then we let em go back to work its like taxes keed and it comes to enough to pay the overhead for the whole damned department more than a hundred grand a year that them best people the regular taxpayers can keep in their pockets and thats stuke please i said you dont have to defend yourself to me i know your conscience is spotless your soul pure as driven snow and you asked for it he said stubbornly im telling you you claim im always layin into the colored folks blaming everything that happens on them well maybe i do kind of but i got a damned good reason to not one out of a hundred can get a decent job a job where he can get as much as you do say or even half as much they dont make no dough but they got to keep laying it on the line they get stuck every time they turn around their rents cost em plenty because theres just one section of town they can live in if they dont want to walk two three miles to a store in a white neighborhood where theyll probably get a good hard snooting they have to buy from the little joints in their own section places where there aint much of a selection and the prices are high it takes every nickel they can get just to keep goin just to live like a bunch of animals theyre always about half sore an it dont take much to make em more than half they make trouble they start playin rough and all me and my boys can do is play a little rougher flatten em out or get em sent up for a stretch we cant get to the bottom of the trouble try to fix it so there wont be any more all we can do is all right stukey sighed go on and laugh at me but just the same im giving it to you straight i wasnt laughing at the remarks i said only at their author i was wondering what irresistible sociological forces moved you to offer to hush up a murder that you thought i had committed providing i would play ball he hesitated frowning i really think he had forgotten all about it all right he said i play along i got just so much to work with and i try to get all i can out of it what about you about me sure youre smart you got a good education and a good trade if things dont go to suit you you can move on to another job you dont have to play with anyone i dont understand you i said why dont you do something youve got influence with lovelace you can swing your weight with him and if he swings back you aint really lost anything me im nothin to him if he gets sore at me im sunk so hows about it keed if you really want somethin done about pacific city why dont you go to work on it it seems to me i said that ive already huhuh you aint done nothin and you aint goin to this cleanup wasnt nothin to you but a way to swing the old needle you could make lovelace squirm you could turn the heat on me you could shake everything to hell up and it gave you a bang thats all it meant to you thats all anything means to you just a chance to make someone sweat from what i hear youve driven this randall guy halfway off his rocker youve got him sweatin blood afraid hes going to lose his job but i could tell him he aint going to lose it you wont carry things that far you dont want him to get away from you i poured another drink and for some reason my hand shook anything else i said uhhuh the county judge thing is out ive been studyin it over an i can see it was just a pipe dream maybe i could make it but i wouldnt last much longer than it would take me to open my mouth thats the way you figured huh keed thats why you wouldnt give me a boost you knew id lose out all the way around and you couldnt ride me any more thats all i said youve nothing more to say i guess thats about it brownie he shrugged goodnaturedly no hard feelings id like to say something then about ellen now i believe the evidence indicated that she revived after the murderers attack she was up on her feet in an enclosure less than fifteen feet square and yet she couldnt make it to the door or a window she died of asphyxiation yeah stukey nodded like i was sayin keed the guy acted like i know like he wasnt serious like he must have had some help from a second guy someone say who was being blackmailed by her he stared at me silently there was a peculiar hardness in his small round eyes which raises this question stuke i said why did you send her almost three thousand dollars in a little more than two years time his face went completely blank then slowly a strange look spread over it not of fear as i had expected but rather a compound of regret and annoyance and mayhap embarrassment he stood up and went out into the kitchen i heard the ice box door open and close he came back and sat down a freshly opened bottle of beer in his hand a blackmailer he said thoughtfully not just a oneshot not just a gal squeezing a little dough when she was in a pinch but a steady worker thats the way you saw your wife brownie i i paused i asked you a question stuke and you got an answer an heres one to the next question why does a guy give a woman dough why would he keep sendin it to her month after month when he aint even seem her i heard a laugh one that was not mine although it came from me oh no i said no stuke that i cant believe i know you cant i knew you wouldnt but that dont change nothin i liked her just liked to talk and visit with her and she seemed to like it too she never asked me for no dough she never tried to make me for a penny so so maybe that was part of it maybe that meant a lot to a guy who never saw a dame without her hand out i liked her and when you like someone you try to help em i laughed again the laugh that was not my laugh so he just liked to talk to her visit with her he was content with that and i somehow i believed him that was all keed i can buy the other for a hell of a lot less than three grand and i can get it a lot handier i dont have to cover up and sneak around that wasnt easy for me to do brownie talkin about her like i did pretendin like i thought why did you why he shot me a puzzled glance you mean i should show how i felt in front of you i shouldnt cover up about a guys own wife i guess you and me went to different schools keed i reached for my drink and the glass slipped from my fingers it bounced from the coffee table and rolled splashing to the floor i picked up the bottle and drank from it i believe you threatened me i said i was to lay off of this deal or youd make me wish i had lets skip it huh pal i wouldnt do it even if you was to try to make somethin out of this maybe it would give you some trouble but it would hurt me more if it got around that i was spreadin a story like like go on i said ah hell brownie he tilted his chair back against the wall i was just sore it it aint really nothin it didnt make no difference with me did it why jesus i had it doped out right from the beginning almost that pension with nothin wrong showin on you an breaking up with your wife when there wasnt another babe an your drinkin and ridin everyone an and this place you wantin a home not just a room and doing your best to have one it wasnt hard to figure out for a guy that was really interested so i did and what the hell if it didnt mean nothin to a lowdown jerk like me why would youve known all along i said youve let me think you let me go ahead and he mumbled apologetically he raised the beer bottle and drank his head thrown back to avoid my eyes hed let me go ahead and it had all started because i was afraid that he lets talk about somethin else huh keed he gave me a pleading look about this doll now that your friend randalls been playin shes no good in trumps an you can tell him i said so hed better pull out while hes still able to doll i said doll it didnt register on me there was no room for it in my mind you didnt know about her well damned near everyone else seems to the guys practically been livin with her at night and shes the kind that talks he started to raise the beer bottle again paused come to think of it maybe you better not tell him nothin just leave her to me ill run the little bitch out of town the bottle went up he threw his head back to receive the beer then i doubt if he knew what happened then i hurled the whisky bottle and it crashed sickeningly against the bottle he was holding his tilted chair shot from under him he went over backward in a tinkling shower of glass and his head hit the floor with a thud he lay there crumpled and groaning his face bleeding from a dozen cuts i got a length of clothesline rope from the kitchen swung an end over one of the livingroom rafters and gave him a boost after all hed always wanted me to boost him hadnt he and then i fled the place i took a room at a hotel and i have not been back since and now i am back at the newspaper the others have all gone but i think someone has come in has been sitting in the darkness at the other side of the room of course i didnt kill him i know now that i am incapable of killing anyone he has been missing for more than a day but not because he is dead i dont know what why i dont as yet have the answer to certain other questions i only know that i have not killed and cannot kill and he is stirring at last the man who has been sitting there behind me he has come forward and his hand has dropped down on my shoulder it is a wellmanicured hand i can smell the odor of hair oil and talcum powder and freshly shined shoes the hand moves from my shoulder to the stack of manuscript it rakes it off the desk and into the wastebasket jesus keed you hadnt ought to write things like that people might think youre crazy he grinned down at me through slightly puffed lips there was a wide strip of adhesive tape across his nose his talcumed face was a network of red scratches and cuts i look like hell huh keed jesus whatd you run out on me for that wasnt no way to treat a pal a guys chair slips out from under him and he smashes his face on a bottle an what what are you trying to pull i said you know i tried to kill you i botched the job the first time and youve been waiting for me to try again youve had the shack staked out you had them give out the report that you were missing and why keed he widened his eyes in exaggerated amazement i dont dig you atall like i said my chair slipped id swear to it brownie get me id swear it happened that way i got him all right i was beginning to get him i saw what he intended to do and a shiver of sickness ran through me why i said why did you drop the stakeout what made you see that i wasnt that i couldnt his grin widened his eyes shifted a little and he jerked his head toward the teletypes looks like you got a lot of news there keed why i repeated maybe you ought to take a look maybe its the same news we got at the station a couple hours ago i turned slowly i walked over to the teletypes a long streamer of yellow paper drooped from each i picked up the one from the ap machine and i read los ang am spl to courier thomas j judge until recently a rewrite man on the pacific city courier confessed today to the mysterious murder of ellen tanner brown estranged wife of another courier employee broke and out of work the sullen stocky newsman told police that he just wanted to get everything over with im not sorry about her he declared she had it coming to her judges early morning confession to los angeles authorities exploded a widely held theory that mrs browns death was one of three socalled sneering slayer murders while unable to explain certain similarities more more more i swallowed heavily and my head swam for a moment then i read on down the yellow stream into the additional dispatches tom had been lying under the cottages and had returned to consciousness from his drunken stupor he was miserable and thoroughly angry he had been sorely mistreated as he saw it she had lured him there and then laughed at him he crawled out from beneath one of the cottages and reentered hers she half hysterical and painfully burned and engaged in trying to beat out the fire in the bed had hurled herself at him he had brutally knocked her to the floor then frightened by what he had done he had hastily wiped up the room with his coat and fled there was no actual intent to kill of course but still he had brought about her death he had and i hadnt and i knew it was the truth well brownie stukey said i guess that cleans it up dont it i stared at him blankly thinking about tom judge thinking of how much alike tom and i were doubtless that was why i had always detested him so much because he was so accurate a mirror of my own faults tom demanded the benefit of all doubts but he could give no one the benefit of any a frown was suspicious but so also was a smile tom judge plowing stubbornly down one rocky path when he could have moved over into an easier and friendlier one he wouldnt try to reorient himself he wouldnt try to adapt himself to another way of life which while it would not have been wholly satisfactory could have been far better than the one he had not tom not me we preferred being miserable martyring ourselves living not as men but human gadflies you see keed i figured like everyone else that the three deaths were all tied together thats what had me thrown but when this judge character confessed i seen right away that you hadnt stukey had been right about me i hadnt wanted any change all i had wanted was to keep everyone under my thumb to gouge and nibble away at them while i watched them squirm dave randall he hadnt always let kay wear the pants in the family it was i not kay who had stripped him of all his selfconfidence she had merely taken over where i left off so that was the way it was then when i wearied of the game when i could no longer continue it i would kill myself or no no i would make them kill me i would do something so blatantly criminal so botched that they would know i was guilty and they would have to they would have to wouldnt they they couldnt leave me to go on into nothingness stukey was watching me narroweyed he said get it through your noggin keed you youre wrong i said toms lying i went over to the island that night we argued and she threatened me and and huhuh he wagged his head he aint lying anyway you couldnt have been over on the island that night you couldnt have got across the bay everyone knows that i tell you i did i hit her with the bottle i yeah how you goin to prove it and what if you did you want to be sent up for a couple of years on an assault charge brownie you want to lay around in a cell with no booze and nothin to do but think he chuckled softly but his round little eyes were like brown chunks of ice i killed mrs chasen i said i met her in los angeles when i went up for the funeral and you didnt kill her she killed herself i tell you i did kill her my voice rose i can tell you just how i did it id been out drinking and when i came back she was lying on the bed asleep and i told him he listened thoughtfully but his head wagged again so that was how he hesitated but you didnt kill her keed she was already dead i tell you what makes you think you remember them sleeping pills she had fivegrain amytals well we checked back on the prescription and shed had it filled the day before shed got thirty of those goofballs and there was only five left in her purse but that doesnt prove she took im tellin you keed we didnt have much in the way of a body to work on but there was plenty of blood and that blood was loaded with the goofer dust more than enough to kill her sure i kept it quiet the deal was futzed up enough as it was and it didnt make sense how in the hell if shed killed herself could she have wound up in the dog pound i figured maybe the coroner had called his shots wrong but well it makes sense now she was already dead when you hit her and by the way you didnt break her neck the coroner wouldve spotted that huhuh you hit her i guess but you didnt kill her he nodded firmly i reached for a cigarette then dropped it to the floor unlit and i was back there in the room with her looking down on her body her tense stretchedout straight body even her fingers stiff as dead wood dead all right thats what she was and somehow i must have known it half of me anyway half of me must have known it but the twoway pull had been working and the other half had to keep at it pushing and plunging and needling so i hit her and picked her up and tossed her into the dog pound even though i knew she was dead christ his eyes softened a little she was a pretty lonely little lady wasnt she keed from what i hear she didnt get along with most people so she was kind of nuts about you and you didnt know how to stave her off and well maybe youd better tell me what happened your guess would be better than mine i figure she must have found out what was wrong with you she mustve seen that things werent going to be like shed thought and i guess a little lady like that i guess she couldnt take it she didnt want to take it no one but you brownie if i couldnt have you you see keed once i got that first murder out of the way the real one the others fell right into line i could take em for what they were a suicide and an accident you dont know i said you cant be sure if i confessed to theyd put you in a nuthouse brownie they wouldnt give you the gas chamber constance wakefield was trying to blackmail me i stalled her and got her to take that late train and then i got on with her save it keed he held up his hand i got a pretty good idea of what you did and it dont make no difference see you didnt kill her you didnt ride over into the next county and shove her off the train it was just what it looked like an accident but i i okay he shrugged have it your own way a couple years for assault and battery six months for maiming a dead body a couple of years more on this wakefield deal whatever theyd call that about five years in the pen say if they believe you that or the nuthouse is that what you want keed my throat was dry i shook my head silently he sighed and the sound was weary and a little sad it aint much fun is it keed youve been slidin down the rope and havin a hell of a time for yourself and now youre at the bottom and all you can do is hang there you cant let go and you cant get anyone to give you a shove it wouldnt make em nothing they cant do your job for you it it aint much fun is it keed the teletypes were clicking again i turned and stared at them blankly at the words marching across the yellow paper across a vast and empty desert where a dead man walked through todays weather in southern and lower california cloudy with thunder showers this morning followed by you know what i figured on doin brownie why i came up here well i was goin to give you the old horse laugh keed you were at the end of the line i figured and youd be sittin here waiting for someone to pick you off maybe youd kidded yourself you was going to do a brodie but i knew you wouldnt you couldnt any moren you could have killed those other people youd make a pass at doin it but thatd be as far as it would go you couldnt carry through with it and like i been tellin you no one else is goin to do it there aint going to be no pinch no gas chamber no easy way out so i was going to lay it on the line for you and watch you squirm make you beg like youve made me beg laugh at you like youve laughed at me but well ill tell you something keed followed by clearing skies strong to moderate winds and theres one thing about bein a louse keed a nogood like maybe i am when youre that way youre not that way i said youre a long way from being a louse stuke i dont know why i ever thought im telling you when youre a louse yourself keed when you know youre a long way from being perfect yourself the other lice dont look so bad to you youre all in the same family and you dont hurt em unless you have to you dont make things no tougher on em than you have to look at me brownie he gripped me by the shoulders i aint laughin am i i didnt stay here to laugh im here to help you he gave me a little shake a brisk puffedlipped nod of his head i said theres just one way you can help stuke i huhuh he said firmly thats out keed i couldnt do it i aint goin to so forget it youre goin to snap out of it brownie youre goin to get your mind off of that off of yourself and start thinkin about something else that it aint everything it isnt it i said isnt it rather easy for you to talk stuke itd be easier not to keed a hell of a lot easier but you dont know you dont know what its like to keed he tapped me on the chest dont tell me what i dont know youd be talking for the next forty years and we aint got much time youve got to get cleaned up get yourself something to eat and a little sleep youve got to be in here on the job in the morning and youve got to work harder than you ever worked before youre going to go on swinging your weight against the rats and the cheaters in this town but this time youre going to swing it the right way it aint going to be a needle job its going to mean something remember what i told you the other night well i meant it if the graft wasnt here to take i wouldnt be taking it but you dont know i cant god how can i you aint got no choice he said his eyes were soft sympathetic friendly they were firm and unwavering i looked away from him to the teletype machines and the last lines of the weather forecast thunder showers in the afternoon possible clearing by evening end
