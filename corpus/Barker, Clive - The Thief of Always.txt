the thief of always copyright by clive barker all illustrations by clive barker i harvey halfdevoured the great gray beast february had eaten harvey swick alive here he was buried in the belly of that smothering month wondering if he would ever find his way out through the cold coils that lay between here and easter he didnt think much of his chances more than likely hed become so bored as the hours crawled by that one day hed simply forget to breathe then maybe people would get to wondering why such a fine young lad had perished in his prime it would become a celebrated mystery which wouldnt be solved until some great detective decided to recreate a day in harveys life then and only then would the grim truth be discovered the detective would first follow harveys route to school every morning trekking through the dismal streets then hed sit at harveys desk and listen to the pitiful drone of the history teacher and the science teacher and wonder how the heroic boy had managed to keep his eyes open and finally as the wasted day dwindled to dusk hed trace the homeward trek and as he set foot on the step from which he had departed that morning and people asked himas they wouldwhy such a sweet soul as harvey had died he would shake his head and say its very simple oh the curious crowd would say do tell and brushing away a tear the detective would reply harvey swick was eaten by the great gray beast february it was a monstrous month that was for sure a dire and dreary month the pleasures of christmas both sharp and sweet were already dimming in harveys memory and the promise of summer was so remote as to be mythical thered be a spring break of course but how far off was that five weeks six mathematics wasnt his strong point so he didnt irritate himself further by attemptingand failingto calculate the days he simply knew that long before the sun came to save him he would have withered away in the belly of the beast you shouldnt waste your time sitting up here his mom said when she came in and found him watching the raindrops chase each other down the glass of his bedroom window ive got nothing better to do harvey said without looking around well then you can make yourself useful his mom said harvey shuddered useful that was another word for hard labor he sprang up marshaling his excuseshe hadnt done this he hadnt done thatbut it was too late you can start by tidying up this room his mom said but dont sit wishing the days away honey lifes too short but thats a good boy and with that she left him to it muttering to himself he stared around the room it wasnt even untidy there were one or two games scattered around a couple of drawers open a few clothes hanging out it looked just fine i am ten he said to himself i mean its not like im a kid i dont have to tidy up just because she says so its boring he wasnt just muttering now he was talking out loud i want toi want to he went to the mirror and quizzed it what do i want the strawhaired snubnosed browneyed boy he saw before him shook his head i dont know what i want he said i just know ill die if i dont have some fun i will ill die as he spoke the window rattled a gust of wind blew hard against itthen a second then a thirdand even though harvey didnt remember the window being so much as an inch ajar it was suddenly thrown open cold rain spattered his face halfclosing his eyes he crossed to the window and fumbled to slam it making sure that the latch was in place this time the wind had started his lamp moving and when he turned back the whole room seemed to be swinging around one moment the light was blazing in his eyes the next it was flooding the opposite wall but in between the blaze and the flood it lit the middle of his room and standing thereshaking the rain off his hatwas a stranger he looked harmless enough he was no more than six inches taller than harvey his frame scrawny his skin distinctly yellowish in color he was wearing a fancy suit a pair of spectacles and a lavish smile who are you harvey demanded wondering how he could get past this interloper to the door dont be nervous the man replied teasing off one of his suede gloves taking harveys hand and shaking it my names rictus you are harvey swick arent you yes i thought for a moment id got the wrong house harvey couldnt take his eyes off rictuss grin it was wide enough to shame a shark with two perfect rows of gleaming teeth rictus took off his spectacles pulled a handkerchief from the pocket of his waterlogged jacket then started to mop off the raindrops either he or the handkerchief gave off an odor that was far from fragrant the smell in truth was flatulent youve got questions i can see that rictus said to harvey yeah ask away ive got nothing to hide well how did you get in for one thing through the window of course its a long way up from the street not if youre flying flying of course how else was i going to get around on a foul night like this it was either that or a rowboat we short folk gotta watch out when its raining this hard one wrong step and youre swimming he peered at harvey quizzically do you swim in the summer sometimes harvey replied wanting to get back to the business of flying but rictus took the conversation in another direction entirely on nights like this he said doesnt it seem like therell never be another summer it sure does said harvey you know i heard you sighing a mile off and i said to myself theres a kid who needs a vacation he consulted his watch if youve got the time that is the time for a trip boy for a trip you need an adventure young swick somewhereout of this world howd you hear me sighing when you were a mile away harvey wanted to know why should you care i heard you thats all that matters is it magic of some kind maybe why wont you tell me rictus gave harvey a beady stare i think youre too inquisitive for your own good thats why he said his smile decaying a little if you dont want help thats fine by me he made a move toward the window the wind was still gusting against the glass as though eager to come back in and carry its passenger away wait harvey said for what im sorry i wont ask any more questions rictus halted his hand on the latch no more questions eh i promise said harvey i told you im sorry so you did so you did rictus peered out at the rain i know a place where the days are always sunny he said and the nights are full of wonders could you take me there we said no questions boy we agreed oh yeah im sorry being a forgiving sort ill forget you spoke and ill tell you this if you want me to inquire on your behalf ill see if theyve got room for another guest id like that im not guaranteeing anything rictus said opening the latch i understand the wind gusted suddenly and blew the window wide the light began to swing wildly watch for me rictus yelled above the din of rain and wind harvey started to ask him if hed be coming back soon but stopped himself in the nick of time no questions boy rictus said and as he spoke the wind seemed to fill up his coat it rose around him like a black balloon and he was suddenly swept out over the windowsill questions trot the mind he hollered as he went keep your mouth shut and well see what comes your way and with that the wind carried him off the balloon of his coat rising like a black moon against the rainy sky ii the hidden way harvey said nothing about his peculiar visitor to either his mom or his dad in case they put locks on the windows to stop rictus returning to the house but the trouble with keeping the visit a secret was that after a few days harvey began to wonder if hed imagined the whole thing perhaps hed fallen asleep at the window he thought and rictus had simply been a dream he kept hoping nevertheless watch for me rictus had said and harvey did just that he watched from the window of his room he watched from his desk at school he even watched with one eye when he was lying on his pillow at night but rictus didnt show and then about a week after that first visit just as harveys hope was waning his watchfulness was rewarded on his way to school one foggy morning he heard a voice above his head and looked up to see rictus floating down from the clouds his coat swelled up around him so that he looked fatter than a prize pig howya doin he said as he descended i was starting to think id invented you harvey replied you know like a dream i get that a lot rictus said his smile wider than ever particularly from the ladies youre a dream come true they say he winked and who am i to argue you like my shoes harvey looked down at rictuss bright blue shoes they were quite a sight and he said so i got given em by my boss rictus said hes very happy youre going to come visit so are you ready well its no use wasting time rictus said there may not be room for you tomorrow can i just ask one question i thought we agreed i know but just one all right one is this place far from here nah its just across town so id only be missing a couple of hours of school thats two questions rictus said no im just thinking out loud rictus grunted look he said im not here to do a great song and dance persuading you i got a friend called jive does that im just a smiler i smile and i say come with me to the holiday house and if folks dont want to come he shrugged hey its their hard luck with that he turned his back on harvey wait harvey protested i want to come but just for a little while you can stay as long as you like rictus said or as little all i want to do is take that glum expression off your face and put one of these up there his grin grew even larger is there any crime in that no said harvey thats no crime im glad you found me i really am so what if he missed all of the morning at school he thought itd be no great loss maybe an hour or two of the afternoon as well as long as he was back home by three or four certainly before dark im ready to go he said to rictus lead the way millsap the town in which harvey had lived all his life wasnt very big and he thought hed seen just about all of it over the years but the streets he knew were soon behind them and though rictus was setting a fair speed harvey made sure he kept a mental list of landmarks along the way in case he had to find his way home on his own a butchers shop with two pigs heads hanging from hooks a church with a yard full of old tombs beside it the statue of some dead general covered from hat to stirrups in pigeon dung all these sights and more he noted and filed away and while they walked rictus kept up a stream of idle chatter i hate the fog just hate it he said and therell be rain by noon well be out of it of course he went on from talk of rain to the state of the streets look at this trash all over the sidewalk its shameful and the mud its making a fine old mess of my shoes he had plenty more to say but none of it was very enlightening so after a while harvey gave up listening how far was this holiday house he began to wonder the fog was chilling him and his legs were aching if they didnt get there soon he was going to turn back i know what youre thinking said rictus i bet you dont youre thinking this is all a trick youre thinking rictus is leading you on a mystery tour and theres nothing at the end of it isnt that true maybe a little well my boy ive got news for you look up ahead he pointed and therenot very far from where they stoodwas a high wall which was so long that it disappeared into the fog to right and left what do you see rictus asked him a wall harvey replied though the more he stared at it the less certain of this he was the stones which had seemed solid enough at first sight now looked to be shifting and wavering as though theyd been chiseled from the fog itself and piled up here to keep out prying eyes it looks like a wall harvey said but its not a wall youre very observant rictus replied admiringly most people just see a dead end so they turn around and take another street but not us no not us were going to keep on walking you know why because the holiday house is on the other side what a miraculous kid you are rictus replied thats exactly right are you hungry by the way starving well theres a woman waiting for you in the house called mrs griffin arid let me tell you she is the greatest cook in all of americaland i swear on my tailors grave anything you can dream of eating she can cook all you have to do is ask her deviled eggs he smacked his lips perfection i dont see a gate harvey said thats because there isnt one so how do we get in just keep walking half out of hunger half out of curiosity harvey did as rictus had instructed and as he came within three steps of the wall a gust of balmy flowerscented wind slipped between the shimmering stones and kissed his cheek its warmth was welcome after his long cold trek and he picked up his pace reaching out to touch the wall as he approached it the misty stones seemed to reach for him in their turn wrapping their soft gray arms around his shoulders and ushering him through the wall he looked back but the street hed stepped out of with its gray sidewalks and gray clouds had already disappeared beneath his feet the grass was high and full of flowers above his head the sky was midsummer blue and ahead of him set at the summit of a great slope was a house that had surely been first imagined in a dream he didnt wait to see if ricer was coming after him nor to wonder how the gray beast february had been slain and this warm day risen in its place he simply let out a laugh that rictus would have been proud of and hurried up the slope and into the shadow of the dream house iii pleasure and the worry what a fine thing it would be harvey thought to build a place like this to drive its foundations deep into the earth to lay its floors and hoist its walls to say where there was nothing i raised a house that would be a very fine thing it wasnt a puffedup peacock of a place either there were no marble steps no fluted columns it was a proud house certainly but there was nothing wrong with that it had much to be proud of it stood four stories high and boasted more windows than harvey could readily count its porch was wide as were the steps that led up to its carved front door its slated roofs were steep and crowned with magnificent chimneys and lightning rods its highest point however was neither a chimney nor a lightning rod but a large and elaborately wrought weathervane which harvey was peering up at when he heard the front door open and a voice say harvey swick as i live and breathe he looked down the weathervanes white silhouette still behind his eyes and there on the porch stood a woman who made his grandmother look young she had a face like a rolledup ball of cobwebs from which her hair which could also have been spiders work fell in wispy abundance her eyes were tiny her mouth tight her hands gnarled her voice however was melodious and its words welcoming i thought maybe youd decided not to come she said picking up a basket of freshly cut flowers shed left on the step which would have been a pity come on in theres food on the table you must be famished i cant stays long harvey said you must do whatever you wish came the reply im mrs griffin by the way yes rictus mentioned you i hope he didnt bend your ear too much he loves the sound of his own voice that and his reflection harvey had climbed the porch steps by now and stopped in front of the open door this was a moment of decision he knew though he wasnt quite certain why step inside mrs griffin said brushing a spiderhair back from her furrowed brow but harvey still hesitated and he might have turned around and never stepped inside the house except that he heard a boys voice yelling i got ya i got ya followed by uproarious laughter wendell mrs griffin said are you chasing the cats again the sound of laughter grew even louder and it was so full of good humor that harvey stepped over the threshold and into the house just so that he could see the face of its owner he only got a brief look a goofy bespectacled face appeared for a moment at the other end of the hallway then a piebald cat dashed between the boys legs and he was off after it yelling and laughing again hes such a crazy boy mrs griffin said but all the cats love him the house was more wonderful inside than out even on the short journey to the kitchen harvey glimpsed enough to know that this was a place built for games chases and adventures it was a maze in which no two doors were alike it was a treasurehouse where some notorious pirate had hidden his bloodstained booty it was a resting place for carpets flown by djinns and boxes sealed before the flood where the eggs of beasts that the earth had lost were wrapped and waiting for the suns heat to hatch them its perfect harvey murmured to himself mrs griffin caught his words nothings perfect she replied why not because time passes she went on staring down at the flowers shed cut and the beetle and the worm find their way into everything sooner or later hearing this harvey wondered what grief it was mrs griffin had known or seen to make her so mournful im sorry she said covering her melancholy with a tiny smile you didnt come here to listen to my dirges you came to enjoy yourself didnt you i guess i did harvey said so let me tempt you with some treats harvey sat himself down at the kitchen table and within sixty seconds mrs griffin had set a dozen plates of food in front of him hamburgers hot dogs and fried chicken mounds of buttered potatoes apple cherry and mud pies ice cream and whipped cream grapes tangerines and a plate of fruits he couldnt even name he set to eating with gusto and was devouring his second slice of pie when a freckled girl with long frizzy blond hair and huge bluegreen eyes ambled in you must be harvey she said how did you know wendell told me how did he know she shrugged he just heard im lulu by the way did you just arrive no ive been here for ages longer than wendell but not as long as mrs griffin nobodys been here as long as she has isnt that right almost said mrs griffin a little mysteriously do you want something to eat sweetie lulu shook her head no thanks i havent got much of an appetite at the moment she nevertheless sat down opposite harvey stuck her thumb in the mud pie and licked it clean who invited you here she asked a guy called rictus oh yeah the one with the grin thats him hes got a sister and two brothers she went on youve met them then not all of them lulu admitted they keep themselves to themselves but youll meet one or two of them sooner or later idont think ill be staying harvey said i mean my mom and dad dont even know im here sure they do lulu replied they just didnt tell you about it this confused harvey and he said so call your mom and dad lulu suggested ask em can i do that he wondered of course you can mrs griffin replied the phones in the hallway carrying a spoonful of ice cream with him harvey went to the phone and dialed at first there was a whining sound on the line as though a wind were in the wires then as it cleared he heard his mom say who is this before you start yelling he began oh honey his mom cooed did you arrive arrive you are at the holiday house i hope yes i am but oh good i was worried maybe youd lost your way do you like it there you knew i was coming harvey said catching lulus eye i told you she mouthed of course we knew his mom went on we invited mr rictus to show you the place you looked so sad you poor lamb we thought you needed a little fun really said harvey astonished by this turn of events we just want you to enjoy yourself his mom went on so you stay just as long as you want what about school he said you deserve a little time off came the reply dont you worry about anything just have a good time i will mom bye honey bye harvey came away from the conversation shaking his head in amazement you were right he said to lulu they arranged everything so now you dont have to feel guilty said lulu well i guess ill see you around later huh and with that she ambled away if youre finished eating mrs griffin said ill show you to your room id like that she duly led harvey up the stairs at the landing basking on the sundrenched windowsill was a cat with fur the color of the cloudless sky thats bluecat mrs griffin said you saw stewcat playing with wendell i dont know where cluecat is but hell find you he likes new guests do you have a lot of people coming here only children very special children like you and lulu and wendell mr hood wont have just anybody whos mr hood the man who built the holiday house mrs griffin replied will i meet him too mrs griffin looked discomfited by the question maybe she said her gaze averted but hes a very private man they were up on the landing by now and mrs griffin led harvey pasta row of painted portraits to a room at the back of the house it overlooked an orchard and the warm air carried the smell of ripe apples into tile room you look tired my sweet mrs griffin said maybe you should lie down for a little while harvey usually hated to sleep in the afternoon it reminded him too much of having the flu or the measles but the pillow looked very cool and comfortable and when mrs griffin had taken her leave he decided to lie down just for a few minutes either he was more tired than hed thought or the calm and comfort of the house rocked him into a slumber whichever his eyes closed almost as soon as he put his head on the pillow and they did not open again until morning iv a death between seasons the sun came to wake him soon after dawna straight white dart of light laid on his lids he sat up with a start wondering for a moment what bed this was what room what house then his memories of the previous day returned and he realized that hed slept through from late afternoon to early morning the rest had strengthened him he felt energetic and with a whoop of pleasure he jumped out of bed and got dressed the house was more welcoming than ever today the flowers mrs griffin had set on every table and sill singing with color the front door stood open and sliding down the gleaming banisters harvey raced out onto the porch to inspect the morning a surprise awaited him the trees which had been heavy with leaves the previous afternoon had shed their canopies there were new tiny buds on every branch and twig as though this were the first day of spring another day another dollar said wendell ambling around the corner of the house what does that mean said harvey its what my father used to say all the time another day another dollar hes a banker my dad wendell hamilton the second and me im wendell hamilton the third howd ya know lucky guess im harvey yeah i know dya like tree houses i never had one wendell pointed up at the tallest tree there was a platform perched up among the branches with a rudimentary house built upon it ive been working up there for weeks said wendell but i cant get it finished alone ya want to help me sure but ive got to eat something first go eat ill be around harvey headed back inside and found mrs griffin setting out a breakfast fit for a prince there was milk spilt on the floor and a cat with a tail hooked like a question mark lapping it up cluecat he said yes indeed mrs griffin said fondly hes the wicked one cluecat looked up as if he knew he was being talked about then he jumped up onto the table and searched among the plates of pancakes and waffles for something more to eat can he do whatever he likes harvey said watching the cat sniff at this and that i mean does nobody control him ah well we all have somebody watching over us dont we mrs griffin replied whether we like it or not now eat youve got some wonderful times ahead of you harvey didnt need a second invitation he dug into his second meal at the holiday house with even more appetite than he had the first and then headed out to meet the day oh what a day it was the breeze was warm and smelled of the green scent of growing things the perfect sky was full of swooping birds he sauntered through the grass his hands in his pockets like the lord of all he surveyed calling to wendell as he approached the trees can i come up if youve got a head for heights wendell dared him the ladder creaked as he climbed but he made the platform without missing a step wendell was impressed not bad for a new boy he said we had two kids here couldnt even get halfway up whered they go back home i spose kids come and go you know harvey peered out through the branches upon which every bud was bursting you cant see much can you he said i mean theres no sign of the town at all who cares said wendell its just gray out there anyway and its sunny here harvey said staring down at the wall of misty stones that divided the grounds of the house from the outside world hows that possible wendells answer was the same again who cares he said i know i dont now are we going to start building or what they spent the next two hours working on the tree house descending a dozen times to dig through the timbers heaped beside the orchard looking for boards to finish their repairs by noon theyd not only found enough wood to fix the roof but they had each found a friend harvey liked wendells bad jokes and that who cares which found its way into every other sentence and wendell seemed just as happy to have harveys company youre the first kid whos been real fun he said what about lulu what about her isnt she any fun she was okay when i first arrived wendell admitted i mean shes been here months so she kinda showed me the place but shes gotten weird the last few days i see her sometimes wanderin around like shes sleepwalkin with a blank expression on her face shes probably going crazy harvey said her brains turning to mush do you know about that stuff wendell wanted to know his face lighting up with ghoulish delight sure i do harvey lied my dads a surgeon wendell was most impressed by this and for the next few minutes listened in gaping envy as harvey told him about all the operations hed seen skulls sawn open and legs sawn off feet sewn on where hands used to be and a man with a boil on his behind that grew into a talking head you swear said wendell i swear said harvey thats so cool all this talk brought on a fierce hunger and at wendells suggestion they climbed down the ladder and wandered into the house to eat what do you want to do this afternoon he asked harvey as they sat down at the table its going to be real hot it always is is there anywhere we can swim wendell frowned well yeshe said doubtfully theres a lake around the other side of the house but you wont much like it why not the waters so deep you cant even see the bottom are there any fish oh sure maybe we could catch some mrs griffin could cookem for us at this mrs griffin who was at the stove piling up a plate with onion rings gave a little shout and dropped the plate she turned to harvey her face ashen you dont want to do that she said why not harvey replied i thought i could do whatever i wanted well yes of course you can she told him but i wouldnt want you to get sick the fish arepoisonous you see oh said harvey well maybe we wont eatem after all look at this mess mrs griffin said fussing to cover her confusion i need a new apron she hurried away to fetch one leaving harvey and wendell to exchange puzzled looks now i really have to see those fish harvey said as he spoke the ever inquisitive cluecat jumped up onto the counter beside the stove and before either of the boys could move to stop him he had his paws up on the lip of one of the pans hey get down harvey told him the cat didnt care to take orders he hoisted himself up onto the rim of the pan to sniff at its contents his tail flicking back and forth the next moment disaster the tail danced too close to one of the burners and burst into flames cluecat yowled and tipped over the pan he was perched upon a wave of boiling water washed him off the top of the stove and he fell to the ground in a smoking heap whether drowned scalded or incinerated the end was the scone he hit the floor dead the din brought mrs griffin hurrying back i think im going to go eat outside wendell said as the old woman appeared at the door he snatched up a couple hot dogs and was gone oh my lord mrs griffin cried when she set eyes on the dead cat ohyou foolish thing it was an accident harvey said sickened by what had happened he was up on the stove foolish thing foolish thing was all mrs griffin seemed able to say she sank down onto her knees and stared at the sad little sack of burned fur no more questions from you she finally murmured the sight of mrs griffins unhappiness made harveys eyes sting but he hated to have anyone see him cry so he fought back his tears as best he could and said shall i help you bury him in his gruffest voice mrs griffin looked around thats very sweet of you she said soy but theres no need you go out and play i dont want to leave you on your own harvey said oh look at you child mrs griffin said youve got tears on your cheeks harvey blushed and wiped them away with the back of his hand dont be ashamed to weep mrs griffin said its a wonderful thing i wish i could still shed a tear or two youre sad harvey said i can see that what i feel is not quite sadness mrs griffin replied and its not much solace either im afraid whats solace harvey asked its something soothing mrs griffin said getting to her feet something that heals the pain in your heart and you dont have any of that no i dont mrs griffin said she reached out and touched harveys cheek except maybe in these tears of yours they comfort me she sighed as she traced their tracks with her fingers your tears are sweet child and so are you now you go out into the light and enjoy yourself theres sun on the step and it wont be there forever believe me are you sure im sure ill see you later then harvey said and headed out into the afternoon v the prisoners the temperature had risen while harvey had been at lunch a heathaze hovered over the lawn and it made the trees around the house shimmer he headed toward them calling wendells name as he went there was no reply he glanced back toward the house thinking he might see wendell at one of the windows but they were all reflecting the pristine blue he looked from house to heavens there was not a cloud in sight and now a suspicion stole upon him which grew into a certainty as his gaze wandered back to the shimmering copse and the flowers underfoot during the hour hed spent in the cool of the kitchen the season had changed summer had come to mr hoods holiday house a summer as magical as the spring that had preceded it that was why the sky was so faultlessly blue and the birds making such music the leafladen branches were no less content nor the blossoms in the grass nor the bees that buzzed from bloom to bloom gathering the seasons bounty all were in bliss it would not be a long season harvey guessed if the spring had been over in a morning then most likely this perfect summer would not outlast the afternoon id better make the most of it he thought and hurried in search of wendell he finally discovered his friend sitting in the shade of the trees with a pile of comics at his side wanna sit down and read he asked maybe later said harvey first i want to go look at this lake you were talking about are you going to come what for i told you its no fun all right ill go on my own you wont stay long wendell remarked and went back to his reading though harvey had a good idea of the lakes general whereabouts the bushes on that side of the house were thick and thorny and it took him several minutes to find a way through them by the time he caught sight of the lake itself the sweat on his face and back was clammy and his arms had been scratched and bloodied by barbs as wendell had predicted the lake wasnt worth the trouble it was largeso large that the far side was barely visiblebut gloomy and dreary both the lake and the dark stones around it covered with a film of green scum there was a legion of flies buzzing around in search of something rotten to feed on and harvey guessed theyd have no trouble finding a feast this was a place where dead things belonged he was about to leave when a movement in the shadows caught his eye somebody was standing further along the bank almost eclipsed by the mesh of thicket he moved a few paces closer to the lake and saw that it was lulu she was perched on the slimy stones at the very edge of the water gazing into their depths speaking in a near whisper for fear hed startle her harvey said it looks cold she glanced up at him her face full of confusion and then without a word of replyturned and bounded away through the bushes wait harvey called hurrying toward the lake lulu had already disappeared however leaving the thicket shaking he might have gone in pursuit of her but the sound of bubbles breaking in the lake took his gaze to the waters and there moving just below the coating of scum he saw the fish they were almost as large as he was their gray scales stained and encrusted their bulbous eyes turned up toward the surface like the eyes of prisoners in a watery pit they were watching him he was certain of that and their scrutiny made him shudder were they hungry he wondered and praying to their fishy gods that hed slip on the stones and tumble in or were they wishing hed come with a rod and a line so that they could be hauled from the depths and put out of their misery what a life he thought no sun to warm them no flowers to sniff at or games to play just the deep dark waters to circle in and circle and circle and circle it made him dizzy just watching and he feared that if he lingered much longer hed lose his balance and join them gasping with relief he turned his back on the sight and returned into the sunlight as fast as the barbs would allow wendell was still sitting underneath the tree he had two bottles of icecold soda in the grass beside him and lobbed one to harvey as he approached well he said you were right harvey replied nobody in their right minds ever goes there i saw lulu what did i tell you wendell crowed nobody in their right minds and those fish yeah i know wendell said pulling a face ugly boogers arent they why would mr hood have fish like that i mean everything else is so beautiful the lawns the house the orchard who cares said wendell i do said harvey i want to know everything there is to know about this place why so i can tell my mom and dad about it when i go home home said wendell who needs it weve got everything we need here id still like to know how all this works is there some kind of machine making the seasons change wendell pointed up through the branches at the sun does that look mechanical to you he said dont be a dope harvey this is all real its magic but its real you think so its too hot to think wendell replied now sit down and shut up he tossed a few comics in harveys direction look through these find yourself a monster for tonight whats happening tonight halloween of course wendell said it happens every night harvey plunked himself down beside wendell opened his soda and began to leaf through the comics thinking as he leafed and sipped that maybe wendell was right and it was too hot to think however this miraculous place worked it seemed real enough the sun was hot the soda was cold the sky was blue the grass was green what more did he need to know somewhere in the middle of these musings he must have dozed off because he woke with a start to find that the sun was no longer dappling the ground around him and wendell was no longer reading at his side he reached for his soda but the bottle had fallen over and the scent of sweet cherry had attracted hundreds of ants they were crawling over it and into it many drowning for their greed as he got to his feet the first real breeze hed felt since noon blew and a leaf its edges sere spiraled down to land at his feet autumn he murmured to himself until this moment standing beneath the creaking boughs watching the wind shake down the leaves autumn had always seemed to him the saddest of seasons it meant that summer was over and the nights would be growing long and cold but now as the drizzle of leaves became a deluge and the patter of acorns and chestnuts a drumming he laughed to see and hear its coming by the time he was out from under the trees he had leaves in his hair and down his back and was kicking them up with every racing step as he reached the porch the first clouds hed seen all afternoon crept over the sun and their shadow made the house which had wavered in the heat of the afternoon like a mirage suddenly loom dark and solid youre real he said as he stood panting on the porch you are arent you he started to laugh at the foolishness of talking to a house but the smile went from his face as a voice so soft he was barely certain he heard it said what do you think child he looked for the speaker but there was nobody at the threshold nor out on the porch nor on the steps behind him who said that he demanded there was no answer which he was glad of it hadnt been a voice at all he told himself it had been a creak of the boards underfoot or the rustling of dry leaves in the grass but he stepped into the house with his heart beating a little faster reminding himself as he went that questions werent welcome here what did it matter anyway he thought whether this was a real place or a dream it felt real and that was all that mattered satisfied with this he raced through the house into the kitchen where mrs griffin was weighing the table down with treats vi seen and unseen well said wendell as they ate what are you going to be tonight i dont know harvey said what are you going to be a hangman he said with a spaghetti grin ive been learning how to tie nooses now all ive got to do is find someone to hang he eyed mrs griffin its quick he said you just drop em andsnaptheir necks break thats horrible mrs griffin said why do boys always love talking about ghosts and murders and hangings because its exciting wendell said youre monsters she replied with a hint of a smile thats what you are monsters harvey is wendell said ive seen him filing down his teeth is it a full moon harvey said smearing ketchup around his mouth and putting on a twitch i hope so i need bloodfresh blood good said wendell you can be a vampire ill hangem and you can suck their blood horrible mrs griffin said again just horrible perhaps the house had heard harvey wishing for a full moon because when he and wendell traipsed upstairs and looked out the landing window therehanging between the bare branches of the treeswas a moon as wide and as white as a dead mans smile look at it harvey said i can see every crater its perfect oh thats just the start wendell promised and led harvey to a large musty room which had been filled with clothes of every description some were hung on hooks and coat hangers some were in baskets like actors costumes still more were heaped at the far end of the room on the dusty floor and halfhidden until wendell cleared the way was a sight that made harvey gasp a wall covered from floor to ceiling with masks where did they all come from harvey said as he gaped at this spectacle mr hood collects them wendell explained and the clothes are just stuff that kids who visited here left behind harvey wasnt interested in the clothes it was the masks that mesmerized him they were like snowflakes no two alike some were made of wood and of plastic some of straw and cloth and papiermвchй some were as bright as parrots others as pale as parchment some were so grotesque he was certain theyd been carved by crazy people others so perfect they looked like the death masks of angels there were masks of clowns and foxes masks like skulls decorated with real teeth and one with carved flames instead of hair take your pick said wendell theres bound to be a vampire somewhere whatever i come in here wanting to find i find it sooner or later harvey decided to leave the pleasure of choosing a mask until last and concentrated instead on digging up something suitably batlike to wear as he worked through the piles of clothes he found himself wondering about the children whod left them here though hed always hated history lessons he knew some of the jackets and shoes and shirts and belts had been out of fashion for many many years where were their owners now dead he presumed or so old it made no difference the thought of these garments belonging to dead folk brought a little shudder to his spine which was only right this was halloween after all and what was halloween without a few chills after a few minutes of searching he found along black coat with a collar he could turn up which wendell pronounced very vampiric well satisfied with his choice he went back to the wall of faces and his eyes almost immediately alighted upon a mask he hadnt previously seen with the pallor and deep sockets of a soul just risen from the tomb he took it down and put it on it fitted perfectly what do i look like harvey asked turning to face wendell who had found an executioners mask which fitted him just as well ugly as sin good there was a flickering family of pumpkin heads lined up on the porch when they stepped outside and the misty air smelled of wood smoke where do we go trickortreating harvey wanted to know out in the street no said wendell its not halloween out in the real world remember were going to go around to the back of the house thats not very far harvey remarked disappointed it is at this time of night wendell said creepily this house is full of surprises youll see harvey looked up at the house through the tiny eyeholes of his mask it loomed as large as a thunderhead its weathervane sharp enough to stab the stars come on said wendell weve got a long trip ahead a long trip harvey thought how could it be a long trip from the front of the house to the back but once again wendell was right the house was full of surprises the trip which would have been a twominute walk in the bright afternoonsoon became a trek that had harvey wishing hed brought a flashlight and a map the leaves rustled underfoot as though snakes were swarming through them the trees that had shaded them by day now looked frightful in their nakedness gaunt and hungry why am i doing this he asked himself as he followed wendell through the darkness im cold and im uncomfortable as he was about to suggest they turn back wendell pointed up and hissed look harvey looked directly overhead a form was moving silently against the sky as if it had just launched itself from the eaves of the house the moon had slunk away behind the roof and shed no light upon this nightflyer so harvey could only guess at its shape from the stars it blotted out as it sailed its wings were wide but raggedtoo ragged to bear it up he thought instead it seemed to claw at the darkness as it went as though it were crawling on the very air itself a glimpse was all harvey had then it was gone what teas that he whispered he got no answer in the moments hed taken staring up at the sky wendell had disappeared wendell harvey whispered where are you there was still no reply just the slithering in the leaves and the moan of hungry branches i know what youre doing harvey said louder this time and you wont scare me that easy hear me this time there was a reply of sorts not words but a creaking sound from somewhere in the trees hes climbing up into the tree house harvey thought and determined to catch wendell and scare him back he followed the sound despite the nakedness of the branches their mesh kept all but a glimmer of starlight from falling on the groves he slipped his mask down around his neck so as to see a little better but even then he was nearly blind and had to listen out for the sound of wendells ascent to guide him he could still hear the creaks plainly enough and stumbled in their direction his arms outstretched to grasp the ladder when he reached it now the sound was so loud he was certain he must be standing beneath the tree he looked up hoping to catch a glimpse of the trickster but as he did so something brushed his face he snatched at it but it was gone at least for the moment then it came again brushing his brow from the other side he snatched at it a second time then as it touched him again caught hold of it got you he cried his yell of triumph was followed by a rush of air and the sound of something crashing to the ground at his side he jumped but refused to let go of whatever he was holding wendell he called by way of a reply a flame flared in the darkness behind him and a firework erupted into a shower of green sparks its light making a gangrenous cavern of the grove by its flickering light he saw what he held and seeing let out a panicked yammering that had the crows rising from their roosts overhead it was not a ladder hed heard creaking it was a rope no not even a rope a noose and in his hand the leg of the man hanging from the noose he let go of it and stumbled backward barely suppressing a second shout as his eyes rose to meet the dead mans stare to judge by his expression he had died horribly his tongue lolled from his foamy lips his veins were so swollen with blood his head looked like a pumpkin either that or it was a pumpkin a fresh fountain of sparks now burst from the firework and harvey saw the truth of the matter the limb hed held was a stuffed trouser leg the body a coat spilling bundles of clothes that head a mask on a pumpkin with cream for spittle and eggs for eyes wendell he yelled turning his back on this scene of execution wendell was standing on the far side of the firework his eartoear grin lit by its spitting sparks he looked like a little demon fresh from the inferno at his side was the ladder that had come crashing down to get the drama underway i warned ya wendell said holding up his mask i said i was going to be a hangman tonight ill get you back for his harvey said his heart still beating too fast for him to see the funny side of this i swearill get you back you can try wendell crowed the firework was beginning to fizzle out the shadows around them beginning to deepen again had enough of halloween for tonight he asked harvey didnt much like admitting defeat but he nodded grimly swearing to himself that when he finally got his revenge it would be choice smile wendell said as the fountain of sparks dwindled were in the holiday house the light had almost gone and even though harvey was still enraged at wendell he couldnt let it die away without making peace all right he said allowing himself a tiny smile therell be other nights always said wendell the reply pleased him thats what this place is he said as the light went out its the house of always vii a present from the pass there was a thanksgiving feast awaiting them when they got back into the house you look as though youve been in the wars mrs griffin remarked when she set eyes on harvey has wendell been up to his tricks harvey admitted that hed fallen for all of them but there was one that impressed him in particular what was that said wendell with a smug grin the falling ladder that was a clever little touch wasnt it no not the ladder said harvey what then the thing in the sky oh that what was it a kite that wasnt my doing wendell replied what was it then i dont know wendell said his smile disappearing better not to ask eh but i want to know harvey insisted turning to mrs griffin it had wings and i think it flew off the roof then it was a bat mrs griffin said no this was a hundred times bigger than a bat he spread his arms great dark wings mrs griffin frowned as harvey spoke you imagined it she said i did not harvey protested why dont you just sit down and eat mrs griffin replied if it wasnt a bat then it wasnt anything at all but wendell saw it too didnt you wendell he looked around at the other boy who was digging into a steaming plate of turkey and cranberry sauce who cares wendell said chewing as he spoke just tell her you saw it wendell shrugged maybe i did maybe i didnt its halloween night theres supposed to be bogeymen out there but not real ones said harvey a tricks one thing but if that beast was real as he spoke he realized he was breaking the rule hed made on the porch whether the winged creature was real or not didnt matter this was a place of illusions wouldnt he be happier here if he just stopped questioning what was real and what wasnt sit down and eat mrs griffin said again harvey shook his head his appetite had disappeared he was angry though he wasnt quite sure at whom maybe at wendell for his shrugs or at mrs griffin for not believing him or at himself for being afraid of illusions maybe all three im going up to my room to change he said and left the kitchen he discovered lulu on the landing staring out the window wind gusted against the glass reminding harvey of rictuss first visit it wasnt rain the gusts were bringing however it was powdery snow itll be christmas soon she said will it therell be presents for everyone there always are you should wish for something is that what youre doing she shook her head no she said ive been here so long ive got everything i ever wanted would you like to see harvey said yes and she led him up the stairs to her room which was immense and filled with her treasures she obviously had a passion for boxes tiny jeweled boxes large carved boxes a box for her collection of glass balls a box that played tinkling music a box into which half a hundred smaller boxes fitted she also had several families of dolls who sat in blankfaced rows around the walls but more impressive by far was the house from which the dolls had been exiled it stood in the middle of the room five feet high from step to chimney top every detail of brick slate and sill perfect this is where i keep my friends lulu said and opened the front door two bright green lizards came out to greet her scurrying up her arms onto her shoulders the rest are inside she said take a look harvey peered through the windows and found that every perfect room in the house was occupied there were lizards lounging on the beds lizards snoozing in the baths lizards swinging from the chandeliers he laughed out loud at their antics arent they fun lulu said great he replied you can come up and play with them any time you want thanks theyre really very friendly they only bite when theyre hungry here she plucked one off her shoulder and dropped it into harveys hands it promptly ran up and perched on his head much to lulus amusement they enjoyed the company of both the lizards and each other for a long while until harvey caught a glimpse of his reflection in one of the windows and remembered what a sight he was id better go and wash he told lulu ill see you later she smiled at him i like you harvey swick she said hey honesty made him honest i like you too he told her then his expression darkening he said i wouldnt want anything to happen to you she looked puzzled i saw you at the lake he said did you she replied i dont remember well anyway its deep you should be careful you could slip and fall in ill be careful she said as he opened the door oh and harvey yes dont forget to wish for something what shall i ask for he wondered as he washed the dirt off his face something impossible maybe to see just how much magic the house possessed a white tiger perhaps a fullsized zeppelin a ticket to the moon the answer came from the depths of his memory hed wish for a present hed been given a long time ago a present that his father had made for him which mr hood however much he might want to please his new guest would never be able to duplicate the ark he murmured with his face washed and the scratches hed got from the thorns in the thicket worn like war wounds he headed back downstairs to find that once again the house had performed an extraordinary transformation a christmas treeso tall that the star at its summit pricked the ceilingstood in the hallway the colors of its twinkling lights seeping into every room there was a smell of chocolate in the air and the sound of carols being sung in the living room mrs griffin was sitting beside a roaring fire with stewcat purring on her lap wendells gone outside she told harvey theres a scarf and gloves for you by the front door harvey went out onto the porch the wind was icy but it was already clearing the snow clouds leaving the stars to shine down on a perfect white carpet not quite perfect a trail of tracks led down from the house to the spot where wendell was building a snowman coming out he hollered to harvey his voice as clear as the bells that were ringing through the crisp air harvey shook his head he was so tired even the snow looked comfortable maybe tomorrow he said itll be back tomorrow wont it of course wendell yelled and the night after and the night after harvey went back inside to look at the christmas tree its branches were hung with strings of popcorn and cranberries with colored lights and baubles and soldiers in gleaming silver uniforms theres something under there for you mrs griffin said standing at the living room door i hope its what you want sweet harvey knelt down and pulled a parcel with his name on it out from under the tree his pulse quickened before he even opened it because he knew from its shape and from the way it rattled that his wish had been answered he pulled at the string remembering as he did so how much littler his hands had been the first time hed held this gift the paper tore and fell away and there shiny and new was a painted wooden ark it was a perfect copy of the one his father had made the same yellow hull the same orange prow the same wheelhouse with holes in its red roof for the giraffes to put their heads through the same lead animals all in pairs snug in the hold or peering through the portholes two dogs two elephants two camels two doves all these and a dozen more and finally the same little noah with his square white beard and his fat wife complete with apron how did he know harvey murmured he hadnt intended the question to be heard much less answered but mrs griffin said mr hood knows every dream in your head but this is perfect harvey said in amazement look my dad ran out of blue paint when he was finishing the elephants so one of them has blue eyes and the other one has green eyes its the same its exactly the same does it please you then mrs griffin asked harvey said it did but that wasnt entirely the truth it was eerie to have the ark back in his hands when he knew the real one had been lost as though time had been turned on its heels and he was a little kid again he heard wendell stamping the snow off his feet at the front door and was suddenly embarrassed to have such a childish present in his hands he gathered it up in its wrapping and hurried away upstairs intending to head back down for some supper but his bed looked too welcoming to be refused and his stomach quite full enough for one night so instead he closed the curtains on the gusty night and laid his head down on his pillow the christmas bells were still ringing in some distant steeple and their repetition lulled him into sleep he dreamed that he was standing on the steps of his house looking through the open door into its warm heart then the wind caught hold of him turning him from the threshold and carrying him away into a dreamless sleep vii hungry waters that first day in the holiday house with all its seasons and its spectacles set the pattern for the many that were to follow when harvey woke the following morning the sun was once again pouring through a crack in the curtains but this time it lay in a warm pool on the pillow beside him he sat up with a shout and a smile and either one or the other remained on his lips for the rest of the day there was plenty to do work on the tree house in the spring morning followed by food and the laying of plans for the afternoon games and lazy hours in the heat of summersometimes with wendell sometimes with luluthen adventures by the light of a harvest moon and finally when the winter wind had blown out the flames in the pumpkin heads and carpeted the grounds with snow chilly fun for them all out in the frosty air and a warm christmas welcome when they were done it was a day of holidays the third as fine as the second and the fourth as fine as the third and very soon harvey began to forget that there was a dull world out beyond the wall where the great beast february was still sleeping its tedious sleep his only real reminder of the life hed leftbesides a second telephone call hed made to his mom and dad just to tell them all was wellwas the present hed wished for and received that first christmas his ark hed thought several times of trying it out on the lake to see if it would float but it wasnt until the afternoon of the seventh day that he got around to doing so wendell had made a real glutton of himself at lunch and had declared that it was far too hot to play so harvey wandered down to the lake on his own with the ark tucked under his arm he half expectedhoped in fact to find lulu down there to keep him company but the banks of the lake were empty once he laid eyes on the gloomy waters he almost gave upon the idea of a launching but that meant admitting something to himself that he didnt wish to admit so he headed on down to the shore found a rock to perch on that looked less precarious than the others and set his ark on the water it floated well he was pleased to see he pushed it to and fro for a little while then lifted it out and peered inside to see if it was leaking it was quite watertight however so he set it back on the lake and pushed it out again as he did so he caught sight of a fish rising from the bottom of the lake its mouth wide open as if it intended to swallow his little vessel whole he reached out to snatch the ark from the water before it was either sunk or devoured but in his haste he lost his footing on the slimeslickened rock and with a cry he fell into the lake the water was icy cold and eager it quickly closed over his head he flailed wildly trying not to imagine the dark depths beneath him or the vast maw of the fish that had been rising from those depths turning his face up toward the surface he started to swim he could see his ark floating above him capsized by his fall its lead passengers were already sinking he didnt try and save them but surfacedgasping for breathand paddled toward the shore it wasnt much of a distance in less than a minute he was hauling himself up onto the rocks and scrambling away from the bank water pouring from his sleeves and trousers and shoes only when his feet were well clear of the lake and no hungry fish could snap at his toes did he drop down onto the ground though it was midsummer and the sun was blazing somewhere overhead the air around the lake was cold and he soon began to shiver before he made his way out into the sun however he looked for some sign of his ark the spot where it had sunk was marked by a forlorn flotilla of wreckage all of which would soon join the rest of the ark at the bottom of the fish that had seemed so eager to devour him there was no sign perhaps it had swum down into the depths to chew on the drowned menagerie if so harvey hoped it choked on its dinner hed lost plenty of toys before hed had a brand new bicyclehis prize possessionstolen from the step of his house two birthdays ago but this loss upset him as much more in fact the idea that the lake now had something that hed owned was somehow worse than a thief running off with his bike a thief was warm flesh and blood the lake was not his possessions had gone into a nightmare place full of monstrous things and he felt as though a little part of himself had gone with it down into the dark he walked away from the lake without looking back but the breeze that came to warm his face when he broke through the thicket and the sound of birds that pleased his ear could not keep from his mind the thought hed tried to ignore when hed gone down to the water despite all entertainments that the holiday house supplied so eagerly it was a haunted place and however hard he had tried to ignore his doubts and suppress his questions they could be ignored and suppressed no longer whoever or whatever that haunter was harvey could not be content now until hed seen its face and knew its nature ix what do you dream harvey didnt mention what had happened at the lake to anyonenot even luluin part because he felt stupid for falling in and in part because the house tried so hard to please him in the days that followed that he almost forgot about the accident entirely that very night in fact he found a piece of colored string with his name tag on it at the base of the christmas tree and followed it through the house to find a new bikeeven more splendid than the one hed lost two years beforewaiting for him but that was just the first of many fine surprises the holiday house sprang in quick succession one morning for instance wendell and harvey climbed up into the tree house to discover that the branches around it were swarming with parrots and monkeys another day in the middle of thanksgiving dinner mrs griffin called them through into the living room where the flames of the fire had taken on the shapes of dragons and heroes and were doing fiery battle in the grate and in the heat of one lazy afternoon harvey was wakened from a doze by a chorus of shouts and found a troupe of mechanical acrobats performing clockworkdefying feats on the lawn the greatest surprise however began with the appearance of one of rictuss siblings my name is jive he said stepping out of the early evening murk at the top of the stairs every muscle in his body seemed to be in motion tics jigs and jitterings that had wasted him away until he barely cast a shadow even his hair which was a mass of oiled curls seemed to hear some crazed rhythm it writhed on his scalp in a knotted frenzy brother rictus sent me along to see how youre doin he said his tones succulent im doing fine harvey replied did you say brother rictus were from the same brood loosely speaking jive said i hope you call your family now and then yep said harvey i called them yesterday are they missin you didnt sound like it are you missin them harvey shrugged not really he said youre going to make the most of bein here then said jive practicing a weird little dance step up and down the stairs yeah said harvey i just want to have fun who doesnt jive grinned who doesnt he sidled up to harvey and whispered speakin of fun what said harvey you never did get wendell back for that trick of his no i didnt said harvey why the heck not i could never think of a way oh im sure we could cook something up between the two of us jive replied mischievously it has to be something hell never think of harvey said that shouldnt be difficult said jive tell me whats your favorite monster harvey didnt have to think hard about that a vampire he said with a grin i found this great mask masks are a good beginning jive said but vampires need to swoop out of the mist he spread his arms curling his long fingers like the claws of some eyegouging beast swoop down snatch up their prey then rise up again up against the moon i can see it now so can i said harvey but im not a bat so so how do i swoop ah said jive well have marr work on that for us after all whats a halloween without a transformation or two he consulted the grandfather clock on the landing weve still got time to do it tonight you go down and tell wendell youll meet him outside ill go up on to the roof and find marr you meet us up there ive never been up on the roof theres a door on the top landing ill see you up there in a few minutes ill have to get my mask an coat an stuff you wont need a mask tonight jive said trust me now you hurry up times awastin it took harvey only a minute or two to tell wendell to go on ahead he was sure wendell suspected something and was probably preparing some counterattack but harvey knew he and jive had something up their sleeves even wendellexpert on shock tactics though he wascouldnt anticipate with the first part of the plan laid he hurried upstairs again found the door jive had mentioned and climbed up onto the roof heights had never bothered him he liked to be up above the world looking down on it over here jive called to him and harvey took off along the narrow walkways and up the steep roofs to where his fellow conspirator stood surefooted jive observed no problem how bout flyin said a third voice as its owner stepped from the shadows of a chimney this is marr jive said another of our little family unlike jive who looked nimble enough to walk on the eaves if the whim took him marr seemed to have slug blood in her somewhere harvey almost expected to see her fingers leave silver trails on the brick she touched or see soft horns appear from her balding head she was grossly fat her flesh barely clinging to her bones wherever it couldaround her mouth and eyes at her neck and wristsit collapsed in clammy folds she reached out and poked harvey i said what bout flyin what about it harvey said pushing her hand away done much i flew to florida once she doesnt mean in a plane jive told him oh in dreams maybe said mart oh yeah i dream about flying thats good marr replied grinning with satisfaction she had not a single tooth in her mouth harvey stared at the empty maw in disgust youre wondering where theyve gone arent you she said to harvey go on admit it harvey shrugged well yes i am carna took them the thieving brute i had fine teeth beautiful teeth whos carna harvey wanted to know never mind jive said hushing marr before she could reply get to it or hell miss the moment marr muttered something beneath her breath then said come to me boy extending her arms in harveys direction her touch was icy feels weird huh said jive as mares fingers floated over his face brushing it here and there dont worry she knows what shes doin and whats that changin you into what you tell her jive said it wont last long so enjoy it go on tell her about being a vampire thats what i want wendell to see harvey said a vampire marr said softly her fingers pressing harder against his skin yeah i want to have fangs like a wolf and a red throat and white skin like ive been dead for a thousand years two thousand said jive ten thousand said harvey beginning to enjoy the game and crazy eyes that can see in the dark and pointy ears like a bats ears wait up marr said ive got to get all this right her fingers were working hard upon him now as though his flesh was clay and she was molding it his face was tingling and he wanted to reach up and touch it but he was afraid of spoiling her handiwork and theres got to be fur jive observed sleek black fur on his neck mares hands dabbled at his throat and he felt fur sprouting where shed touched him and the wings harvey said dont forget the wings never said jive spread your arms boy marr told him he did so and she ran her hands along them smiling now its good she said its good he looked down at himself to his astonishment he found his fingers were gnarled and sharp and leathery flaps were hanging from his arms the wind gusted against them threatening to carry him off the roof then and there you know youre playin a dangerous game dont you marr said as she stood back to admire her handiwork youll either break your head or scare the life out of your friend wendell or both he wont fall woman jive said hes got the knack of this i can tell just by looking at him he peered at harvey with his squinty eyes wouldnt be surprised if you werent a vampire in another life boy he said vampires dont have other lives harvey said the words more difficult to say with a mouthful of fangs they live forever thats right said jive snapping his fingers so they do so they do well im finished said marr you can get goin boy the wind came gusting again and if jive hadnt been holding onto him as they walked the edge of the roof harvey would surely have been carried away theres your friend jive whispered pointing down into the shadows much to his amazement harvey found that he could see wendell quite clearly even though it was pitch dark in the thicket he could hear him too every little breath every beat of his heart this is it jive hissed putting his hand on harveys back what do i do harvey said do i flap or what jump jive said the windll take care of the rest either the wind or gravity and with that he shoved harvey off the edge of the roof and into the empty air x falling from grace the wind wasnt there to bear him up he plummeted like a slate tossed from the gables a cry of sheer terror escaping his throat he saw wendell turn saw a look of mortal fear come onto his face then the wind came out of nowhere cold and strong and just as his legs brushed the bushes he felt himself lifted up and up toward the sky his cry became a whoop his terror joy the moon was larger than hed ever seen it and its vast white face filled his sight like the face of his mother bending to kiss him goodnight except that he needed no sleep tonight no nor a mother to wish him sweet dreams this was better than any dream flying with the wind in his wings and the world shuddering below in fear of his shadow he looked for wendell again and saw him fleeing for the safety of the house no you dont he thought and fuming his wings like leathery sails he swooped down on his prey a bloodcurdling shriek filled his ears and for a moment he thought it was the wind then he realized it was his own throat that was uttering this inhuman din and the shriek became laughter wild lunatic laughter dontpleasedont wendell was sobbing as he ran somebody help me somebody help me harvey knew hed already had his revenge wendell was frightened out of his wits but it was too much fun to stop now he liked the feel of the wind beneath him and the cold moon on his back he liked the sharpness of his eyes and the strength of his claws but mast of all he liked the fear he was causing liked the look on wendells upturned face and the sound of panic in his chest the wind was carrying him down into the thicket and as he landed wendell dropped to his knees begging for merry dont kill me please please i beg youdont kill me harvey had seen and heard enough hed had his revenge it was time to put an end to the game before the fun soured he opened his mouth to announce himself but wendellseeing the red throat and the wolfish fangs and thinking this meant certain deathbegan a new round of supplications this time however he wasnt simply begging im too fat to eat he said but theres another kid around here somewhere harvey growled at this there is wendell said i swear and theres more meat on him than on me listen to the child said a voice in the bushes at harveys side he glanced around there was jive his wiry form barely visible among the barbs hed see you dead young harvey wendell heard none of this he was still advertising the edibility of his friend hoisting up his shirt and shaking his blubbery belly to prove how unpalatable he was you dont want me he sobbed take harvey take harvey bite him said jive go on drink a little of his blood why not the fats no good but the bloods hot the bloods tasty he was doing a little dance as he spoke stamping his feet to the rhythm of his chant dont waste the taste go eat the meat and still wendell whined all snot and tears you dont want me find harvey find harvey and the more he sobbed the more jives chant made sense to harvey who was this ridiculous boy wendell anyway he was too eager to serve harvey up as dinner to be called a friend he was just a tasty morsel any vampire worth his wings would chew off his head as soon as look at him and yet what are you waiting for jive wanted to know weve gone to all this trouble to make a monster of you yes but its a game harvey said a game said jive no no boy its more than that its an education harvey didnt know what he meant by this and he wasnt altogether certain he wanted to know if you dont pounce soon jive hissed youre going to lose him it was true wendells tears were clearing and he was staring at his attacker with a puzzled look are yougoing to let mego he murmured harvey felt jives hand on his back do it jive said harvey looked at wendells tearstained face and trembling hands if the situation had been reversed he thought to himself would i have been much braver the answer he knew was no its now or never said jive then its never harvey said never the word came out as a guttural roar and wendell fled before it yelling at the top of his voice harvey didnt give chase you disappoint me boy jive said i thought you had the killer instinct well i dont said harvey a little ashamed of himself he felt like a coward even though he knew hed done the right thing that was a waste of magic said another voice and marr appeared from out of the bushes her arms filled with enormous fungi whered you find those jive said usual place marr replied she gave harvey a contemptuous look i suppose you want your old body back she said yes please we should leave him like this said jive hed get around to sucking blood sooner or later nah said marr theres only so much magic to go around you know that why waste it on a miserable little punk like this she waved her hand casually in harveys direction and he felt the power that had filled his limbs and transformed his face drain out of him it was a relief of course to feel the magic unmade but a little part of him mourned the loss in a matter of moments he was once again an earthbound boy wingless and weak with the spell removed marr turned her back on him and waddled off into the darkness jive however lingered long enough to have one last dig at harvey you missed your chance there kiddo he said you could have been one of the greats it was a trick thats all harvey said concealing the strange unhappiness he felt a halloween trick it meant nothing there are those whod disagree jive said darkly those whod say that all the great powers in the world are bloodsuckers and soulstealers at heart and we must serve them all of us serve them to our dying day he stared hard at harvey all the way through this peculiar little speech and then with a nimble step retreated into the shadows and was gone harvey found wendell in the kitchen a hot dog in one hand and a cookie in the other telling mrs griffin about what hed seen he dropped his food when harvey came in and yelped with relief youre alive youre alive of course im alive said harvey why shouldnt i be there was something out there a terrible beast it almost ate me i thought maybe it had eaten you harvey looked down at his hands and legs nope he said not a nibble im glad wendell said im so so glad youre my best friend for always i was vampire food five minutes ago harvey thought but he said nothing maybe thered come a time when he could tell wendell about his transformation and temptation but this wasnt it he simply said im hungry and sat down at the table beside his fairweather friend to put something sweeter than blood in his belly xi turnabout neither wendell nor lulu was around the following daymrs griffin said shed seen them both before breakfast and then theyd disappearedso harvey was left to his own devices he tried not to think about what had happened the night before but he couldnt help himself snatches of conversation kept coming back and he puzzled over them all day long what had jive meant for instance when hed told harvey that turning him into a vampire was not so much a game as an education what kind of lesson had he learned by jumping off a roof and scaring wendell and all that stuff about soulstealers and how they had to be served what had that meant was it mr hood that jive had been speaking of that great power they all had to serve if hood was somewhere in the house why hadnt anyonelulu wendell or himselfencountered him harvey had quizzed his friends about hood and had the same story from them both theyd heard no footfalls no whispers no laughter if mr hood was indeed here where was he hiding and why so many questions so few answers and then if these mysteries werent enough another came along to vex him in the late afternoon lounging in the shade of the tree house he heard a yell of frustration and peered through the leaves to set wendell racing across the lawn he was dressed in a windbreaker and boots even though it was swelteringly hot and he was stamping around like a madman harvey shouted to him but his call went either unheard or ignored so he climbed down and pursued wendell around the side of the house he found him in the orchard redfaced and sweaty whats going on he said i cant get out wendell said grinding a halfrotted apple underfoot i want to leave harvey but theres no way out of course there is ive been trying for hours and hours and i tell you the mist keeps sending me hack the way i came hey calm down i want to go home harvey wendell said close to tears now last night was too much for me that thing came after my blood i know you dont believe me i do said harvey honest i do you do for sure well then maybe you should leave toocause if i go itll come after you i dont think so said harvey ive been kiddin myself about this place wendell said its dangerous oh yeah i know it seems like everythings perfect but harvey interrupted him maybe you should keep your voice down he said we should talk about this quietly in private like where said wendell wildeyed the whole place is watching us and listening to us dont you feel it why would it do that i dont know wendell snapped but last night i thought if i dont leave im going to die here ill just disappear one night or go crazy like lulu he dropped his voice to a whisper were not the first you know what about all the clothes upstairs all the coats and shoes and hats they belonged to kids like us harvey shuddered had he played trickortreat in a murdered boys shoes i want to get out of here wendell said tears running down his face but theres no way out if theres a way in there must be a way out harvey reasoned well go to the wall with that he marched off wendell in tow around to the front of the house and down the gentle slope of the lawn the mistwall looked perfectly harmless as they approached it be careful wendell warned its got some tricks up its sleeve harvey slowed his step expecting the wall to twitch or even reach for him but it did nothing bolder now he strode into the mist fully expecting to emerge on the other side but by some trick or other he was turned around without even being aware of it and delivered out of the wall with the house in front of him what happened he said to himself puzzled he stepped back into the mist the same thing occurred in he went and out he came again facing the opposite direction he tried again and again and again but the same trick was worked upon him every time until harvey was as frustrated as wendell had been a half hour before now do you believe me wendell said yep so what do we do well we dont yell about it harvey whispered we just get on with the day pretend weve given up leaving im going to do a little looking around he began his investigations as soon as they got back into the house by going in search of lulu her bedroom door was closed he knocked then called her there was no reply so he tried the handle the door was unlocked lulu he called its harvey she wasnt there but he was relieved to see that her bed had been slept in and that shed apparently been playing with her pets recently the doors to the dolls house were open and the lizards were everywhere underfoot there was one strangeness however the sound of running water led him through to the bathroom where he found the bath full almost to brimming and lulus clothes scattered in the puddles on the tile have you seen lulu he asked mrs griffin when he got downstairs not in the last few hours she replied but shes been keeping to herself mrs griffin looked hard at harvey i wouldnt pay too much mind if i were you child she said mr hood doesnt like inquisitive guests i was only wondering where shed got to harvey said mrs griffin frowned her tongue working against her pale cheek as though it wanted to speak but didnt dare anyway harvey went on deliberately goading mrs griffin i dont believe mr hood exists now you be careful she said her voice and frown deepening you dont want to talk about mr hood that way ive been heredays and days harvey said realizing as he spoke that hed lost count of his time in the house and i havent seen him once where is he now mrs griffin came at harvey with her hands raised and for a moment he thought she was going to strike him but instead she took hold of his shoulders and shook him please child she said be content with what you know youre here to enjoy yourself for a little time and child its such a little time it flies by oh lord how it flies its just a few weeks harvey said im not going to stay here forever now it was he who stared at her or am i he said stop she told him you think i am here forever dont you he said shaking off her grip what is this place mrs griffin is it some kind of prison she shook her head dont tell me lies he said its stupid were locked up in here arent we now though she was shaking with fear from head to foot she dared to make a tiny nod of her head all of us he asked again she nodded you too yes she whispered me too and theres no way out believe me if you try to escape again carna will come after you carna he said remembering the name from the conversation between jive and marr hes up there mrs griffin said on the roof thats where the four of them live rictus marr carna and jive you know ive met them all but carna pray you never do said mrs griffin now listen to me harvey ive seen many children come and go through this housesome of them foolish some of them selfish some sweet some bravebut you you are one of the brightest souls i have ever set eyes on i want you to take what joy you can from being here use the hours well because therell be fewer than you think harvey listened patiently to this then when shed finished he said i still want to meet mr hood mr hood is dead mrs griffin said exasperated by his persistence dead you swear i swear she replied on the brave of my poor cluecat i swear mr hood is dead so dont ask about him ever again this was the first time mrs griffin had ever come close to giving harvey an order and though he wanted to press her further he decided not to instead he said he was sorry for bringing up the subject and wouldnt do it again then left her to her secret sorrows xii what the flood gave up well said wendell when harvey came to his room whats the story harvey shrugged everythings fine he said why dont we just enjoy ourselves while we can enjoy ourselves wendell said how can we enjoy ourselves when were locked in its better in here than it is out in the world harvey said wendell looked at him in astonishment thats true isnt it as he spoke he grabbed hold of wendells hand and wendell realized there was a ball of paper in harveys palm which he was trying to pass between the two of them maybe you should just find a quiet little corner and do some reading he said glancing down at their hands as he spoke wendell got the idea he claimed the balledup note from harveys hand and said maybe ill do that good said harvey im going to go out and enjoy the sun while i can that was exactly what he did he had a lot of planning to do before midnight which was when the note told wendell they should meet to make their escape surely even the forces that guarded the house had to sleep sometime and of all the hours to slip away midnight seemed the most promising but he didnt suppose it would be easy the house had been a trap for decades and even at midnight it would not be so foolish as to leave the exit wide open they would have to be quick and clever and not panic or lose their tempers once they were in the mist the real world was out there somewhere all they had to do was find it he knew when he saw wendell for halloween that the note had been read and understood there was a look in wendells eyes that said im ready im nervous but im ready the rest of the evening passed for the two of them like the performance of a strange play in which they were the actors and the house was the audience they went about enjoying themselves as though this was a night like any other heading out to play trickortreat with a show of loud laughter then coming in to eat their supper and spend what they hoped would be their last christmas in the house they opened their presents said their goodnights to mrs griffin and then went to bed the house grew quiet and quieter still the snow no longer sighed at the sill nor the wind in the chimney it was harvey thought the deepest silence hed ever heard so deep that he could hear his heartbeat in his ears and every rustle of his body against the sheets sounded like a roll of drums a little before midnight he got up and dressed moving slowly and carefully so as to make as little noise as possible then he headed out into the passageway andslipping like a thief from shadow to shadowhurried down the stairs and out into the night he left not by the front door but by the kitchen door which brought him out at the side of the house though the wind had dropped the air was still bitter and the surface of the snow had frozen it crackled as he walked however lightly he trod but he was beginning to hope that the eyes and ears of the house were indeed closed at this hour and he might make it to the perimeter without attracting attention just as he was about to turn the corner however that sweet hope was soured as somebody in the murk behind him called his name he froze in his tracks hoping the darkness would conceal him but the voice came again and again called his name it was not a voice he recognized not wendell certainly nor mrs griffin not jive not rictus not marr this was a frail voice the voice of somebody who barely knew how to shape the syllables of his name harrrvvvey and then all of a sudden he knew the voice and his heartwhich had been working overtime since hed slipped out of bedgrew so loud in his ears it almost drowned out the summons when it came again lulu he murmured yesss said the voice where are you near she said he stared at the thicket hoping for some glimpse of her but all he could see was the starlight glittering on the frosted leaves youre leaving she said her words slurred yes he whispered and you have to come with us he took a step toward her and as he did so some of the glitter that hed thought was frost retreated from him what was she wearing that shimmered this way dont be afraid he said i dont want you to look at me she said whats wrong please she said justkeep your distance she retreated even farther from him and seemed to lose her balance as she did so she dropped to the ground the thicket around her shaking harvey stepped forward to help her up but she let out such a sob that he stopped in his tracks i only want to help he said you cant help me she replied every word pained its too late you just haveto gowhile you still can i justwanted to give yousomething to remember me by he saw her move in the shadows reaching out in his direction look away she said he turned his head away from her now close your eyes and promise you wont open them he dutifully closed his eyes i promise he said and now he heard her moving toward him her breath laborious open your hand she said her voice was near now he knew if he opened his eyes hed be face to face with her but he had made a promise and was determined to keep it he put out his hand and felt first one then two then three heavy little objects cold and wet dropped into his cupped palm this was alli could find lulu said im sorry can i look he asked not yet let meleavefirst he closed his fingers around the gifts shed given him trying to make sense of them by touch what were they pieces of frozen stone no they were carved he could feel grooves on one a head on another and now of course he knew what he held three survivors of his ark dredged up from the depths of the lake the answer was no comfort to him quite the reverse he shuddered as he put the puzzle of lulus silvery gleam together with the knowledge of what he held she had swum down to the bottom of the lake to recover these figures a descent that was beyond the capacity of any land dweller no wonder shed retreated into the shadows ordering him not to look at her she wasnt human any longer she was becomingor had already becomea sister to the strange fish that circled in these dark waters coldblooded and silverskinned oh lulu he said how did this happen dont waste your time with me she murmured just go while youve a chance i want to help he said you cant came the reply cant help meive been here too long my life is over thats not true harvey said were the same age but ive been here so long i dont even remember her voice trailed away dont remember what maybe i just dont want to remember she said itll hurt too muchshe made along choked sigh you have to goshe said in a whisper go while you still can im not afraid then youre stupid she said because you should be he heard the thicket shake as she started to retreat from him wait he said she made no reply lulu the din of her departure grew louder by the sound of it she was almost throwing herself out of his range breaking his promise he opened his eyes and caught a glimpse of her as she fled a shadow in the shadows no more he started after her not knowing what he would say or do when he caught up with her but knowing hed never forgive himself if he didnt somehow help maybe if he persuaded her to go with him out of the shadow of the house its vicious magic would be undone or maybe he could find some doctor for her in the outside world who could cure her of this malformation anything rather than leaving her to return to the lake its waters were in view now gleaming darkly between the branches of the thicket lulu had reached the bank and for a moment the meager starlight found her all that harvey had feared was true and more a fin grew from her bent and scaly back and her legs had almost fused together her arms had become short and stubby her fingers webbed but it was her face glimpsed as she turned back to look at him that was the greatest shock her hair had fallen out and her nose disappeared her mouth had lost its lips and her blue eyes turned to swivelling silver balls lidless and lashless and yet despite their freakishness there was human feeling in those eyes and on that mouth a terrible sadness that he knew would never leave his heart if he lived to be a thousand you were my friend she said as she teetered on the bank thank you for that then she tumbled into the water he went to the edge of the lake at a dash but by the time he reached the place from which shed dived the ripples were disappearing and the bubbles breaking he watched the icy waters for a minute or more hoping she would see him and surface but shed gone where he couldnt follow and that it seemed was the end of it clutching her gifts to him like talismans he trudged away from the lake and down the lawn to keep his rendezvous with wendell xiii the fourth part of darkness what happened to you wendell whispered when harvey reached the bottom of the lawn i thought we were meeting at midnight i gotwaylaid harvey said hed intended to tell wendell what had just transpired but his friend was obviously nervous enough without being told about lulus fate harvey slipped the three survivors of the ark into his pocket and resolved only to speak of the encounter when he and wendell were safely away from this terrible place just one thing stood between them and that ambition the wall of mist now as ever it seemed innocent enough but that was an illusion of course like so many things in mr hoods kingdom we have to be very organized about this harvey said to wendell once were in the wall we lose our sense of direction so we have to be sure we keep walking in a straight line and not let the mist turn us around how do we do that said wendell i think one of us should go in first and the other one keep hold of his hand me said wendell eagerly i want to be first no problem then ill keep my back to the house and keep guiding you who knows maybe the walls so thin youll just be able to pull me through we can hope wendell said are you ready harvey asked extending his hand wendell took it whenever you are he said then lets get out of here wendell nodded and stepped into the mist instantly harvey felt his grip tighten dontletgowendell said his voice already remote although he was just a pace away just keep walking harvey said as they reached arms length any sign of before he could finish his question a noise from the house behind him sealed his lips he glanced back the front door was open and a light was burning in the hall throwing into silhouette the figure rushing down the porch steps it was mrs griffin the noise hed heard was not from her lips however nothing human could make such a din he saw mrs griffin glance up toward the roof as she hurried down the lawn and following her gaze saw the noisemaker rising against the stars he knew its name even though he couldnt see its face hood had four servants and hed met only three rictus jive and marr here was the fourth carna the toothstealer carna the devourer carna the beast mrs griffin had hoped harvey would never meet back to the house child mrs griffin yelled as the din of vast wings filled the air quickly quickly harvey pulled on wendells arm yelling to him as he did so but wendell had a whiff of freedom in his nostrils and wasnt about to give it up what are you waiting for mrs griffin yelled get away from there or itll take off your head harvey glanced up at the swooping beast and knew this was no lie carnas jaws were wide enough to snap him in half with a single bite but he couldnt leave wendell in the mist theyd begun this adventure together and that was how they would finish it dead or alive he had no choice but to step into the mist himself and hope that wendell had snatched a glimpse of the world outside and could pull him through to the street as he took that step he heard mrs griffin say something about leading the way then he was blinded by the chill of the mist and the sound of her voice became a garbled whisper carnas shrieks were not so hushed however they pierced the murk skewering harveys thoughts the way its teeth would skewer his head if the beast caught up with him wendell harvey yelled its coming for us he caught a glimpse of a figure up ahead of him then of wendells face smeared by the mist turning to say theres no way out there has to be i cant find it wendell said his reply almost drowned out by the din of carnas shrieks harvey glanced back the way hed come more afraid not to know how close the creature was than to see it however terrifying the sight a veil of mist swirled in front of him but he glimpsed carnas form as the beast descended it was the most monstrous of the brood its skin rotted and stretched over barbed and polished bone its throat a nest of snaky tongues its jaws set with hundreds of teeth this is the end harvey thought ive only been alive ten years and five months and im going to have my head bitten off then from the corner of his eye a strange sight mrs griffins arms reaching into the mist and dropping bluecat to the ground hes got a good sense of direction harvey heard her say follow him follow him he didnt need a second invitation nor did bluecat tail up it padded off and harvey hauled on wendells arm to drag him in pursuit the cat was quick but so was harvey he kept his eyes glued on that bright tail even when the rush of wings behind him announced that carna had entered the mist and was almost upon them two strides three strides four and now the mist seemed to be thinning he heard wendell whooping for joythe street he yelled i see itand the next moment harvey saw it too the sidewalks wet with rain and shining in the lamplight now he dared look back and there was carna its jaws a yard from them he let go of wendells arm and pushed his friend toward the street ducking as he did so carnas lower jaw scraped his spine but the beast was moving too fast to check itself and instead of wheeling around to scoop up its quarry it flew on out into the real world wendell was already there harvey joined him a moment later we did it wendell yelled we did it so did carna harvey said pointing up at the beast as it rose against the cloudy sky and turned to come back for them it wants to drive us back inside harvey said im not going wendell cried never im never going in there again carna heard his defiance its blazing eyes fixed on him and it came down like a thunderbolt its shriek echoing through the midnight streets run harvey said but carnas stare had rooted wendell to the spot harvey grabbed hold of him and was about to make a run for it when he heard the beasts cry change triumph became doubt doubt became pain and suddenly carna wasnt swooping but falling holes opening in its wings as though a horde of invisible moths was eating at their fabric it labored to climb the air again but its wounded wings refused their duty and seconds later it struck the street so hard it bit off a dozen of its tongues and scattered half a hundred teeth at the boys feet the fall didnt kill it however though agonized by its wounds it hauled itself up onto the spiky crutches of its wings and began to drag itself back toward the wall even now in this wretched state it was ferocious and with snaps to right and left drove harvey and wendell out of its path it cant survive out here wendell realized aloud its dying harvey wished he had some weapon to keep the beast from returning to safety but he had to be content with the sight of its defeat if it had not wanted their flesh so badly he thought it wouldnt have come after them at such speed and brought this pain and humiliation upon itself there was a lesson there if he could only remember it evil however powerful it seemed could be undone by its own appetite then the creature was gone a curtain of mist drawn over its retreat there was only one sign remaining of the mysteries that lay on the other side of the wall the face of bluecat gazing out at the world that he like all the occupants of the holiday house could never explore his azure gaze met harveys for a moment then he looked back toward his prison as though he heard mrs griffins summons and with a sorrowful sigh turned and traipsed away weird said wendell as he stared at the rainy streets its as though i never left is it said harvey he wasnt so sure he felt different marked by this adventure i wonder if well even remember we came here in a weeks time oh ill remember harvey said ive got a few souvenirs he dug into his pocket in search of the figures from the ark even as he pulled them out he felt them crumbling as the real world took its toll on them illusions he murmured as they turned to dust and ran away between his fingers who cares said wendell its time to go home and thats no illusion xiv time was it took the boys an hour to reach the center of town and theregiven that their houses lay in opposite directionsthey parted company they exchanged addresses before they did so promising to contact each other in a day or two so that they could each support the others account of the holiday house it would be difficult to make people believe all that had happened to them but perhaps theyd have a better chance if two voices told the same tale i know what you did back there wendell said just before they parted you saved my life you would have done the same thing for me harvey said wendell looked doubtful i might have wanted to he said somewhat abashed but ive never been very brave we escaped together harvey said i couldnt have done it without you really really wendell brightened at this yeah he said i guess thats right wellbe seein ya and with that they went their separate ways it was still several hours before daybreak and the streets were virtually deserted so for harvey it was a long lonely trudge home he was tired and a little saddened by his farewell to wendell but the thought of the welcome hed get when he reached his own doorstep put a spring in his heels several times he wondered if hed gone astray because the streets he passed through were unfamiliar one neighborhood was extremely fancy the houses and the cars parked outside them slicker than anything hed set eyes on another was virtually a wasteland the houses half rubble the streets strewn with garbage but his sense of direction served him well as the east began to pale and the birds in the trees started their twitterings he rounded the corner of his street his weary legs broke into a joyful dash and brought him to the step panting for breath and ready to fall into his parents arms he knocked on the door there was no sound from the house at first which didnt surprise him given the hour he knocked again and again finally a light was turned on and he heard somebody coming to the door who is it said his father from behind the closed door do you know what time it is its me said harvey then came the sound of bolts being drawn aside and the door was opened a crack whos me said the man peering out at him he looked kindly enough harvey thought but it wasnt his father this was a much older man his hair almost white his face thin he had a badly trimmed mustache and a furrow of a frown what do you want he said before harvey could reply a womans voice said come away from the door he couldnt see the second speaker yet but he caught a glimpse of the wallpaper in the hallway and the pictures on the wall to his relief he saw that this was not his house at all hed obviously made a simple mistake and knocked on the wrong door im sorry he said backing away i didnt mean to wake you up who are you looking for the man wanted to know opening the door a little wider now are you one of the smith kids he started to dig in the pocket of his dressing gown and brought out a pair of spectacles he cant even see me properly harvey thought poor old man but before the spectacles reached the bridge of the mans nose his wife appeared behind him and harveys legs almost folded up beneath him at the sight of her she was old this woman her hair almost as colorless as her husbands and her face even more lined and sorrowful but harvey knew that face better than any on earth it was the first face hed ever loved it was his mother mom he murmured the woman stopped and stared out through the open door at the boy standing on the step her eyes filling up with tears she could barely breathe the word she said next harvey mommom it is you isnt it by now the man had put on his spectacles and peered through them with his eyes wide its not possible he said flatly this cant be harvey its him said his wife its our harvey hes come home the man shook his head after all these years he said hed be a man by now hed be a grown man this is just a boy its him i tell you no the man replied angry now its some prank somebody trying to break our hearts as if theyre not broken enough he started to slam the door but harveys mom caught hold of it look at him she said look at his clothes thats what he was wearing the night he left us how do you know you think i dont remember its thirtyone years ago said harveys father still staring at the boy on the step this cantcant be he faltered as slow recognition spread over his face oh my lord he said his voice dropping to a hoarse whisper it is him isnt it i told you his wife replied are you some kind of ghost he asked harvey oh for goodness sake harveys mom said hes no ghost she slipped past her husband and out onto the step i dont know how its possible and i dont care she said opening her arms to harvey all i know is our little boys come home to us harvey couldnt speak there were too many tears in his throat and in his nose and in his eyes all he could do was stumble into his mothers arms it was wonderful to feel her hands stroke his hair and her fingers wipe his cheeks oh harvey harvey harvey she sobbed we thought wed never see you again she kissed him over and over we thought youd gone forever hows this possible his father still wanted to know i kept praying his mother said harvey had another answer though he didnt voice it the moment hed set eyes on his motherso changed so sorrowfulit was instantly clear what a terrible trick hoods house had played upon them all for every day hed spent there a year had gone by here in the real world every morning while hed played in the spring warmth months had passed in the afternoon while hed lazed in the summer sun the same and those haunted twilights which had seemed so brief had been another span of months as had the christmas nights full of snow and presents theyd all slipped by so easily and though he had only aged a month his mom and dad had lived in sadness for thirtyone years thinking that their little boy had gone forever that had almost been the case if hed remained in the house of illusions distracted by its petty pleasures a whole lifetime would have gone by here in the real world and his soul would have become hoods property he would have joined the fish circling in the lake and circling and circling he shuddered at the thought youre cold sweetie his mother said lets get you inside he sniffed hard and cleared his tears with the back of his hand im so tired he said ill make a bed for you straight away no i want to tell you what happened before i go to sleep harvey replied its a long story thirtyone years long xv new nightmares it was a more difficult tale to tell than he expected it to be though some of the details were clear in his headrictuss first appearance the sinking of the ark his and wendells escapethere was much else he could not properly remember it was as though the mist hed strode through had seeped into his head and had there drawn a veil over the house and much of what it contained i remember speaking to you on the phone two or three times he said you didnt speak to us honey his mom replied then that was just another trick harvey said i should have known but who was playing all those tricks his father demanded if this house existsi say ifthen whoever owns it kidnapped you and somehow kept you from growing up maybe he froze you no said harvey it was warm there except when the snow came down of course there has to be some sane explanation there is said harvey it was magic his father shook his head thats a childs answer he said and im not a child anymore and i know what i know said harvey firmly it isnt very much honey his mom said i wish i could remember more she put a comforting arm around his shoulder never mind she said well talk about it when youve had a rest could you find this house again his father asked him yes harvey replied though his skin ran with chills at the thought of going back i think so then thats what well do i dont want him going back to that place his mother said we have to know it exists before we report it to the police you understand that dont you son harvey nodded it sounds like something i made up i know but its not i swear its not come on sweetie his mother said im afraid your rooms changed a bit but its still comfortable i kept it just as youd left it for years and years hoping youd find your way home then i realized if you ever did come back youd be a grown man and you wouldnt want it decorated with rocket ships and parrots so we had the decorators in its completely different now i dont mind harvey said its home and thats all i care about in the early afternoon as he slept in his old room it rained a hard march rain that beat against the window and slapped on the sill the sound woke him he sat up in bed with the hairs at his nape pricking and knew that hed been dreaming of lulu poor lost lulu dragging her misshapen body through the bushes her flipper hand clutching the ark animals shed dredged up from the mud the thought of her unhappiness was unbearable how could he ever hope to live in the world to which hed returned knowing that she remained hoods prisoner ill find you he murmured to himself i will i swear then he lay back on the cold pillow and listened to the sound of rain until sleep crept over him exhausted by his travels and traumas he didnt wake again until the following morning the rain had cleared it was time to lay plans i bought a map of the whole of millsap his father said unfolding his purchase and spreading it over the kitchen table theres our house he had already marked the place with a cross now do you remember any of the street names around hoods place harvey shook his head i was too busy escaping he said were there any particular buildings you saw it was dark and rainy so we just have to trust to luck well find it harvey said even if it takes all week it was easier said than done more than three decades had passed since hed first made his way through the town with rictus and countless things had changed there were new plazas and new slums new cars on the streets and new aircraft overhead so many distractions all keeping harvey from the trail i dont know which way is which he admitted after theyd been searching for half a day nothings the way i remember it well keep going his father said itll all come clear it didnt they spent the rest of the day wandering around hoping that some night would trigger a memory but it was frustrating business every now and then in some square or street harvey would say maybe this is it and theyd head off in one direction or another only to find that the trail grew cold a few blocks on that evening his father quizzed him again if you could only remember what the house looked like he said i could describe it to people it was big i remember that and old im sure it was very old could you draw it i could try he did just that and though he wasnt much of an artist his hand seemed to remember more than his brain had because after a half hour he had drawn the house in considerable detail his father was pleased well take this with us tomorrow he said maybe somebody will recognize it but the second day was just as frustrating as the first nobody knew the house that harvey had drawn nor anything remotely like it by the end of the afternoon harveys father was getting shorttempered its useless he said i must have asked five hundred people and not one of themnot oneeven vaguely recognized the place its not surprising said harvey i dont think anyone who saw the housebesides me and wendellever escaped before we should just repeat all this to the police his mother said and let them deal with it and what do we tell them his father said raising his voice that we think theres a house out there that hides in a mist and steals children with magic its ridiculous calm down calm down harveys mother said well talk about this after weve eaten they trudged home ate and discussed the whole problem again but without finding any solutions mr hood had laid his traps carefully over the years protecting himself from the laws of the real world safe behind the mists of his illusion hed most likely already found two new and unwitting prisoners to replace harvey and wendell it seemed his evil would go on undiscovered and unpunished the following day harveys father made an announcement this search is getting us nowhere he said were going to give it up are you going to the police his wife asked him yes and theyll want harvey to tell them everything he knows its going to be difficult they wont believe me harvey said thats why im going to talk to them first his father said ill find somebody wholl listen he left soon after breakfast with a worried expression on his face this is all my fault harvey said to his mom we lost all that time together just because i was bored dont blame yourself she said were all tempted to do things we regret once in a while sometimes we choose badly and make mistake i just wish i knew how to unmake it harvey replied his mother went out shopping in the middle of the morning and left harvey haunted by that thought was there some way to undo the damage that had been done to take back the stolen years and live them here with the people who loved him and whom he loved dearly in return he was sitting at his bedroom window trying to puzzle the problem out when he saw a forlorn figure at the street corner he threw open the window and yelled down to him wendell wendell over here then he raced downstairs by the time he opened the door his friend was on the step his face red and wet with tears and sweat what happened he said everythings changed his words were punctuated by hiccups my dad divorced my mom and my moms so old harvey and fat as a house he wiped his running nose with the back of his hand and sniffed hard it wasnt supposed to be this way he said well was it harvey did his best to explain how the house had deceived them but wendell was in no mood for theory he just wanted the nightmare to be over i want things the way they were he wailed my dads gone to the police harvey said hes going to tell them everything that wont do any good wendell said despairingly theyll never find the house youre right harvey said i went to look for it with my mom and dad but it was no use its hiding well its bound to hide from them stupid wendell said it doesnt want grownups youre right said harvey it wants children and i bet it wants you and me more than ever howd you reckon that it almost had us it almost ate us alive so you think its got a taste for us im sure of it wendell stared at his feet for a moment you think we should go back dont you i dont think any of those grownupsmy dad your mom the policeare ever going to find the house if we want all those years back we have to get them for ourselves i dont much like the idea wendell confessed neither do i he said thinking as he spoke that hed have to leave a note for his mom and dad so that they wouldnt think his return had been a dream we have to go he said we dont have any choice so when do we start now said harvey grimly weve lost too much time already xvi back to the happy land it was as if the house knew that they were coming back and was calling to them as soon as they stepped out into the street their feet seemed to know the way all they had to do was let them lead what do we do when we get there wendell wanted to know i mean we only just escaped with our lives last time mrs griffin will help us harvey said wendells breath quickened suppose carna bit her head off he said then well have to do it alone do what find hood but you told me he was dead i dont think being dead means much to a creature like him harvey said hes in the house somewhere wendell and we have to hunt him down whether we like it or not hes the one who stole all those years with our moms and dads and we wont get them back until we face him you make it sound easy wendell said the whole house is a box of tricks harvey reminded him the seasons the presents theyre all illusions we have to hold on to that harvey look wended pointed ahead of them harvey knew the street at a glance thirtythree days ago hed stood here with rictus and listened to the tempter tell him what a fine place lay on the other side of the mist wall up ahead this is it then harvey said it was strange but he didnt feel afraid even though he knew they were walking back into their enemys arms it was better to face hood and his illusions now than to spend the rest of his life wondering about lulu and mourning the years hed lost are you ready he asked wendell before we go his friend replied can we get just one thing s straight if the house is all illusions then how come we felt the cold and how come i got fat from eating mrs griffins pies and i dont know harvey cut in doubt running a cold finger up his spine i cant explain how hoods magic works all i know is he took all those years away to feed himself feed yeah likelikelike a vampire this was the first time harvey had thought of hood that way but it instinctively seemed right blood was life and life was what w hood fed upon he was a vampire sure enough maybe a king among vampires so shouldnt we have a stake or holy water or something thats just in stories harvey said but if he comes after us we fight fight with what harvey shrugged the truth was he didnt know but he was sure that crosses and prayers werent going to be any use in the battle that lay ahead no more talk he said to wendell if you dont want to come then dont i didnt say that good said harvey and started toward the mist wendell followed on his heels and just as harvey stepped into the wall he snatched hold of his friends sleeve so that they entered as they had exited together the mist closed around them like a waterlogged blanket pressing so hard against their faces harvey half thought it intended to smother them but it only wished to keep them from changing their minds a moment later a tremor moved through its folds and spat them out the other side it was high summer in hoods kingdom the lazy season the sun which had been hidden by rain clouds on the other side of the mist was beaming down on the house and all that prospered around it the trees swayed in a balmy breeze the doors and windows of the house its porch and chimneys all gleamed as if newly painted there were welcoming songs in the eaves welcoming smells from the kitchen welcoming laughter through the open door welcome everywhere welcome id forgotten wendell murmured forgotten what howbeautiful it is dont trust it harvey said its all illusion remember all of it wendell didnt reply but wandered away toward the trees the honeyed breeze gusted around him as if to pluck him up he didnt resist but went where it led into the dappled shade wendell harvey said following him across the lawn weve got to stick together id forgotten about the tree house wendell said dreamily staring up into the canopy we had such fun up there remember no said harvey determined not to let the past distract him from his mission here i dont remember yes you do said wendell smiling from ear to ear we worked so hard up there im going up to see how it looks harvey grabbed his arm no youre not yes i am he snapped back wrenching his arm from harveys grip i can do whatever i want you dont own me harvey could see by the glazed look in wendells eyes that the house was already working its seductive magic it could only be a matter of time he knew before his own powers of resistance were worn away and what then would he forget his work here entirely and become an emptyheaded boy laughing like a loon while his soul was sucked away no he said aloud im not going to let you do it do what said wendell weve got work to do harvey told him who cares wendell replied i do and so did you five minutes ago remember what it did to us wendell the wind in trees seemed to sigh at this aaahh it said as if it now understood harveys purpose here and would waft this intelligence to the ears of mr hood harvey didnt care in fact he was pleased go on he said as the gusts flew toward the house tell him tell him he turned on wendell are you coming he said or am i going to go in alone i dont mind going in wendell said cheerily im hungry harvey stared hard at wendell dont you remember anything we said out there he demanded of course i do wendell replied we said we were going to he paused frowning goingto this place has stolen time that belonged to us wendell how did it do that said wendell still frowning deeply its justjust again he faltered searching for the words just such a perfect day the frown began to fade again and a broad smile replaced it who cares wendell said i mean on a day like this who cares lets just enjoy ourselves harvey shook his head he was losing precious time here which was exactly what hood and the house wanted instead of wasting any further words on wendell he turned on his heel and headed toward the front door wait for me wendell hollered can you smell that pie harvey could and wished hed put some food in his belly before hed started out on this adventure knowing that these tantalizing smells were all part of hoods repertoire wasnt enough to stop his mouth from watering or his stomach from grumbling all he could do was think of the dust to which his ark animals had turned when hed stepped out into the street the pie on the kitchen table was probably made of the same bitter stuff concealed beneath a veneer of sweetness he held on to that thought as best he could knowing that the house into which he was about to step would be full of such blandishments with wendell again trailing a step behind he climbed the porch steps and marched into the house the moment they were both inside the door slammed behind them harvey reeled around his skin crawling it was not the wind that had thrown the door shut it was rictus xvii cook cat and coffin great to have you back boy rictus said his smile as wide as ever i told everyone you wouldnt be able to stay away nobody believed me hes gone they said hes gone but i knew better he started to wander toward harvey i knew you wouldnt be satisfied with a little visitnot with so much fun still to be had im hungry wendell whined help yourselves rictus grinned wendell was off at a sprint into the kitchen oh boy oh boy oh boy he hollered look at all this food harvey didnt reply arent you hungry rictus said raising an eyebrow high above his spectacles he cupped his hand behind his ear that sounds like an empty belly to me wheres mrs griffin harvey said ohshes around rictus said mischievously but shes getting old she takes to her bed a good deal these days so we laid her down somewhere safe and sound as he spoke there was a mewling sound from the living room and there at the door stood stewcat rictus scowled get out of here pussy he spat cant you see were having a conversation but stewcat wasnt about to be intimidated she sauntered over to harvey rubbing herself against his legs what do you want harvey said going down on his haunches to stroke her she purred loudly hey thats fine and dandy rictus said putting off his anger in favor of a freshly polished smile you like the cat the cat likes you everybodys happy im not happy harvey said and whys that i left all my presents here and i dont know where no problem said rictus ill find em for you would you do that harvey said sure kid said rictus persuaded that his charm was working again thats what were all here for to give you whatever your heart desires i think maybe i left them up in my bedroom harvey suggested you know i think i saw em up there rictus replied you stay right here ill be back he took himself up the stairs two and three at a time whistling tunelessly through his teeth as he ascended harvey waited until he disappeared from sight and then went to check on wendell letting stewcat slip away ah now look at this a voice said as he appeared at the kitchen door it was jive he was standing at the stove as sinewy as ever juggling eggs with one hand and tossing pancakes in a pan with the other what do you fancy he said sweet or savory nothing harvey said its all good wendell piped up he was almost hidden behind a wall of filled plates try the apple turnovers theyre great harvey was sorely tempted the buffet looked wonderfully tempting but it was dust he had to keep remembering that maybe later he said averting his eyes from the heaps of syrupdrenched waffles and bowls of ice cream where are you going jive wanted to know mr rictus is finding a few presents for me harvey said jive smiled with satisfaction so youre getting back into the swing of things kiddo he said good for you ive missed being here harvey replied he didnt linger just in case jive saw the lie in his eyes but turned and headed back into the hallway stewcat was still there staring at him what is it he said the cat took off toward the stairs then stopped and cast a backward glance have you something to show me harvey whispered at this the cat bounded off again harvey followed expecting her to lead the way upstairs but before she reached the bottom step she veered off to her left and led harvey down a narrow passage to a door he had never even noticed before he rattled the handle but the door was locked turning to look for stewcat he found her rubbing her arched back against the leg of a small table set nearby on the table was a carved wooden box in the box was a key he went back to the door unlocked it and pulled it open there was a flight of wooden steps in front of him leading down into a darkness from which a sour dank smell rose he might have declined to descend had stewcat not hurried on past him down into the murk with his fingers trailing on the damp walls to the left and right of him he followed stewcat to the bottom of the flight counting the steps as he went there were fiftytwo and by the time he had descended them all his eyes had become reasonably accustomed to the gloom the cellar was cavernous but empty except for a litter of rubble and a large wooden box which lay in the dust maybe a dozen yards from where he stood what is it he hissed to stewcat knowing the creature had no way of replying but hoping for some sign nevertheless stewcats only answer was to run across the floor and leap nimbly up onto the box where it began to claw at the wood harveys curiosity was stronger than his fear but not so much stronger that he dashed to pull off the lid he approached as though the box were some sleeping beast which for all he knew it was the closer he got the more it resembled a crude coffin but what kind of coffin was sealed with a padlock was this where carna had been laid perhaps after the beast had dragged its wounded body back home was it even now listening to stewcat scratch on the lid waiting for release as he came within a yard of the casket however he laid eyes on a clue to its contents an apron string left hanging out of the box by whoever had locked it he knew of only one person in the house who wore an apron mrs griffin he whispered digging his fingernails under the lid mrs griffin are you in there there was a muffled thump from inside im going to get you out he promised hauling on the lid as hard as he could he didnt have the strength to break the lock in desperation he began to search the cellar looking for some tool or other and found himself two sizable rocks hefting them he returned to the casket this is going to be noisy he warned mrs griffin then using one stone as a kind of chisel and the other as a hammer he assaulted the lock blue sparks flew as he struck at the metal but he seemed to be making no impression until all of a sudden the lock gave a loud crack and fell to the ground he paused for a moment a feather of doubt brushing his brow suppose it was carnas coffin then he threw the rocks aside and hauled off the lid xvii the bitter truth he almost shouted out loud seeing the terrible state that poor mrs griffin was in she was staring up at him with wild eyes her hair pulled out in clawfuls her face purple with bruises a foul rag had been stuffed into her mouth harvey carefully removed it and she began to speak her voice a hoarse whisper thank you my sweet thank you she said but oh you shouldnt have come back its too dangerous here who did this to you jive and rictus but he ordered it didnt he harvey said helping her up dont tell me hes dead because i know that doesnt matter hoods here in the house isnt he yes she said holding on to him as she climbed up out of the box yes hes here but not in the way you think she began to weep the tears clogging her words its all right harvey said everythings going to be all right her fingers went up to her face and touched the tears i thoughti thought id never cry again she said look what youve done im sorry said harvey oh no my sweet dont be sorry its wonderful she smiled through her tears youve broken his curse on me what curse oh its a long story i want to hear i was the first child who ever came to hoods house she said this was many many years ago i was nine when i first walked up the front path id run away from home you see why my cat had died and my father refused to buy me another and what do you think rictus gave me the very day i arrived three cats said harvey you know how this house works dont you harvey nodded it gives you whatever you think you want and i wanted cats and a home and what another father she shivered with fear remembering the horror i met hood that night at least i heard his voice stewcat had come to her feet and she paused to stoop and gather the creature into her arms where did you hear him harvey asked in the attic at the top of the house and he said to me if you stay here forever and ever youll never die youll grow old but youll live until the end of time and never weep again and thats what you wanted it was stupid but yes i did i was afraid you see afraid of being put into the ground like my cat a new wave of tears came running down her pale cheeks i was running away from death straight into its house harvey said oh no child mrs griffin said hood isnt death she wiped away her tears so as to see harvey more clearly death is a natural thing hood isnt i would welcome death now like a friend id driven away from my door ive seen too much my sweet too many seasons too many children why didnt you try and stop him i have no power against him all i could do was give the children who came here as much happiness as i knew how so how old are you harvey asked her who knows she replied laying her cheek against stewcats fur i grew up and old in a matter of days but then the passage of time seemed to lose its hold on me sometimes ive wanted to ask one of the children what year is it in the world outside i can tell you dont she said putting her finger to her lips i dont want to know how the years have flown it would hurt too much what do you want then to die she said with a little smile to slip out of this skin and go to the stars is that what happens its what i believe she said but hood wont let me die not ever thatll be his revenge on me for helping you to escape he already had bluecat murdered for showing you the way out hoods going to let you go harvey said i promise im going to make him she shook her head youre so brave my sweet she said but he wont let any of us go theres such a terrible emptiness inside him he wants to fill it with souls but its a pit a bottomless pit and youre both heading for it said an oily voice the speaker was marr she was oozing down the stairs weve been looking for you up and down she said to harvey youd better come with me child she extended her arms in harveys direction he remembered all too well her transforming touch come come she said i might still get you out of trouble if you let me make something humble of you he likes humble things does mr hood fleas worms scabby dogs come to me child quickly harvey looked around the cellar there were no other ways out if he was to get mrs griffin up into the sun it had to be by way of the stairs and marr was standing in front of them he took a step in her direction she smiled toothlessly good child good she said dont mrs griffin said shell hurt you hush woman mary said were going to have to nail that lid down next time her greasy green eyes swiveled back in harveys direction he knows whats good for him dont you boy harvey didnt reply he simply kept walking toward marr whose fingers seemed to be growing like a snails horns reaching out to fix upon his face youve been such an obedient boy marr went on maybe i wont turn you into a worm after all what would you like to be tell me tell me whats in your heart never mind my heart harvey said reaching out toward marr what about yours a puzzled look came over marrs face mine she said yes said harvey what do you dream of being i never dream she said defiantly you should try it harvey told her if you can change me into a worm or a bat what could you do for yourself the defiance on her face became bafflement and the bafflement turned to panic her outstretched fingers began to retreat into themselves harvey reached for them like lightning however interweaving his fingers with hers what do you want to be he said to her think she started to struggle and he felt her magic surging through her fingers into his attempting to work some change on him but he didnt want to be a vampire bat anymore and he certainly didnt want to be a worm he was quite happy to be himself the magic therefore had no hold on him instead it flowed back into marr who began to shake as though she were being dipped in icy water whatareyoudoing she demanded tell me whats in your heart he said returning her invitation im not telling you she replied still trying to wrest her fingers free of his but she was not used to having her victims resist her this way her muscles were soft and flabby she pulled and pulled but she couldnt escape him leave me alone she said if you harm me mr hood will have your head im not harming you harvey replied im just letting you have your dreams the way you let me have mine i dont want them she yelled struggling more than ever he wouldnt let her go instead he drew closer to her as if to wrap her up in his arms she started to spit at himgreat gobs of slimebut he wiped them from his face and kept approaching her no she began to murmur no but she couldnt keep the magic shed intended for him from working on her own skin and bones her fat face began to soften and run like melting wax her body sagged in its ragged coat and a greenish gruel began to pour out onto the floor oh she sobbed you damnable child what dream was this harvey wondered that was turning marr to mush she was growing smaller all the time her clothes dropping off her as her body shrank her voice becoming thin it could only be moments before she disappeared altogether what do you dream about harvey said as marrs fingers ran away between his own like brackish water i dream of nothing marr replied her eyes sinking back into her disintegrating skull and thatswhativebecome she was almost lost in the folds of her clothesnothing she said again she was no more than a dirty puddle now a puddle with a fading voice nothing then she was gone devoured by her own magic you did it mrs griffin said child you did it one down three to go harvey said three rictus jive and hood himself youre forgetting carna is it still alive mrs griffin nodded im afraid ive heard its shrieks every night it wants revenge and i want my life back harvey said taking her by the arm and escorting her to the bottom of the stairs im going to get it mrs griffin whatever it takes im going to get it mrs griffin glanced back at the heap of clothes that marked the place where marr had vanished into thin air maybe you can she said with astonishment in her voice of all the children whove come here maybe youre the one who can beat hood at his own game xix dust to dust rictus was waiting at the top of the stairs his smile was sweet his words were not youre a murderer now my little man he said do you like the feel of marrs blood on your hands he didnt kill her mrs griffin said she was never alive none of you are what are we then rictus asked illusions harvey replied ushering mrs griffin and her cat past rictus to the front door its all illusions rictus followed them giggling insanely whats so funny harvey said opening the door to let mrs griffin out into the sun you are rictus replied you think you know everything but you dont know mr hood i will in a little while said harvey go and get warm he told mrs griffin ill be back be careful child she said i will he told her then closed the door youre a strange one rictus said his smile failing a little his face when his teeth no longer dazzled was like a mask made of dough two thumbholes for eyes and a blob for a nose i could suck out your brains through your ears he said all the music gone from his voice maybe you could said harvey but youre not going to how do you know because ive got an appointment with your master he started toward the bottom of the stairs but before he reached it a dark figure flitted in front of him it was jive and he was carrying a plate of apple pie and ice cream its a long climb he said put something in your stomach first harvey looked down at the plate the pie was golden brown and dusted with sugar the ice cream melting in a sweet white pool it certainly looked tempting go on said jive you deserve a treat no thanks harvey told him why not jive wanted to know turning full circle on his heel its lighter than i am but i know what its made of harvey said apples and cinnamon and no said harvey i know what its really made of he looked back at the pie and for a moment it seemed he glimpsed the truth of the thing the gray dust and ashes from which this illusion was made you think its poisoned jive said is that it maybe harvey replied still staring at the pie well its not jive said and ill prove it harvey heard rictus make a warning sound behind him but jive didnt catch it he plunged his fingers into the pie and ice cream and delivered them to his mouth in one swift motion as he closed his mouth rictus said dont swallow it again too late the food went down in one gulp an instant later jive dropped the plate and began to slam his fists against his stomach as if to force the food up again but instead of halfchewed pie a cloud of dust issued from between his teeth then another then another halfblinded jive snatched at harveys throat whathaveyoudone he coughed harvey had no difficulty shaking himself free its all dust he said dirt and dust and ashes all the food all the presents everything help me jive said clawing at his mouth somebody help me theres no help for you now came a solemn voice harvey looked around it was rictus who had spoken and he was retreating across the hallway his hands clamped to his face he stared at jive between his fingers his teeth chattering as he voiced the horrid truth you shouldnt have eaten that pie he said its reminding your belly of what youre made of whats that jive said what the boy says rictus replied dirt and ashes jive threw back his head howling noooo at this but even as he opened his mouth to deny it the truth came pouring forth dry streams of dust that ran from ms his gullet and flowed over ms angers it was like a fatal message being passed from one part of his body to another touched by the dust his fingers began to crumble in their turn and as they dropped the same whisper of decay spread to his thighs and knees and feet he started to drop to the ground but with a final pirouette swung himself around and grabbed hold of me banister save me he yelled up the stairs mr hood can you hear me please please save me his legs crumbled beneath him now but he refused to give up he started to haul himself up the stairs still yelling for mr hood to heal him there was no reply from the heights of the house however nor any sound now from rictus there were only jives pleas and wheezings and the hiss of dust as it ran away down the stairs from the emptying sack of his body whats going on wendell said appearing from the kitchen with ketchup smeared around his mouth he stared at the cloud of dust that hung around the stairs unable to see the creature at its heart harvey was closer to the cloud however and so was witness to jives last terrible moments the dying creature reached up with an almost fingerless hand still hopingeven as its life drifted awaythat its creator would come to save it then it sank down upon the stairs and its last pitiful fragments crumbled somebody been beating the carpets wendell said as jives dust settled two down harvey murmured to himself what did you say wendell wanted to know before he replied harvey glanced around the hallway looking for rictus but hoods third servant had disappeared it doesnt matter harvey said are you done eating yeah was the food good wendell grinned yeah harvey shook his head what does that mean wendell asked harvey was on the verge of saying it means you cant help me it means i have to go up and face mr hood on my own but what was the use the house had claimed wendell entirely hed be more of a hindrance than a help in the battle ahead so instead he said mrs griffins outside so we found her we found her ill go say hi wendell said with a cheery smile good idea wendell had his hand on the door when he turned and said where will you be but harvey didnt answer hed already climbed past the heap of dust that marked jives demise and was nearing the top of the first flight on his way to meet the power that lay waiting in the darkness of the attic xx the thieves meet glimpsing the dusty truth masquerading as pie and ice cream was one thing but scratching the veneer of deceits that the house had polished to such perfection was quite another as harvey climbed the stairs he kept hoping hed find some little detail in the walls or the carpets that would allow him to get his minds fingers beneath the lid of this illusion and lift it up to see what charmless thing lay inside if marr had been made of stale mud and spittle and jive of dust what was the house itself made of but it knew its business too well however hard harvey stared he could not pierce its lies it delighted his senses with warmth and color and the scents of summer it cooed softly in his ear and played its gentle airs against his face even when he reached the dark landing at the top of the final flight the house continued to pretend that this was just another innocent game of hideandseek like the countless games it had seen played in its shadow there were five doors ahead of him everyone of them ajar a few inches as if to say there are no secrets here not from a boy who wants the truth come look come see if you dare he dared but not in the way the house had planned after spending a few moments examining the doors he ignored all of them and instead went back down a flight chose a strong chair from one of the bedrooms brought it back upstairs climbed onto it and pushed open the trapdoor that let onto the attic it was hard work hauling himself up but he knew when hed finished and lay panting on the attic floor that his pursuit of hood was almost at an end the vampire king was near who else but a master of illusions would live in a place so bereft of them the attic was all the house was not filthy murky and cobwebbed where are you he said it was no use thinking he could surprise the enemy hood had watched his ascent from the first stair come out he yelled i want to see what a thief looks like there was no reply at first but thenfrom somewhere at the other end of the atticharvey heard a low guttural growl not whiting for his eyes to become fully accustomed to the gloom he started toward the utterance the boards creaking beneath his feet as he went twice he stopped to look up because a noise somewhere in the darkness overhead caught his attention was it a trapped bird panicking as it flew blindly back and forth or roaches perhaps massed on the beams above him he told himself to put such imaginings out of his head and concentrate on finding hood there were enough real reasons to be fearful here without inventing more unlike the area around the trapdoor this end of the attic served as some kind of storeroom and his enemy was surely lurking in the maze of rotting pictures and mildewed furniture in fact wasnt that a fluttering motion he saw now out of the corner of his eye hood he said squinting to try and make better sense of the shape in the shadows what are you doing hiding up here he took another step forward and as he did so he realized his error this wasnt the mysterious mr hood he knew this shape mangled though it was the halfrotted wings the tiny black eyes the teeth the endless teeth it was carna the creature half rose from its squalid nest snapping at harvey as it did so he made a stumbling retreat and might have been seized after three steps had carna not been so hobbled by its wounds and slowed by the chaos of its surroundings it struck out at the piles of detritus to the left and right of it scattering chairs and overturning boxes then hauled itself in pained pursuit of its prey harvey kept his eyes fixed upon the beast as he backed away his mind buzzing with questions where was hood that was the main mystery mrs griffin had been certain he was up here somewhere but harvey had now wandered the attic from end to end and its only occupant was the creature driving him back toward the exit he chanced several glances into the shadows as he retreated in case hed missed some figure hiding there it was not a human form his eyes alighted upon however it was a globe the size of a tennis ball glowing as though filled with starlight it appeared like a bubble from the boards and rose toward the roof momentarily forgetting his jeopardy harvey watched it as it ascended joined by another then a third and a fourth astonished by the sight he took too little care where he was walking he stumbled fell and ended up sprawled on the hard boards staring up at the roof through a red haze of pain and there above him was hood in all his glory his face was spread over the entire roof his features horribly distorted his eyes were dark pits gouged into the timbers his nose was flared and flattened grotesquely like the nose of an enormous bat his mouth was a lipless slit that was surely ten feet wide from which issued a voice that was like the creaking of doors and the howling of chimneys and the rattling of windows child he said you have brought pain into my paradise shame on you what pain harvey shouted back he was shuddering to his marrow but he knew this was no time to show his fear he would deal in illusion the way the enemy did pretending courage even if he didnt feel it i came to get what was mine thats all he said hood sucked one of the gleaming spheres into his mouth its light went out instantly marr is dead he said jive is dead gone to muck and dust because of you they were never alive harvey said did you not hear their sobs and pleas hood demanded the knots in his brow tightening did you not pity them no harvey said then i will not pity you came the rasping reply i will watch my poor carna devour you from sole to scalp and take pleasure in it harvey glanced in carnas direction the beast had stopped advancing but was poised to strike its dripping jaws inches from harveys feet now that the beast was still he could clearly see how badly wounded it was its body as ragged as a moldy rug its huge head drooping as though every breath was a burden as harvey stared at it he remembered something mrs griffin had told him i would welcome death now shed said like a friend id driven from my door maybe it wasnt a journey to the stars that was awaiting carna maybe it was simply a return to the nothingness from which hood had conjured it but the creature wanted that gift nevertheless it was weary and wounded kept alive not by any will of its own but because hood demanded its service such a pity the voice in the roof murmured what is harvey said looking back at hood who had two more of the globes at his lips to lose you this way he went on cant i persuade you to think again after all ive done you no harm why not come back and live here peacefully you stole thirty years of time with my mom and dad from me harvey said if i stay here youll steal a lot more i only took the days you didnt want hood protested the rainy days the gray days the days you wished away wheres the crime in that i didnt know what i was losing harvey protested ah said hood softly but isnt that always the way of it things slip from your fingers and when they re gone you regret it but gone is gone harvey swick no harvey said what you stole i can steal back at this a gleam ignited in the twin pits of hoods eyes you burn bright harvey swick he said ive never known a soul that burned as bright as yours he frowned as if studying the boy below now i understand he said understand what why it is you came back harvey began to say i came for what you took but hood was correcting him before hed uttered two words you came because you knew youd find a home here hood said were both thieves harvey swick i take time you take lives but in the end were the same both thieves of always repulsive as it was to think of himself in any way similar to this monster there was some comer of harvey that feared this was true the thought silenced him perhaps we neednt be enemies hood said perhaps i should take you under my wing my west wing he laughed mirthlessly at his own joke i can nurture you help you better understand the dark paths so ill end up feeding on children like you harvey said no hanks i think youd like it harvey swick hood said youve got a streak of the vampire in you already there was no denying this the very word vampire reminded him of his halloween flight of soaring against a harvest moon with his eyes burning red and his teeth sharp as razors i see you remember hood said catching the flicker of pleasure on harveys face harvey instantly put a scowl in its place i dont want to stay here he said i just want to get whats mine and leave hood sighed so sad he said so very sad but if you will have whats yours have death carnal the beast raised its pitiful head devour the boy before the wretched beast could shift itself harvey scrambled to his feet in the race to the trapdoor he knew he had little chance of outrunning carna but was there perhaps another way of laying the beast low if he was a thief of always as hood had said perhaps it was time to prove it not with dust nor with stolen conjurings but with the power in his own bones carna took a threatening step toward him but instead of retreating harvey extended his hand in the creatures direction as if to pat its decaying head it hesitated its expression mellowing into doubt devour him the vampire king growled the beast lowered its head in expectation of punishment from above but it was harvey who laid his hand upon it a gentle touch that sent a shudder through its body it raised its snout to press itself against harveys palm and as it did so let out a long low moan there was neither pain in the sound nor complaint in fact it was almost a moan of gratitude that for once it not be met with blows or with howls of horror it turned its eyes up to harveys face and a shudder of pleasure passed through its body it seemed to know that the motion would prove fatal because the instant after it retreated from its comforter and as it did so its shudders multiplied and its body suddenly flew into a thousand pieces its teeth which had seemed so fearsome moments before rolled away into the darkness its massive skull shattered its spine collapsed in a matter of seconds it was no more than a heap of bone shards so dry and so aged even the most desperate dog would have passed them by harvey glanced up at the face in the roof hoods expression was one of utter perplexity his mouth was agape his eyes staring from their pits harvey didnt wait for him to break his silence he simply turned his back on carnas remains and hurried toward the trapdoor half expecting the creature in the roof to slam it shut there was no response from hood however until harvey was lowering himself down onto the chair on the landing only then as harvey took one last look up at the attic did hood speak oh my little thief he murmured what shall me do with you now xxi tricks and temptations youve done well said the smiling face awaiting him at the top of the stairs i wondered where youd gone to harvey said to rictus always ready to serve came the unctuous reply really said harvey stepping down off the chair and approaching the creature of course said rictus always now that he was closer to the man harvey saw the cracks in his veneer he was plastering on a smile and smothering his words in butter and honey but it was the sour smell of fear that oozed from his sickly skin youre afraid of me arent you harvey said no no rictus insisted im respectful thats all mr hood thinks youre a bright boy hes instructed me to offer whatever you want to make you stay he spread his arms the skys the limit you know what i want anything but the years thief you cant have those you wont even need them if you stay and become mr hoods apprentice youll live forever just like him he dabbed at the sweat beads on his upper lip with a yellowed handkerchief think about it he said you might be able to kill the likes of carnaor mebut youll never hurt hood hes too old too wise too dead if i stayed harvey said rictuss grin spread yes he purred would the children in the lake go free why bother about them because one of them was my friend harvey reminded him youre thinking of little lulu arent you rictus said well let me tell you shes very happy down there they all are no theyre not harvey raged the lakes foul and you know it he took a step toward rictus who retreated as if in fear of his life which perhaps he was how would you like it harvey said stabbing his finger in rictuss direction living in the cold and the dark youre right said rictus raising his hands in surrender whatever you say i say set them free now harvey replied and if you wont then i will he pushed rictus aside and started down the stairs two at a time he didnt have a clue what he was going to do when he got down to the lake fish were fish after all even if theyd once been children if he tried to take them out of the lake theyd surely drown in the airbut he was determined to somehow save them from hood rictus came after him down the flight chattering like a clockwork salesman what do you want he said just imagine it and its yours how about your own motorcycle as he spoke something gleamed on the landing below and the sleekest motorcycle human eyes had ever seen rolled into view its yours mboy rictus said no thanks harvey said i dont blame you rictus said kicking the motorcycle over as he sailed past it how about books do you like books before harvey could reply the wall in front of him lifted like a great brick curtain revealing shelf upon shelf of leatherbound volumes the masterpieces of the world rictus said from aristotle to zola no no said harvey hurrying on theres got to be something you want rictus said they were heading toward the final flight of stairs now and rictus knew he didnt have very long before his prey was out in the open air you like dogs rictus said as a litter of yapping pups scampered up the stairs pick one hell have em all harvey was tempted but he stepped over them and on something more exotic maybe rictus said as a flock of brilliantly feathered parrots descended from the ceiling harvey waved them away too noisy huh said rictus you want something quiet and powerful tigers thats what you want tigers no sooner said than they padded into view in the hallway below two white tigers with eyes like polished gold nowhere to keep em harvey said thats practical rictus conceded i like a practical kid as the tigers bounded off the telephone on the table beside the kitchen door began to ring rictus was down the flight in two springs and at the table in another two listen to this he said its the president he wants to give you a medal no he doesnt harvey said tiring of this rigamarole now he was at the bottom of the stairs and crossing to the front door youre right said rictus ear to the phone again he wants to give you an oil field in alaska harvey kept walking no no i got that wrong he wants to give you alaska too cold he says how about florida too hot boy youre a difficult guy to please harvey swick harvey ignored him and turned the handle of the front door rictus slammed down the phone and raced toward him wait up he hollered wait up im not done yet youve got nothing i want harvey said hauling open the front door theyre all fakes what if they are said rictus suddenly hushed sos the sun out there you can still enjoy it and let me tell you it takes a lot of magic to conjure up all these shams and hoaxes mr hoods really sweating to find you something you like ignoring him harvey stepped out onto the porch mrs griffin was standing on the lawn with stewcat in her arms squinting up at the house she smiled when she saw harvey emerge i heard such noises she said whats been going on in there ill tell you later said harvey wheres wendell he wandered off she said harvey cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled wendell wendell his voice came back to him from the face of the house but there was no reply from wendell its a warm afternoon said rictus idling on the porch maybe he wentswimming oh no harvey murmured no not wendell please not wendell rictus shrugged he was a goofy little kid anyhow he said hell probably look better as a fish no harvey yelled up at the house this isnt fair you cant do this you cant tears started to cloud his eyes he wiped them away with his fists they were both useless fists and tears he couldnt soften hoods heart with weeping and he couldnt bring down the house with blows he had no weapon against the enemy but his wits and his wits were about at an end xxii appetite oh to be a vampire again harvey thought to have claws and fangs and a hunger for blood upon him like the hunger hed had that distant halloween the hunger hed turned from in disgust he wouldnt turn from it now oh no hed let it swell the beast in him so he could fly in hoods face with his hatred razorsharp but he wasnt a beast he was a boy it was the vampire king who had the power not him and then as he stared up at the house he remembered something that rictus had told him at the door it takes a lot of magic to conjure up these shams and hoaxes hed said mr hoods really sweating to find you something you like maybe i dont need fangs to suck him dry harvey thought maybe all i need is wishes i want to talk to hood he told rictus why wellmaybe there are some things id like only i want to tell him about them personally hes listening rictus said glancing back toward the house harvey scanned the windows and the eaves and the porch but there was no sign of any presence i dont see him he said yes you do rictus replied is he in the house harvey asked staring through the open door havent you guessed yet rictus replied he is the house as he spoke a cloud moved over the sun the roof and walls darkened and the entire house seemed to swell like a monstrous fungus it was alive from the eaves to the foundations alive go on rictus said speak to him hes listening harvey took a step toward the house can you hear me he said the front door swung a little wider and a sighing breath from the top of the stairs blew a cloud of jives dust out onto the porch he can hear you said rictus if i stay harvey began yesss said the house making the word from creaks and rattles youll give me anything i want for a bright boy like you came the reply anything you promise on your magic i promise i promise just say the word well for a start yesss i lost my ark then you must have another my lodestar the hoodhouse said bigger better and a board of the porch folded back as an ark three times the size of the first one rose into view i dont want lead animals harvey said as he walked toward the steps what then said hood silver gold flesh and blood harvey replied perfect little animals i like a challenge hood said and as he spoke a tinny din of bellows and roars rose from the ark and the little windows were flung open and the doors flung wide and half a hundred animals appeared all perfect miniatures elephants giraffes hyenas aardvarks doves satisfied said hood harvey shrugged its okay i suppose he said okay said hood its a little miracle so make me another another ark another miracle what would you like harvey turned his back on the hoodhouse and surveyed the lawn the sight of mrs griffin watching with puzzlement inspired the next request i want flowers he said everywhere and i dont want two alike what for asked the hoodhouse you said i could have whatever i wanted harvey replied you didnt say i had to give you reasons if i have to do that all the fun goes out of it oh i wouldnt want that the hoodhouse said you must have fun at all costs so give me the flowers harvey insisted the lawn began to tremble as though a minor earthquake were underway and the next moment countless shoots pressed up between the blades of grass mrs griffin began to laugh with delight look at them she said just look it was quite a show tens of thousands of flowers bursting into blossom at the same time harvey could have named a few of them if hed been quizzed tulips daffodils roses but most of them were new to him species that only bloomed at night on the high himalayas or on the windswept plateaus of tierra del fuego flowers with blooms as big as his head or as small as his thumbnail blooms that stank like bad meat or smelled like a breeze from heaven itself even though he knew it was all an illusion he was impressed and said so looks good he told the hoodhouse satisfied it wanted to know was its voice a little weaker than it had been earlier harvey wondered he suspected it was he showed no sign of that suspicion however he simply said were getting there getting where said the hoodhouse well said harvey i guess well know when we arrive a low growl of irritation came from the house shaking the windows one or two slates slid from the roof and smashed on the ground below im going to have to be careful harvey thought hoods getting angry rictus echoed that thought i hope youre not stringing mr hood along he warned because he doesnt like that kind of game he wants me happy doesnt he harvey said of course so how about something to eat the kitchens full said rictus i dont want pies and hot dogs i want he paused ransacking his memory for delicacies hed heard about roast swan and oysters and those little black eggs caviar rictus suggested thats it i want caviar really its disgusting i still want it said harvey and frogs legs and horseradish and pomegranates the meals were already appearing in the hallway plate upon steaming plate the smells were tantalizing at first but the more dishes harvey added to the list the more sickly the mix became he rapidly began to exhaust his menu of real meals however so instead of giving the house easy recipes like meatballs and pizzas he started to invent dishes i want crawfish cooked in cherry soda and horse steaks with jellybean sauce and boston cream cheese and pastrami soup wait wait said rictus youre going too fast but harvey didnt stop and pumpernickel stew and snail fudge with pigsfoot clusters wait the house howled this time harvey stopped in the heat of his invention he hadnt even looked to see if hood was supplying him with these eatables but now he saw all the dishes hed demanded piled so high in the hallway that they were threatening to topple and float the ark on a noxious sea of sweetmeats and stews i know what youre doing said the hoodhouse uhoh harvey thought hes onto me he looked up from the feast at the door to the facade and saw that his plan to drain the house of its magic was indeed working many of the windows were now cracked or broken the doors were peeling and hanging from their hinges the porch boards were twisted and blighted youre testing me arent you said hood his voice had never been melodious but it was now uglier than ever like the rumble of the devils belly admit it thief he said harvey took a deep breath then said if im going to be your apprentice i need to know how powerful you are are you satisfied the decaying house demanded almost harvey said what more do you want it roared what more indeed harvey thought his mind was reeling with these ridiculous lists he had little left in the way of demands you may have one final gift the hoodhouse said one final proof of my power then you must accept me as your master forever and ever agreed harvey felt a trickle of cold sweat run down his spine he stared at the teetering house his mind racing what was left to demand agreed the house boomed agreed he said so tell me it went on what do you want he looked at the tiny animals around the ark and at the flowers and at the food spewing through the door what should he demand one final request to break hoods back but what what a gust of chilly wind came from the direction of the lake autumn could not be far off the season of dying things i know he said suddenly tell me the house replied tell me and lets have this game over owe and fur all i want your bright soul under my wing little thief and i want the seasons harvey said all the seasons at once at once yes at once thats nonsensical its what i want stupid imbecilic its what i want you said one more wish and thats it very well said the house i will give it to you and when you have it little thief your soul is mine xxiii the war of seasons hood didnt waste any time hed no sooner made his final offer to harvey than the balmy wind grew gusty carrying off the lambs wool clouds that had been drifting through the summer sky in their place came a juggernaut a thunderhead the size of a mountain which loomed over the house like a shadow thrown against heaven it had more than lightning at its dark heart it had the light rains that came at early morning to coax forth the seeds of another spring it had the drooping fogs of autumn and the spiraling snows that had brought so many midnight christmases to the house now all three fell at oncerains snows and fogsas a chilly sleet that all but covered the sun it would have killed the flowers on the slope with cold had the wind not reached them first tearing through the blossoms with such vehemence that every petal and leaf was snatched up into the air standing between this fragrant tide and the plummeting curtain of ice and cloud harvey was barely able to stay upright but he planted his feet wide apart and resisted every blast and buffet determined not to take shelter this spectacle might be the last he set eyes upon as a free spirit indeed as a living spirit he intended to enjoy it it was a sight to behold a battle the likes of which the planet had never seen to his left shafts of sunlight pierced the storm clouds in the name of summer only to be smothered by autumns fogs while to his right spring coaxed its legions out of bough and earth then saw its buds murdered by winters frosts before they could show their colors attack after attack was mounted and repulsed reveille and retreat sounded a hundred times but no one season was able to carry the day it was soon impossible to distinguish defeats from victories the rallies and the feints the diversions and encirclements all became one confusion snows melted into rains as they fell rains were boiled into vapor and sweated new shoots out through the rot of their brothers and somewhere in the midst of this chaos the power that had brought it about raised its voice in a rage demanding that it cease enough the hoodhouse yelled enough but its voicewhich had once carried such terrible authority had grown weak its orders went unnoticed or if noticed then disobeyed the seasons raged on throwing themselves against each other with rare abandon and in passing tearing at the house which stood in the midst of their battlefield the walls which had begun to teeter as hoods power diminished were thrown over by the raging wind the chimneys were wracked by thunder and toppled the lightning rods struck so many times they melted and fell through the slateless roof in a burning rain setting fire to every floorboard banister and stick of furniture they touched the porch pummeled by hail was reduced to matchwood the staircase rocked to its foundations by the growth in the dirt around it collapsed like a tower of cards squinting against the face of the storm harvey witnessed all of this and rejoiced hed come to the house hoping to steal back the years that hood had tricked from him but hed never dared believe he could bring the whole edifice down yet here it was falling as he watched loud though the dins of wind and thunder were they couldnt drown out the sound of the house as it perished and went to dust every nail and sill and brick seemed to shriek at once a cry of pain that only oblivion could comfort harvey was denied a glimpse of hoods last moments a cloud of dirt rose like a veil to cover the sight but he knew the moment his battle with the vampire king was over because the warring seasons suddenly turned to peace the thunderhead softened its furies and dispersed the wind dropped to an idling breeze the fierce sun grew watery and veiled itself in mist there was debris in the air of course petals and leaves dust and ash they fell like a dream rain though their fall marked the end of a dream oh childsaid mrs griffin harvey turned to her she was standing just a few yards from him gazing up at the sky there was a little patch of blue above their heads the first glimpse of real sky these few acres of ground had seen since hood had founded his empire of illusions but it was not the patch she was watching it was a congregation of floating lightsthe same that harvey had seen hood feeding upon in the atticwhich had been freed by the collapse of the house they were now moving in a steady stream toward the lake the childrens souls she said her voice growing thinner as she spoke the word beautiful her body was no longer solid harvey saw she was fading away in front of him oh no he murmured she took her eyes off the sky and stared down at her arms and the cat she was carrying in them it too was growing insubstantial look at us mrs griffin said with a smile upon her weary face it feels so wonderful but youre disappearing ive lingered here far too long sweet boy she said there were tears glistening on her face but they were tears of joy not of sadness its time to go she kept stroking stewcat as they both faded from sight you are the brightest soul i ever met harvey swick she said keep shining wont you harvey wished he had some words to persuade her to stay a little while longer but even if hed had such words he knew it would have been selfish to speak them mrs griffin had another life to go to where every soul shone goodbye child she said wherever i go i will speak of you with love then her ghostly form flickered out leaving harvey alone in the ruins xxiv a fledgling thief he was not alone for long mrs griffin and stewcat had no sooner vanished from sight than harvey heard a voice calling his name the air was still thick with dust and he had to look hard for the speaker but after a little time he found her stumbling toward him lulu who else she said with a little laugh the lakes dark water still soaked her from head to foot but as it ran from her body and into the ground the last traces of her silver scales went with it when she opened her arms to him they were human arms youre free he said running to her and hugging her hard i cant believe youre free were all free she said and glanced back toward the lake an extraordinary sight met his eyes a procession of laughing children coming toward him through the mist those closest to him were all but returned to their human shape those behind them still shaking off their fishiness step by step we should all get out of here harvey said looking toward the wall i dont think well have any trouble getting through the mist now one of the children behind lulu had spotted a box of clothes in the rubble of the house and announcing his find to the rest stumbled through the debris to find something to wear lulu left harveys side to join the search but not before shed planted a kiss on his cheek dont expect one from me said a voice out of the dust and wendell stepped into view beaming from ear to ear what did you do harvey he wanted to know as he surveyed the chaos pull the place down brick by brick something like that said harvey unable to conceal his pride there was a roaring sound from the direction of the lake whats that harvey wanted to know the waters disappearing wendell said where to wendell shrugged who cares he said maybe its all being sucked to hell eager to witness this harvey walked toward the lake and through the clouds of dirt in the air saw that it had indeed become a whirlpool its once placid waters now a raging spiral what happened to hood by the way wendell wanted to know hes gone said harvey almost mesmerized by the sight of the vortex theyve all gone even as the words left his lips a voice said not quite he turned from the waters and there in the rubble stood rictus his fine jacket was torn and his face was white with dust he looked like a clown a laughing clown now why would i take myself off he asked we never said goodbye harvey stared at him with bafflement on his face hood was gone so was his magic how could rictus have survived the disappearance of his master i know what youre thinking said rictus reaching into his pocket youre wondering why im not dead and gone well ill tell you i did some plannin ahead he drew a glass globe which flickered as though it held a dozen candle flames out of his pocket i stole a little piece of the old mans magic just in case he ever got tired of me and tried to put me out of my misery he lifted the globe up to his leering face ive got enough power here to keep me going for years and years he said long enough to build a new house and take over where hood left off oh dont look so unhappy kid i got a place for you right here he slapped his thigh you can be my bird dog ill send you out lookin for kiddiewinkies to bring home to uncle rictus he slapped his thigh a second time cmon he said dont waste my time now i dont he stopped there his gaze dropping to the rubble at his feet a terrified whisper escaped his throat oh no he murmured i beg before he could finish his plea a hand with footlong fingers reached up from the rubble and snatched hold of his throat dragging him down into the dirt in one swift motion mine said a voice out of the ground mine it was hood harvey knew there was no other voice on earth that cut so deep rictus struggled in his creators grip digging in the debris for some weapon but none came to hand all he had was his skill as a persuader the magics yours he said i was holding on to it for you liar said the voice that rose from the debris i was i swear give it to me then hood demanded where shall i put it rictus asked his voice a strangled croak hoods hand loosened him a little and he managed to haul himself to his knees right here hood said hanging onto rictuss collar by his littlest digit while his forefinger pointed down toward the rubble pour it into the ground but into the ground rictus pressed the globe between his palms and it shattered like a sphere of spun sugar its bright contents running out between his palms and into the ground in front of him there was a moment of silence then a tremor ran through the rubble hoods finger let its captive slip and rictus hurriedly got to his feet he had no chance to make an escape however pieces of timber and stone instantly moved over the heaps of rubble toward the spot where hed poured the magic several lifted high into the air all rictus could do was cover his head as the hail increased harvey was clear of this flying debris and might well have made a retreat in these few moments but he was wiser than that if he fled now he knew his business with hood would never be finished it would be like a nightmare he could never quite shake from his head whatever happened next however terrible it would be better to see it and understand it than to turn his back and have his mind haunt him with imaginings to his dying day he didnt have to wait long for hoods next move the hand holding rictuss neck suddenly let him go and in a flash was gone from sight the following moment the ground gaped and a form appeared hunched over as it climbed out of its tomb in the rubble rictus let out a cry of horror but it was short before he could retreat one step the figure reached for him and turning to face harvey held his traitorous servant high here at last was the evil that had built the holiday house shaped more or less as a man he was not made of flesh blood and bone however he had used the magic rictus had unwillingly provided to create another body in the high times of his evil hood had been the house now it was the other way around the house what was left of it had become mr hood xxv the vortex his eyes were made of broken mirrors and his face of gouged stone he had a mane of splinters and limbs of timber he had shattered slates for teeth and rusty screws for fingernails and a cloak of rotted drapes that scarcely hid the darkness of his heart from sight so thief he said ignoring rictuss pitiful struggles you see me as the man was or rather as a copy of that man is it what you expected yes harvey said its exactly what i expected oh youre dirt and muck and bits and pieces harvey said youre nothing nothing am i said hood nothing ha ill show you thief ill show you what i am let me kill him for you rictus managed to gasp you neednt bother ill do it you brought him here hood said turning his splintered eyes on his servant youre to blame hes just a boy i can deal with him just let me do it let me before rictus could finish hood took hold of his servants head and with one short motion simply twisted it off a yellowish cloud of foulsmelling air rose from the severed neck and rictusthe last of hoods abominable quartetperished in an instant hood let the head go from his hand it flew up into the air like an unknotted balloon giving off a farting sputter as it looped the loop and finally fell emptied to the ground hood casually dropped the body which had summarily shrunk to nothing and turned his mirrored gaze back upon harvey now thief he said you will see power his mane of splinters stood on end as though every one of them was ready to pierce harveys heart his mouth grew wide as a tunnel and a blast of sour icy air rose from his belly come closer he roared opening his arms the rags that clung there billowed and spread like the wings of some ancient vampire a vampire that had dined on the blood of pterodactyl and tyrannosaur come he said again or must i come for you harvey didnt waste his breath with a reply hed need every gasp he had if he was to outpace this horror not even certain what direction he was taking he turned on his heels and ran as another blast of soulfreezing air struck him the ground was treacherous slippery and strewn with rubble he fell within six strides and glanced back to see hood descending upon him with a vengeful shriek he hauled himself to his feethoods rusted nails missing him by a whistling inchand had taken three stumbling strides from hoods shadow when he heard lulu calling his name he veered in the direction of her voice but hood caught the collar of his jacket got you little thief he roared dragging harvey back into his splintery embrace before hood could catch better hold however harvey threw back his arms and pitched himself forward off came the jacket and he made a third dash for freedom his eyes fixed on lulu who was beckoning him toward her she was standing on the edge of the lake he realized perched inches from the spinning waters surely she didnt imagine they could escape into the lake the vortex would tear them limb from limb we cant he yelled to lulu we must she called back its the only way he was within three strides of her now he could see her bare feet slithering and sliding on the slimy rock as she fought to keep her balance he reached out for her determined to snatch her from her perch before she fell but her eyes werent on him they were on the monster at his back lulu he yelled to her dont look but her gaze was fixed upon hood her mouth agape and harvey couldnt help but glance back to see what fascinated her so hoods pursuit had thrown his coat of rags into disarray and there was something between its folds he saw darker than any night sky or lightless cellar what was it the essence of his magic perhaps guarding his loveless heart do you give up hood said driving harvey back onto the rocks beside lulu surely you would not choose the vortex over me go harvey murmured to lulu his gaze still fixed on the mystery beneath hoods coat he felt her hand grasp his for a moment its the only way she said then her fingers were gone and he was standing on the rocks alone if you choose the flood you will die horribly hood was saying it will spin you apart whereas i he extended an inviting hand to harvey stepping up onto the rock as he did so i offer you an easy death rocked to sleep on a bed of illusions he made a smile and it was the foulest sight harvey had ever seen choose he said out of the corner of his eye harvey glimpsed lulu she had not fled as hed thought shed simply gone to find a weapon and she had one a piece of timber dragged out of the rubble it would be precious little use against hoods enormity harvey knew but he was glad not to be alone in these last moments he looked up at hoods face maybe i should sleep he said the vampire king smiled wise little thief he replied opening his arms to invite the boy into his shadow harvey took a step over the rock toward hood raising his hand as he did so his face was reflected in the shattered mirrors of the vampires eyes two thieves in one head sleep said hood but harvey had no intention of sleeping yet before hood could stop him he grabbed hold of the creatures coat and pulled the scraps came away with a wet tearing sound and hood let out a howl of rage as he was uncovered there was no great enchantment at his heart in fact there was no heart at all there was only a voidneither cold nor hot living nor deadmade not of mystery but of nothingness the illusionists illusion furious at this revelation hood let out another roar of rage and reached down to reclaim the rags of his coat from the thiefs hands harvey took a quick step backward however avoiding the fingers by a whisker hood came raging after him his soles squealing on the rock leaving harvey with no choice but to retreat another step until he had nowhere to go but the flood again hood snatched at the filched rags and would have had both coat and thief in one fatal grasp had lulu not run at him from behind swinging the timber like a baseball bat she struck the back of hoods knee so hard her weapon shattered the impact pitching her to the ground the blow was not without effect however it threw hood off balance and he flailed wildly the thunder of the vortex shaking the rock on which he and harvey perched and threatening to toss them both into the maelstrom even now hood was determined to claim his rags back from harvey and conceal the void in him give me my coat thief he howled its all yours harvey yelled and tossed the stolen rags toward the waters hood lunged after them and as he did so harvey flung himself back toward solid ground he heard hood shriek behind him and turned to see the vampire kingthe rags in his fist pitch headfirst into the frenzied waters the maned head surfaced a moment later and hood struck out for the bank but strong as he was the vortex was stronger it swept him away from the rocks drawing him toward its center where the waters were spiraling down into the earth in terror he started to plead for assistance his pitiful bargains only audible when the whirlpool carried him to the bank where harvey and lulu now stood thief he yelled help me andill give youthe world foreverand ever then the ferocity of the waters began to rip at his makeshift body tearing out his nails and rattling out his teeth washing away his mane of splinters and shaking his limbs apart at the joints reduced to a living litter of flotsam and jetsam he was drawn into the white waters at the whirlpools heart and shrieking with rage went where all evil must go at last into nothingness on the shore harvey put his arms around lulu laughing and sobbing at the same time we did it he said did what said a voice at their backs and they looked around to see wendell wandering toward them blithe as ever every article of clothing hed found in the rubble was either too large or too small whats been going on he wanted to know what are you laughing at what are you crying for he looked beyond harvey and lulu in time to see the last fragments of hoods body disappear with a fading howl and what was that he demanded harvey wiped the tears from his cheeks and got to his feet at last he had a purpose for wendells perpetual reply who cares he said xxvi living proof the wall of mist still hovered at the edge of hoods domain and it was there that the survivors gathered to say their farewells none quite knew what adventures lay on the other side of the mist of course each of the children had come into the house from a different year would they all find that agegive or take a month or twoawaiting them on the other side even if we dont get the stolen years back lulu said as they prepared to step into the mist were free because of you harvey there were murmurs of thanks from the little crowd and a few grateful tears say something wendell hissed to harvey why because youre a hero i dont feel like one so tell them that harvey raised his hands to hush the murmurs i just want to saywell probably all forget about being here in a little while a few of the children said no me wont or well always remember you but harvey insisted we will he said well grow up and well forget unless unless what asked lulu unless we remind ourselves every morning or make a story of it and tell everyone we meet they wont believe us said one of the children that doesnt matter said harvey well know its true and thats what counts this met with approval from all sides now lets go home said harvey weve wasted too much time here already wendell nudged him in the ribs as the group dispersed what about telling them youre not a hero he said oh yeah said harvey with a mischievous smile i forgot about that the first of the children were already braving the wall of mist eager to put the horrors of hoods prison behind them as soon as possible harvey watched them fading with every step they took and wished hed had a moment to talk to them to find out who they were and why theyd wandered into hoods grip had they been orphans with no other place to call home or runaways like wendell and lulu or simply bored with their lives the way hed been bored and seduced by illusions he would never know they were disappearing one by one until there was only lulu wendell and himself left on the inside of the wall well wendell said to harvey if time really is set to rights out there then im going back a few more years than you thats true if we meet again im going to be a lot older you may not even know me ill know you harvey said promise said wendell i promise with that they shook hands and wendell made his departure into the mist he was gone in three strides lulu sighed heavily have you ever wanted two things at the same time she asked harvey but you knew you couldnt have both of them once or twice said harvey why because id like to grow up with you and be your friend she replied but i also want to go home and i think in the year thats waiting for me on the other side of that wall you havent even been born harvey nodded sadly glancing back toward the ruins i guess we do have one thing to thank hood for whats that we were children together he said taking hold of her hand at least for a little while lulu tried to smile but her eyes were full of tears lets go together as far as we can harvey said yes id like that lulu replied and hand in hand they walked toward the wall at the last moment before the mist eclipsed them they looked around at each other and harvey said home then they stepped into the wall for the first stride he felt lulus hand in his but by the second stride it had grown faint and by the thirdwhen he stepped out into the street it and she had gone completely delivered back into the time from which shed stepped all those seasons ago harvey looked up at the sky the sun had set but its pinkish light still found the ribs of cloud laid high above him the wind was gusty and chilled the sweat of fear and exertion on his face and spine teeth chattering he started home through the darkening streets uncertain what awaited him it was strange that after so many victories the simple business of walking home should defeat him but defeat him it did after an hour of wandering his wits and strength which had preserved him from every terror hood could conjurefailed him his head began to spin his legs buckled beneath him and he fell down on the sidewalk exhausted luckily two passersby took pity on him and gently asked him where he lived it was dangerous he vaguely recalled to trust his life to total strangers but he had no choice all he could do was give himself over to their care and hope that the world hed returned to still had a little kindness in it he woke in darkness and for one heartstopping moment he thought the black lake had claimed him after all and he was down in its depths a prisoner crying out in terror he sat up and to his infinite relief saw the window at the bottom of his bed the curtains slightly parted and heard the light patter of rain upon the sill he was home he swung his legs out of bed and stood up his whole body ached as though hed gone ten rounds with a heavyweight boxer but he was strong enough to hobble to the door and open it the sound of two familiar voices drifted up from the bottom of the stairs im just happy hes home he heard his mom say so am i said his dad but we need some explanations well get them his mom went on but we shouldnt push him too hard clinging to the banisters as he went harvey started down the stairs while his mom and dad continued to talk we need to find out the truth quickly his father said i mean suppose he was involved with something criminal not harvey yes harvey you saw the state of him blood and dirt all over him hes not been out picking roses thats for sure at the bottom of the stairs harvey halted a little afraid to face the truth had anything changed or were the two people just out of sight still old and frail he went to the door and pushed it open his mom and dad were standing with their backs to him at the window staring out at the rain hello he said they both turned at the same moment and harvey let out a whoop of joy to see that all the griefs and horrors of the house had not been endured in vain here was his prize staring down at him his mother and father looking just the way they had before rictus had come for him the stolen years were back where they belonged in his possession im a good thief he said half to himself oh my darling said his mom coming to him with open arms he hugged her first then his dad what have you been up to son his dad wanted to know harvey remembered how difficult it had been to explain everything last time so instead of even trying he said i was just wandering around and i got lost i didnt mean to get you upset you said something about a thief did i you know you did his dad said sternly wellare you a thief if youre taking something that belongs to you in the first place harvey asked him his dad and mom exchanged puzzled looks no honey his mom said of course not then im not a thief harvey replied i think you owe both of us the truth harvey his mom said we want to know everything everything everything said his dad so he told them the whole tale just as theyd asked right from the beginning and if their expressions had been doubtful the last time hed related his adventures they were incredulous now do you really expect us to believe all of this his father broke in while harvey was talking about meeting hood in the attic i can take you to the house harvey said or whats left of it i couldnt find it last time because it hid itself from grownups but hoods gone so theres no magic left to hide it with once again his mom and dad exchanged baffled looks if you can find this hoodhouse his father said wed both like to see it they set out early the following day and this timejust as harvey had expectedthe way back to the house was not concealed by magic he found the streets that rictus had first led him along easily enough and very soon the gentle slope on which the house had once stood came into view thats it he said to his mom and dad the house stood there its just a hill harvey his dad said a hill covered in grass it was indeed a surprise to see that the ground on which so many terrible deeds had been done had greened so quickly it all looks rather pretty his mom said as they came to the place where the mist wall had stood the ruins are under there i swear harvey said venturing onto the slope ill show you come on they werent the only visitors here today there were several kiteflyers plying the wind at the top of the ridge a dozen or more dogs romping around children laughing as they rolled down the slope even a pair of lovers whispering in each others ears harvey resented the presence of all these people how dare they romp and laugh and fly their kites here he thought as though it were just another hill he wanted to tell them all that they were cavorting on the ruins of a vampires house and see how quickly that wiped the smiles off their faces but then he thought perhaps it was better this way better that the hill not be haunted by rumors and stories the name of hood would probably never cross the lips of these lovers and kiteflyers and why should it his evil had no place in happy hearts well said harveys dad as the three of them climbed the slope this house of yours is well buried harvey went down on his haunches and dug at the dirt with his bare hands the ground was soft and gave off the sweet smell of fertility strange isnt it said a voice he looked up from his labors both his fists full of dirt a man a little older than his father was standing a few yards from him smiling what are you talking about harvey asked the flowers the ground he said maybe the earth has its own magicgood magic i meanand its buried hoods memory forever you know about hood harvey said the man nodded oh yes what exactly do you know harveys mom asked our son heres been telling us such strange stories theyre all true the man said you havent even heard them harveys dad replied you should trust your boy the man said i have it on the best authority that hes a hero harveys dad stared at his son with a twitch of a smile on his face really he said were you one of hoods prisoners not me the man said then how do you know the man glanced over his shoulder and there at the bottom of the slope stood a woman in a white dress harvey studied this stranger trying to make out her face but her widebrimmed hat kept her features in shadow he started to get to his feet intending to take a closer look but the man said dontplease she sent me in her place just to say hello she remembers you the way you are young that isand shed like you to remember her the same way lulu harvey murmured the man neither confirmed nor denied this he simply said to harvey i am much obliged to you young man i hope to be as fine a husband to her as you were a friend husband harvey mouthed how time flies the man said consulting his watch were late for lunch may i shake your hand young sir its dirty harvey warned letting the earth run between the fingers of his right hand what could be better between us the man replied with a smile than thishealing earth he took harveys hand shook it and with a nod to harveys mom and dad hurried back down the slope harvey watched as he spoke to the woman in the white dress saw her nod saw her smile in his direction then they were both gone out into the street and away well said harveys dad it seems your mr hood existed after all so you believe me harvey asked something happened here came the reply and you were a hero i believe that then thats enough said harveys mom you dont have to keep digging sweetie whatevers under there should stay buried harvey was about to empty his left hand of dirt when his dad said let me have that and opened his hand really said harvey ive heard a little good magics always useful came his fathers reply isnt that right harvey smiled and poured a fistful of earth into his fathers palm always he said the days that followed were unlike any harvey had ever known though there was no more talk of hood or of the house or of the green hill upon which it had once stood the subject was a part of every look and laugh that passed between him and his parents he knew they had only the vaguest sense of what had happened to them but they were all three agreed on one thing that it was fine to be together again time would be precious from now on it would tick by of course as it always had but harvey was determined he wouldnt waste it with sighs and complaints hed fill every moment with the seasons hed found in his heart hopes like birds on a spring branch happiness like a warm summer sun magic like the rising mists of autumn and best of all love love enough for a thousand christmases
