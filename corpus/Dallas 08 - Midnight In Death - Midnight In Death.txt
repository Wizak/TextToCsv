 chapter one murder respects no traditions it ignores sentiment it takes no holidays because murder was her business lieutenant eve dallas stood in the predawn freeze of christmas morning coating the deerskin gloves her husband had given her only hours before with sealit the call had come in less than an hour before and less than six hours since shed closed a case that had left her shaky and exhausted her first christmas with roarke wasnt getting off to a rousing start then again it had taken a much nastier turn for judge harold wainger his body had been dumped dead center in the ice rink at rockefeller center face up so his glazed eyes could stare at the huge celebrational tree that was new yorks symbol of goodwill toward men his body was naked and already a deep shade of blue the thick mane of silver hair that had been his trademark had been roughly chopped off and though his face was severely battered she had no trouble recognizing him shed sat in his courtroom dozens of times in her ten years on the force he had been she thought a solid and steady man with as much understanding of the slippery channels of the law as respect for the heart of it she crouched down to get a closer look at the words that had been burned deeply into his chest judge not lest you be judged she hoped the burns had been inflicted postmortem but she doubted it he had been mercilessly beaten the fingers of both hands broken deep wounds around his wrists and ankles indicated that hed been bound but it hadnt been the beating or the burns that killed him the rope used to hang him was still around his neck digging deep into flesh even that wouldnt have been quick she decided it didnt appear that his neck had been broken and the burst vessels in his eyes and face signaled slow strangulation he wanted you alive as long as possible she murmured he wanted you to feel it all kneeling now she studied the handwritten note that was flapping gaily in the wind it had been fixed over the judges groin like an obscene loincloth the list of names had been printed in careful square block letters judge harold wainger prosecuting attorney stephanie ring public defender carl neissan justine polinsky doctor charlotte mira lieutenant eve dallas saving me for last dave she recognized the style gleeful infliction of pain followed by a slow torturous death david palmer enjoyed his work his experiments as hed called them when eve had finally hunted him down three years before by the time shed gotten him into a cage he had eight victims to his credit and with them an extensive file of discs recording his work since then hed been serving the eight lifeterm sentences that wainger had given him in a maximumsecurity ward for mental defectives but you got out didnt you dave this is your handiwork the torture the humiliations the burns public dumping spot for the body no copycat here bag him she ordered and got wearily to her feet it didnt look as though the last days of december were going to be much of a party the minute she was back in her vehicle eve ordered the heat on full blast she stripped off her gloves and rubbed her hands over her face she would have to go in and file her report but the first order of business couldnt wait for her to drive to her home office damn if she was going to spend christmas day at cop central she used the indash link to contact dispatch and arrange to have each name on the list notified of possible jeopardy christmas or not she was ordering uniformed guards on each one as she drove she engaged her computer computer status on david palmer mentaldefective inmate on rexal penal facility working david palmer sentenced to eight consecutive life terms in offplanet facility rexal reported escaped during transport to prison infirmary december nineteen manhunt ongoing i guess dave decided to come home for the holidays she glanced up scowling as a blimp cruised over blasting christmas tunes as dawn broke over the city screw the herald angels she thought and called her commander sir she said when whitneys face filled her screen im sorry to disturb your christmas ive already been notified about judge wainger he was a good man yes sir he was she noted that whitney was wearing a robe a thick rich burgundy that she imagined had been a gift from his wife roarke was always giving her fancy presents she wondered if whitney was as baffled by them as she usually was his bodys being transferred to the morgue i have the evidence sealed and am en route to my home office now i would have preferred another primary on this lieutenant he saw her tired eyes flash the golden brown darkening still her face with its sharp angles the firm chin with its shallow dent the full unsmiling mouth stayed cool and controlled do you intend to remove me from the case youve just come off a difficult and demanding investigation your aide was attacked im not calling peabody in eve said quickly shes had enough and you havent she opened her mouth closed it again tricky ground she acknowledged commander my names on the list exactly one more reason for you to take a pass here part of her wanted to the part that wanted badly to put it all aside for the day to go home and have the kind of normal christmas shed never experienced but she thought of wainger stripped of all life and all dignity i tracked david palmer and i broke him he was my collar and no one knows the inside of his mind the way i do palmer whitneys wide brow furrowed palmers in prison not anymore he escaped on the nineteenth and hes back commander you could say i recognized his signature the names on the list she continued pressing her point theyre all connected to him wainger was the judge during his trial stephanie ring was apa cicely towers prosecuted the case but shes dead ring assisted carl neissan was his courtappointed attorney when palmer refused to hire his own counsel justine polinksy served as jury foreman dr mira tested him and testified against him at trial i brought him in the names on the list need to be notified already done sir and bodyguards assigned i can pull the data from the files into my home unit to refresh my memory but its fairly fresh as it is you dont forget someone like david palmer another primary will have to start at the beginning taking time that we dont have i know this man how he works how he thinks what he wants what he wants lieutenant what he always wanted acknowledgment for his genius its your case dallas whitney said after a long silence close it yes sir she broke transmission as she drove through the gates of the staggering estate that roarke had made his home ice from the previous nights storm glinted like silver silk on naked branches ornamental shrubs and evergreens glistened with it beyond them the house rose and spread an elegant fortress a testament to an earlier century with its beautiful stone its acres of glass in the gloomy halflight of morning gorgeously decorated trees shimmered in several windows roarke she thought with a little smile had gotten heavily into the christmas spirit neither of them had had much in the way of pretty holiday trees with gaily wrapped gifts stacked under them in their lives their childhoods had been miseries and they had compensated for it in different ways his had been to acquire to become one of the richest and most powerful men in the world by whatever means available hers had been to take control to become part of the system that had failed her when she was a child hers was law his was or had been circumventing law now not quite a year since another murder had put them on the same ground they were a unit she wondered if she would ever understand how theyd managed it she left her car out front walked up the steps and through the door into the kind of wealth that fantasies were made of old polished wood sparkling crystal ancient rugs lovingly preserved art that museums would have wept for she shrugged off her jacket started to toss it over the newel post then gritting her teeth she backtracked and hung it up she and summerset roarkes aidedecamp had declared a tacit truce in their sniping war there would be no potshots on christmas she decided she could stand it if he could only marginally pleased that he didnt slither into the foyer and hiss at her as he normally did eve headed into the main parlor roarke was there sitting by the fire reading the firstedition copy of yeats that shed given him it had been the only gift shed been able to come up with for the man who not only had everything but owned most of the plants where it was manufactured he glanced up smiled at her her stomach fluttered as it so often did just a look just a smile and her system went jittery he looked so perfect she thought he was dressed casually for the day in black his long lean body relaxing in a chair probably made two hundred years before he had the face of a god with slightly wicked intentions eyes of blazing irish blue and a mouth created to destroy a womans control power sat attractively on him as sleek and sexy eve thought as the rich fall of black hair that skimmed nearly to his shoulders he closed the book set it aside then held out a hand to her im sorry i had to leave she crossed to him linked her fingers with his im sorrier that im going to have to go up and work at least for a few hours got a minute first yeah maybe just and she let him pull her down into his lap let herself close her eyes and simply wallow there in the scent and the feel of him not exactly the kind of day youd planned thats what i get for marrying a cop ireland sang quietly in his voice the lilt of a sexy poet for loving one he added and tipped her face up to kiss her its a pretty lousy deal right now not from where im sitting he combed his fingers through her short brown hair youre what i want eve the woman who leaves her home to stand over the dead and the one who knew what a copy of yeats would mean to me im better with the dead than with buying presents otherwise id have come up with more than one she looked over at the small mountain of gifts under the tree gifts it had taken her more than an hour to open and her wince made him laugh you know one of the greatest rewards in giving you presents lieutenant is the baffled embarrassment they cause you i hope you got it out of your system for a while mmm was his only response she wasnt used to gifts he thought hadnt been given anything as a child but pain have you decided what to do with the last one the final box hed given her had been empty and hed enjoyed seeing her frown in puzzlement just as hed enjoyed seeing her grin at him when he told her it was a day a day she could fill with whatever she liked he would take her wherever she wanted to go and they would do whatever she wanted to do offplanet or on in reality or through the holoroom any time any place any world was hers for the asking no i havent had much time to think it through its a pretty great gift i dont want to screw it up she let herself relax against him another moment with the fire crackling the tree shimmering then she pulled back ive got to get started theres a lot of drone work on this one and i dont want to tag peabody today why dont i give you a hand he smiled again at the automatic refusal he read in her eyes step into peabodys sturdy shoes for the day this ones not connected to you in any way i want to keep it that way all the better he nudged her up got to his feet i can help you do the runs or whatever and that way you wont have to spend your entire christmas chained to your desk she started to refuse again then reconsidered most of the data she wanted were public domain in any case and what wasnt was nothing she wouldnt have shared with him if shed been thinking it through aloud besides he was good okay consider yourself a drone but when peabodys got her balance youre out darling he took her hand kissed it watched her scowl since you ask so sweetly and no sloppy stuff she put in im on duty chapter two the huge cat galahad was draped over the back of eves sleep chair like a drunk over a bar at last call since hed spent several hours the night before attacking boxes fighting with ribbon and murdering discarded wrapping paper she left him where he was so he could sleep it off eve set down her bag and went directly to the autochef for coffee the guy were after is david palmer youve already identified the killer oh yeah i know who im after me and dave were old pals roarke took the mug she brought him watched her through the steam the names vaguely familiar to me youd have heard it it was all over the media three three and a half years ago i need all my case files on that investigation all data on the trial you can start by she broke off when he laid a hand on her arm david palmer serial killer torture murders it was playing back for him in bits and pieces fairly young what midtwenties twentytwo at time of arrest a real prodigy our dave he considers himself a scientist a visionary his mission is to explore and record the human minds tolerance to extreme duress pain fear starvation dehydration sensory deprivation he could talk a good game too she sipped her coffee hed sit there in interview his pretty face all lit with enthusiasm and explain that once we knew the minds breaking point wed be able to enhance it to strengthen it he figured since i was a cop id be particularly interested in his work cops are under a great deal of stress often finding ourselves in lifeanddeath situations where the mind is easily distracted by fear or outside stimuli the results of his work could be applied to members of the police and security forces the military even in business situations i didnt realize he was yours yeah he was mine she shrugged her shoulders i was a little more low profile in those days he might have smiled at that knowing it was partially her connection to him that had changed that status but he remembered too much of the palmer case to find the humor i was under the impression that he was safely locked away not safely enough he slipped out the victim this morning was dumped in a public area another of daves trademarks he likes us to know hes hard at work the autopsy will have to verify but the victim was tortured premortem id guess dave found himself a new hole to work in and had the judge there at least a day before killing him death by strangulation occurred on or around midnight merry christmas judge wainger she murmured and that would be the judge who tried his case yeah absently she put her mug down reached into her bag for a copy of the sealed note shed already sent to the lab he left a calling card another signature all these names are connected to his case and his sentencing part of his work this time around would be at my guess letting his intended victims stew about what he has in store for them theyre being contacted and protected hell have a tough time getting to any of them and you roarke spoke with studied calm after a glance at the list and his wifes name wheres your protection im a cop im the one who does the protecting hell want you most eve she turned however controlled his voice was she heard the anger under it maybe but not as much as i want him you stopped him roarke continued whatever was done after the tests the trial the sentence was all a result of your work youll matter most lets leave those conclusions to the profiler though she agreed with them im going to contact mira as soon as i look through the case files again you can access those for me while i start my prelim report ill give you the codes for my office unit and the palmer files now he lifted a brow smiled smugly please i cant work if you insult me sorry she picked up her coffee again i dont know why i pretend you need codes to access any damn thing neither do i he sat down to retrieve the data she wanted moving smoothly through the task it was pitifully simple for him and his mind was left free to consider to decide shed said he wasnt connected to this and that she expected him to back away when peabody was on duty again but she was wrong her name on the list meant he was more involved than hed ever been before and no power on earth not even that of the woman he loved would cause him to back away close by eve worked on the auxiliary unit recording the stark facts into the report she wanted the autopsy results the crime scene team and sweeper data but she had little hope that she would get anything from the spotty holiday staff before the end of the next day struggling not to let her irritation with christmas resurface she answered her beeping link dallas lieutenant officer miller here what is it miller sir my partner and i were assigned to contact and guard apa ring we arrived at her residence shortly after seventhirty there was no response to our knock this is a priority situation miller youre authorized to enter the premises yes sir understood we did so the subject is not in residence my partner questioned the acrossthehall neighbor the subject left early yesterday morning to spend the holiday with her family in philadelphia lieutenant she never arrived her father reported her missing this morning eves stomach tightened too late she thought already too late what was her method of transpo miller she had her own car were en route to the garage where she stored it keep me posted miller eve broke transmission looked over and met roarkes eyes hes got her id like to think she ran into some road hazard or hired a licensed companion for a quick holiday fling before heading on to her family but hes got her i need the link codes for the other names on the list youll have them one minute she didnt need the code for one of the names with her heart beating painfully she put the call through to miras home a small boy answered with a grin and a giggle merry christmas this is grandmoms house for a moment eve just blinked wondering how shed gotten the wrong code then she heard the familiar soft voice in the background saw mira come on screen with a smile on her face and strain in her eyes eve good morning would you hold for a moment please id like to take this upstairs no sweetie she said to the boy who tugged on her sleeve run play with your new toys ill be back just a moment eve the screen went to a calm cool blue and eve exhaled gratefully relief at finding mira home alive well safe and the oddity of thinking of the composed psychiatrist as grandmom played through her mind im sorry mira came back on i didnt want to take this downstairs with my family no problem are the uniforms there yes in a rare show of nerves mira pushed a hand through her sabletoned hair miserable duty for them sitting out in a car on christmas i havent figured out how to have them inside and keep my family from knowing my children are here eve my grandchildren i need to know if you believe theres any chance theyre in danger no she said it quick and firm thats not his style dr mira youre not to leave the house without your guards youre to go nowhere not the office not the corner deli without both of them tomorrow youll be fitted for a tracer bracelet ill take all the precautions eve good because one of those precautions is to cancel all patient appointments until palmer is in custody thats ridiculous youre to be alone with no one at any time so unless your patients agree to let you walk around in their heads while a couple of cops are looking on youre taking a vacation mira eyed eve steadily and are you about to take a vacation im about to do my job part of that job is you stephanie ring is missing she waited one beat only for the implication to register do what youre told dr mira or youll be in protective custody within the hour ill need a consult tomorrow nine oclock ill come to you she broke transmission turned to get the link codes from roarke and found him watching her steadily what she means a great deal to you if she meant less youd have handled that with more finesse i dont have much finesse at the best of times lets have the codes when he hesitated she sighed and replied okay okay fine she means a lot and ill be damned if hell get within a mile of her now give me the goddamn codes already transferred to your unit lieutenant logged in on memory youve only to state the name of the party for transmission showoff she muttered it knowing it would make him grin and turned back to contact the rest of the names on palmers list when she was satisfied that the other targets were where they were supposed to be and under guard eve turned to the case files roarke had accessed she spent an hour going over data and reports another reviewing her interview discs with palmer okay dave tell me about michelle hammel what made her special david palmer a wellbuilt man of twentytwo with the golden good looks of the wealthy new england family hed sprung from smiled and leaned forward earnestly his clear blue eyes were bright with enthusiasm his caramelcream complexion glowed with health and vitality somebodys finally listening eve remembered thinking as she saw herself as shed been three years before hes finally got the chance to share his genius her hair was badly cut shed still been hacking at it herself in those days the boots crossed at her ankles had been new then and almost unscarred there was no wedding ring on her finger otherwise she thought she was the same she was young fit an athlete palmer told her very disciplined mind and body a longdistance runner olympic hopeful she knew how to block pain how to focus on a goal shed be at the top end of the scale you see just as leroy greene was at the bottom hed fogged his mind with illegals for years no tolerance for disruptive stimuli he lost all control even before the application of pain his mind broke as soon as he regained consciousness and found himself strapped to the table but michelle she fought she held out palmer nodded cheerfully she was magnificent really she struggled against the restraints then stopped when she understood that she wouldnt be able to free herself there was fear the monitors registered her rise in pulse rate blood pressure all vital physical and emotional signs i have excellent equipment yeah ive seen it top of the line its vital work his eyes had clouded then unfocused as they did when he spoke of the import of his experiments youll see if you review the data on michelle that she centered her fear used it to keep herself alive she controlled it initially tried to reason with me she made promises she pretended to understand my research even to help me she was clever when she understood that wouldnt help her she cursed me pumping up her adrenaline as i introduced new pain stimuli he broke her feet eve said knowing roarke was watching behind her then her arms he was right about his equipment back then he had electrodes that when attached to different parts of the body or placed in various orifices administered graduating levels of electric shock he kept michelle alive for three days until the torture broke her she was begging for him to kill her toward the end he used a rope and pulley system to hang her gradual strangulation she was nineteen roarke laid his hands on her shoulders you stopped him once eve youll stop him again damn right i will she looked up when she heard someone coming quickly down the corridor save data and file she ordered just as nadine furst came into the room perfect she thought a visit from one of channel s top onair reporters the fact that they were friends didnt make eve any less wary out paying christmas calls nadine i got a present this morning nadine tossed a disc on the desk eve looked at it then back up at nadines face it was pale the sharp features drawn for once nadine wasnt perfectly groomed with lip dye enhancers and every hair in place she looked more than frazzled eve realized she looked afraid whats the problem david palmer slowly eve got to her feet what about him apparently he knows what i do for a living and that were friendly he sent me that she glanced back down at the disc struggled to suppress a shudder hoping id do a feature story on him and his work and share the contents of his disc with you can i have a drink something strong roarke came around the desk and eased her into a chair sit down youre cold he murmured when he took her hands yeah i am ive been cold ever since i ran that disc ill get you a brandy nadine nodded in agreement then fisted her hands in her lap and looked at eve there are two other people on the recording one of them is judge wainger whats left of judge wainger and theres a woman but i cant recognize her shes hes already started on her here roarke brought the snifter gently wrapped nadines hands around the bowl drink this okay she lifted the glass took one long sip and felt the blast of heat explode in her gut dallas ive seen a lot of bad things ive reported them ive studied them but ive never seen anything like this i dont know how you deal with it day after day one day at a time eve picked up the disc you dont have to watch this again yes nadine drank again let out a long breath i do eve turned the disc over in her hand it was a standarduse model theyd never trace it she slid it into her unit copy disc and run display on screen david palmers youthful and handsome face swam onto the wall screen ms furst or may i call you nadine so much more personal that way and my work is very personal to me ive admired your work by the way its one of the reasons im trusting you to get my story on air you believe in what you do dont you nadine his eyes were serious now professional to professional his face holding all the youth and innocence of a novitiate at the altar those of us who reach for perfection believe in what we do he continued im aware that you have a friendly relationship with lieutenant dallas the lieutenant and i also have a relationship perhaps not so friendly but we do connect and i do admire her stamina i hope youll share the contents of this disc with her as soon as possible by this time she should already be heading the investigation into the death of judge wainger his smile went bright now and just a little mad at the edges hello lieutenant youll excuse me if i just conclude my business with nadine i want dallas to be closely involved its important to me you will tell my story wont you nadine let the public themselves judge not some narrowminded fool in a black robe the next scene slipped seamlessly into place the audio high so that the womans screams seemed to rip the air in the room where eve sat watching judge waingers body was bound hand and foot and suspended several inches from a plain concrete floor a basic pulley system this time eve mused hed taken time to set up some of the niceties but it wasnt yet the complex and yes ingenious system of torture that hed created before still he worked very well waingers face was livid with agony the muscles twitching as palmer burned letters in his chest with a hand laser he only moaned his head lolling nearby a system of monitors beeped and buzzed hes failing you see palmer said briskly in a voiceover his mind is moving beyond the pain as it can no longer endure it his system will attempt to shut down into unconsciousness that can be reversed as youll see here on screen he flipped a switch there was a high whine then waingers body jerked this time he screamed across the room a woman shrieked and sobbed the cage she was in swung wildly on its cable and was only big enough to allow her to crouch on hands and knees a dark fall of hair covered most of her face but eve knew her stephanie ring was palmers when he turned engaged another control the cage sparked and shook the woman let out a piercing wail shuddered convulsively then collapsed palmer turned to the camera smiled shes distracting but i have only so much time its necessary to begin one subject before completing work on another but her turn will come shortly subject waingers heart is failing the data on him are nearly complete using the ropes he manually lowered wainger to the floor eve noted the flex and bunch of muscles in palmers arms daves been pumping she murmured getting in shape he knew hed have to work harder this round he likes to prepare palmer slipped a perfectly knotted noose around waingers neck and meticulously slid the trailing end through a metal ring in the ceiling leading it down he threaded it through another ring in the floor then pulled out the slack until wainger rose to his knees then his feet and began gasping for air stop it will you nadine leapt to her feet i cant watch this again i thought i could i cant stop disc eve waited until the screen went blank then went over to crouch in front of nadine im sorry no im sorry i thought i was tough you are nobodys this tough nadine shook her head and finishing her brandy with one deep gulp set the snifter aside you are you dont let it get to you it gets to me but this is for me im going to have a couple of uniforms come and take you home theyre going to hang with you everywhere until palmers down you think hell come after me no but why take chances go home nadine put it away but after shed asked roarke to take nadine downstairs to wait for the escort eve finished watching the disc and at the end her eyes met palmers as he moved toward the camera subject wainger died at midnight december twentyfourth youll last longer dallas we both know that youll be my most fascinating subject i have such wonders planned for you youll find me i know you will im counting on it happy holidays chapter three stephanie rings car was still in its permit slot in the garage her luggage was neatly stowed in the trunk eve circled the vehicle searching for any sign of struggle any evidence that might have been dropped and gone unnoticed during the snatch hes got two basic mos she said as much to herself as to the uniforms waiting nearby one is to gain entrance into the victims homes by a ruse delivery repair or service con the other is to come on them in an unpopulated area he spends time getting to know their routines and habits the usual routes and schedules he keeps all that in a log very organized scientific along with bio data on each of them they werent lab rats to him she mused it was personal individualized that was what excited him in either case she went on he uses a stunner takes them down quickly then transports them in his own vehicle security cameras operational in here yes sir one of the uniforms passed her a sealed package of discs we confiscated them for the last three days assuming that the subject may have stalked the victim previous to her abduction eve lifted a brow miller right sir good thinking theres nothing more you can do here go home and eat some goose they didnt exactly race away but neither did they linger eve put the package in her bag and turned to roarke why dont you do the same pal ill only be a couple of hours well only be a couple of hours i dont need an aide to do a pass through rings apartment roarke simply took her arm and led her back to the car you let the two uniforms go he began as he started the engine everyone else on palmers list is under guard why arent you we covered that already partially he reversed and headed out of the garage but i know you lieutenant youre hoping hell shuffle the order and come after you next and you dont want some bigshouldered uniforms scaring him off for a moment she just drummed her fingers on her knee in less than a year the man had learned her inside and out she wasnt entirely comfortable with that and your point would be he nearly smiled at the annoyance in her voice i admire my wifes courage her dedication to duty you tossed in my wife to irritate me didnt you of course satisfied he picked up her hand kissed the knuckles im sticking eve deal with it o o the pass through stephanie rings apartment was no more than routine and it turned up nothing but the tidy life of a single career woman who enjoyed surrounding herself with attractive things spending her city salary on a stylish wardrobe eve thought of the naked woman crouched like an animal in a cage screaming in terror hes killing her now eve knew it and she had no power to stop him when she was back in her home office she reviewed the disc palmer had sent nadine this time she willed herself to ignore what was happening and focus only on the surroundings no windows she commented the floor and walls look like concrete and old brick the whole area cant be over thirty feet by twenty its probably a basement computer pause enhance sector eight through fifteen magnify she paced as the computer went to work then moved closer to the screen there thats a stair tread steps part of a railing behind it is some sort of what is it old furnace unit or water tank hes found himself a hole it has to be private she continued studying the view he cant do his work in a building where people might hear even if its soundproofed hed risk someone poking around maintenance crew repair team anything like that not an apartment or office building roarke agreed and with the steps its not likely a storage facility from the look of the furnace its a goodsized building but far from new nothing built in the last fifteen or twenty years would have had a tank furnace installed hed want something in the city wouldnt he yeah hed want to be close to all of his marks he wouldnt go for the burbs and even the boroughs arent likely daves a true urbanite and new yorks his turf private home has to be but how did he get his hands on a private residence friends roarke suggested family palmer didnt have a tight circle of friends hes a loner he has parents they relocated after the trial went under the victim and survivors protection act sealed files she heard the faintest trace of humor in his voice turned to scowl at him for a moment she wrestled with procedure she could get clearance to access the palmers location and it would take at least two days to hack through the red tape for authorization or she could hand the problem to roarke and have what she needed in minutes she could hear stephanie rings screams echoing in her head youll have to use the unregistered equipment compuguard will have an automatic block on their file it wont take long im going to keep working on this she gestured toward the screen he might have slipped up just enough to have let something identifiable come through all right but he crossed to her framed her face in his hands lowering his head he kissed her long and slow and deep and felt as he did some of the rigid tension in her body ease i can handle this roarke whether you can or not you will would it hurt to hold on to me just for a minute guess not she slipped her arms around him felt the familiar lines the familiar warmth her grip tightened why wasnt it enough to stop him once why wasnt it enough to put him away what good is it if you do your job and it comes back this way he held her and said nothing he wants to show me he can do it all again he wants to take me through all the steps and stages the way he did before only this time as theyre happening look how clever i am dallas knowing that understanding that will help you stop him a second time yeah she eased back get me the data so i can hammer at his parents roarke skimmed a finger over the dent in her chin youll let me watch wont you its so stimulating to see you browbeat witnesses when she laughed as hed hoped she would he went to his private room to circumvent compuguard and officially sealed files shed barely had time to review another section of the recording before he came back it couldnt have been that easy yes he smiled and passed her a new data disc it could thomas and helen palmer now known as thomas and helen smith which shows just how imaginative bureaucrats can be currently reside in a small town called leesboro in rural pennsylvania pennsylvania eve glanced toward her link considered then looked back at roarke it wouldnt take long to get there if you had access to some slick transpo roarke looked amused which slick transpo would you prefer lieutenant that minijet of yours would get us there in under an hour then why dont we get started if eve had been more fond of heights she might have enjoyed the fast smooth flight south as it was she sat jiggling a foot to relieve a case of nerves while roarke piloted them over what she imagined some would consider a picturesque range of mountains to her they were just rocks and the fields between them just dirt im only going to say this once she began and only because its christmas banking for landing he warned her as he approached the private airstrip what are you only going to say once that maybe all these toys of yours arent a complete waste of time overindulgent maybe but not a complete waste of time darling im touched once they were on the ground they transferred from the snazzy little twoperson jet to the car that roarke had waiting of course it couldnt be a normal vehicle eve mused as she studied it it was a sleek black bullet of a car built for style and speed ill drive she held out a hand for the keycode the attendant had given him you navigate roarke considered her as he tossed the code in his hand why because im the one with the badge she snatched the code on its upward arc and smirked at him im a better driver she snorted as they climbed in you like to hotdog that doesnt make you better strap in ace im in a hurry she punched it and sent them flying away from the terminal and onto a winding rural road that was lined with snowlaced trees and sheer rock roarke programmed their destination and studied the route offered by the onboard computer follow this road for two miles turn left for another ten point three then next left for five point eight by the time hed finished she was already making the first left she spotted a narrow creek water fighting its way through ice over rock a scatter of houses trees climbing steeply up hills a few children playing with new airskates or boards in snowcovered yards why do people live in places like this theres nothing here you see all that sky she asked roarke you shouldnt be able to see that much sky from down here it cant be good for you and where do they eat we havent passed a single restaurant glide cart deli nothing cozily roarke suggested around the kitchen table all the time jesus she shuddered he laughed smoothed a finger over her hair eve i adore you right she tapped the brakes to make the next turn what am i looking for third house on the right there that twostory prefab minitruck in the drive she slowed scanning the house as she turned in behind the truck there were christmas lights along the eaves a wreath on the door and the outline of a decorated tree behind the front window no point in asking you to wait in the car i guess none he agreed and got out theyre not going to be happy to see me eve warned him as they crossed the shoveled walk to the front door if they refuse to talk to me im going to give them some hard shoves if it comes down to it you just follow the lead she pressed the buzzer shivered you should have worn the coat i gave you cashmeres warm im not wearing that on duty it was gorgeous she thought and made her feel soft it wasnt the sort of thing that worked for a cop and when the door opened eve was all cop helen palmer had changed her hair and her eyes subtle differences in shades and shapes but enough to alter her looks it was still a pretty face very like her sons her automatic smile of greeting faded as she recognized eve you remember me mrs palmer what are you doing here helen put a hand high on the doorjamb as if to block it how did you find us were under protection i dont intend to violate that i have a crisis situation youd have been informed that your son has escaped from prison helen pressed her lips together hunched her shoulders as a defense against the cold that whipped through the open door they said they were looking for him assured us that theyd have him back in custody back in treatment very soon he isnt here he doesnt know where we are can i come in mrs palmer why do you have to rake this all up again tears swam into her eyes seeming as much from frustration as grief my husband and i are just getting our lives back weve had no contact with david in nearly three years honey whos at the door youre letting the cold in a tall man with a dark sweep of hair came smiling to the door he wore an old cardigan sweater and ancient jeans with a pair of obviously new slippers he blinked once twice then laid his hand on his wifes shoulder lieutenant lieutenant dallas isnt it yes mr palmer im sorry to disturb you let them in helen oh god tom let them in his fingers rubbed over her shoulder before he drew her back you must be roarke tom worked up what nearly passed for a smile as he offered roarke his hand i recognize you please come in and sit down tom please why dont you make some coffee he turned and pressed his lips to his wifes brow he murmured something to her and she let out a shuddering breath and nodded ill make this as quick as i can mr palmer eve told him as helen walked quickly down a central hallway you dealt very fairly with us during an unbearable time lieutenant he showed them into a small living area i havent forgotten that helen my wifes been on edge all day for several days he corrected himself since we were informed that david escaped weve worked very hard to keep that out of the center but he gestured helplessly and sat down eve remembered these decent people very well their shock and grief over what their son was they had raised him with love with discipline with care and still they had been faced with a monster there had been no abuse no cruelty no underlying gruel for that monster to feed on miras testing and analysis had corroborated eves impression of a normal couple whod given their only child their affection and the monetary and social advantages that had been at their disposal i dont have good news for you mr palmer i dont have easy news he folded his hands in his lap hes dead no tom closed his eyes god help me id hoped id actually hoped he was he got up quickly when he heard his wife coming back here ill take that he bent to take the tray she carried well get through this helen i know i know we will she came in sat busied herself pouring the coffee shed made lieutenant do you think davids come back to new york we know he has she hesitated then decided they would hear the news soon enough through the media early this morning the body of judge wainger was found in rockefeller plaza its davids work she continued as helen moaned hes contacted me with proof theres no doubt of it he was supposed to be given treatment kept away from people so he couldnt hurt them hurt himself sometimes the system fails mrs palmer sometimes you can do everything right and it just fails helen rose walked to the window and stood looking out you said something like that to me before to us that wed done everything right everything we could that it was something in david that had failed that was kind of you lieutenant but you cant know what its like you cant know how it feels to know that a monster has come from you no eve thought but she knew what it was to come from a monster to have been raised by one for the first eight years of her life and she lived with it i need your help she said instead i need you to tell me if you have any idea where he might go who he might go to he has a place she continued a private place where he can work a house a small building somewhere in new york in the city or very close by he has nowhere tom lifted his hands we sold everything when we relocated our home my business helens even our holiday place in the hamptons we cut all ties the house where david where he lived that last year was sold as well we live quietly here simply the money wed accumulated the money from the sales is sitting in an account we havent had the heart to we dont need it he had money of his own eve prompted yes inheritance a trust fund it was how he financed what he was doing tom reached out a hand for his wifes and clasped her fingers tightly we donated that money to charity lieutenant all the places where he might have gone are in the hands of others now all right you may think of something later however farfetched please contact me she rose when davids in custody again ill let you know after that ill forget where you are eve said nothing more until she and roarke were in the car and headed back they still love him after all he did after what he is theres a part of them that loves him yes and enough i think to help you stop him if they knew how no one ever cared for us that way she took her eyes off the road briefly met his no one ever felt that bond no he brushed the hair from her cheek not until we found each other dont grieve eve he has his mothers eyes she murmured soft and blue and clear shes the one who had to change them i imagine because she couldnt look in the mirror and face them every morning she sighed shook it off but he can she said quietly chapter four there was nothing else to do no other data to examine or analyze no other route to check tomorrow she knew there would be now she could only wait eve walked into the bedroom with some idea of taking a catnap they needed to salvage some of the day she thought to have their christmas dinner together to squeeze in some sense of normalcy the strong dreamy scent of pine made her shake her head the man had gone wild for tradition on this their first christmas together christ knew what he had paid for the live trees hed placed throughout the house and this one the one that stood by the window in their bedroom hed insisted they decorate together it mattered to him and with some surprise she realized it had come to matter to her tree lights on she ordered and smiled a little as she watched them blink and flash she stepped toward the seating area released her weapon harness and shrugged it off she was sitting on the arm of the sofa taking off her boots when roarke came in good i was hoping youd take a break ive got some calls to make why dont you let me know when youre ready for a meal she angled her head and studied him as he stood just inside the doorway she let her second boot drop and stood up slowly come here recognizing the glint in her eyes he felt the light tingle of lust begin to move through his blood there you heard me slick keeping his eyes on hers he walked across the room what can i do for you lieutenant traditions eve thought had to start somewhere she fisted a hand in the front of his shirt straining the silk as she pulled him a step closer i want you naked and quick so unless you want me to get rough strip his smile was as cocky as hers and made her want to sink in with her teeth maybe i like it rough yeah she began to back him up toward the bed well then youre going to love this she moved fast the only signal was the quick flash of her eyes before she ripped his shirt open and sent buttons flying he gripped her hips squeezing hard as she fixed her teeth on his shoulder and bit christ christ i love your body give it to me you want it he jerked her up to her toes youll have to take it when his mouth would have closed hotly over hers she pivoted he countered she came in low and might have flipped him if he hadnt anticipated her move theyd gone hand to hand before with very satisfying results they ended facetoface again breath quickening im taking you down she warned him try it they grappled both refusing to give way the momentum took them up the stairs of the platform to the bed she slipped a hand between his legs gently squeezed it was a move shed used before even as the heat shot straight down the center of his body to her palm he shifted slid under her guard and flipped her onto the bed she rolled came up in a crouch come on tough guy she was grinning now her face flushed with battle desire going gold in her eyes and the lights of the tree sparkling behind her you look beautiful eve that had her blinking straightening from the fighting stance and gaping at him even the man who loved her had never accused her of beauty huh it was all she managed before he leapt at her and took her out with a midbody tackle bastard she nearly giggled it even as she scissored up and managed to roll on top of him but he used the impetus to keep going until he had her pinned again beautiful my ass your ass is beautiful the elbow to his gut knocked some of the breath out of him but he sucked more in and sos the rest of you im going to have your beautiful ass and the rest of you she bucked twisted nearly managed to slip out from under him then his mouth closed over her breast sucking nipping through her shirt she moaned arched up against him and the fist shed clenched in his hair dragged him closer rather than yanking him away when he tore at her shirt she reared up hooking strong long legs around his waist finding his mouth with hers again as he pushed back to kneel in the center of the bed they went over in a tangle of limbs hands rough and groping and flesh began to slide damply over flesh he took her up and over the first time hard and fast those clever fingers knowing her weaknesses her strengths her needs quivering crying out she let herself fly on the edgy power of the climax then they were rolling again gasps and moans and murmurs heat coming in tidal waves nerves raw and needy her mouth was a fever on his as she straddled him let me let me let me she chanted it against his mouth as she rose up her hands linked tight to his as she took him inside her he filled her body mind heart fast and full of fury she drove them both as shed needed to from the moment hed come into the room it flooded into her swelled inside her that unspeakable pleasure the pressure the frantic war to end to prolong she threw her head back clung to it that razors edge go over she panted it out fighting to clear her vision to focus on that glorious face go over first and take me with you she watched his eyes that staggering blue go dark as midnight felt him leap over with one last hard thrust with her hands still locked in his she threw herself over with him and when the energy slid away from her like wax from a melting candle she slipped down quivering even as she pressed her face into his neck i won she managed okay her lips twitched at the smug and exhausted satisfaction in his voice i did i got just what i wanted from you pal thank christ he shifted until he could cradle her against him take a nap eve just an hour knowing he would never sleep longer than that himself she wrapped around him to keep him close o o when she woke at two a m eve decided the brief predinner nap had thrown her system off now she was fully awake her mind engaged and starting to click through the information and evidence she had so far david palmer was here in new york somewhere out in the city happily going about his work and her gut told her stephanie ring was already dead he wouldnt have such an easy time getting to the others on his list she thought as she turned in bed ego would push him to try and hed make a mistake in all likelihood hed already made one she just hadnt picked up on it yet closing her eyes she tried to slip into palmers mind as she had years before when shed been hunting him he loved his work had loved it even when hed been a boy and doing his experiments on animals hed managed to hide those little deaths to put on a bright innocent face everyone whod known him parents teachers neighbors had spoken of a cheerful helpful boy a bright one who studied hard and caused no trouble yet some of the classic elements had been there even in childhood hed been a loner obsessively neat compulsively organized hed never had a healthy sexual relationship and had been socially awkward with women theyd found hundreds of journal discs going back to his tenth year carefully relating his theories his goals and his accomplishments and with time with practice with study hed gotten very very good at his work where would you set up dave it would have to be somewhere comfortable you like your creature comforts you must have hated the lack of them in prison pissed you off didnt it so now youre coming after the ones who put you there thats a mistake letting us know the marks in advance but its ego too its really you against me thats another mistake because no one knows you better a house she thought but not just any house it would have to be in a good neighborhood close to good restaurants those years of prison food must have offended your palate youd need furniture comfortable stuff with some style linens good ones and an entertainment complex got to watch the screen or you wont know what people are saying about you and all that takes money when she sat up in bed roarke stirred beside her figure it out hes got a credit line somewhere i always wondered if he had money stashed but it didnt seem to matter since he was never getting out to use it i was wrong moneys power and he found a way to use it from prison she tossed back the duvet started to leap out of bed when the link beeped she stared at it a moment and knew chapter five two teenagers looking for a little adventure snuck out of their homes met at a prearranged spot and took their new scootbikes for a spin in central park theyd thought at first that stephanie ring was a vagrant maybe a licensed beggar or a chemihead sleeping it off and they started to give her a wide berth but vagrants didnt make a habit of stretching out naked on the carousel in central park eve had both of them stashed in a blackandwhite one had been violently ill and the brittle air still carried the smear of vomit shed ordered the uniforms to set up a stand of lights so the area was under the glare of a false day stephanie hadnt been beaten nor had her hair been cut palmer believed in variety there were dozens of long thin slices over her arms and legs the flesh around the wounds shriveled and discolored something toxic eve imagined something that when placed on a relatively minor open wound would cause agony the blood had been allowed to drip and dry her feet speared out at sharp angles in a parody of a ballet stance dislocated carved into her midriff were the signature block letters lets kill all the lawyers he had finally killed this one eve thought with the slow torturous strangulation he was most fond of eve examined the noose found the rope identical to that used on judge wainger another mistake dave lots of little oversights this time around she reached for her field kit and began the routine that followed murder o o she went home to write her report wanting the quiet shed find there as opposed to the postholiday confusion at central she shot a copy to her commander then sent messages to both peabody and feeney once her aide and the top man in the electronics detective division woke and checked their links she was pulling them in she fueled on coffee then set about the tedious task of peeling the layers from palmers financial records it was barely dawn when the door between her office and roarkes opened he came in fully dressed and she could hear the hum of equipment already at work in the room behind him you working at home today she said it casually sipping coffee as she studied him yes he glanced down at her monitor following the money lieutenant at the moment youre not my bodyguard roarke he merely smiled and who i wonder could be more interested in your body im a cop i dont need a sitter he reached down cupped her chin what nearly happened to peabody two nights ago it didnt happen and im not having you hovering around when you should be off doing stuff i can do stuff from here just as easily and efficiently as i can from midtown youre wasting time arguing and i doubt youll find your money trail through palmers official records i know it the admission covered both statements and frustrated her equally i have to start somewhere go away and let me work done with me are you he lowered his head and brushed his lips over hers the sound of a throat being loudly and deliberately cleared came from the doorway sorry peabody managed most of a smile she was pale and more than a little heavyeyed but her uniform was stiff and polished as always youre early eve rose then slid her hands awkwardly into her pockets the message said to report as soon as possible ill leave you two to work alone roarke thought the two of them would slip past the discomfort faster its good to see you peabody lieutenant he added before he closed the door between the rooms you might want to check the names of deceased relatives the transfer and disbursement of funds involving accounts with the same last name and blood ties are rarely noticed yeah right thanks eve shifted her feet the last time shed seen her aide peabody had been wrapped in a blanket her face blotchy from tears you okay yeah mostly mostly my ass eve thought look i shouldnt have called you in on this take a couple of more days to level off sir id do better if i got back to work into routine sitting home watching videos and eating soy chips isnt the way i want to spend another day work clears it out quicker because she believed that herself eve moved her shoulders then get some coffee peabody ive got plenty of work here yes sir she stepped forward pulling a small wrapped box from her pocket setting it on the desk as she went to the autochef your christmas present i didnt get a chance to give it to you before i guess we were a little busy eve toyed with the ribbon gifts always made her feel odd but she could sense peabodys eyes on her she ripped off the red foil opened the lid it was a silver star a little dented a bit discolored its an old sheriffs badge peabody told her i dont guess its like wyatt earps or anything but its official i thought youd get a kick out of it you know the long tradition of law and order absurdly touched eve grinned yeah its great for the fun of it she took it out and pinned it to her shirt does this make you the deputy it suits you dallas youdve stood up wherever whenever looking up eve met her eyes you stand peabody i wouldnt have called you in today if i thought different i guess i needed to hear that thanks well she hesitated then lifted her brows in question problem no i just she pouted giving her square sober face a painfully young look hmmm you didnt like your present eve said lightly youll have to take that up with leonardo what present whats he got to do with it he made that wardrobe for your undercover work if you dont like it the clothes like magic peabodys face cleared i get to keep all those mag clothes all of them what the hell am i supposed to do with them now are you going to stand around grinning like an idiot or can i get on with things here i can grin and work at the same time sir settle down start a run and trace on this rope she pushed a hardcopy description across the desk i want any sales within the last week bulk sales he uses a lot of it who well get to that run the rope then get me a list of private residences upscale sold or rented in the metro area within the last week also private luxury vehicles pickup or delivery on those within the last week he needs transpo and hed go classy the cage she muttered as she began to pace where the hell did he get the cage wildlife facility domestic animal detention well track it start the runs peabody ill brief you when feeney gets here shed called in feeney peabody thought as she sat down at a computer it was big just what she needed o o youll both want to review the investigation discs profiles transcripts from the palmer case of three years ago feeney eve added youll remember most of it you tracked and identified the electronic equipment he used in those murders yeah i remember the little bastard feeney sat scowling into his coffee his habitually weary face was topped by wiry red hair that never seemed to decide which direction it wanted to take he was wearing a blue shirt so painfully pressed and bright that eve imagined it had come out of its gift box only that morning and would be comfortably rumpled by afternoon because we know him his pattern his motives and in this case his victims or intended victims hes given us an edge he knows that enjoys that because hes sure hell be smarter he hates you dallas feeneys droopy eyes lifted met hers he hated your everfucking guts all along you stopped him then you played him until he spilled everything hell come hard for you i hope youre right because i want the pleasure of taking him out again he got the first two on his list because he had a lead on us she continued the others have been notified warned and are under guard he may or may not make an attempt to continue in order but once he runs into a snag hell skip down and come for you peabody put in everything the others did happened because i busted him under the whack is a very logical mind everything he does has a reason its his reason so its bent but its there she glanced at her wrist unit ive got a meeting with mira at her residence in twenty minutes im going to leave it to feeney to fill you in on any holes in this briefing peabody once you have the lists from the runs i ordered do a probability scan see if we can narrow the field a bit feeney when you review the disc he sent through nadine you might be able to tag some of the equipment you get a line on it we can trace the source we do it in steps but we do it fast if he misses on the list he might settle for someone else anyone else hes been out a week and already killed twice she broke off as her communicator signaled she walked to retrieve her jacket as she answered two minutes later she jammed it back in her pocket and her eyes were flat and cold make that three times he got to carl neissan o o eve was still steaming when she rang the bell of miras dignified brownstone the fact that the guard on door duty demanded that she show her id and had it verified before entry mollified her slightly if the man posted at neissans had done the same palmer wouldnt have gotten inside mira came down the hall toward her she was dressed casually in slacks and sweater with soft matching shoes but there was nothing casual about her eyes before eve could speak she lifted a hand i appreciate your coming here we can talk upstairs in my office she glanced to the right as a childs laughter bounced through an open doorway under different circumstances id introduce you to my family but id rather not put them under any more stress well leave them out of it i wish that were possible saying nothing more mira started upstairs the house reflected her eve decided calming colors soft edges perfect style her home office was half the size of her official one and must at one time have been a small bedroom eve noted that shed furnished it with deep chairs and what she thought of as a ladys desk with curved legs and fancy carving mira adjusted the sunscreen on a window and turned to the mini autochef recessed into the wall youll have reviewed my original profile on david palmer she began satisfied that her hands were steady as she programmed for tea i would stand by it with a few additions due to his time in prison i didnt come for a profile ive got him figured do you i walked around inside his head before we both did yes mira offered eve a delicate cup filled with the fragrant tea they both knew she didnt want in some ways he remains the exception to a great many rules he had a loving and advantaged childhood neither of his parents exhibits any signs of emotional or psychological defects he did well in school more of an overachiever than under but nothing off the scale testing showed no brain deformities no physical abnormalities there is no psychological or physiological root for his condition he likes it eve said briefly sometimes evils its own root i want to disagree mira murmured the reasons the whys of abnormal behavior are important to me but i have no reasons no whys for david palmer thats not your problem doctor mine is to stop him and to protect the people hes chosen the first two on his list are dead stephanie ring youre sure her body was found this morning carl neissans been taken this time miras hand shook rattling her cup in its saucer before she set it aside he was under guard palmer got himself into a cop suit knocked on the damn door and posed as the relief the onduty didnt question it he went home to a late christmas dinner when the morning duty came on he found the house empty and the night relief the real one inside the trunk of his unit tranqd and bound but otherwise unharmed he hasnt come around enough to be questioned yet hardly matters we know it was palmer im arranging for justine polinsky to be moved to a safe house youll want to pack some things doctor youre going under you know i cant do that eve this is as much my case as yours youre wrong youre a consultant and thats it i dont need consultation im no longer confident that you can be adequately protected in this location im moving you eve dont fuck with me it came out sharp very close to mean and mira jerked back in surprise im taking you into police custody you can gather up some personal things or you can go as you are but youre going calling on the control that ran within her like her own bloodstream mira folded her hands in her lap and you will you be going under im not your concern of course you are eve mira said quietly watching the storm of emotions in eves eyes just as im yours and my family downstairs is mine theyre not safe ill see to it ill see to them mira nodded closed her eyes briefly it would be a great relief to me to know they were away from here and protected its difficult for me to cope when im worried about their welfare he wont touch them i promise you ill take your word now as to my status i didnt give you multiple choices dr mira just a moment composed again mira picked up her tea i think youll agree i have every bit as much influence with your superiors as you do it would hardly serve either of us to play at tugging strings im not being stubborn or courageous she added those are your traits a ghost of a smile curved her mouth when eve frowned at her i admire them youre also a woman who can see past emotion to the goal the goal is to stop david palmer i can be of use we both know it with my family away ill be less distracted and i cant be with them eve because if i am ill worry that hell harm one of them to get to me she paused for a moment judged that eve was considering i have no argument to having guards here or at my office in fact i want them very much i have no intention of taking any unnecessary chances or risks im just asking you to let me do my work you can do your work where i put you eve mira drew a breath if you put both me and justine out of his reach theres the very real possibility hell take someone else she nodded youve considered that already he wont come for you until hes ready youre the grand prize if no one else is accessible hell strike out hell want to keep to his timetable even if it requires a substitute ive got some lines on him and youll find him but if he believes im accessible if im at least visible hell be satisfied to focus his energies on getting through i expect you to prevent that she smiled again easier now and i intend to do everything i can to help you i can make you go all your influence wont matter if i toss you in restraints and have you hauled out of here youll be pissed off but youll be safe i wouldnt put it past you mira agreed but you know im right im doubling your guards youre wearing a bracelet you work here youre not to leave the house for any reason her eyes flashed when mira started to protest you push me on this youre going to find out what it feels like to wear cuffs eve rose your guards will do hourly checkins your link will be monitored that hardly makes me appear accessible hell know youre here thats going to have to be enough ive got work to do eve started for the door hesitated then spoke without turning around your family they matter to you yes of course you matter to me she walked away quickly before mira could get shakily to her feet chapter six eve headed to the lab from miras from there she planned a stop by the morgue and another at carl neissans before returning to her home office remembering miras concern about family eve called roarke on her palmlink after she parked and started into the building why are you alone was the first thing he said to her cut it out she flashed her badge at security then headed across the lobby and down toward the labs im in a secured facility surrounded by rentacops monitors and lab dorks ive got a job to do let me do it hes gotten three out of six she stopped rolled her eyes oh i get it shows what kind of faith you have in me i guess being a cop for ten years makes me as easy a fish as a seventyyearold judge and a couple of soft lawyers you annoy me eve why because im right yes and snotty about it but his smile warmed a little why did you call so i could be snotty im at the lab about to tackle dickhead ive got a few stops to make after this ill check in it was a casual way to let him know she understood he worried and he accepted in the same tone ive several link conferences this afternoon call in on the private line watch your back lieutenant im very fond of it satisfied she swung into the lab dickie the chief tech was there looking sleepyeyed and pale as he stared at the readout on his monitor the last time shed been in the lab thered been a hell of a party going on now those whod bothered to come in worked sluggishly and looked worse i need reports dickie wainger and ring jesus dallas he looked up mournfully hunching his shoulders dont you ever stay home since he looked ill she gave him a little leeway silently she opened her jacket tapped the silver star pinned to her shirt im the law she said soberly the law has no home it made him grin a little then he moaned man i got the mother of all christmas hangovers mix yourself up a potion dickie and get over it daves got number three dave who palmer david palmer she resisted letting out her impatience by cuffing him on the side of the head but she imagined doing it did you read the damn directive ive only been here twenty minutes jesus he rolled his shoulders rubbed his face drew in three sharp nasal breaths palmer that freaks caged not anymore he skipped and hes back in new york wainger and ring are his shit damn shit he didnt look any less ill but his eyes were alert now fucking christmas week and we get the worlds biggest psychofreak yeah and happy new year too i need the results on the rope on the paper i want to know what he used to carve the letters you get any hair or fiber from the sweepers no wait just wait a damn minute he scooted his rolling chair down the counter barked orders at a computer muttering as he scanned the data bodies were clean no hair other than victims no fiber he always kept them clean eve murmured yeah i remember i remember got some dust like grit between the toes both victims concrete dust yeah get you the grade possible age now the rope he skidded back i was just looking at it just doing the test run nothing special or exotic about it standard nylon strapping rope give me some time ill get you the make how much time two hours three tops takes longer when its standard make it fast she swung away im in the field o o she stopped at the morgue next to harass the chief medical examiner it was more difficult to intimidate morse or to rush him no sexual assault or molestation no mutilation or injuries of genitalia typical of palmer eve thought as she ran over morses prelim report in her head he was as highly asexual as anyone shed come up against she doubted that he even thought of the gender of his victims other than as a statistic for his experiments subject waingers central nervous system had been severely damaged subject suffered minor cardiac infarction during abduction and torture period anus and interior of mouth showed electrical bums both hands crushed with a smooth heavy instrument three ribs cracked the list of injuries went on until morse had confirmed the cause of death as strangulation and the time of death as midnight december twentyfourth she spent an hour at carl neissans another at waingers in both cases she thought the door had been opened palmer allowed in he was good at that good at putting on a pretty smile and talking his way in he looked so damn innocent eve thought as she climbed the steps to her own front door even the eyes and the eyes usually told you were those of a young harmless man they hadnt flickered hadnt glazed or brightened even when hed sat in interview across from her and described each and every murder theyd taken on the light of madness only when he talked about the scope and importance of his work lieutenant summerset tall and bony in severe black slipped out of a doorway do i assume your guests will be remaining for lunch guests i dont have any guests she stripped off her jacket tossed it across the newel post if you mean my team well deal with it he had the jacket off the post even as she started up the stairs at his low growl of disgust she glanced back he held in his fingertips the gloves shed balled into her jacket pocket what have you done to these its just sealant which shed forgotten to clean off before she shoved them into her pocket these are handmade italian leather with mink lining mink shit what is he crazy shaking her head she kept on going mink lining for christs sake ill have lost them by next week then some stupid mink will have died for nothing she glanced down the hallway at roarkes office door shook her head again and walked into her own she was right eve noted her team could deal with lunch on their own feeney was chowing down on some kind of multitiered sandwich while he muttered orders into the computer and scanned peabody had a deep bowl of pasta scooping it up onehanded sliding printouts into a pile with the other her office smelled like an upscale diner and sounded like cops computer and human voices clashed the printer hummed and the main link was beeping and being ignored she strode over and answered it herself dallas hey got your rope when she saw dickie shove a pickle in his mouth she wondered if every city officials stomach had gone on alarm at the same time nylon strapping cord like i said this particular type is top grade heavy load manufactured by kytell outta jersey you guys run the distributor thats your end yeah thanks she broke transmission thinking dickie wasnt always a complete dickhead hed come through and hadnt required a bribe lieutenant peabody began but eve held up a finger and walked to roarkes door and through it do you own kytell in new jersey then she stopped and winced when she saw that he was in the middle of a holographic conference several images turned studied her out of politely annoyed eyes sorry its all right gentlemen ladies this is my wife roarke leaned back in his chair monumentally amused that eve had inadvertently made good on her threat to barge in on one of his multimilliondollar deals just to annoy him if youd excuse me one moment caro the holo of his administrative assistant rose smiled of course well shift to the boardroom momentarily the image turned ran her hands over controls that only she could see and the holos winked away i should have knocked or something its not a problem theyll hold im about to make them all very rich do i own what did you have to say my wife just that way like id just run up from the kitchen so much more serene an image than telling them youd just run in from the morgue and it is a rather conservative company im about to buy now do i own what and why do you want to know kytell based in new jersey they make rope do they well i have no idea just a minute he swiveled at the console asked for the information on the company which eve thought with some irritation she could have damn well done herself yes theyre an arm of yancy which is part of roarke industries and which i assume made the murder weapon right the first time then youll want the distributor the stores in the new york area where large quantities were sold to one buyer within the last week peabody can get it ill get it faster give me thirty minutes to finish up in here then ill shoot the data through to your unit thanks she started out turned back the third woman on the right the redhead she was giving you a leg shot another inch of skirt lift and it would have been past her crotch i noticed very nice legs he smiled but she still wont get more than eighty point three a share anything else shes no natural redhead eve said for the hell of it and heard him laugh as she shut the door between them sir peabody got to her feet i think i have a line on the vehicle three possibles highend privates sold to single men in their early to midtwenties on december twentieth and twentyfirst two dealerships on the east side and one in brooklyn print hard copies of palmers photo already done feeney whittling it down keep whittling roarke should have some data on the murder weapon inside a half hour send what he has to me in the field will you peabody youre with me o o the first dealership was a wash and as she pulled up at the second eve sincerely hoped she didnt have to head to brooklyn the shiny new vehicles on the showroom floor had peabodys eyes gleaming avariciously only eves quick elbow jab kept her from stroking the hood of a booster the sportutility vehicle of the year maintain some dignity eve muttered she flagged a salesman who looked none too happy when she flipped out her badge i need to talk to the rep who sold a rig like this she gestured toward the booster last week young guy bought it lana sold one of the zs a few days before christmas now he looked even unhappier she often rounds up the younger men he pointed to a woman at a desk on the far side of the showroom thanks eve walked over noting that lana had an explosion of glossy black curls cascading down her back a headset over it and was fasttalking a potential customer on the line while she manually operated a keyboard with fingernails painted a vivid red i can put you in it for eight a month eight a month and youre behind the wheel of the sexiest most powerful land and air unit currently produced im slicing my commission to the bone because i want to see you drive off in what makes you happy make him happy later lana eve held her badge in front of lanas face lana put a hand over the mouthpiece studied the id cursed softly then her voice went back to melt jerry you take one more look at the video try out the holo run if youre not smiling by the end of it the s not the one for you you call me back and let me know remember i want you happy hear she disconnected glared at eve i paid those damn parking violations every one glad to hear it our city needs your support i need information on a sale you made last week booster you were contacted earlier today and confirmed yeah right nice guy pretty face she smiled he knew what he wanted right off is this the guy eve signaled to peabody who took out the photo yeah cute yeah hes real cute i need the data name address the works sure no problem she turned to her machine asked for the readout then looking back up at eve she narrowed her eyes you look familiar have i sold you a car eve thought of her departmental issue its sad peagreen finish and blocky style no you really look oh lana lit up like a christmas tree sure sure youre roarkes wife roarkes cop wife ive seen you on screen word is hes got an extensive collection of vehicles where does he deal wherever he wants eve said shortly and lana let out a gay laugh oh im sure he does id absolutely love to show him our brandnew barbarian it wont be on the market for another three months but i can arrange a private showing if youd just give him my card mrs roarke ill be you see this eve took out her badge again all but pushed it into lanas pert nose it says dallas lieutenant dallas im not here to liaison your next commission this is an official investigation give me the damn data certainly of course if her feathers were ruffled lana hid it well um the name is peter nolan east sixtyeighth apartment b howd he pay that i remember straight etransfer the whole shot didnt want to finance the transfer was ordered received and confirmed and he drove off a happy man i need all the vehicle information including temp license and registration number full description all right gee whatd he do kill somebody yeah he did wow lana busily copied the data disc you just cant trust a pretty face she said and slipped her business card into the disc pack chapter seven peter nolan didnt live at the sixtyeighth street address the kowaskis an elderly couple and their creaky schnauzer had lived there for fifteen years a check of the bank showed that the nolan account had been opened in person on december of that year and closed on december just long enough to do the deal eve thought but where had he gotten the money taking roarkes advice she rounded out a very long day by starting searches on accounts under the name of palmer it would she thought rubbing her eyes take a big slice of time how much time did carl have she wondered another day by her guess if palmer was running true to form he would begin to enjoy his work too much to rush through it but sometime within the next twentyfour hours she believed hed try for justine polinsky while her machine worked she leaned back and closed her eyes nearly midnight she thought another day feeney was working his end she was confident theyd have a line on the equipment soon then there were the houses to check they had the make model and license of his vehicle hed left a trail she thought he wanted her to follow it wanted her close the son of a bitch its you and me isnt it dave she thought as her mind started to drift how fast can i be and how clever you figure itll make it all the sweeter when youve got me in that cage its because you want that so bad that youre making mistakes little mistakes im going to hang you with them she slid into sleep while her computer hummed and woke only when she felt herself being lifted what reflexively she reached for the weapon shed already unharnessed you need to be in bed roarke held her close as he left the office i was just resting my eyes ive got data coming in dont carry me you were dead out the data will be there in the morning and im already carrying you im getting closer but not close enough hed seen the financial data on her screen ill take a look through the accounts in the morning he told her as he laid her on the bed ive got it covered he unpinned her badge set it aside yes sheriff but money is my business close it down a while hell be sleeping now she let roarke undress her in a big soft bed with clean sheets dave likes to be clean and comfortable hell have a monitor in the bedroom so he can watch neissan he likes to watch before he goes to sleep he told me dont think roarke slipped into bed beside her gathered her close he wants me yes i know roarke pressed his lips to her hair as much to comfort himself as her but he cant have you o o sleep helped shed dropped into it like a stone and had lain on the bottom of the dreaming pool for six hours thered been no call in the middle of the night to tell her carl neissans body had been found another day she thought again and strode into her office roarke was at her desk busily screening data what are you doing she all but leapt to him thats classified dont pick nits darling you were going too broad last night youll be days compiling and rejecting all accounts under the name palmer you want one that shows considerable activity large transfers and connections to other accounts which is of course the trickier part if youre dealing with someone who understands how to hide the coin you cant just sit down and start going through data accumulated in an investigation of course i can you need coffee he looked up briefly then youll feel more yourself and ill show you what i have i feel exactly like myself which she admitted at the moment was annoyed and edgy she stalked to the autochef in the kitchen went for an oversized mug of hot and black the rich and real caffeine roarke could command zipped straight through her system what have you got she demanded when she walked back in palmer was too simple too obvious roarke began and she narrowed her eyes you didnt think so yesterday i said check for relatives same names i should have suggested you try his mothers maiden name riley and here we have the account of one palmer riley it was opened six years ago standard brokerage account managed since theres been some activity over the last six months i would assume your man found a way to access a link or computer from prison he shouldnt have been near one how can you be sure he understands how money works and just how fluid it can be you see here that six months ago he had a balance of just over million for the past three years previous all action was automatic straight managed with no input from the account holder but here he begins to make transfers heres one to an account under peter nolan which by the way is his aunts husbands name on his fathers side overseas accounts offplanet accounts local new york accounts different names different ids hes had this money for some time and he waited sat on it until he found the way to use it when i took him down before we froze his accounts accounts under david palmer we didnt look deeper i didnt think of it why should you have you stopped him you put him away he was meant to stay away if id cleared it all he wouldnt have had the backing to come back here eve hed have found a way he waited until she looked at him you know that yeah she let out a long breath yeah i know that this tells me hes been planning hes been shopping hes been juggling funds funneling into cover accounts i need to freeze them i dont think a judge is going to argue with me not after what happened to one of their own youll piss him off thats the plan i need the names numbers locations of all the accounts you can connect to him she blew out a breath then i guess i owe you use your present and well call it even my present oh yeah where and or when do i want to go for a day let me mull that over a little bit we get this wrapped ill use it for new years eve theres a deal a horrible thought snuck into her busy mind we dont have like a thing for new years do we no party or anything no i didnt want anything but you she looked back at him narrowing her eyes even as the smile spread do you practice saying stuff like that no he rose framed her face and kissed her hard and deep i have all that stuff on disc youre a slick guy roarke she skimmed her fingers through her hair and simply lost herself for a moment in the look of him then giving herself a shake she stepped back i have to work wait he grabbed her hand before she could turn away what was that i dont know it just comes over me sometimes you i guess come over me sometimes i dont have time for it now darling eve he brushed his thumb over her knuckles be sure to make time later yeah ill do that o o they worked together for an hour before peabody arrived she switched gears leaving roarke to do what he did best manipulate data while she focused on private residences purchased in the new york area widening the timing to the six months since palmer had activated his account feeney called in to let her know hed identified some of the equipment from the recording and was following up eve gathered her printouts and rose weve got more than thirty houses to check have to do it doortodoor since i dont trust the names and data he could have used anything peabody im with you sir right roarke ill be in the field ill let you know when i have this wrapped she looked at him working smoothly thoroughly methodically and wondered who the hell was dealing with what she often thought of as his empire look i can call a man in for this mcnab mcnab peabody winced at the name before she could stop herself she had a temporary truce going with the edd detective but that didnt mean she wanted to share her case with him again dallas come on its been so nice and quiet around here ive got this roarke shot her a glance winked at peabody i have an investment in it now whatever shoot me and feeney the data when you have it all im going to check out the rope too he likely picked up everything himself but it would only take one delivery to pin down his hole o o after three hours of knocking on doors questioning professional parents housekeepers or others who chose the workathome route eve took pity on peabody and swung by a glide cart in this neighborhood the carts were clean the awnings or umbrellas bright the operators polite and the prices obscene peabody winced as she was forced to use a credit card for nothing but coffee a kabob and a small scoop of paperthin oil chips its my metabolism she muttered as she climbed back into the car i have one that requires fuel at regular intervals then pump up eve advised its going to be a long day at least half these people arent going to be home until after the five oclock shift ends she snagged the link when it beeped dallas hello lieutenant roarke eyed her soberly your datas coming through thanks ill start on the warrant one thing i didnt find any account with a withdrawal or transfer that seemed large enough for a purchase or down payment on a house a couple are possible but if as you told me he didnt finance a car its likely he didnt want to deal with the credit and compuguard checks on his rating and background hes got a damn house roarke i know it im sure youre right im not convinced he acquired it recently ive still got twentycouple to check she replied i have to follow through on that maybe hes just renting he likes to own but maybe this time hes renting ill run it through that way too there werent any standard transfers or withdrawals that would indicate rent or mortgage payments she hissed out a breath its ridiculous what how good a cop youd make i dont think insulting me is appropriate under the circumstances i have some business of my own to tend to he said when she grinned at him ill get back to yours shortly o o palmer had purchased and personally picked up a hundred twenty yards of nylon rope from a supply warehouse store off canal the clerk who had handled the sale idd the photo and mentioned what a nice young man mr dickson had been as dickson palmer had also purchased a dozen heavyload pulleys a supply of steel o rings cable and the complete handy homemaker set of steelguard tools including the accessory laser package the entire business had been loaded into the cargo area of his shiny new boosterz which the clerk had admired on the morning of december eve imagined palmer had been a busy little bee that day and throughout the next setting up his private chamber of horrors by eight theyd eliminated all the houses on eves initial list thats it eve climbed back in her vehicle and pressed her fingers to her eyes they all check out ill drop you at a transpo stop peabody are you going home eve lowered her hands why because im not going off duty if youre starting on the list of rentals i ran excuse me peabody firmed her chin eve could arrow a cold chill up your spine when she took on that superiorofficer tone im not going off duty sir to leave you solo in the field with palmer on the loose and you as a target with respect lieutenant you dont think i can handle some little pissant mentally defective i think you want to handle him too much peabody sucked in a breath im sticking dallas eve narrowed her eyes have you been talking to roarke at the quick flicker in peabodys eyes eve swore goddamn it hes right and youre wrong sir peabody braced for the explosion was determined to weather it then all but goggled with shock maybe was all eve said as she pulled away from the curb since she was on a roll peabody slanted eve a look you havent eaten all day you didnt even steal any of my oil chips you could use a meal okay okay christ roarkes got your number doesnt he i wish zip it peabody well fuel the metabolism then start on the rental units zipping with pleasure sir chapter eight it began to snow near midnight fat cold flakes with icy edges eve watched it through the windshield and told herself it was time to stop the night was over nothing more could be done hes got all the cards she murmured youve got a pretty good hand dallas peabody shifted in her seat grateful for the heat of the car even her bones were chilled doesnt matter what ive got eve drove away from the last rental unit theyd checked not tonight i know who he is who hes going to kill i know how he does it and i know why and tonight it doesnt mean a damn thing odds are hes done with carl now it was rare to see eve discouraged angry yes peabody thought with some concern and driven but she couldnt recall ever hearing that quiet resignation in her lieutenants voice before you covered all the angles you took all the steps thats not going to mean much to carl and if id covered all the angles id have the son of a bitch so im missing one hes slipping through because i cant pin it youve only had the case for three days no ive had it for three years as she pulled up at a light her link beeped dallas lieutenant this is detective dalrymple assigned to observation on the polinsky residence weve got a mixedrace male midtwenties average height and build subject is on foot and carrying a small sack he used what appeared to be a key code to gain access to premises hes inside now im three blocks east of your location and on my way shed already whipped around the corner secure all exists call for backup doesnt make sense she muttered to peabody as they barreled across madison right out in the open falls right into our laps doesnt fucking make sense she squealed to a stop a half a block from the address her weapon was in her hand before she hit the sidewalk peabody the polinsky unit is on four south side go around take the fire escape he comes out that way take him down quick eve charged in at the front of the building and too impatient for the elevator raced up the stairs she found dalrymple on four weapon drawn as he waited beside the door lieutenant he gave her a brief nod my partners around the back subjects been inside less than five minutes backups on the way good she studied dalrymples face found his eyes steady we wont wait for them i go in low she added taking out her master and bypassing the locks fine with me he was ready beside her on three one two they hit the door went through high and low back to back sweeping with their weapons music was playing a primitive backbeat of drums behind screaming guitars in the tidy living area the mood screen had been set on deep reds and swimming blues melting into each other she signaled dalrymple to the left had taken two steps to the right herself when a naked man came out of the kitchen area carrying a bottle of wine and a single red rose he screamed and dropped the bottle wine glugged out onto the rug holding the rose to his balls he crouched dont shoot jesus dont shoot take anything you want anything its not even mine nypsd eve snapped at him on the floor facedown hands behind your head now yes maam yes maam he all but dove to the rug i didnt do anything he flinched when eve dragged his hands down and cuffed them i was just going to meet sunny she said it would be okay who the hell are you jimmy jimmy ripsky i go to college with sunny were on winter break she said her parents were out of town for a few days and we could use the place eve holstered her weapon in disgust the boy was shaking like a leaf get him a blanket or something dalrymple this isnt our man she dragged him to his feet and had enough pity in her to uncuff him before gesturing to a chair lets here the whole story jimmy thats it um cringing with embarrassment he folded his arms over his crotch sunny and i are like an item and whos sunny sunny polinsky sheila i guess everybody calls her sunny this is her parents place man her fathers going to kill me if he finds out she called you yeah well no he looked up with desperate gratitude when dalrymple came in with a chenille throw i got an email from her this morning and a package she said her parents were going south for the week and how i should come over tonight about midnight let myself in with the key shed sent me and i should um you know get comfortable he tucked the throw more securely around his legs she said shed be here by twelvethirty and i should well ah be waiting in bed he moistened his lips it was pretty sort of explicit for sunny do you still have the email the package the key came in i dumped the package in the recycler but ive got the email i printed it out its its a keeper you know right detective call in your partner and my aide um maam jimmy began when dalrymple turned away with his communicator dallas lieutenant yes maam lieutenant whats going on is sunny okay shes fine shes with her parents but she said shed be here i think someone else sent you that keeper email somebody who wanted me to have a little something extra to do tonight but she sat pulled out her palmlink im going to check out your story jimmy if it all fits detective dalrymples going to arrange for a uniform to take you home you can give him the printout of the email and your computer my computer but its police business she said shortly youll get it back well that was fun peabody said when eve resecured the door a barrel of laughs poor kid he was mortified here he was thinking he was going to have the sex of his dreams with his girl and he gets busted the fact that a rosebud managed to preserve most of his modesty tells me that the sex of his dreams outruns the reality at peabodys snort eve turned to the elevator sunny backed up his story about them being an item not that i doubted it the kid was too scared to lie so daves been keeping up with the social activities of his marks he knows the family the friends and he knows how to use them she stepped out of the elevator crossed the lobby for an md in a maximum lockup he managed to get his hands on plenty of data she paused at the door and simply stood for a moment looking out at the thin steady snow you got offplanet clearance peabody sure its a job requirement right well go home and pack a bag i want you on your way to rexal on the first transport we can arrange you and mcnab can check out the facilities find the unit palmer had access to the initial rush from the idea of an offplanet assignment turned to ashes in her mouth mcnab i dont need mcnab when you find the unit youll need a good electronics man eve opened the door and the blast of cold cooled the annoyed flush on peabodys cheeks hes a pain in the ass sure he is but he knows his job if feeney can spare him youre the offplanet team she reached for her communicator intending to interrupt feeneys sleep and get the ball rolling a scream from the end of the block had her drawing her weapon instead she pounded west boots digging into the slick sidewalk with one quick gesture she signaled dalrymple to stay at his post in the surveillance van she saw the woman first wrapped in sleek black fur clinging to a man with an overcoat over a tux he was trying to shield her face and muffle her mouth against his shoulder the pitch and volume of her screams indicated he wasnt doing a very good job of it police he shouted it as he saw peabody and eve running toward them heres the police honey my god my god whats this city coming to he threw it out threw it out right at our feet it eve saw was carl neissan his naked and broken body lay face up against the curb his head had been shaved she noted and the tender skin abraded and burned his knees were shattered his protruding tongue blackened around his neck digging deep was the signature noose and the message carved into his chest was still red and raw woe unto you also ye lawyers the womans screaming had turned to wailing now eve tuned it out with her eyes on the body she pulled out her communicator this is dallas lieutenant eve i have a homicide she gave dispatch the necessary information then turned to the male witness you live around here yes yes this building on the corner we were just coming home from a party when my aide is going to take your companion inside away from this out of the cold well need her statement id appreciate it if youd stay out here with me for a few minutes yes of course yes honey he tried to pry his wifes hands from around his neck honey you go with the policewoman go inside now peabody eve said under her breath take honey out of here get what you can out of her yes sir maam come with me with a couple of firm tugs peabody had the woman it was such a shock he continued shes very delicate my wife its such a shock yes sir im sure it is can i have your names please what oh fitzgerald george and maria eve got the names and the address on record in a few minutes she would have a crowd to deal with she knew even jaded new yorkers would gather around a dead naked body on madison avenue can you sir look at me she added when he continued to stare at the body he was going faintly green look at me she repeated and try to tell me exactly what happened it was all so fast so shocking reaction began to set in showing in the way his hand trembled as he pressed it to his face wed just come from the andersons they had a holiday party tonight its only a block over so we walked wed just crossed the street when there was a squeal of brakes i barely paid attention to it you know how it is yes sir what did you see i glanced back just out of reflex i suppose i saw a dark car black i think no no not a car one of those utility vehicles the sporty ones it stopped right here right here you can still see the skid marks in the snow and then the door opened he pushed he all but flung this poor man out right at our feet you saw the driver yes yes quite clearly this corner is very well lit he was a young man handsome light hair he smiled he smiled at me just as the door opened why i think i smiled back he had the kind of face that makes you smile im sure i could identify him im sure of it yeah eve let out a breath watched the wind snatch it away as the first blackandwhites arrived on the scene you wanted to be seen didnt you dave she thought and you wanted me to be close very close when you gave me carl you can go inside with your wife mr fitzgerald ill be in touch yes of course thank you i its christmas week he said with honest puzzlement in his eyes you live in the city you know terrible things can and do happen but its christmas week joy to the world eve murmured as he walked away she turned around and ordered the uniforms to secure the scene and prepare for the crimescene team then she crouched beside carl and got to work chapter nine eve spent most of the next thirty hours backtracking searching for the step she was sure she had missed with peabody offplanet she did the work herself rerunning searches and scans compiling data studying reports she did personal dropbys at both the safe house where justine and her family were being kept and miras home she ran checks on their security bracelets to confirm that they were in perfect working order he couldnt get to them she assured herself as she paced her office with them out of reach he would have no choice but to come for her jesus she wanted him to come for her it was a mistake she knew it was a mistake to make it a personal battle but she could see his face too clearly hear his soft prepschool voice so perfectly but you see lieutenant dallas the work you do is nothing more than a stopgap you dont change anything however many criminals you lock up today therell be that many and more tomorrow what im doing changes everything the answers to questions every human being asks how much is too much how much will the mind accept tolerate bear if you will before it shuts down and before it does what thoughts what impulses go through the mind as the body dies death lieutenant is the focus of your work and of mine and while we both enjoy the brutality that goes with it in the end ill have my answers youll only have more questions she only had one question now eve thought where are you dave she turned back to her computer engage open file palmer hg crossreference all files and data pertaining to david palmer run probability scan what is the probability that palmer david is now residing in new york city working using current data the probability is ninetyseven point six that subject palmer now resides in new york city what is the probability that subject palmer resides in a private home working probability ninetyfive point eight that subject palmer is residing in a private home at this time given the status of the three remaining targets of subject palmer which individual will he attempt to abduct next working strongest probability is for target dallas lieutenant eve attempts on targets polinsky and mira are illogical given current status thats what youre hoping for she turned her head roarke stood in the doorway between their offices watching her thats what im counting on why arent you wearing a tracer bracelet they dont have one that goes with my outfit she straightened turned to face him i know what im doing do you he crossed to her or are you too close to this one hes gotten to you eve hes upset your sense of balance its become almost intimate between you its always intimate maybe he brushed a thumb just above her left cheekbone her eyes were shadowed her face pale she was he knew running on nerves and determination now hed seen it before in any case youve interrupted his work he has no one now he wont wait long i dont need the computer analysis to tell me that weve got less than forty hours left in the year i dont want to start the new one knowing hes out there he wont want to start it without me neither do i you wont have to because she sensed he needed it she leaned into him closed her mouth over his weve got a date ill hold you to it when she started to ease back he slid his arms around her brought her close im not quite done here he murmured and sent her blood swimming with a hard and hungry kiss for a moment that was all there was the taste of him the feel of him pressed against her the need they created in each other time after time erupting inside her giving herself to it and to him was as natural as breathing roarke remember how on christmas eve we got naked and crazy mmm he moved his mouth to her ear felt her tremble i believe i recall something of that well prepare yourself for a review on new years eve she drew his head back framing his face as she smiled at him ive decided its one of our holiday traditions i feel very warmly toward tradition yeah and if i feel much warmer right now im not going to get my job done so she jumped away from him when her link beeped and all but pounced on it dallas lieutenant peabodys face swam on swam off again then came shakily back peabody either your transmissions poor or youve grown a second nose the equipment heres worse than what we deal with at central the audio came through with a snake hiss of static and i dont even want to talk about the food when youre planning your next holiday vacation steer clear of rexal and it was top of my list what have you got for me i think we just caught a break weve tracked down at least one unit palmer had access to its in the chapel he convinced the padre hed found god and wanted to read scripture and write an inspirational book on salvation glory hallelujah can mcnab access his files he says he can shut up mcnab peabody turned her head the fact that her face became a vivid orange could have been temper or space interference im giving this report and im reporting sir that detective mcnab is still one big butt ache so noted what does he have so far he found the files on the book palmer used to hose the preacher and he claims hes working down the levels hey the buzzing increased and the screen blurred with color lines figures eve pressed her fingers to her eyes and prayed for patience mcnabs cheerful attractive face came on eve noted that he wore six tiny silver hoops in one ear so he hadnt decided to tone down his look for a visit to a rehabilitation center dallas this guy knows his electronics so he took basic precautions with his personal data but take a hike shebody this is my area anyway lieutenant im scraping off the excess now hes got stuff tucked under his praisethelord hype it wont take me long to start picking it out the trouble other than your aides constant griping is transmitting to you weve got crap equipment here and a meteor storm or some such happy shit happening its going to cause some problems can you work on the unit on a transport ah sure why not confiscate the unit catch the first transpo back report en route wow thats iced confiscate you hear that shebody were confiscating this little bastard get started eve ordered if they give you any grief have the warden contact me dallas out o o eve drove into cop central making three unnecessary stops on the way if palmer was going to make a move on her hed do it on the street hed know he would never be able to break through the defenses of roarkes fortress but she spotted no tail no shadow more she didnt feel him would he go for her in the station she wondered as she took the glide up to the edd sector to consult with feeney hed used a cops disguise to get to carl he could put it to use again slip into the warrenlike building blend with the uniforms it would be a risk but a risk like that would increase the excitement the satisfaction she studied faces as she went up glides through breezeways down corridors past cubes and offices once shed updated feeney and arranged for him to consult with mcnab on the unit en route she elbowed her way onto a packed elevator to make the trip to commander whitneys office she spent the morning moving through the building inviting a confrontation then she took to the streets for the afternoon she recanvased the houses she and peabody had already hit left herself in the open she bought bad coffee from a glide cart loitered in the cold and the smoke of grilling soydogs what the hell was he waiting for she thought in disgust tossing the coffee cup into a recycling bin the sound of a revving engine had her glancing over her shoulder and she looked directly into palmers eyes he sat in his vehicle grinned at her blew her an exaggerated kiss even as she leaped forward he hit vertical lift shot up and streaked south she jumped into her car going air as she squealed away from the curb dispatch dallas lieutenant eve all units all units in the vicinity of park and eighty respond im in groundtoair chase with murder suspect vehicle is a black newissue boosterz new york license number delta able zero temporary heading south on park dispatch dallas received and confirmed units dispatched is subject vehicle in visual range no subject vehicle went air at park and eighty headed south at high speed subject should be considered armed and dangerous acknowledged whered you go whered you go you little son of a bitch eve rapped the wheel with her fist as she zipped down park shot down cross streets circled back too fast she muttered you went under too fast your holes got to be close she set down did her best to bank her temper to use her head and not her emotions shed let the search run another thirty minutes though shed already decided it was useless hed had the vehicle tucked away in a garage or lot minutes after shed spotted him after hed made certain shed spotted him that meant canvases of every parking facility in three sectors public and private and with the budget it would take days the department wouldnt spare the manpower necessary to handle the job any quicker she stayed parked where she was on the off chance that palmer would try another taunt after aborting the search she did slow sweeps through the sectors herself working off frustration before she drove home through the dark and the snarling traffic she didnt bother to snipe at summerset though he gave her ample opportunity instead scooping up the cat which circled her legs she climbed the stairs her intent was to take a blisteringhot shower drink a gallon of coffee and go back to work her reality was to fall facedown on the bed galahad climbed onto her butt kneaded his way to comfort curled up and went on guard with his eyes slitted on the door thats how roarke found them an hour later ill take over from here he murmured giving the cat a quick scratch between the ears but when he started to drape a blanket over his wife eve stirred im awake im just resting your eyes yes i know to keep her prone roarke stretched out beside her stroked the hair away from her cheek rest them a bit longer i saw him today the son of a bitch was ten feet away and i lost him she closed her eyes again he wants to piss me off so i stop thinking maybe i did but im thinking now and what are you thinking lieutenant that ive been counting too much on the fact that i know him that ive been inside his head ive been tracking him without factoring in one vital element which is she opened her eyes again hes fucking crazy she rolled over stared at the sky window and the dark beyond it you cant predict insanity whatever the head shrinkers call it it comes down to crazy theres no physical no psychological reason for it it just is he just is ive been trying to predict the unpredictable so i keep missing its not his work this time its payback the other names on the list are incidental its me he needed them to get to me youd already concluded that yeah but what i didnt conclude and what im concluding now is hes willing to die as long as he takes me out he doesnt intend to go back to prison i saw his eyes today they were already dead which only makes him more dangerous he has to find a way to get to me so hell take risks but he wont risk going down before hes finished with me he needs bait good bait he must know about you she sat up now raking her hair back i want you to wear a bracelet he lifted a brow i will if you will a muscle in her cheek jumped as she set her teeth i phrased that incorrectly youre going to wear a bracelet i believe such things are voluntary unless the subject has committed a crime he sat up himself caught her chin in his hand he wont get to you through me that i can promise but if you expect me to wear nypsd accessories youll have to wear a matching one since you wont i dont believe this conversation has a point goddamn it roarke i can slap you into protective custody i can order taps on all your communications have you shadowed no he interrupted and infuriated her by kissing her lightly you cant my lawyers will tapdance all over your warrants stop he tightened his grip on her chin before she could curse him again and this time there was no light kiss no flicker of amusement in his eyes you leave here every day to do a job that puts you in constant physical jeopardy i dont ask you to change that its one of the reasons i fell in love with you who you are what you do why you do it i dont ask you to change he repeated dont you ask me its just a precaution no its a capitulation if it was less youd be wearing one yourself she opened her mouth shut it again then shoved away and rose i hate when youre right i really hate it im going to take a shower and dont even think about joining me and trying anything because im not too happy with you right now he merely reached out snagged her hand and yanked her back onto the bed i dare you to say that again in five minutes he challenged and rolled on top of her she didnt say anything in five minutes could barely speak in thirty and when she did finally make it to the shower her blood was still buzzing she decided it was wiser not to comment when he joined her there it would only appeal to his competitive streak she kept her silence and stepped out of the shower and into the drying tube it gave her a very nice view she let herself relax enough to enjoy it watching the jets of water pulse and pound over roarke as the hot air swirled around her she was back in the bedroom just tugging on an ancient nypsd sweatshirt and thinking about coffee and a long evening of work when her palmlink rang vaguely irritated with a call on her personal she plucked it up from where shed dumped it on the bedside table dallas it was nice to see you today in person facetoface hello dave with her free hand she reached in her pocket switched her communicator on and plugged in feeneys code nice vehicle yes i like it very much fast efficient spacious youre looking a bit tired lieutenant a bit pale overworked as usual too bad you havent been able to enjoy the holidays theyve had their moments mine have been very rewarding his handsome face glowed with a smile its so good to be back at work though i did manage to keep my hand in while i was away but you and i im sure well agree know theres nothing like new york nothing like being home and doing what we love best too bad you wont be able to stay long oh i intend to be here long enough to see the celebration in times square tomorrow night to ring in the new year in fact im hoping well watch it together sorry dave i have plans from the corner of her eye she watched roarke come out of the bath watched him keep out of range move directly to the bedroom computer and begin to work manually i think youll change them when you know who else ive invited to the party i picked her up just a little while ago you should be getting a call shortly from the guards youd posted the police havent gotten any smarter since ive been gone he let out a charming laugh i took a little video for you dallas take a look ill be in touch later to tell you what you need to do to keep her alive the image shifted eves blood iced as she saw the woman in the cage unconscious pale one slim hand dangling through the bars transmitted from a public link roarke said from behind her grand central dimly she heard feeney giving her the same information through her communicator units were already on their way to the location hed be gone of course they knew hed already be gone he has mira it was all she could say he has mira chapter ten panic wanted to win it crawled in her belly snaked up her throat it made her hands shake until she balled them into fists it wanted to swallow her when she moved through miras house when she found the broken security bracelet on the floor of the office he used laser tools her voice was steady and cool as she bagged the bracelet he anticipated that shed be wearing one and brought what was necessary to remove it the mts are taking the guards in the two from outside were just stunned but one of the inside teams in bad shape feeney crouched down next to her looks like palmer got in the back bypassed the security system like a pro he hit the one guard in the kitchen used a stunner to take him out quick and quiet from the looks of the living area the second one gave him more trouble they went a round in there mira must have been up here if she had the door closed and was working she wouldnt have heard anything rooms fully soundproofed so he takes out the security four experienced cops waltzes right in dismantles her bracelet and waltzes out with her we underestimated him feeney and for that she would forever blame herself hes not what he was when i took him down before hes studied up hes learned hes gotten himself into condition he made good use of three years in a cage she knows how his mind works feeney laid his hand on her shoulder mira knows how to handle this kind of guy shell use that shell keep her cool and use it no one knows how his mind works this time around thinking i did was part of the problem all along i fucked up here feeney and miras going to pay for it youre wrong the only fucking up youre doing is thinking that way now i thought he might use roarke as bait because if hes been studying me he knows thats where he could hit me the hardest she made herself breathe slow as she got to her feet but he knows me better than i figured he knows she matters to me and hell count on that messing you up you gonna let it no she breathed in again exhaled no i need mcnab to shake something loose whats their eta midday tomorrow they had some transpo delays the transmissions are full of blips but i got that hes dug into some financials shoot whatever youve got to my home unit ill be working from there well want to tap your palmlink yeah hell have figured that but well do it anyway she met feeneys eyes we take the steps well get her back dallas yeah we will she turned the sealed bracelet over in her hand if he hurts her im taking him out she lifted her gaze again whatever line i have to cross i take him out when she walked outside roarke was waiting she hadnt argued when hed come with her and could only be grateful that he was there to drive home so her mind could be free to think feeneys going to be sending me data she began as she climbed into the car financials youll be able to extrapolate faster the sweepers will go through miras house but he wont have left much if anything anyway its not a question of iding him peabody and mcnab wont be back until midday tomorrow so well be working with whatever they can send us while theyre en route i took a look at the alarms and security its a very good system he used a sophisticated bypass unit to take it out without triggering the auto its not something your average citizen can access easily i can help you trace the source doesnt matter at this point later we can deal with it its just another thread he left dangling figuring id waste time pulling it and getting nowhere she rubbed at the headache behind her eyes ive got uniforms canvasing one of the neighbors might have seen or heard something its useless but its routine and we might get lucky she closed her eyes forced herself to think past the fear shes got until tomorrow midnight dave wants some tradition and symbolism he wants to welcome in the new year with me and he needs her to get me there her voice was too cool roarke thought too controlled hed seen the hint of panic in her eyes and the grief he let her hold in both as they arrived home as she walked directly up to her office and called up all necessary files she added hardcopy data to the investigators board shed set up and when she shifted miras photo from one area to the other her fingers shook eve he took her shoulders turned her around let it out cant dont talk to me you cant work around it he only tightened his grip when she tried to jerk away let it out let it out he said in a gentler tone i know what she means to you god she wrapped her arms around him curling her hands up over his shoulders as she pressed her face into his neck oh god hold on just for a minute hold on her body shook one hard wave of shudders after another she didnt weep but her breath hitched as he held her close i cant think about what he might do to her if i think about it ill lose it then remember shes strong and shes smart shell know what she has to do yeah her link signaled incoming data thatll be the financials ill start on them he eased her back he wont win this round damn right o o she worked until her eyes and mind went blurry then fueled up with coffee and worked some more at just after two a m feeney shot her more data it told her that he peabody and mcnab were all still on the job basically roarke said this is just confirming what we already have the accounts the transfers you need to find more you need to look from a different angle he glanced up to see eve all but swaying on her feet and you need to sleep she would have argued but it would have wasted time we both do just a little while we can share the sleep chair i want to stay close to this unit the caffeine in her system couldnt fight off exhaustion moments after closing her eyes she fell into sleep where nightmares chased her images of mira trapped in a cage mixed and melded with memories of herself as a child locked in a room horror pain fear lived in both places he would come palmer her father he would come and he would hurt her because he could because he enjoyed it because she couldnt stop him until she killed him but even then he came back and did it all again in her dreams she moaned in sleep curled into roarke it was the smell of coffee and food that woke her she sat up with a jerk blinked blindly in the dark and found herself alone in the chair she stumbled into the kitchen and saw roarke already taking food from the autochef you need to eat yeah okay but she went for the coffee first i was thinking about what you said looking at a different angle she sat because he nudged her into a chair and shoveled in food because it was in front of her what if he bought or rented this place hes got before he got to new york a year ago two years ago its possible i still havent found any payments has to be there somewhere she heard the ring of her palmlink from the other room and was on her feet stay in here do what you can to trace deliberately she moved behind her desk sat composed her face dallas good morning lieutenant i hope you slept well like a top dave she curled a hand under the desk good i want you rested up for our date tonight youve got oh lets see just over sixteen and a half hours to get here i have every confidence in you you could tell me where you are we can start our date early he laughed obviously delighted with her and spoil the fun i dont think so were puzzle solvers dallas you find me by midnight and dr mira will remain perfectly safe thats providing you come to see me alone ill know if you bring uninvited guests as i have full security any gatecrashers and the good doctor dies immediately and in great physical distress i want to dance with you dallas just you understood its always been you and me dave exactly come alone by midnight and well finish what we started three years ago i dont know that shes still alive he only smiled you dont know that shes not and broke transmission another public link roarke told her port authority i need the location if im not there by midnight hell kill her she rose paced hes got a place one with full security hes not bullshitting there hell have cameras in and out sensors he didnt have time to set all that up in a week so either the place came equipped with them or he ordered them from prison courtesy of the chaplain we can access tax records blueprints specs itll take time times running out lets get started o o at two she received word that peabody and mcnab had landed and she ordered them to bring the unit to her home office he was close she thought again and none of them should waste time working downtown the minute they walked in she began outlining her plan of attack mcnab set up over there start checking out any financials transfers transmissions using the chaplains name or a combo of his and palmers peabody contact whitney request a canvas of all private garages in the suspect area i want uniforms every warm body we can find hitting the public parking facilities with orders to confiscate and review all security tapes for the past week all lieutenant every last one she swung around and into roarkes office using his auxiliary unit she called up data shot it to screen ive got the residences of palmers targets in blue she told roarke we run from mid to upper manhattan heaviest population on the east side we need to concentrate on private homes in this tenblock radius unless something jumps out at you disregard anything that doesnt fit this profile she rolled her shoulders to relieve the tension closed her eyes to clear her mind itll have a basement probably two stories in addition to it fully soundproofed and most likely with its own vehicle storage area ive got them looking at public storage but im betting he has his own he wants me to find him goddamn it so it cant be that hard he wants me to work for it but not to fail its just personal for him and without me she trailed off whirled around he needs me jesus check my name check deeds mortgages leases using my name theres your new angle lieutenant roarke murmured as he set to work very good toss it on screen she asked even as she moved to stand behind him and watch as her name popped up with a list of liber and folio numbers she swore again how the hell did he get all that property thats not his its yours what do you mean mine i dont own anything properties ive transferred into your name roarke spoke absently as he continued the scan transferred what the hell for he skimmed a finger lightly over her wedding ring and earned a punch in the shoulder youre welcome take it back all of it its complicated taxes really youre doing me a favor no theres nothing here that isnt yours well try a combination of names she wanted badly to seethe but she didnt have time they found three listings for the name david dallas in manhattan get the property descriptions im working on it it takes a moment to hack into city hall barely more than that for roarke eve noted as the data flashed on screen no thats downtown sex club try the next she gripped the back of his chair straining with impatience thats just out of the target area but possible hold that and run the last ill be damned she almost whispered it he reverted to type after all thats his parents house he bought their place two and a half years ago roarke confirmed using the name david dallas your man was thinking ahead very far ahead well find accounts in that name or an account that he had and closed five blocks from here the son of a bitch is five blocks from here she leaned down kissed the top of roarkes head and strode back into her office ive found it she announced then looked at her wrist unit weve got seven hours to figure out how to take him down o o she would go in alone she insisted on it she agreed to go in wired agreed to surveillance and backup at halfblock intervals surrounding the house for luck she pinned on the badge peabody had given her then waited with growing impatience as feeney checked the transmitter youre on he told her nothing i found on the video disc had equipment that can tag this pretty little bug weve got a decoy so hell think hes found one and deactivated it good thinking you got to do it this way he nodded at her id do the same but you better understand i hear anything i dont like im coming in roarke he stepped back as roarke came into the room ill give you a minute here roarke crossed to her tapped a finger on her badge funny you dont look like gary cooper who he smiled high noon darling eve though the clocks turned around on this one we have a date in a couple of hours i remember ive got a present coming i can do this yes he kissed her softly i know give my best to mira you bet the teams moving into place now i have to go ill see you soon he waited until she was gone then walked outside himself and climbed casually into feeneys unit ill be riding with you feeney scratched his chin dallas wont like it thats a pity i spent the last few hours studying the schematics for the security on the palmer house i can bypass it by remote can you now feeney said mildly roarke turned his head gave feeney a level look i shouldnt need more than twenty minutes clear to manage it feeney pursed his lips and started down the drive ill see what we can do about that she went in at ten it was best shed decided not to cut it too close to the deadline the old brownstone was lovely in perfect repair the security cameras and sensors were discreetly worked into the trim so as not to detract from its dignity as she walked to the door she was certain palmer was watching and that he was pleased she gave the overhead camera a brief glance then bypassed the locks with her master she closed the door at her back heard the locks snick automatically back into place as they did the foyer lights flashed on good evening dallas palmers voice flowed out of the intercom im so pleased you could make it i was just assuring doctor mira that youd be here soon so we could begin our endofyear celebration shes fine by the way now if youd just remove your weapon no she said it casually as she moved forward im not stripping down for you dave so you can take me out as i come down the stairs lets not insult each other he laughed well i suppose youre right keep it take it out engage it its fine just remember doctor miras fate is in your hands come join us lieutenant lets party shed been in the house before when she interviewed his parents even if the basic setup hadnt come back to her shed taken time to study the blueprints still she didnt move too quickly but scanned cautiously for booby traps on the way through the house she turned at the kitchen opened the basement door the sound of cheering blasted up at her the lights were on bright she could see streamers balloons festive decorations she took her weapon out and started down he had champagne chilling in a bucket pretty canapes spread on silver trays on a table draped with a colorful cloth and he had mira in a cage lieutenant dallas mira said it calmly though her mind was screaming shed been careful to call eve by her title to keep their relationship professional distant doctor palmer clucked his tongue i told you id do the talking lieutenant you see this control im holding just so we understand each other right away if i press this button a very strong current will pass through the metal of the doctors temporary home shell be dead in seconds even with your weapon on full ill have time to engage it actually my nervous system will react in such a way to the shock that my finger will twitch involuntarily and the doctor shall we say is toasted okay dave but i intend to verify that doctor mira is unharmed are you hurt doctor no and shed managed so far to hold back hysteria he hasnt hurt me and i dont think he will you wont hurt me will you david you know i want to help you i understand how difficult all this has been for you not having anyone who appreciates what youve been working to achieve shes really good isnt she he said to eve so soothing since i dont want to show her any disrespect youll note i didnt remove her clothing for our little experiment maybe you should tell her to shut the fuck up would you mind dallas dave and i need to handle this dr mira eve moved closer dont we dave its you and me ive waited for this for so long you can see ive gone to quite a bit of trouble he gestured with his free hand maybe youd like a drink an hors doeuvre we have a celebration going on the end of the old the birth of the new oh and before i jam that wire youre wearing tell the backup team that if anyone attempts entry you both die im sure they heard you and they already have orders to hold back you said to come alone she reminded him so i did i always played it straight with you thats right we learned to trust each other why stop now ive got a deal for you dave a trade me for mira you let her out of there you let her go and ill get in youll have what you want eve dont miras composure started to slip this is between me and dave she kept her eye on him level and cool thats what you want isnt it to put me in a cage the way i put you in one youve been thinking about it for three years youve been planning it working for it arranging it step by step and you did a damn good job this time around let her go dave she was just bait you got me here by using her let her go and ill put down my weapon ill get in and youll have the kind of subject youve always wanted she took another step toward him watching his eyes now watching them consider desire shes a shrink and shes not in the kind of condition im in mental or physical she sits at a desk and pokes into other peoples minds you start on her shell go down fast give you no satisfaction think how long ill last not just hours days maybe weeks if you can hold the outside team off that long you know its going to end here for both of us yes im prepared for that but this way you can get your payback and finish your work two for one but you have to let her out music crashed out of the entertainment unit on screen the revelers in times square swarmed like feverish ants put down the weapon now tell me its a deal she held her breath lifted her weapon aimed it at the center of his body tell me its a deal or i take you down she goes but i live and you lose all around take the deal dave youll never get a better one ill take the deal all but quivering with excitement he rubbed a hand over his mouth put the weapon down put it down and move away from it bring the cage down first bring it down to the floor so i know you mean it i can still kill her but he reached out to the console touched a switch the cage began to sway and lower i know it youve got the power here ive just got a job im sworn to protect her unlock the cage put the weapon down he shouted it out now raising his voice over the music and cheers you said youd put it down now do it okay weve got a deal sweat slid down her back as she bent to lay the weapon on the floor you dont kill for the hell of it its for science unlock the cage and let her go eve lifted her hands palms out on a bright laugh he grabbed up a stunner jabbed the air with it just in case you stay where you are dallas her heart began to beat again when he put the control down hit the button to release the locks sorry you have to leave the party doctor mira but i promised this dance to the lieutenant i need to help her out eve crouched to take miras hand her muscles are stiff she wouldnt have lasted for you dave she gave miras hand one hard squeeze get in get in now as soon as shes clear eve remained crouched pushed mira aside as she used her body as a shield she had time to register a movement on the stairs then her clinch piece was in her hand i lied dave she watched his eyes go round with shock saw him grab for the control lower the stunner the crowd cheered wildly as her blast took him full in the chest his body jerked a quick and obscene dance he was right she noted about the finger twitch it depressed convulsively on the control even as he fell onto the cage sparks showered from it from his quaking body as she dragged mira clear and curled herself over her your jackets caught fire lieutenant with admirable calm roarke bent over and patted out the spark that burned the leather at her shoulder what the hell are you doing here just picking up my wife for our date he reached down gently and helped mira to her feet hes gone roarke murmured and brushed tears from her cheeks i couldnt reach him i tried for hours after i woke up in that in that thing but i couldnt reach him mira turned to eve you could in the only way that was left i was afraid youd she broke off shook her head i was afraid youd come and afraid you wouldnt i should have trusted you to do what had to be done when she caught eve in a hard embrace pressed her cheek against hers eve held on just held on then eased away awkwardly patting miras back it was a team effort including this civilian this time around go spend new years with your family well worry about the routine later thank you for my life she kissed eves cheek then turned and kissed roarkes and didnt begin to weep again until she was upstairs well lieutenant its a very fitting end she followed roarkes gaze studied palmer and felt nothing but quiet relief to the man or the year to both he stepped to the champagne sniffing it as he drew it from the bucket your teams on the way in but i think we could take time for a toast not here not with that she took the bottle dumped it back into the bucket on impulse she took the badge off her shirt pinned it on his routine can wait i want to collect on my present where do you want to go just home she slid an arm around his waist moving toward the stairs as cops started down just home with you she heard the crowd erupt with another cheer happy new year not quite yet but it will be
