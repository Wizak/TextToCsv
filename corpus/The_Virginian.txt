 the virginian a horseman of the plains by owen wister to theodore roosevelt some of these pages you have seen some you have praised one stands newwritten because you blamed it and all my dear critic beg leave to remind you of their authors changeless admiration to the reader certain of the newspapers when this book was first announced made a mistake most natural upon seeing the subtitle as it then stood a tale of sundry adventures this sounds like a historical novel said one of them meaning i take it a colonial romance as it now stands the title will scarce lead to such interpretation yet none the less is this book historical quite as much so as any colonial romance indeed when you look at the root of the matter it is a colonial romance for wyoming between and was a colony as wild as was virginia one hundred years earlier as wild with a scantier population and the same primitive joys and dangers there were to be sure not so many chippendale settees we know quite well the common understanding of the term historical novel hugh wynne exactly fits it but silas lapham is a novel as perfectly historical as is hugh wynne for it pictures an era and personifies a type it matters not that in the one we find george washington and in the other none save imaginary figures else the scarlet letter were not historical nor does it matter that dr mitchell did not live in the time of which he wrote while mr howells saw many silas laphams with his own eyes else uncle toms cabin were not historical any narrative which presents faithfully a day and a generation is of necessity historical and this one presents wyoming between and had you left new york or san francisco at ten oclock this morning by noon the day after tomorrow you could step out at cheyenne there you would stand at the heart of the world that is the subject of my picture yet you would look around you in vain for the reality it is a vanished world no journeys save those which memory can take will bring you to it now the mountains are there far and shining and the sunlight and the infinite earth and the air that seems forever the true fountain of youth but where is the buffalo and the wild antelope and where the horseman with his pasturing thousands so like its old self does the sagebrush seem when revisited that you wait for the horseman to appear but he will never come again he rides in his historic yesterday you will no more see him gallop out of the unchanging silence than you will see columbus on the unchanging sea come sailing from palos with his caravels and yet the horseman is still so near our day that in some chapters of this book which were published separate at the close of the nineteenth century the present tense was used it is true no longer in those chapters it has been changed and verbs like is and have now read was and had time has flowed faster than my ink what is become of the horseman the cowpuncher the last romantic figure upon our soil for he was romantic whatever he did he did with his might the bread that he earned was earned hard the wages that he squandered were squandered hard half a years pay sometimes gone in a night blown in as he expressed it or blowed in to be perfectly accurate well he will be here among us always invisible waiting his chance to live and play as he would like his wild kind has been among us always since the beginning a young man with his temptations a hero without wings the cowpunchers ungoverned hours did not unman him if he gave his word he kept it wall street would have found him behind the times nor did he talk lewdly to women newport would have thought him oldfashioned he and his brief epoch make a complete picture for in themselves they were as complete as the pioneers of the land or the explorers of the sea a transition has followed the horseman of the plains a shapeless state a condition of men and manners as unlovely as is that moment in the year when winter is gone and spring not come and the face of nature is ugly i shall not dwell upon it here those who have seen it know well what i mean such transition was inevitable let us give thanks that it is but a transition and not a finality sometimes readers inquire did i know the virginian as well i hope as a father should know his son and sometimes it is asked was such and such a thing true now to this i have the best answer in the world once a cowpuncher listened patiently while i read him a manuscript it concerned an event upon an indian reservation was that the crow reservation he inquired at the finish i told him that it was no real reservation and no real event and his face expressed displeasure why he demanded do you waste your time writing what never happened when you know so many things that did happen and i could no more help telling him that this was the highest compliment ever paid me than i have been able to help telling you about it here charleston sc march st the virginian i enter the man some notable sight was drawing the passengers both men and women to the window and therefore i rose and crossed the car to see what it was i saw near the track an enclosure and round it some laughing men and inside it some whirling dust and amid the dust some horses plunging huddling and dodging they were cow ponies in a corral and one of them would not be caught no matter who threw the rope we had plenty of time to watch this sport for our train had stopped that the engine might take water at the tank before it pulled us up beside the station platform of medicine bow we were also six hours late and starving for entertainment the pony in the corral was wise and rapid of limb have you seen a skilful boxer watch his antagonist with a quiet incessant eye such an eye as this did the pony keep upon whatever man took the rope the man might pretend to look at the weather which was fine or he might affect earnest conversation with a bystander it was bootless the pony saw through it no feint hoodwinked him this animal was thoroughly a man of the world his undistracted eye stayed fixed upon the dissembling foe and the gravity of his horseexpression made the matter one of high comedy then the rope would sail out at him but he was already elsewhere and if horses laugh gayety must have abounded in that corral sometimes the pony took a turn alone next he had slid in a flash among his brothers and the whole of them like a school of playful fish whipped round the corral kicking up the fine dust and i take it roaring with laughter through the windowglass of our pullman the thud of their mischievous hoofs reached us and the strong humorous curses of the cowboys then for the first time i noticed a man who sat on the high gate of the corral looking on for he now climbed down with the undulations of a tiger smooth and easy as if his muscles flowed beneath his skin the others had all visibly whirled the rope some of them even shoulder high i did not see his arm lift or move he appeared to hold the rope down low by his leg but like a sudden snake i saw the noose go out its length and fall true and the thing was done as the captured pony walked in with a sweet churchdoor expression our train moved slowly on to the station and a passenger remarked that man knows his business but the passengers dissertation upon roping i was obliged to lose for medicine bow was my station i bade my fellowtravellers goodby and descended a stranger into the great cattle land and here in less than ten minutes i learned news which made me feel a stranger indeed my baggage was lost it had not come on my train it was adrift somewhere back in the two thousand miles that lay behind me and by way of comfort the baggageman remarked that passengers often got astray from their trunks but the trunks mostly found them after a while having offered me this encouragement he turned whistling to his affairs and left me planted in the baggageroom at medicine bow i stood deserted among crates and boxes blankly holding my check hungry and forlorn i stared out through the door at the sky and the plains but i did not see the antelope shining among the sagebrush nor the great sunset light of wyoming annoyance blinded my eyes to all things save my grievance i saw only a lost trunk and i was muttering halfaloud what a forsaken hole this is when suddenly from outside on the platform came a slow voice off to get married again oh dont the voice was southern and gentle and drawling and a second voice came in immediate answer cracked and querulous it aint again who says its again who told you anyway and the first voice responded caressingly why your sunday clothes told me uncle hughey they are speakin mighty loud o nuptials you dont worry me snapped uncle hughey with shrill heat and the other gently continued aint them gloves the same yu wore to your last weddin you dont worry me you dont worry me now screamed uncle hughey already i had forgotten my trunk care had left me i was aware of the sunset and had no desire but for more of this conversation for it resembled none that i had heard in my life so far i stepped to the door and looked out upon the station platform lounging there at ease against the wall was a slim young giant more beautiful than pictures his broad soft hat was pushed back a looseknotted dullscarlet handkerchief sagged from his throat and one casual thumb was hooked in the cartridgebelt that slanted across his hips he had plainly come many miles from somewhere across the vast horizon as the dust upon him showed his boots were white with it his overalls were gray with it the weatherbeaten bloom of his face shone through it duskily as the ripe peaches look upon their trees in a dry season but no dinginess of travel or shabbiness of attire could tarnish the splendor that radiated from his youth and strength the old man upon whose temper his remarks were doing such deadly work was combed and curried to a finish a bridegroom swept and garnished but alas for age had i been the bride i should have taken the giant dust and all he had by no means done with the old man why yuve hung weddin gyarments on every limb he now drawled with admiration who is the lucky lady this trip the old man seemed to vibrate tell you there aint been no other call me a mormon would you why that call me a mormon then name some of my wives name two name one dare you that laramie wido promised you shucks only her docter suddenly ordered southern climate and shucks youre a false alarm so nothing but her lungs came between you and next youd most got united with cattle kate only tell you youre a false alarm only she got hung wheres the wives in all this show the wives come now that cornfed biscuitshooter at rawlins yu gave the canary never married her never did marry but yu come so near uncle she was the one left yu that letter explaining how shed got married to a young cyardplayer the very day before her ceremony with you was due and oh youre nothing youre a kid you dont amount to and how shed never never forgot to feed the canary this countrys getting full of kids stated the old man witheringly its doomed this crushing assertion plainly satisfied him and he blinked his eyes with renewed anticipation his tall tormentor continued with a face of unchanging gravity and a voice of gentle solicitude how is the health of that unfortunate thats right pour your insults pour em on a sick afflicted woman the eyes blinked with combative relish insults oh no uncle hughey thats all right insults goes why i was mighty relieved when she began to recover her memry las time i heard they told me shed got it pretty near all back remembered her father and her mother and her sisters and brothers and her friends and her happy childhood and all her doins except only your face the boys was bettin shed get that far too give her time but i reckon afteh such a turrable sickness as she had that would be expectin most too much at this uncle hughey jerked out a small parcel shows how much you know he cackled there see that thats my ring she sent me back being too unstrung for marriage so she dont remember me dont she haha always said you were a false alarm the southerner put more anxiety into his tone and so youre atakin the ring right on to the next one he exclaimed oh dont go to get married again uncle hughey whats the use o being married whats the use echoed the bridegroom with scorn hm when you grow up youll think different course i expect to think different when my age is different im havin the thoughts proper to twentyfour and youre havin the thoughts proper to sixty fifty shrieked uncle hughey jumping in the air the southerner took a tone of selfreproach now how could i forget you was fifty he murmured when you have been telling it to the boys so careful for the last ten years have you ever seen a cockatoo the white kind with the topknot enraged by insult the bird erects every available feather upon its person so did uncle hughey seem to swell clothes mustache and woolly white beard and without further speech he took himself on board the eastbound train which now arrived from its siding in time to deliver him yet this was not why he had not gone away before at any time he could have escaped into the baggageroom or withdrawn to a dignified distance until his train should come up but the old man had evidently got a sort of joy from this teasing he had reached that inevitable age when we are tickled to be linked with affairs of gallantry no matter how with him now the eastbound departed slowly into that distance whence i had come i stared after it as it went its way to the far shores of civilization it grew small in the unending gulf of space until all sign of its presence was gone save a faint skein of smoke against the evening sky and now my lost trunk came back into my thoughts and medicine bow seemed a lonely spot a sort of ship had left me marooned in a foreign ocean the pullman was comfortably steaming home to port while i how was i to find judge henrys ranch where in this unfeatured wilderness was sunk creek no creek or any water at all flowed here that i could perceive my host had written he should meet me at the station and drive me to his ranch this was all that i knew he was not here the baggageman had not seen him lately the ranch was almost certain to be too far to walk to tonight my trunk i discovered myself still staring dolefully after the vanished eastbound and at the same instant i became aware that the tall man was looking gravely at me as gravely as he had looked at uncle hughey throughout their remarkable conversation to see his eye thus fixing me and his thumb still hooked in his cartridgebelt certain tales of travellers from these parts forced themselves disquietingly into my recollection now that uncle hughey was gone was i to take his place and be for instance invited to dance on the platform to the music of shots nicely aimed i reckon i am looking for you seh the tall man now observed ii when you call me that smile we cannot see ourselves as other see us or i should know what appearance i cut at hearing this from the tall man i said nothing feeling uncertain i reckon i am looking for you seh he repeated politely i am looking for judge henry i now replied he walked toward me and i saw that in inches he was not a giant he was not more than six feet it was uncle hughey that had made him seem to tower but in his eye in his face in his step in the whole man there dominated a something potent to be felt i should think by man or woman the judge sent me afteh you seh he now explained in his civil southern voice and he handed me a letter from my host had i not witnessed his facetious performances with uncle hughey i should have judged him wholly ungifted with such powers there was nothing external about him but what seemed the signs of a nature as grave as you could meet but i had witnessed and therefore supposing that i knew him in spite of his appearance that i was so to speak in his secret and could give him a sort of wink i adopted at once a method of easiness it was so pleasant to be easy with a large stranger who instead of shooting at your heels had very civilly handed you a letter youre from old virginia i take it i began he answered slowly then you have taken it correct seh a slight chill passed over my easiness but i went cheerily on with a further inquiry find many oddities out here like uncle hughey yes seh there is a right smart of oddities around they come in on every train at this point i dropped my method of easiness i wish that trunks came on the train said i and i told him my predicament it was not to be expected that he would be greatly moved at my loss but he took it with no comment whatever well wait in town for it said he always perfectly civil now what i had seen of town was to my newly arrived eyes altogether horrible if i could possibly sleep at the judges ranch i preferred to do so is it too far to drive there tonight i inquired he looked at me in a puzzled manner for this valise i explained contains all that i immediately need in fact i could do without my trunk for a day or two if it is not convenient to send so if we could arrive there not too late by starting at once i paused its two hundred and sixtythree miles said the virginian to my loud ejaculation he made no answer but surveyed me a moment longer and then said supper will be about ready now he took my valise and i followed his steps toward the eatinghouse in silence i was dazed as we went i read my hosts letter a brief hospitable message he was very sorry not to meet me himself he had been getting ready to drive over when the surveyor appeared and detained him therefore in his stead he was sending a trustworthy man to town who would look after me and drive me over they were looking forward to my visit with much pleasure this was all yes i was dazed how did they count distance in this country you spoke in a neighborly fashion about driving over to town and it meant i did not know yet how many days and what would be meant by the term dropping in i wondered and how many miles would be considered really far i abstained from further questioning the trustworthy man my questions had not fared excessively well he did not propose making me dance to be sure that would scarcely be trustworthy but neither did he propose to have me familiar with him why was this what had i done to elicit that veiled and skilful sarcasm about oddities coming in on every train having been sent to look after me he would do so would even carry my valise but i could not be jocular with him this handsome ungrammatical son of the soil had set between us the bar of his cold and perfect civility no polished person could have done it better what was the matter i looked at him and suddenly it came to me if he had tried familiarity with me the first two minutes of our acquaintance i should have resented it by what right then had i tried it with him it smacked of patronizing on this occasion he had come off the better gentleman of the two here in flesh and blood was a truth which i had long believed in words but never met before the creature we call a gentleman lies deep in the hearts of thousands that are born without chance to master the outward graces of the type between the station and the eatinghouse i did a deal of straight thinking but my thoughts were destined presently to be drowned in amazement at the rare personage into whose society fate had thrown me town as they called it pleased me the less the longer i saw it but until our language stretches itself and takes in a new word of closer fit town will have to do for the name of such a place as was medicine bow i have seen and slept in many like it since scattered wide they littered the frontier from the columbia to the rio grande from the missouri to the sierras they lay stark dotted over a planet of treeless dust like soiled packs of cards each was similar to the next as one old fivespot of clubs resembles another houses empty bottles and garbage they were forever of the same shapeless pattern more forlorn they were than stale bones they seemed to have been strewn there by the wind and to be waiting till the wind should come again and blow them away yet serene above their foulness swam a pure and quiet light such as the east never sees they might be bathing in the air of creations first morning beneath sun and stars their days and nights were immaculate and wonderful medicine bow was my first and i took its dimensions twentynine buildings in all one coal shute one water tank the station one store two eatinghouses one billiard hall two toolhouses one feed stable and twelve others that for one reason and another i shall not name yet this wretched husk of squalor spent thought upon appearances many houses in it wore a false front to seem as if they were two stories high there they stood rearing their pitiful masquerade amid a fringe of old tin cans while at their very doors began a world of crystal light a land without end a space across which noah and adam might come straight from genesis into that space went wandering a road over a hill and down out of sight and up again smaller in the distance and down once more and up once more straining the eyes and so away then i heard a fellow greet my virginian he came rollicking out of a door and made a pass with his hand at the virginians hat the southerner dodged it and i saw once more the tiger undulation of body and knew my escort was he of the rope and the corral how are yu steve he said to the rollicking man and in his tone i heard instantly old friendship speaking with steve he would take and give familiarity steve looked at me and looked away and that was all but it was enough in no company had i ever felt so much an outsider yet i liked the company and wished that it would like me just come to town inquired steve of the virginian been here since noon been waiting for the train going out tonight i reckon ill pull out tomorro beds are all took said steve this was for my benefit dear me said i but i guess one of them drummers will let yu double up with him steve was enjoying himself i think he had his saddle and blankets and beds were nothing to him drummers are they asked the virginian two jews handling cigars one american with consumption killer and a dutchman with jewlry the virginian set down my valise and seemed to meditate i did want a bed tonight he murmured gently well steve suggested the american looks like he washed the oftenest thats of no consequence to me observed the southerner guess itll be when yu see em oh im meaning something different i wanted a bed to myself then youll have to build one bet yu i have the dutchmans take a man that wont scare bet yu drinks yu cant have the americans go yu said the virginian ill have his bed without any fuss drinks for the crowd i suppose you have me beat said steve grinning at him affectionately youre such a sonofa when you get down to work well so long i got to fix my horses hoofs i had expected that the man would be struck down he had used to the virginian a term of heaviest insult i thought i had marvelled to hear it come so unheralded from steves friendly lips and now i marvelled still more evidently he had meant no harm by it and evidently no offence had been taken used thus this language was plainly complimentary i had stepped into a world new to me indeed and novelties were occurring with scarce any time to get breath between them as to where i should sleep i had forgotten that problem altogether in my curiosity what was the virginian going to do now i began to know that the quiet of this man was volcanic will you wash first sir we were at the door of the eatinghouse and he set my valise inside in my tenderfoot innocence i was looking indoors for the washing arrangements its out hyeh seh he informed me gravely but with strong southern accent internal mirth seemed often to heighten the local flavor of his speech there were other times when it had scarce any special accent or fault in grammar a trough was to my right slippery with soapy water and hanging from a roller above one end of it was a rag of discouraging appearance the virginian caught it and it performed one whirling revolution on its roller not a dry or clean inch could be found on it he took off his hat and put his head in the door your towel maam said he has been too popular she came out a pretty woman her eyes rested upon him for a moment then upon me with disfavor then they returned to his black hair the allowance is one a day said she very quietly but when folks are particular she completed her sentence by removing the old towel and giving a clean one to us thank you maam said the cowpuncher she looked once more at his black hair and without any word returned to her guests at supper a pail stood in the trough almost empty and this he filled for me from a well there was some soap sliding at large in the trough but i got my own and then in a tin basin i removed as many of the stains of travel as i was able it was not much of a toilet that i made in this first washtrough of my experience but it had to suffice and i took my seat at supper canned stuff it was corned beef and one of my table companions said the truth about it when i slung my teeth over that he remarked i thought i was chewing a hammock we had strange coffee and condensed milk and i have never seen more flies i made no attempt to talk for no one in this country seemed favorable to me by reason of something my clothes my hat my pronunciation whatever it might be i possessed the secret of estranging people at sight yet i was doing better than i knew my strict silence and attention to the corned beef made me in the eyes of the cowboys at table compare well with the overtalkative commercial travellers the virginians entrance produced a slight silence he had done wonders with the washtrough and he had somehow brushed his clothes with all the roughness of his dress he was now the neatest of us he nodded to some of the other cowboys and began his meal in quiet but silence is not the native element of the drummer an average fish can go a longer time out of water than this breed can live without talking one of them now looked across the table at the grave flannelshirted virginian he inspected and came to the imprudent conclusion that he understood his man good evening he said briskly good evening said the virginian just come to town pursued the drummer just come to town the virginian suavely assented cattle business jumping along inquired the drummer oh fair and the virginian took some more corned beef gets a move on your appetite anyway suggested the drummer the virginian drank some coffee presently the pretty woman refilled his cup without his asking her guess ive met you before the drummer stated next the virginian glanced at him for a brief moment havent i now aint i seen you somewhere look at me you been in chicago aint you you look at me well remember ikeys dont you i dont reckon i do see now i knowed youd been in chicago four or five years ago or maybe its two years times nothing to me but i never forget a face yes sir him and mes met at ikeys all right this important point the drummer stated to all of us we were called to witness how well he had proved old acquaintanceship aint the world small though he exclaimed complacently meet a man once and youre sure to run on to him again thats straight thats no barroom josh and the drummers eye included us all in his confidence i wondered if he had attained that high perfection when a man believes his own lies the virginian did not seem interested he placidly attended to his food while our landlady moved between dining room and kitchen and the drummer expanded yes sir ikeys over by the stockyards patronized by all cattlemen that know whats what thats where maybe its three years time never was nothing to me but faces why i cant quit em adults or children male and female onced i seen em i couldnt lose one off my memory not if you were to pay me bounty five dollars a face white men that is cant do nothing with niggers or chinese but youre white all right the drummer suddenly returned to the virginian with this high compliment the cowpuncher had taken out a pipe and was slowly rubbing it the compliment seemed to escape his attention and the drummer went on i can tell a man when hes white put him at ikeys or out loose here in the sagebrush and he rolled a cigar across to the virginians plate selling them inquired the virginian solid goods my friend havana wrappers the biggest tobacco proposition for five cents got out yet take it try it light it watch it burn here and he held out a bunch of matches the virginian tossed a fivecent piece over to him oh no my friend not from you not after ikeys i dont forget you see i knowed your face right away see thats straight i seen you at chicago all right maybe you did said the virginian sometimes im mighty careless what i look at well py damn now exclaimed the dutch drummer hilariously i am ploom disappointed i vas hoping to sell him somedings myself not the same here stated the american hes too healthy for me i gave him up on sight now it was the american drummer whose bed the virginian had in his eye this was a sensible man and had talked less than his brothers in the trade i had little doubt who would end by sleeping in his bed but how the thing would be done interested me more deeply than ever the virginian looked amiably at his intended victim and made one or two remarks regarding patent medicines there must be a good deal of money in them he supposed with a live man to manage them the victim was flattered no other person at the table had been favored with so much of the tall cowpunchers notice he responded and they had a pleasant talk i did not divine that the virginians genius was even then at work and that all this was part of his satanic strategy but steve must have divined it for while a few of us still sat finishing our supper that facetious horseman returned from doctoring his horses hoofs put his head into the dining room took in the way in which the virginian was engaging his victim in conversation remarked aloud ive lost and closed the door again whats he lost inquired the american drummer oh you mustnt mind him drawled the virginian hes one of those boxhead jokers goes around openin and shuttin doors thataway we call him harmless well he broke off i reckon ill go smoke not allowed in hyeh this last he addressed to the landlady with especial gentleness she shook her head and her eyes followed him as he went out left to myself i meditated for some time upon my lodging for the night and smoked a cigar for consolation as i walked about it was not a hotel that we had supped in hotel at medicine bow there appeared to be none but connected with the eatinghouse was that place where according to steve the beds were all taken and there i went to see for myself steve had spoken the truth it was a single apartment containing four or five beds and nothing else whatever and when i looked at these beds my sorrow that i could sleep in none of them grew less to be alone in one offered no temptation and as for this courtesy of the country this doubling up well they have got ahead of us this was the virginian standing at my elbow i assented they have staked out their claims he added in this public sleeping room they had done what one does to secure a seat in a railroad train upon each bed as notice of occupancy lay some article of travel or of dress as we stood there the two jews came in and opened and arranged their valises and folded and refolded their linen dusters then a railroad employee entered and began to go to bed at this hour before dusk had wholly darkened into night for him going to bed meant removing his boots and placing his overalls and waistcoat beneath his pillow he had no coat his work began at three in the morning and even as we still talked he began to snore the man that keeps the store is a friend of mine said the virginian and you can be pretty near comfortable on his counter got any blankets i had no blankets looking for a bed inquired the american drummer now arriving yes hes looking for a bed answered the voice of steve behind him seems a waste of time observed the virginian he looked thoughtfully from one bed to another i didnt know id have to lay over here well i have sat up before this ones mine said the drummer sitting down on it halfs plenty enough room for me youre certnly mighty kind said the cowpuncher but id not think o disconveniencing yu thats nothing the other half is yours turn in right now if you feel like it no i dont reckon ill turn in right now better keep your bed to yourself see here urged the drummer if i take you im safe from drawing some party i might not care so much about this here sleeping proposition is a lottery well said the virginian and his hesitation was truly masterly if you put it that way i do put it that way why youre clean youve had a shave right now you turn in when you feel inclined old man i aint retiring just yet the drummer had struck a slightly false note in these last remarks he should not have said old man until this i had thought him merely an amiable person who wished to do a favor but old man came in wrong it had a hateful taint of his profession the being too soon with everybody the celluloid goodfellowship that passes for ivory with nine in ten of the city crowd but not so with the sons of the sagebrush they live nearer nature and they know better but the virginian blandly accepted old man from his victim he had a game to play well i certnly thank yu he said after a while ill take advantage of your kind offer i was surprised possession being nine points of the law it seemed his very chance to intrench himself in the bed but the cowpuncher had planned a campaign needing no intrenchments moreover going to bed before nine oclock upon the first evening in many weeks that a towns resources were open to you would be a dull proceeding our entire company drummer and all now walked over to the store and here my sleeping arrangements were made easily this store was the cleanest place and the best in medicine bow and would have been a good store anywhere offering a multitude of things for sale and kept by a very civil proprietor he bade me make myself at home and placed both of his counters at my disposal upon the grocery side there stood a cheese too large and strong to sleep near comfortably and i therefore chose the drygoods side here thick quilts were unrolled for me to make it soft and no condition was placed upon me further than that i should remove my boots because the quilts were new and clean and for sale so now my rest was assured not an anxiety remained in my thoughts these therefore turned themselves wholly to the other mans bed and how he was going to lose it i think that steve was more curious even than myself time was on the wing his bet must be decided and the drinks enjoyed he stood against the grocery counter contemplating the virginian but it was to me that he spoke the virginian however listened to every word your first visit to this country i told him yes how do you like it i expected to like it very much how does the climate strike you i thought the climate was fine makes a man thirsty though this was the subcurrent which the virginian plainly looked for but he like steve addressed himself to me yes he put in thirsty while a mans soft yet youll harden i guess youll find it a drier country than you were given to expect said steve if your habits have been frequent that way said the virginian theres parts of wyoming pursued steve where youll go hours and hours before youll see a drop of wetness and if yu keep athinkin about it said the virginian itll seem like days and days steve at this stroke gave up and clapped him on the shoulder with a joyous chuckle you old sonofa he cried affectionately drinks are due now said the virginian my treat steve but i reckon your suspense will have to linger a while yet thus they dropped into direct talk from that speech of the fourth dimension where they had been using me for their telephone any cyards going tonight inquired the virginian stud and draw steve told him strangers playing i think id like to get into a game for a while said the southerner strangers yu say and then before quitting the store he made his toilet for this little hand at poker it was a simple preparation he took his pistol from its holster examined it then shoved it between his overalls and his shirt in front and pulled his waistcoat over it he might have been combing his hair for all the attention any one paid to this except myself then the two friends went out and i bethought me of that epithet which steve again had used to the virginian as he clapped him on the shoulder clearly this wild country spoke a language other than mine the word here was a term of endearment such was my conclusion the drummers had finished their dealings with the proprietor and they were gossiping together in a knot by the door as the virginian passed out see you later old man this was the american drummer accosting his prospective bedfellow oh yes returned the bedfellow and was gone the american drummer winked triumphantly at his brethren hes all right he observed jerking a thumb after the virginian hes easy you got to know him to work him thats all und vat is your point inquired the german drummer point is hell not take any goods off you or me but hes going to talk up the killer to any consumptive he runs across i aint done with him yet say he now addressed the proprietor whats her name whose name woman runs the eatinghouse glen mrs glen aint she new been settled here about a month husbands a freight conductor thought id not seen her before shes a goodlooker hm yes the kind of good looks id sooner see in another mans wife than mine so thats the gait is it hm well it dont seem to be she come here with that reputation but theres been general disappointment then she aint lacked suitors any lacked are you acquainted with cowboys and she disappointed em maybe she likes her husband hm well how are you to tell about them silent kind talking of conductors began the drummer and we listened to his anecdote it was successful with his audience but when he launched fluently upon a second i strolled out there was not enough wit in this narrator to relieve his indecency and i felt shame at having been surprised into laughing with him i left that company growing confidential over their leering stories and i sought the saloon it was very quiet and orderly beer in quart bottles at a dollar i had never met before but saving its price i found no complaint to make of it through folding doors i passed from the bar proper with its bottles and elk head back to the hall with its various tables i saw a man sliding cards from a case and across the table from him another man laying counters down near by was a second dealer pulling cards from the bottom of a pack and opposite him a solemn old rustic piling and changing coins upon the cards which lay already exposed but now i heard a voice that drew my eyes to the far corner of the room why didnt you stay in arizona harmless looking words as i write them down here yet at the sound of them i noticed the eyes of the others directed to that corner what answer was given to them i did not hear nor did i see who spoke then came another remark well arizonas no place for amatures this time the two card dealers that i stood near began to give a part of their attention to the group that sat in the corner there was in me a desire to leave this room so far my hours at medicine bow had seemed to glide beneath a sunshine of merriment of easygoing jocularity this was suddenly gone like the wind changing to north in the middle of a warm day but i stayed being ashamed to go five or six players sat over in the corner at a round table where counters were piled their eyes were close upon their cards and one seemed to be dealing a card at a time to each with pauses and betting between steve was there and the virginian the others were new faces no place for amatures repeated the voice and now i saw that it was the dealers there was in his countenance the same ugliness that his words conveyed whos that talkin said one of the men near me in a low voice trampas whats he cowpuncher broncobuster tinhorn most anything whos he talkin at think its the blackheaded guy hes talking at that aint supposed to be safe is it guess were all goin to find out in a few minutes been trouble between em theyve not met before trampas dont enjoy losin to a stranger fellos from arizona yu say no virginia hes recently back from havin a look at arizona went down there last year for a change works for the sunk creek outfit and then the dealer lowered his voice still further and said something in the other mans ear causing him to grin after which both of them looked at me there had been silence over in the corner but now the man trampas spoke again and ten said he sliding out some chips from before him very strange it was to hear him how he contrived to make those words a personal taunt the virginian was looking at his cards he might have been deaf and twenty said the next player easily the next threw his cards down it was now the virginians turn to bet or leave the game and he did not speak at once therefore trampas spoke your bet you sonofa the virginians pistol came out and his hand lay on the table holding it unaimed and with a voice as gentle as ever the voice that sounded almost like a caress but drawling a very little more than usual so that there was almost a space between each word he issued his orders to the man trampas when you call me that smile and he looked at trampas across the table yes the voice was gentle but in my ears it seemed as if somewhere the bell of death was ringing and silence like a stroke fell on the large room all men present as if by some magnetic current had become aware of this crisis in my ignorance and the total stoppage of my thoughts i stood stockstill and noticed various people crouching or shifting their positions sit quiet said the dealer scornfully to the man near me cant you see he dont want to push trouble he has handed trampas the choice to back down or draw his steel then with equal suddenness and ease the room came out of its strangeness voices and cards the click of chips the puff of tobacco glasses lifted to drink this level of smooth relaxation hinted no more plainly of what lay beneath than does the surface tell the depth of the sea for trampas had made his choice and that choice was not to draw his steel if it was knowledge that he sought he had found it and no mistake we heard no further reference to what he had been pleased to style amatures in no company would the blackheaded man who had visited arizona be rated a novice at the cool art of selfpreservation one doubt remained what kind of a man was trampas a public backdown is an unfinished thing for some natures at least i looked at his face and thought it sullen but tricky rather than courageous something had been added to my knowledge also once again i had heard applied to the virginian that epithet which steve so freely used the same words identical to the letter but this time they had produced a pistol when you call me that smile so i perceived a new example of the old truth that the letter means nothing until the spirit gives it life iii steve treats it was for several minutes i suppose that i stood drawing these silent morals no man occupied himself with me quiet voices and games of chance and glasses lifted to drink continued to be the peaceful order of the night and into my thoughts broke the voice of that carddealer who had already spoken so sagely he also took his turn at moralizing what did i tell you he remarked to the man for whom he continued to deal and who continued to lose money to him tell me when didnt i tell you hed not shoot the dealer pursued with complacence you got ready to dodge you had no call to be concerned hes not the kind a man need feel anxious about the player looked over at the virginian doubtfully well he said i dont know what you folks call a dangerous man not him exclaimed the dealer with admiration hes a brave man thats different the player seemed to follow this reasoning no better than i did its not a brave man thats dangerous continued the dealer its the cowards that scare me he paused that this might sink home fello came in here las toosday he went on he got into some misunderstanding about the drinks well sir before we could put him out of business hed hurt two perfectly innocent onlookers theyd no more to do with it than you have the dealer explained to me were they badly hurt i asked one of em was hes died since what became of the man why we put him out of business i told you he died that night but there was no occasion for any of it and thats why i never like to be around where theres a coward you cant tell hell always go to shooting before its necessary and theres no security who hell hit but a man like that blackheaded guy is the dealer indicated the virginian need never worry you and theres another point why theres no need to worry about him itd be too late these good words ended the moralizing of the dealer he had given us a piece of his mind he now gave the whole of it to dealing cards i loitered here and there neither welcome nor unwelcome at present watching the cowboys at their play saving trampas there was scarce a face among them that had not in it something very likable here were lusty horsemen ridden from the heat of the sun and the wet of the storm to divert themselves awhile youth untamed sat here for an idle moment spending easily its hardearned wages city saloons rose into my vision and i instantly preferred this rocky mountain place more of death it undoubtedly saw but less of vice than did its new york equivalents and death is a thing much cleaner than vice moreover it was by no means vice that was written upon these wild and manly faces even where baseness was visible baseness was not uppermost daring laughter endurance these were what i saw upon the countenances of the cowboys and this very first day of my knowledge of them marks a date with me for something about them and the idea of them smote my american heart and i have never forgotten it nor ever shall as long as i live in their flesh our natural passions ran tumultuous but often in their spirit sat hidden a true nobility and often beneath its unexpected shining their figures took on heroic stature the dealer had styled the virginian a blackheaded guy this did well enough as an unflattered portrait judge henrys trustworthy man with whom i was to drive two hundred and sixtythree miles certainly had a very black head of hair it was the first thing to notice now if one glanced generally at the table where he sat at cards but the eye came back to him drawn by that inexpressible something which had led the dealer to speak so much at length about him still blackheaded guy justly fits him and his next performance he had made his plan for this like a true and i must say inspired devil and now the highly appreciative town of medicine bow was to be treated to a manifestation of genius he sat playing his studpoker after a decent period of losing and winning which gave trampas all proper time for a change of luck and a repairing of his fortunes he looked at steve and said amiably how does bed strike you i was beside their table learning gradually that studpoker has in it more of what i will call red pepper than has our eastern game the virginian followed his own question bed strikes me he stated steve feigned indifference he was far more deeply absorbed in his bet and the american drummer than he was in this game but he chose to take out a fat florid gold watch consult it elaborately and remark its only eleven yu forget im from the country said the blackheaded guy the chickens have been roostin a right smart while his sunny southern accent was again strong in that brief passage with trampas it had been almost wholly absent but different moods of the spirit bring different qualities of utterance where a man comes by these naturally the virginian cashed in his checks awhile ago said steve you had won three months salary im still twenty dollars to the good said the virginian thats better than breaking a laig again in some voiceless masonic way most people in that saloon had become aware that something was in process of happening several left their games and came to the front by the bar if he aint in bed yet mused the virginian ill find out said i and i hurried across to the dim sleeping room happy to have a part in this they were all in bed and in some beds two were sleeping how they could do it but in those days i was fastidious the american had come in recently and was still awake thought you were to sleep at the store said he so then i invented a little lie and explained that i was in search of the virginian better search the dives said he these cowboys dont get to town often at this point i stumbled sharply over something its my box of consumption killer explained the drummer well i hope that man will stay out all night bed narrow i inquired for two it is and the pillows are mean takes both before you feel anythings under your head he yawned and i wished him pleasant dreams at my news the virginian left the bar at once and crossed to the sleeping room steve and i followed softly and behind us several more strung out in an expectant line what is this going to be they inquired curiously of each other and upon learning the great novelty of the event they clustered with silence intense outside the door where the virginian had gone in we heard the voice of the drummer cautioning his bedfellow dont trip over the killer he was saying the prince of wales barked his shin just now it seemed my english clothes had earned me this title the boots of the virginian were next heard to drop can yu make out what hes at whispered steve he was plainly undressing the rip of swift unbuttoning told us that the blackheaded guy must now be removing his overalls why thank yu no he was replying to a question of the drummer outside or ins all one to me then if youd just as soon take the wall why certnly there was a sound of bedclothes and creaking this hyeh pillo needs a southern climate was the virginians next observation many listeners had now gathered at the door the dealer and the player were both here the storekeeper was present and i recognized the agent of the union pacific railroad among the crowd we made a large company and i felt that trembling sensation which is common when the cap of a camera is about to be removed upon a group i should think said the drummers voice that youd feel your knife and gun clean through that pillow i do responded the virginian i should think youd put them on a chair and be comfortable id be uncomfortable then used to the feel of them i suppose thats it used to the feel of them i would miss them and that would make me wakeful well good night good night if i get to talkin and tossin or what not youll understand youre to yes ill wake you no dont yu for gods sake not dont yu touch me whatll i do roll away quick to your side it dont last but a minute the virginian spoke with a reassuring drawl upon this there fell a brief silence and i heard the drummer clear his throat once or twice its merely the nightmare i suppose he said after a throat clearing lord yes thats all and dont happen twice a year was you thinkin it was fits oh no i just wanted to know ive been told before that it was not safe for a person to be waked suddenly that way out of a nightmare yes i have heard that too but it never harms me any i didnt want you to run risks me oh itll be all right now that yu know how it is the virginians drawl was full of assurance there was a second pause after which the drummer said tell me again how it is the virginian answered very drowsily oh just dont let your arm or your laig touch me if i go to jumpin around im dreamin of indians when i do that and if anything touches me then im liable to grab my knife right in my sleep oh i understand said the drummer clearing his throat yes steve was whispering delighted oaths to himself and in his joy applying to the virginian one unprintable name after another we listened again but now no further words came listening very hard i could half make out the progress of a heavy breathing and a restless turning i could clearly detect this was the wretched drummer he was waiting but he did not wait long again there was a light creak and after it a light step he was not even going to put his boots on in the fatal neighborhood of the dreamer by a happy thought medicine bow formed into two lines making an avenue from the door and then the commercial traveller forgot his consumption killer he fell heavily over it immediately from the bed the virginian gave forth a dreadful howl and then everything happened at once and how shall mere words narrate it the door burst open and out flew the commercial traveller in his stockings one hand held a lump of coat and trousers with suspenders dangling his boots were clutched in the other the sight of us stopped his flight short he gazed the boots fell from his hand and at his profane explosion medicine bow set up a united unearthly noise and began to play virginia reel with him the other occupants of the beds had already sprung out of them clothed chiefly with their pistols and ready for war what is it they demanded what is it why i reckon its drinks on steve said the virginian from his bed and he gave the first broad grin that i had seen from him ill set em up all night steve shouted as the reel went on regardless the drummer was bawling to be allowed to put at least his boots on this way pard was the answer and another man whirled him round this way beau they called to him this way budd and he was passed like a shuttlecock down the line suddenly the leaders bounded into the sleepingroom feed the machine they said feed her and seizing the german drummer who sold jewellery they flung him into the trough of the reel i saw him go bouncing like an ear of corn to be shelled and the dance ingulfed him i saw a jew sent rattling after him and next they threw in the railroad employee and the other jew and while i stood mesmerized my own feet left the earth i shot from the room and sped like a bobbing cork into this mill race whirling my turn in the wake of the others amid cries of here comes the prince of wales there was soon not much english left about my raiment they were now shouting for music medicine bow swept in like a cloud of dust to where a fiddler sat playing in a hall and gathering up fiddler and dancers swept out again a larger medicine bow growing all the while steve offered us the freedom of the house everywhere he implored us to call for whatever pleased us and as many times as we should please he ordered the town to be searched for more citizens to come and help him pay his bet but changing his mind kegs and bottles were now carried along with us we had found three fiddlers and these played busily for us and thus we set out to visit all cabins and houses where people might still by some miracle be asleep the first man put out his head to decline but such a possibility had been foreseen by the proprietor of the store this seemingly respectable man now came dragging some sort of apparatus from his place helped by the virginian the cowboys cheered for they knew what this was the man in his window likewise recognized it and uttering a groan came immediately out and joined us what it was i also learned in a few minutes for we found a house where the people made no sign at either our fiddlers or our knocking and then the infernal machine was set to work its parts seemed to be no more than an empty keg and a plank some citizen informed me that i should soon have a new idea of noise and i nerved myself for something severe in the way of gunpowder but the virginian and the proprietor now sat on the ground holding the keg braced and two others got down apparently to play seesaw over the top of it with the plank but the keg and plank had been rubbed with rosin and they drew the plank back and forth over the keg do you know the sound made in a narrow street by a dray loaded with strips of iron that noise is a lullaby compared with the staggering blinding bellow which rose from the keg if you were to try it in your native town you would not merely be arrested you would be hanged and everybody would be glad and the clergyman would not bury you my head my teeth the whole system of my bones leaped and chattered at the din and out of the house like drops squirted from a lemon came a man and his wife no time was given them they were swept along with the rest and having been routed from their own bed they now became most furious in assailing the remaining homes of medicine bow everybody was to come out many were now riding horses at top speed out into the plains and back while the procession of the plank and keg continued its work and the fiddlers played incessantly suddenly there was a quiet i did not see who brought the message but the word ran among us that there was a woman the engineers woman down by the watertank very sick the doctor had been to see her from laramie everybody liked the engineer plank and keg were heard no more the horsemen found it out and restrained their gambols medicine bow went gradually home i saw doors shutting and lights go out i saw a late few reassemble at the card tables and the drummers gathered themselves together for sleep the proprietor of the store you could not see a more respectablelooking person hoped that i would be comfortable on the quilts and i heard steve urging the virginian to take one more glass weve not met for so long he said but the virginian the blackheaded guy who had set all this nonsense going said no to steve i have got to stay responsible was his excuse to his friend and the friend looked at me therefore i surmised that the judges trustworthy man found me an embarrassment to his holiday but if he did he never showed it to me he had been sent to meet a stranger and drive him to sunk creek in safety and this charge he would allow no temptation to imperil he nodded good night to me if theres anything i can do for yu youll tell me i thanked him what a pleasant evening i added im glad yu found it so again his manner put a bar to my approaches even though i had seen him wildly disporting himself those were matters which he chose not to discuss with me medicine bow was quiet as i went my way to my quilts so still that through the air the deep whistles of the freight trains came from below the horizon across great miles of silence i passed cowboys whom half an hour before i had seen prancing and roaring now rolled in their blankets beneath the open and shining night what world am i in i said aloud does this same planet hold fifth avenue and i went to sleep pondering over my native land iv deep into cattle land morning had been for some while astir in medicine bow before i left my quilts the new day and its doings began around me in the store chiefly at the grocery counter drygoods were not in great request the early rising cowboys were off again to their work and those to whom their nights holiday had left any dollars were spending these for tobacco or cartridges or canned provisions for the journey to their distant camps sardines were called for and potted chicken and devilled ham a sophisticated nourishment at first sight for these sons of the sagebrush but portable readymade food plays of necessity a great part in the opening of a new country these picnic pots and cans were the first of her trophies that civilization dropped upon wyomings virgin soil the cowboy is now gone to worlds invisible the wind has blown away the white ashes of his campfires but the empty sardine box lies rusting over the face of the western earth so through my eyes half closed i watched the sale of these tins and grew familiar with the hams inevitable trademark that label with the devil and his horns and hoofs and tail very pronounced all colored a sultry prodigious scarlet and when each horseman had made his purchase he would trail his spurs over the floor and presently the sound of his horses hoofs would be the last of him through my dozing attention came various fragments of talk and sometimes useful bits of knowledge for instance i learned the true value of tomatoes in this country one fellow was buying two cans of them meadow creek dry already commented the proprietor been dry ten days the young cowboy informed him and it appeared that along the road he was going water would not be reached much before sundown because this meadow creek had ceased to run his tomatoes were for drink and thus they have refreshed me many times since no beer suggested the proprietor the boy made a shuddering face dont say its name to me he exclaimed i couldnt hold my breakfast down he rang his silver money upon the counter ive swore off for three months he stated im going to be as pure as the snow and away he went jingling out of the door to ride seventyfive miles three more months of hard unsheltered work and he would ride into town again with his adolescent blood crying aloud for its own im obliged said a new voice rousing me from a new doze shes easier this morning since the medicine this was the engineer whose sick wife had brought a hush over medicine bows rioting ill give her them flowers soon as she wakes he added flowers repeated the proprietor you didnt leave that bunch at our door wish id thought to do it she likes to see flowers said the engineer and he walked out slowly with his thanks unachieved he returned at once with the virginian for in the band of the virginians hat were two or three blossoms it dont need mentioning the southerner was saying embarrassed by any expression of thanks if we had knowed last night you didnt disturb her any broke in the engineer shes easier this morning ill tell her about them flowers why it dont need mentioning the virginian again protested almost crossly the little things looked kind o fresh and i just picked them his eye now fell upon me where i lay upon the counter i reckon breakfast will be getting through he remarked i was soon at the wash trough it was only halfpast six but many had been before me one glance at the rollertowel told me that i was afraid to ask the landlady for a clean one and so i found a fresh handkerchief and accomplished a sparing toilet in the midst of this the drummers joined me one by one and they used the degraded towel without hesitation in a way they had the best of me filth was nothing to them the latest risers in medicine bow we sat at breakfast together and they essayed some light familiarities with the landlady but these experiments were failures her eyes did not see nor did her ears hear them she brought the coffee and the bacon with a sedateness that propriety itself could scarce have surpassed yet impropriety lurked noiselessly all over her you could not have specified how it was interblended with her sum total silence was her apparent habit and her weapon but the american drummer found that she could speak to the point when need came for this during the meal he had praised her golden hair it was golden indeed and worth a high compliment but his kind displeased her she had let it pass however with no more than a cool stare but on taking his leave when he came to pay for the meal he pushed it too far pity this must be our last he said and as it brought no answer ever travel he inquired where i go theres room for a pair of us then youd better find another jackass she replied quietly i was glad that i had not asked for a clean towel from the commercial travellers i now separated myself and wandered alone in pleasurable aimlessness it was seven oclock medicine bow stood voiceless and unpeopled the cowboys had melted away the inhabitants were indoors pursuing the business or the idleness of the forenoon visible motion there was none no shell upon the dry sands could lie more lifeless than medicine bow looking in at the store i saw the proprietor sitting with his pipe extinct looking in at the saloon i saw the dealer dealing dumbly to himself up in the sky there was not a cloud nor a bird and on the earth the lightest straw lay becalmed once i saw the virginian at an open door where the goldenhaired landlady stood talking with him sometimes i strolled in the town and sometimes out on the plain i lay down with my day dreams in the sagebrush pale herds of antelope were in the distance and near by the demure prairiedogs sat up and scrutinized me steve trampas the riot of horsemen my lost trunk uncle hughey with his abortive brides all things merged in my thoughts in a huge delicious indifference it was like swimming slowly at random in an ocean that was smooth and neither too cool nor too warm and before i knew it five lazy imperceptible hours had gone thus there was the union pacific train coming as if from shores forgotten its approach was silent and long drawn out i easily reached town and the platform before it had finished watering at the tank it moved up made a short halt i saw my trunk come out of it and then it moved away silently as it had come smoking and dwindling into distance unknown beside my trunk was one other tied extravagantly with white ribbon the fluttering bows caught my attention and now i suddenly saw a perfectly new sight the virginian was further down the platform doubled up with laughing it was good to know that with sufficient cause he could laugh like this a smile had thus far been his limit of external mirth rice now flew against my hat and hissing gusts of rice spouted on the platform all the men left in medicine bow appeared like magic and more rice choked the atmosphere through the general clamor a cracked voice said dont hit her in the eye boys and uncle hughey rushed proudly by me with an actual wife on his arm she could easily have been his granddaughter they got at once into a vehicle the trunk was lifted in behind and amid cheers rice shoes and broad felicitations the pair drove out of town uncle hughey shrieking to the horses and the bride waving unabashed adieus the word had come over the wires from laramie uncle hughey has made it this time expect him on todays number two and medicine bow had expected him many words arose on the departure of the newmarried couple whos she whats he got for her got a gold mine up bear creek and after comment and prophecy medicine bow returned to its dinner this meal was my last here for a long while the virginians responsibility now returned duty drove the judges trustworthy man to take care of me again he had not once sought my society of his own accord his distaste for what he supposed me to be i dont exactly know what this was remained unshaken i have thought that matters of dress and speech should not carry with them so much mistrust in our democracy thieves are presumed innocent until proved guilty but a starched collar is condemned at once perfect civility and obligingness i certainly did receive from the virginian only not a word of fellowship he harnessed the horses got my trunk and gave me some advice about taking provisions for our journey something more palatable than what food we should find along the road it was well thought of and i bought quite a parcel of dainties feeling that he would despise both them and me and thus i took my seat beside him wondering what we should manage to talk about for two hundred and sixtythree miles farewell in those days was not said in cattle land acquaintances watched our departure with a nod or with nothing and the nearest approach to goodby was the proprietors solong but i caught sight of one farewell given without words as we drove by the eatinghouse the shade of a side window was raised and the landlady looked her last upon the virginian her lips were faintly parted and no womans eyes ever said more plainly i am one of your possessions she had forgotten that it might be seen her glance caught mine and she backed into the dimness of the room what look she may have received from him if he gave her any at this too public moment i could not tell his eyes seemed to be upon the horses and he drove with the same mastering ease that had roped the wild pony yesterday we passed the ramparts of medicine bow thick heaps and fringes of tin cans and shelving mounds of bottles cast out of the saloons the sun struck these at a hundred glittering points and in a moment we were in the clean plains with the prairiedogs and the pale herds of antelope the great still air bathed us pure as water and strong as wine the sunlight flooded the world and shining upon the breast of the virginians flannel shirt lay a long gold thread of hair the noisy american drummer had met defeat but this silent free lance had been easily victorious it must have been five miles that we travelled in silence losing and seeing the horizon among the ceaseless waves of the earth then i looked back and there was medicine bow seemingly a stones throw behind us it was a full halfhour before i looked back again and there sure enough was always medicine bow a size or two smaller i will admit but visible in every feature like something seen through the wrong end of a field glass the eastbound express was approaching the town and i noticed the white steam from its whistle but when the sound reached us the train had almost stopped and in reply to my comment upon this the virginian deigned to remark that it was more so in arizona a man come to arizona he said with one of them telescopes to study the heavenly bodies he was a yankee seh and a right smart one too and one night we was watchin for some little old fallin stars that he said was due and i saw some lights movin along across the mesa pretty lively an i sang out but he told me it was just the train and i told him i didnt know yu could see the cyars that plain from his place yu can see them he said to me but it is las nights cyars youre lookin at at this point the virginian spoke severely to one of the horses of course he then resumed to me that yankee man did not mean quite all he said you buck he again broke off suddenly to the horse but arizona seh he continued it certnly has a mos deceivin atmospheah another man told me he had seen a lady close one eye at him when he was two minutes hard run from her this time the virginian gave buck the whip what effect i inquired with a gravity equal to his own does this extraordinary foreshortening have upon a quart of whiskey when its outside yu seh no distance looks too far to go to it he glanced at me with an eye that held more confidence than hitherto he had been able to feel in me i had made one step in his approval but i had many yet to go this day he preferred his own thoughts to my conversation and so he did all the days of this first journey while i should have greatly preferred his conversation to my thoughts he dismissed some attempts that i made upon the subject of uncle hughey so that i had not the courage to touch upon trampas and that chill brief collision which might have struck the spark of death trampas i had forgotten him till this silent drive i was beginning i wondered if i should ever see him or steve or any of those people again and this wonder i expressed aloud theres no tellin in this country said the virginian folks come easy and they go easy in settled places like back in the states even a poor man mostly has a home dont care if its only a barrel on a lot the fello will keep frequentin that lot and if yu want him yu can find him but out hyeh in the sagebrush a mans home is apt to be his saddle blanket first thing yu know he has moved it to texas you have done some moving yourself i suggested but this word closed his mouth i have had a look at the country he said and we were silent again let me however tell you here that he had set out for a look at the country at the age of fourteen and that by his present age of twentyfour he had seen arkansas texas new mexico arizona california oregon idaho montana and wyoming everywhere he had taken care of himself and survived nor had his strong heart yet waked up to any hunger for a home let me also tell you that he was one of thousands drifting and living thus but as you shall learn one in a thousand medicine bow did not forever remain in sight when next i thought of it and looked behind nothing was there but the road we had come it lay like a ships wake across the huge ground swell of the earth we were swallowed in a vast solitude a little while before sunset a cabin came in view and here we passed our first night two young men lived here tending their cattle they were fond of animals by the stable a chained coyote rushed nervously in a circle or sat on its haunches and snapped at gifts of food ungraciously a tame young elk walked in and out of the cabin door and during supper it tried to push me off my chair a halftame mountain sheep practised jumping from the ground to the roof the cabin was papered with posters of a circus and skins of bear and silver fox lay upon the floor until nine oclock one man talked to the virginian and one played gayly upon a concertina and then we all went to bed the air was like december but in my blankets and a buffalo robe i kept warm and luxuriated in the rocky mountain silence going to wash before breakfast at sunrise i found needles of ice in a pail yet it was hard to remember that this quiet open splendid wilderness with not a peak in sight just here was six thousand feet high and when breakfast was over there was no december left and by the time the virginian and i were ten miles upon our way it was june but always every breath that i breathed was pure as water and strong as wine we never passed a human being this day some wild cattle rushed up to us and away from us antelope stared at us from a hundred yards coyotes ran skulking through the sagebrush to watch us from a hill at our noon meal we killed a rattlesnake and shot some young sage chickens which were good at supper roasted at our campfire by halfpast eight we were asleep beneath the stars and by halfpast four i was drinking coffee and shivering the horse buck was hard to catch this second morning whether some hills that we were now in had excited him or whether the better water up here had caused an effervescence in his spirits i cannot say but i was as hot as july by the time we had him safe in harness or rather unsafe in harness for buck in the mysterious language of horses now taught wickedness to his side partner and about eleven oclock they laid their evil heads together and decided to break our necks we were passing i have said through a range of demimountains it was a little country where trees grew water ran and the plains were shut out for a while the road had steep places in it and places here and there where you could fall off and go bounding to the bottom among stones but buck for some reason did not think these opportunities good enough for him he selected a more theatrical moment we emerged from a narrow canyon suddenly upon five hundred cattle and some cowboys branding calves by a fire in a corral it was a sight that buck knew by heart he instantly treated it like an appalling phenomenon i saw him kick seven ways i saw muggins kick five ways our furious motion snapped my spine like a whip i grasped the seat something gave a forlorn jingle it was the brake dont jump commanded the trustworthy man no i said as my hat flew off help was too far away to do anything for us we passed scathless through a part of the cattle i saw their horns and backs go by some earth crumbled and we plunged downward into water rocking among stones and upward again through some more crumbling earth i heard a crash and saw my trunk landing in the stream shes safer there said the trustworthy man true i said well go back for her said he with his eye on the horses and his foot on the crippled brake a dry gully was coming and no room to turn the farther side of it was terraced with rock we should simply fall backward if we did not fall forward first he steered the horses straight over and just at the bottom swung them with astonishing skill to the right along the hardbaked mud they took us along the bed up to the head of the gully and through a thicket of quaking asps the light trees bent beneath our charge and bastinadoed the wagon as it went over them but their branches enmeshed the horses legs and we came to a harmless standstill among a bower of leaves i looked at the trustworthy man and smiled vaguely he considered me for a moment i reckon said he youre feelin about halfway between oh lord and thank god thats quite it said i as he got down on the ground nothings broke said he after a searching examination and he indulged in a true virginian expletive gentlemen hush he murmured gently looking at me with his grave eyes one time i got pretty near scared you buck he continued some folks would beat you now till yud be uncertain whether yu was a hawss or a railroad accident id do it myself only it wouldnt cure yu i now told him that i supposed he had saved both our lives but he detested words of direct praise he made some grumbling rejoinder and led the horses out of the thicket buck he explained to me was a good horse and so was muggins both of them generally meant well and that was the judges reason for sending them to meet me but these broncos had their off days off days might not come very often but when the humor seized a bronco he had to have his spree buck would now behave himself as a horse should for probably two months they are just like humans the virginian concluded several cowboys arrived on a gallop to find how many pieces of us were left we returned down the hill and when we reached my trunk it was surprising to see the distance that our runaway had covered my hat was also found and we continued on our way buck and muggins were patterns of discretion through the rest of the mountains i thought when we camped this night that it was strange buck should be again allowed to graze at large instead of being tied to a rope while we slept but this was my ignorance with the hard work that he was gallantly doing the horse needed more pasture than a ropes length would permit him to find therefore he went free and in the morning gave us but little trouble in catching him we crossed a river in the forenoon and far to the north of us we saw the bow leg mountains pale in the bright sun sunk creek flowed from their western side and our two hundred and sixtythree miles began to grow a small thing in my eyes buck and muggins i think knew perfectly that tomorrow would see them home they recognized this region and once they turned off at a fork in the road the virginian pulled them back rather sharply want to go back to balaams he inquired of them i thought you had more sense i asked who was balaam a maltreater of hawsses replied the cowpuncher his ranch is on butte creek oveh yondeh and he pointed to where the diverging road melted into space the judge bought buck and muggins from him in the spring so he maltreats horses i repeated thats the word all through this country a man that will do what they claim balaam does to a hawss when hes mad aint fit to be called human the virginian told me some particulars oh i almost screamed at the horror of it and again oh hed have probly done that to buck as soon as he stopped runnin away if i caught a man doin that we were interrupted by a sedatelooking traveller riding upon an equally sober horse mawnin taylor said the virginian pulling up for gossip aint you strayed off your range pretty far youre a nice one replied mr taylor stopping his horse and smiling amiably tell me something i dont know retorted the virginian hold up a man at cards and rob him pursued mr taylor oh the news has got ahead of you trampas has been hyeh explainin has he said the virginian with a grin was that your victims name said mr taylor facetiously no it wasnt him that brought the news say what did you do anyway so that thing has got around murmured the virginian well it wasnt worth such wide repawtin and he gave the simple facts to taylor while i sat wondering at the contagious powers of rumor here through this voiceless land this desert this vacuum it had spread like a change of weather any news up your way the virginian concluded importance came into mr taylors countenance bear creek is going to build a schoolhouse said he goodness gracious drawled the virginian whats that for now mr taylor had been married for some years to educate the offspring of bear creek he answered with pride offspring of bear creek the virginian meditatively repeated i dont remember noticin much offspring there was some white tail deer and a right smart o jack rabbits the swintons have moved up from drybone said mr taylor always seriously they found it no place for young children and theres uncle carmody with six and ben dow and westfall has become a family man and jim westfall exclaimed the virginian him a famly man well if this hyeh territory is goin to get full o famly men and empty o game i believe ill get married yourself suggested mr taylor me i aint near reached the marriageable age no seh but uncle hughey has got there at last yu know uncle hughey shouted mr taylor he had not heard this rumor is very capricious therefore the virginian told him and the family man rocked in his saddle build your schoolhouse said the virginian uncle hughey has qualified himself to subscribe to all such propositions got your eye on a schoolmarm v enter the woman we are taking steps said mr taylor bear creek aint going to be hasty about a schoolmarm sure assented the virginian the children wouldnt want yu to hurry but mr taylor was as i have indicated a serious family man the problem of educating his children could appear to him in no light except a sober one bear creek he said dont want the experience they had over at calef we must not hire an ignoramus sure assented the virginian again nor we dont want no gadaway flirt said mr taylor she must keep her eyes on the blackboad said the virginian gently well we can wait till we get a guaranteed article said mr taylor and thats what were going to do it cant be this year and it neednt to be none of the kids is very old and the schoolhouse has got to be built he now drew a letter from his pocket and looked at me are you acquainted with miss mary stark wood of bennington vermont he inquired i was not acquainted with her at this time shes one we are thinking of shes a correspondent with mrs balaam taylor handed me the letter she wrote that to mrs balaam and mrs balaam said the best thing was for to let me see it and judge for myself im taking it back to mrs balaam maybe you can give me your opinion how it sizes up with the letters they write back east the communication was mainly of a business kind but also personal and freely written i do not think that its writer expected it to be exhibited as a document the writer wished very much that she could see the west but she could not gratify this desire merely for pleasure or she would long ago have accepted the kind invitation to visit mrs balaams ranch teaching school was something she would like to do if she were fitted for it since the mills failed the writer said we have all gone to work and done a lot of things so that mother might keep on living in the old house yes the salary would be a temptation but my dear isnt wyoming bad for the complexion and could i sue them if mine got damaged it is still admired i could bring one male witness at least to prove that then the writer became businesslike again even if she came to feel that she could leave home she did not at all know that she could teach school nor did she think it right to accept a position in which one had had no experience i do love children boys especially she went on my small nephew and i get on famously but imagine if a whole benchful of boys began asking me questions that i couldnt answer what should i do for one could not spank them all you know and mother says that i ought not to teach anybody spelling because i leave the u out of honor altogether it was a letter which i could assure mr taylor sized up very well with the letters written in my part of the united states and it was signed your very sincere spinster molly stark wood i never seen honor spelled with a u said mr taylor over whose not highly civilized head certain portions of the letter had lightly passed i told him that some oldfashioned people still wrote the word so either way would satisfy bear creek said mr taylor if shes otherwise up to requirements the virginian was now looking over the letter musingly and with awakened attention your very sincere spinster he read aloud slowly i guess that means shes forty said taylor i reckon she is about twenty said the virginian and again he fell to musing over the paper that he held her handwriting aint like any ive saw pursued mr taylor but bear creek would not object to that provided she knows rithmetic and george washington and them kind of things i expect she is not an awful sincere spinster surmised the virginian still looking at the letter still holding it as if it were some token has any botanist set down what the seed of love is has it anywhere been set down in how many ways this seed may be sown in what various vessels of gossamer it can float across wide spaces or upon what different soils it can fall and live unknown and bide its time for blooming the virginian handed back to taylor the sheet of note paper where a girl had talked as the women he had known did not talk if his eyes had ever seen such maidens there had been no meeting of eyes and if such maidens had ever spoken to him the speech was from an established distance but here was a free language altogether new to him it proved however not alien to his understanding as it was alien to mr taylors we drove onward a mile perhaps and then two he had lately been full of words but now he barely answered me so that a silence fell upon both of us it must have been all of ten miles that we had driven when he spoke of his own accord your real spinster dont speak of her lot that easy he remarked and presently he quoted a phrase about the complexion could i sue them if mine got damaged and he smiled over this to himself shaking his head what would she be doing on bear creek he next said and finally i reckon that witness will detain her in vermont and her motherll keep livin at the old house thus did the cowpuncher deliver himself not knowing at all that the seed had floated across wide spaces and was biding its time in his heart on the morrow we reached sunk creek judge henrys welcome and his wifes would have obliterated any hardships that i had endured and i had endured none at all for a while i saw little of the virginian he lapsed into his native way of addressing me occasionally as seh a habit entirely repudiated by this land of equality i was sorry our common peril during the runaway of buck and muggins had brought us to a familiarity that i hoped was destined to last but i think that it would not have gone farther save for a certain personage i must call her a personage and as i am indebted to her for gaining me a friend whose prejudice against me might never have been otherwise overcome i shall tell you her little story and how her misadventures and her fate came to bring the virginian and me to an appreciation of one another without her it is likely i should also not have heard so much of the story of the schoolmarm and how that lady at last came to bear creek vi emly my personage was a hen and she lived at the sunk creek ranch judge henrys ranch was notable for several luxuries he had milk for example in those days his brother ranchmen had thousands of cattle very often but not a drop of milk save the condensed variety therefore they had no butter the judge had plenty next rarest to butter and milk in the cattle country were eggs but my host had chickens whether this was because he had followed cockfighting in his early days or whether it was due to mrs henry i cannot say i only know that when i took a meal elsewhere i was likely to find nothing but the eternal sowbelly beans and coffee while at sunk creek the omelet and the custard were frequent the passing traveller was glad to tie his horse to the fence here and sit down to the judges table for its fame was as wide as wyoming it was an oasis in the territorys desolate billoffare the long fences of judge henrys home ranch began upon sunk creek soon after that stream emerged from its canyon through the bow leg it was a place always well cared for by the owner even in the days of his bachelorhood the placid regiments of cattle lay in the cool of the cottonwoods by the water or slowly moved among the sagebrush feeding upon the grass that in those forever departed years was plentiful and tall the steers came fat off his unenclosed range and fattened still more in his large pasture while his small pasture a field some eight miles square was for several seasons given to the judges horses and over this ample space there played and prospered the good colts which he raised from paladin his imported stallion after he married i have been assured that his wifes influence became visible in and about the house at once shade trees were planted flowers attempted and to the chickens was added the much more troublesome turkey i the visitor was pressed into service when i arrived green from the east i took hold of the farmyard and began building a better chicken house while the judge was off creating meadow land in his gray and yellow wilderness when any cowboy was unoccupied he would lounge over to my neighborhood and silently regard my carpentering those cowpunchers bore names of various denominations there was honey wiggin there was nebrasky and dollar bill and chalkeye and they came from farms and cities from maine and from california but the romance of american adventure had drawn them all alike to this great playground of young men and in their courage their generosity and their amusement at me they bore a close resemblance to each other each one would silently observe my achievements with the hammer and the chisel then he would retire to the bunkhouse and presently i would over hear laughter but this was only in the morning in the afternoon on many days of the summer which i spent at the sunk creek ranch i would go shooting or ride up toward the entrance of the canyon and watch the men working on the irrigation ditches pleasant systems of water running in channels were being led through the soil and there was a sound of rippling here and there among the yellow grain the green thick alfalfa grass waved almost it seemed of its own accord for the wind never blew and when at evening the sun lay against the plain the rift of the canyon was filled with a violet light and the bow leg mountains became transfigured with hues of floating and unimaginable color the sun shone in a sky where never a cloud came and noon was not too warm nor the dark too cool and so for two months i went through these pleasant uneventful days improving the chickens an object of mirth living in the open air and basking in the perfection of content i was justly styled a tenderfoot mrs henry had in the beginning endeavored to shield me from this humiliation but when she found that i was inveterate in laying my inexperience of western matters bare to all the world begging to be enlightened upon rattlesnakes prairiedogs owls blue and willow grouse sagehens how to rope a horse or tighten the front cinch of my saddle and that my spirit soared into enthusiasm at the mere sight of so ordinary an animal as a whitetailed deer she let me rush about with my firearms and made no further effort to stave off the ridicule that my blunders perpetually earned from the ranch hands her own humorous husband and any chance visitor who stopped for a meal or stayed the night i was not called by my name after the first feeble etiquette due to a stranger in his first few hours had died away i was known simply as the tenderfoot i was introduced to the neighborhood a circle of eighty miles as the tenderfoot it was thus that balaam the maltreater of horses learned to address me when he came a two days journey to pay a visit and it was this name and my notorious helplessness that bid fair to end what relations i had with the virginian for when judge henry ascertained that nothing could prevent me from losing myself that it was not uncommon for me to saunter out after breakfast with a gun and in thirty minutes cease to know north from south he arranged for my protection he detailed an escort for me and the escort was once more the trustworthy man the poor virginian was taken from his work and his comrades and set to playing nurse for me and for a while this humiliation ate into his untamed soul it was his lugubrious lot to accompany me in my rambles preside over my blunders and save me from calamitously passing into the next world he bore it in courteous silence except when speaking was necessary he would show me the lower ford which i could never find for myself generally mistaking a quicksand for it he would tie my horse properly he would recommend me not to shoot my rifle at a whitetailed deer in the particular moment that the outfit wagon was passing behind the animal on the further side of the brush there was seldom a day that he was not obliged to hasten and save me from sudden death or from ridicule which is worse yet never once did he lose his patience and his gentle slow voice and apparently lazy manner remained the same whether we were sitting at lunch together or up in the mountain during a hunt or whether he was bringing me back my horse which had run away because i had again forgotten to throw the reins over his head and let them trail hell always stand if yu do that the virginian would say see how my hawss stays right quiet yondeh after such admonition he would say no more to me but this tame nursery business was assuredly gall to him for though utterly a man in countenance and in his selfpossession and incapacity to be put at a loss he was still boyishly proud of his wild calling and wore his leather straps and jingled his spurs with obvious pleasure his tiger limberness and his beauty were rich with unabated youth and that force which lurked beneath his surface must often have curbed his intolerance of me in spite of what i knew must be his opinion of me the tenderfoot my liking for him grew and i found his silent company more and more agreeable that he had spells of talking i had already learned at medicine bow but his present taciturnity might almost have effaced this impression had i not happened to pass by the bunkhouse one evening after dark when honey wiggin and the rest of the cowboys were gathered inside it that afternoon the virginian and i had gone duck shooting we had found several in a beaver dam and i had killed two as they sat close together but they floated against the breastwork of sticks out in the water some four feet deep where the escaping current might carry them down the stream the judges red setter had not accompanied us because she was expecting a family we dont want her along anyways the cowpuncher had explained to me she runs around mighty irresponsible and shell stand a prairiedog bout as often as shell stand a bird shes a triflin animal my anxiety to own the ducks caused me to pitch into the water with all my clothes on and subsequently crawl out a slippery triumphant weltering heap the virginians serious eyes had rested upon this spectacle of mud but he expressed nothing as usual they aint overly good eatin he observed tying the birds to his saddle theyre divers divers i exclaimed why didnt they dive i reckon they was young ones and hadnt experience well i said crestfallen but attempting to be humorous i did the diving myself but the virginian made no comment he handed me my doublebarrelled english gun which i was about to leave deserted on the ground behind me and we rode home in our usual silence the mean little whitebreasted sharpbilled divers dangling from his saddle it was in the bunkhouse that he took his revenge as i passed i heard his gentle voice silently achieving some narrative to an attentive audience and just as i came by the open window where he sat on his bed in shirt and drawers his back to me i heard his concluding words and the hat on his haid was the one mark showed yu he werent a snappinturtle the anecdote met with instantaneous success and i hurried away into the dark the next morning i was occupied with the chickens two hens were fighting to sit on some eggs that a third was daily laying and which i did not want hatched and for the third time i had kicked emly off seven potatoes she had rolled together and was determined to raise i know not what sort of family from she was shrieking about the henhouse as the virginian came in to observe i suspect what i might be doing now that could be useful for him to mention in the bunkhouse he stood awhile and at length said we lost our best rooster when mrs henry came to live hyeh i paid no attention he was a right elegant dominicker he continued i felt a little riled about the snappingturtle and showed no interest in what he was saying but continued my functions among the hens this unusual silence of mine seemed to elicit unusual speech from him yu see that rooster hed always lived round hyeh when the judge was a bachelor and he never seen no ladies or any persons wearing female gyarments you aint got rheumatism seh me no i reckoned maybe them little odd divers yu got damp goin afteh he paused oh no not in the least thank you yu seemed sort o grave this mawnin and im certnly glad it aint them divers well the rooster i inquired finally oh him he werent raised where he could see petticoats mrs henry she come hyeh from the railroad with the judge afteh dark next mawnin early she walked out to view her new home and the rooster was afeedin by the door and he seen her well seh he screeched that awful i run out of the bunkhouse and he jus went over the fence and took down sunk creek shoutin fire right along he has never come back theres a hen over there now that has no judgment i said indicating emly she had got herself outside the house and was on the bars of a corral her vociferations reduced to an occasional squawk i told him about the potatoes i never knowed her name before said he that runaway rooster he hated her and she hated him same as she hates em all i named her myself said i after i came to notice her particularly theres an old maid at home whos charitable and belongs to the cruelty to animals and she never knows whether she had better cross in front of a street car or wait i named the hen after her does she ever lay eggs the virginian had not troubled his haid over the poultry well i dont believe she knows how i think she came near being a rooster shes sure manlylookin said the virginian we had walked toward the corral and he was now scrutinizing emly with interest she was an egregious fowl she was huge and gaunt with great yellow beak and she stood straight and alert in the manner of responsible people there was something wrong with her tail it slanted far to one side one feather in it twice as long as the rest feathers on her breast there were none these had been worn entirely off by her habit of sitting upon potatoes and other rough abnormal objects and this lent to her appearance an air of being decollete singularly at variance with her otherwise prudish ensemble her eye was remarkably bright but somehow it had an outraged expression it was as if she went about the world perpetually scandalized over the doings that fell beneath her notice her legs were blue long and remarkably stout shed ought to wear knickerbockers murmured the virginian shed look a heap better n some o them college students and shell set on potatoes yu say she thinks she can hatch out anything ive found her with onions and last tuesday i caught her on two balls of soap in the afternoon the tall cowpuncher and i rode out to get an antelope after an hour during which he was completely taciturn he said i reckon maybe this hyeh lonesome country aint been healthy for emly to live in it aint for some humans them old trappers in the mountains gets skewed in the haid mighty often an talks out loud when nobodys nigher n a hundred miles emly has not been solitary i replied there are forty chickens here thats so said he it dont explain her he fell silent again riding beside me easy and indolent in the saddle his long figure looked so loose and inert that the swift light spring he made to the ground seemed an impossible feat he had seen an antelope where i saw none take a shot yourself i urged him as he motioned me to be quick you never shoot when im with you i aint hyeh for that he answered now youve let him get away on yu the antelope had in truth departed why he said to my protest i can hit them things any day whats your notion as to emly i cant account for her i replied well he said musingly and then his mind took one of those particular turns that made me love him taylor ought to see her shed be just the schoolmarm for bear creek shes not much like the eatinghouse lady at medicine bow i said he gave a hilarious chuckle no emly knows nothing o them joys so yu have no notion about her well ive got one i reckon maybe she was hatched after a big thunderstorm in a big thunderstorm i exclaimed yes dont yu know about them and what theyll do to aiggs a big case o lightnin and thunder will addle aiggs and keep em from hatchin and i expect one came along and all the other aiggs of emlys set didnt hatch out but got plumb addled and she happened not to get addled that far and so she just managed to make it through but she certnly aint got a strong haid i fear she has not said i mighty honble intentions he observed if she cant make out to lay anything she wants to hatch somethin and be a mother anyways i wonder what relation the law considers that a hen is to the chicken she hatched but did not lay i inquired the virginian made no reply to this frivolous suggestion he was gazing over the wide landscape gravely and with apparent inattention he invariably saw game before i did and was off his horse and crouched among the sage while i was still getting my left foot clear of the stirrup i succeeded in killing an antelope and we rode home with the head and hind quarters no said he its sure the thunder and not the lonesomeness how do yu like the lonesomeness yourself i told him that i liked it i could not live without it now he said this has got into my system he swept his hand out at the vast space of world i went back home to see my folks onced mother was dyin slow and she wanted me i stayed a year but them virginia mountains could please me no more afteh she was gone i told my brothers and sisters goodby we like each other well enough but i reckon ill not go back we found emly seated upon a collection of green california peaches which the judge had brought from the railroad i dont mind her any more i said im sorry for her ive been sorry for her right along said the virginian she does hate the roosters so and he said that he was making a collection of every class of object which he found her treating as eggs but emlys eggindustry was terminated abruptly one morning and her unquestioned energies diverted to a new channel a turkey which had been sitting in the roothouse appeared with twelve children and a family of bantams occurred almost simultaneously emly was importantly scratching the soil inside paladins corral when the bantam tribe of newly born came by down the lane and she caught sight of them through the bars she crossed the corral at a run and intercepted two of the chicks that were trailing somewhat behind their real mamma these she undertook to appropriate and assumed a high tone with the bantam who was the smaller and hence obliged to retreat with her still numerous family i interfered and put matters straight but the adjustment was only temporary in an hour i saw emly immensely busy with two more bantams leading them about and taking a care of them which i must admit seemed perfectly efficient and now came the first incident that made me suspect her to be demented she had proceeded with her changelings behind the kitchen where one of the irrigation ditches ran under the fence from the hayfield to supply the house with water some distance along this ditch inside the field were the twelve turkeys in the short recently cut stubble again emly set off instantly like a deer she left the dismayed bantams behind her she crossed the ditch with one jump of her stout blue legs flew over the grass and was at once among the turkeys where with an instinct of maternity as undiscriminating as it was reckless she attempted to huddle some of them away but this other mamma was not a bantam and in a few moments emly was entirely routed in her attempt to acquire a new variety of family this spectacle was witnessed by the virginian and myself and it overcame him he went speechless across to the bunkhouse by himself and sat on his bed while i took the abandoned bantams back to their own circle i have often wondered what the other fowls thought of all this some impression it certainly did make upon them the notion may seem out of reason to those who have never closely attended to other animals than man but i am convinced that any community which shares some of our instincts will share some of the resulting feelings and that birds and beasts have conventions the breach of which startles them if there be anything in evolution this would seem inevitable at all events the chickenhouse was upset during the following several days emly disturbed now the bantams and now the turkeys and several of these latter had died though i will not go so far as to say that this was the result of her misplaced attentions nevertheless i was seriously thinking of locking her up till the broods should be a little older when another event happened and all was suddenly at peace the judges setter came in one morning wagging her tail she had had her puppies and she now took us to where they were housed in between the floor of a building and the hollow ground emly was seated on the whole litter no i said to the judge i am not surprised she is capable of anything in her new choice of offspring this hen had at length encountered an unworthy parent the setter was bored by her own puppies she found the hole under the house an obscure and monotonous residence compared with the dining room and our company more stimulating and sympathetic than that of her children a muchpetted contact with our superior race had developed her dog intelligence above its natural level and turned her into an unnatural neglectful mother who was constantly forgetting her nursery for worldly pleasures at certain periods of the day she repaired to the puppies and fed them but came away when this perfunctory ceremony was accomplished and she was glad enough to have a governess bring them up she made no quarrel with emly and the two understood each other perfectly i have never seen among animals any arrangement so civilized and so perverted it made emly perfectly happy to see her sitting all day jealously spreading her wings over some blind puppies was sufficiently curious but when they became large enough to come out from under the house and toddle about in the proud hens wake i longed for some distinguished naturalist i felt that our ignorance made us inappropriate spectators of such a phenomenon emly scratched and clucked and the puppies ran to her pawed her with their fat limp little legs and retreated beneath her feathers in their games of hide and seek conceive if you can what confusion must have reigned in their infant minds as to who the setter was i reckon they think shes the wetnurse said the virginian when the puppies grew to be boisterous i perceived that emlys mission was approaching its end they were too heavy for her and their increasing scope of playfulness was not in her line once or twice they knocked her over upon which she arose and pecked them severely and they retired to a safe distance and sitting in a circle yapped at her i think they began to suspect that she was only a hen after all so emly resigned with an indifference which surprised me until i remembered that if it had been chickens she would have ceased to look after them by this time but here she was again out of a job as the virginian said shes raised them puppies for that triflin setter and now shell be huntin around for something else useful to do that aint in her business now there were other broods of chickens to arrive in the henhouse and i did not desire any more bantam and turkey performances so to avoid confusion i played a trick upon emly i went down to sunk creek and fetched some smooth oval stones she was quite satisfied with these and passed a quiet day with them in a box this was not fair the virginian asserted you aint going to jus leave her fooled that away i did not see why not why she raised them puppies all right aint she showed she knows how to be a mother anyways emly aint going to get her time took up for nothing while im round hyeh said the cowpuncher he laid a gentle hold of emly and tossed her to the ground she of course rushed out among the corrals in a great state of nerves i dont see what good you do meddling i protested to this he deigned no reply but removed the unresponsive stones from the straw why if they aint right warm he exclaimed plaintively the poor deluded sonofagun and with this unusual description of a lady he sent the stones sailing like a line of birds im regular getting stuck on emly continued the virginian yu neednt to laugh dont yu see shes got sort o human feelins and desires i always knowed hawsses was like people and my collie of course it is kind of foolish i expect but that hens goin to have a real aigg directly right now to set on with this he removed one from beneath another hen well have emly raise this hyeh said he so she can put in her time profitable it was not accomplished at once for emly singularly enough would not consent to stay in the box whence she had been routed at length we found another retreat for her and in these new surroundings with a new piece of work for her to do emly sat on the one egg which the virginian had so carefully provided for her thus as in all genuine tragedies was the stroke of fate wrought by chance and the best intentions emly began sitting on friday afternoon near sundown early next morning my sleep was gradually dispersed by a sound unearthly and continuous now it dwindled receding to a distance again it came near took a turn drifted to the other side of the house then evidently whatever it was passed my door close and i jumped upright in my bed the high tense strain of vibration nearly but not quite a musical note was like the threatening scream of machinery though weaker and i bounded out of the house in my pajamas there was emly dishevelled walking wildly about her one egg miraculously hatched within ten hours the little lonely yellow ball of down went cheeping along behind following its mother as best it could what then had happened to the established period of incubation for an instant the thing was like a portent and i was near joining emly in her horrid surprise when i saw how it all was the virginian had taken an egg from a hen which had already been sitting for three weeks i dressed in haste hearing emlys distracted outcry it steadily sounded without perceptible pause for breath and marked her erratic journey back and forth through stables lanes and corrals the shrill disturbance brought all of us out to see her and in the henhouse i discovered the new brood making its appearance punctually but this natural explanation could not be made to the crazed hen she continued to scour the premises her slant tail and its one preposterous feather waving as she aimlessly went her stout legs stepping high with an unnatural motion her head lifted nearly off her neck and in her brilliant yellow eye an expression of more than outrage at this overturning of a natural law behind her entirely ignored and neglected trailed the little progeny she never looked at it we went about our various affairs and all through the clear sunny day that unending metallic scream pervaded the premises the virginian put out food and water for her but she tasted nothing i am glad to say that the little chicken did i do not think that the hens eyes could see except in the way that sleepwalkers do the heat went out of the air and in the canyon the violet light began to show many hours had gone but emly never ceased now she suddenly flew up in a tree and sat there with her noise still going but it had risen lately several notes into a slim acute level of terror and was not like machinery any more nor like any sound i ever heard before or since below the tree stood the bewildered little chicken cheeping and making tiny jumps to reach its mother yes said the virginian its comical even her aigg acted different from anybody elses he paused and looked across the wide mellowing plain with the expression of easygoing gravity so common with him then he looked at emly in the tree and the yellow chicken it aint so damned funny said he we went in to supper and i came out to find the hen lying on the ground dead i took the chicken to the family in the henhouse no it was not altogether funny any more and i did not think less of the virginian when i came upon him surreptitiously digging a little hole in the field for her i have buried some citizens here and there said he that i have respected less and when the time came for me to leave sunk creek my last word to the virginian was dont forget emly i aint likely to responded the cowpuncher she is just one o them parables save when he fell into his native idioms which they told me his wanderings had wellnigh obliterated until that years visit to his home again revived them in his speech he had now for a long while dropped the seh and all other barriers between us we were thorough friends and had exchanged many confidences both of the flesh and of the spirit he even went the length of saying that he would write me the sunk creek news if i would send him a line now and then i have many letters from him now their spelling came to be faultless and in the beginning was little worse than george washingtons the judge himself drove me to the railroad by another way across the bow leg mountains and south through balaams ranch and drybone to rock creek ill be very homesick i told him come and pull the latchstring whenever you please he bade me i wished that i might no lotus land ever cast its spell upon mans heart more than wyoming had enchanted mine vii through two snows dear friend thus in the spring the virginian wrote me yours received it must be a poor thing to be sick that time i was shot at canada de oro would have made me sick if it had been a littel lower or if i was much of a drinking man you will be well if you give over city life and take a hunt with me about august or say september for then the elk will be out of the velvett things do not please me here just now and i am going to settel it by vamosing but i would be glad to see you it would be pleasure not business for me to show you plenty elk and get you strong i am not crybabying to the judge or making any kick about things he will want me back after he has swallowed a litter tincture of time it is the best dose i know now to answer your questions yes the emmily hen might have ate loco weed if hens do i never saw anything but stock and horses get poisoned with loco weed no the school is not built yet they are always big talkers on bear creek no i have not seen steve he is around but i am sorry for him yes i have been to medicine bow i had the welcom i wanted do you remember a man i played poker and he did not like it he is working on the upper ranch near ten sleep he does not amount to a thing except with weaklings uncle hewie has twins the boys got him vexed some about it but i think they are his now that is all i know today and i would like to see you poco presently as they say at los cruces theres no sense in you being sick the rest of this letter discussed the best meeting point for us should i decide to join him for a hunt that hunt was made and during the weeks of its duration something was said to explain a little more fully the virginians difficulty at the sunk creek ranch and his reason for leaving his excellent employer the judge not much was said to be sure the virginian seldom spent many words upon his own troubles but it appeared that owing to some jealousy of him on the part of the foreman or the assistant foreman he found himself continually doing another mans work but under circumstances so skilfully arranged that he got neither credit nor pay for it he would not stoop to telling tales out of school therefore his ready and prophetic mind devised the simple expedient of going away altogether he calculated that judge henry would gradually perceive there was a connection between his departure and the cessation of the satisfactory work after a judicious interval it was his plan to appear again in the neighborhood of sunk creek and await results concerning steve he would say no more than he had written but it was plain that for some cause this friendship had ceased money for his services during the hunt he positively declined to accept asserting that he had not worked enough to earn his board and the expedition ended in an untravelled corner of the yellowstone park near pitchstone canyon where he and young lin mclean and others were witnesses of a sad and terrible drama that has been elsewhere chronicled his prophetic mind had foreseen correctly the shape of events at sunk creek the only thing that it had not foreseen was the impression to be made upon the judges mind by his conduct toward the close of that winter judge and mrs henry visited the east through them a number of things became revealed the virginian was back at sunk creek and said mrs henry he would never have left you if i had had my way judge h no madam judge retorted her husband i am aware of that for you have always appreciated a fine appearance in a man i certainly have confessed the lady mirthfully and the way he used to come bringing my horse with the ridges of his black hair so carefully brushed and that blue spotted handkerchief tied so effectively round his throat was something that i missed a great deal after he went away thank you my dear for this warning i have plans that will keep him absent quite constantly for the future and then they spoke less flightily i always knew said the lady that you had found a treasure when that man came the judge laughed when it dawned on me he said how cleverly he caused me to learn the value of his services by depriving me of them i doubted whether it was safe to take him back safe cried mrs henry safe my dear because im afraid he is pretty nearly as shrewd as i am and thats rather dangerous in a subordinate the judge laughed again but his action regarding the man they call steve has made me feel easy and then it came out that the virginian was supposed to have discovered in some way that steve had fallen from the grace of that particular honesty which respects another mans cattle it was not known for certain but calves had begun to disappear in cattle land and cows had been found killed and calves with one brand upon them had been found with mothers that bore the brand of another owner this industry was taking root in cattle land and of those who practised it some were beginning to be suspected steve was not quite fully suspected yet but that the virginian had parted company with him was definitely known and neither man would talk about it there was the further news that the bear creek schoolhouse at length stood complete floor walls and roof and that a lady from bennington vermont a friend of mrs balaams had quite suddenly decided that she would try her hand at instructing the new generation the judge and mrs henry knew this because mrs balaam had told them of her disappointment that she would be absent from the ranch on butte creek when her friend arrived and therefore unable to entertain her the friends decision had been quite suddenly made and must form the subject of the next chapter viii the sincere spinster i do not know with which of the two estimates mr taylors or the virginians you agreed did you think that miss mary stark wood of bennington vermont was forty years of age that would have been an error at the time she wrote the letter to mrs balaam of which letter certain portions have been quoted in these pages she was in her twentyfirst year or to be more precise she had been twenty some eight months previous now it is not usual for young ladies of twenty to contemplate a journey of nearly two thousand miles to a country where indians and wild animals live unchained unless they are to make such journey in company with a protector or are going to a protectors arms at the other end nor is school teaching on bear creek a usual ambition for such young ladies but miss mary stark wood was not a usual young lady for two reasons first there was her descent had she so wished she could have belonged to any number of those patriotic societies of which our american ears have grown accustomed to hear so much she could have been enrolled in the boston tea party the ethan allen ticonderogas the green mountain daughters the saratoga sacred circle and the confederated colonial chatelaines she traced direct descent from the historic lady whose name she bore that molly stark who was not a widow after the battle where her lord her captain john battled so bravely as to send his name thrilling down through the blood of generations of schoolboys this ancestress was her chief claim to be a member of those shining societies which i have enumerated but she had been willing to join none of them although invitations to do so were by no means lacking i cannot tell you her reason still i can tell you this when these societies were much spoken of in her presence her very sprightly countenance became more sprightly and she added her words of praise or respect to the general chorus but when she received an invitation to join one of these bodies her countenance as she read the missive would assume an expression which was known to her friends as sticking her nose in the air i do not think that mollys reason for refusing to join could have been a truly good one i should add that her most precious possession a treasure which accompanied her even if she went away for only one nights absence was an heirloom a little miniature portrait of the old molly stark painted when that faroff dame must have been scarce more than twenty and when each summer the young molly went to dunbarton new hampshire to pay her established family visit to the last survivors of her connection who bore the name of stark no word that she heard in the dunbarton houses pleased her so much as when a certain greataunt would take her by the hand and after looking with fond intentness at her pronounce my dear youre getting more like the generals wife every year you live i suppose you mean my nose molly would then reply nonsense child you have the family length of nose and ive never heard that it has disgraced us but i dont think im tall enough for it there now run to your room and dress for tea the starks have always been punctual and after this annual conversation molly would run to her room and there in its privacy even at the risk of falling below the punctuality of the starks she would consult two objects for quite a minute before she began to dress these objects as you have already correctly guessed were the miniature of the generals wife and the looking glass so much for miss molly stark woods descent the second reason why she was not a usual girl was her character this character was the result of pride and family pluck battling with family hardship just one year before she was to be presented to the world not the great metropolitan world but a world that would have made her welcome and done her homage at its little dances and little dinners in troy and rutland and burlington fortune had turned her back upon the woods their possessions had never been great ones but they had sufficed from generation to generation the family had gone to school like gentlefolk dressed like gentlefolk used the speech and ways of gentlefolk and as gentlefolk lived and died and now the mills failed instead of thinking about her first evening dress molly found pupils to whom she could give music lessons she found handkerchiefs that she could embroider with initials and she found fruit that she could make into preserves that machine called the typewriter was then in existence but the day of women typewriters had as yet scarcely begun to dawn else i think molly would have preferred this occupation to the handkerchiefs and the preserves there were people in bennington who wondered how miss wood could go about from house to house teaching the piano and she a lady there always have been such people i suppose because the world must always have a rubbish heap but we need not dwell upon them further than to mention one other remark of theirs regarding molly they all with one voice declared that sam bannett was good enough for anybody who did fancy embroidery at five cents a letter i dare say he had a greatgrandmother quite as good as hers remarked mrs flynt the wife of the baptist minister thats entirely possible returned the episcopal rector of hoosic only we dont happen to know who she was the rector was a friend of mollys after this little observation mrs flynt said no more but continued her purchases in the store where she and the rector had happened to find themselves together later she stated to a friend that she had always thought the episcopal church a snobbish one and now she knew it so public opinion went on being indignant over mollys conduct she could stoop to work for money and yet she pretended to hold herself above the most rising young man in hoosic falls and all just because there was a difference in their grandmothers was this the reason at the bottom of it the very bottom i cannot be certain because i have never been a girl myself perhaps she thought that work is not a stooping and that marriage may be perhaps but all i really know is that molly wood continued cheerfully to embroider the handkerchiefs make the preserves teach the pupils and firmly to reject sam bannett thus it went on until she was twenty there certain members of her family began to tell her how rich sam was going to be was indeed already it was at this time that she wrote mrs balaam her doubts and her desires as to migrating to bear creek it was at this time also that her face grew a little paler and her friends thought that she was overworked and mrs flynt feared she was losing her looks it was at this time too that she grew very intimate with that greataunt over at dunbarton and from her received much comfort and strengthening never said the old lady especially if you cant love him i do like him said molly and he is very kind never said the old lady again when i die youll have something and that will not be long now molly flung her arms around her aunt and stopped her words with a kiss and then one winter afternoon two years later came the last straw the front door of the old house had shut out of it had stepped the persistent suitor mrs flynt watched him drive away in his smart sleigh that girl is a fool she said furiously and she came away from her bedroom window where she had posted herself for observation inside the old house a door had also shut this was the door of mollys own room and there she sat in floods of tears for she could not bear to hurt a man who loved her with all the power of love that was in him it was about twilight when her door opened and an elderly lady came softly in my dear she ventured and you were not able oh mother cried the girl have you come to say that too the next day miss wood had become very hard in three weeks she had accepted the position on bear creek in two months she started heartheavy but with a spirit craving the unknown ix the spinster meets the unknown on a monday noon a small company of horsemen strung out along the trail from sunk creek to gather cattle over their allotted sweep of range spring was backward and they as they rode galloping and gathering upon the cold weeks work cursed cheerily and occasionally sang the virginian was grave in bearing and of infrequent speech but he kept a song going a matter of some seventynine verses seventyeight were quite unprintable and rejoiced his brother cowpunchers monstrously they knowing him to be a singular man forebore ever to press him and awaited his own humor lest he should weary of the lyric and when after a day of silence apparently saturnine he would lift his gentle voice and begin if you go to monkey with my looloo girl ill tell you what ill do ill cyarve your heart with my razor and ill shoot you with my pistol too then they would stridently take up each last line and keep it going three four ten times and kick holes in the ground to the swing of it by the levels of bear creek that reach like inlets among the promontories of the lonely hills they came upon the schoolhouse roofed and ready for the first native wyoming crop it symbolized the dawn of a neighborhood and it brought a change into the wilderness air the feel of it struck cold upon the free spirits of the cowpunchers and they told each other that what with women and children and wire fences this country would not long be a country for men they stopped for a meal at an old comrades they looked over his gate and there he was pattering among garden furrows pickin nosegays inquired the virginian and the old comrade asked if they could not recognize potatoes except in the dish but he grinned sheepishly at them too because they knew that he had not always lived in a garden then he took them into his house where they saw an object crawling on the floor with a handful of sulphur matches he began to remove the matches but stopped in alarm at the vociferous result and his wife looked in from the kitchen to caution him about humoring little christopher when she beheld the matches she was aghast but when she saw her baby grow quiet in the arms of the virginian she smiled at that cowpuncher and returned to her kitchen then the virginian slowly spoke again how many little strangers have yu got james only two my aint it most three years since yu maried yu mustnt let time creep ahaid o yu james the father once more grinned at his guests who themselves turned sheepish and polite for mrs westfall came in brisk and hearty and set the meat upon the table after that it was she who talked the guests ate scrupulously muttering yes maam and no maam in their plates while their hostess told them of increasing families upon bear creek and the expected schoolteacher and little alfreds early teething and how it was time for all of them to become husbands like james the bachelors of the saddle listened always diffident but eating heartily to the end and soon after they rode away in a thoughtful clump the wives of bear creek were few as yet and the homes scattered the schoolhouse was only a sprig on the vast face of a world of elk and bear and uncertain indians but that night when the earth near the fire was littered with the cowpunchers beds the virginian was heard drawling to himself alfred and christopher oh sugar they found pleasure in the delicately chosen shade of this oath he also recited to them a new verse about how he took his looloo girl to the schoolhouse for to learn her a b c and as it was quite original and unprintable the camp laughed and swore joyfully and rolled in its blankets to sleep under the stars upon a monday noon likewise for things will happen so some tearful people in petticoats waved handkerchiefs at a train that was just leaving bennington vermont a girls face smiled back at them once and withdrew quickly for they must not see the smile die away she had with her a little money a few clothes and in her mind a rigid determination neither to be a burden to her mother nor to give in to that mothers desires absence alone would enable her to carry out this determination beyond these things she possessed not much except spellingbooks a colonial miniature and that craving for the unknown which has been mentioned if the ancestors that we carry shut up inside us take turns in dictating to us our actions and our state of mind undoubtedly grandmother stark was empress of mollys spirit upon this monday at hoosic junction which came soon she passed the uptrain bound back to her home and seeing the engineer and the conductor faces that she knew well her courage nearly failed her and she shut her eyes against this glimpse of the familiar things that she was leaving to keep herself steady she gripped tightly a little bunch of flowers in her hand but something caused her eyes to open and there before her stood sam bannett asking if he might accompany her so far as rotterdam junction no she told him with a severity born from the struggle she was making with her grief not a mile with me not to eagle bridge goodby and sam what did he do he obeyed her i should like to be sorry for him but obedience was not a lovers part here he hesitated the golden moment hung hovering the conductor cried all aboard the train went and there on the platform stood obedient sam with his golden moment gone like a butterfly after rotterdam junction which was some forty minutes farther molly wood sat bravely up in the through car dwelling upon the unknown she thought that she had attained it in ohio on tuesday morning and wrote a letter about it to bennington on wednesday afternoon she felt sure and wrote a letter much more picturesque but on the following day after breakfast at north platte nebraska she wrote a very long letter indeed and told them that she had seen a black pig on a white pile of buffalo bones catching drops of water in the air as they fell from the railroad tank she also wrote that trees were extraordinarily scarce each hour westward from the pig confirmed this opinion and when she left the train at rock creek late upon that fourth night in those days the trains were slower she knew that she had really attained the unknown and sent an expensive telegram to say that she was quite well at six in the morning the stage drove away into the sagebrush with her as its only passenger and by sundown she had passed through some of the primitive perils of the world the second team virgin to harness and displeased with this novelty tried to take it off and went down to the bottom of a gully on its eight hind legs while miss wood sat mute and unflinching beside the driver therefore he when it was over and they on the proper road again invited her earnestly to be his wife during many of the next fifteen miles and told her of his snug cabin and his horses and his mine then she got down and rode inside independence and grandmother stark shining in her eye at point of rocks where they had supper and his drive ended her face distracted his heart and he told her once more about his cabin and lamentably hoped she would remember him she answered sweetly that she would try and gave him her hand after all he was a franklooking boy who had paid her the highest compliment that a boy or a man for that matter knows and it is said that molly stark in her day was not a new woman the new driver banished the first one from the maidens mind he was not a franklooking boy and he had been taking whiskey all night long he took it while his passenger helpless and sleepless inside the lurching stage sat as upright as she possibly could nor did the voices that she heard at drybone reassure her sunrise found the white stage lurching eternally on across the alkali with a driver and a bottle on the box and a pale girl staring out at the plain and knotting in her handkerchief some utterly dead flowers they came to a river where the man bungled over the ford two wheels sank down over an edge and the canvas toppled like a descending kite the ripple came sucking through the upper spokes and as she felt the seat careen she put out her head and tremulously asked if anything was wrong but the driver was addressing his team with much language and also with the lash then a tall rider appeared close against the buried axles and took her out of the stage on his horse so suddenly that she screamed she felt splashes saw a swimming flood and found herself lifted down upon the shore the rider said something to her about cheering up and its being all right but her wits were stockstill so she did not speak and thank him after four days of train and thirty hours of stage she was having a little too much of the unknown at once then the tall man gently withdrew leaving her to become herself again she limply regarded the river pouring round the slanted stage and a number of horsemen with ropes who righted the vehicle and got it quickly to dry land and disappeared at once with a herd of cattle uttering lusty yells she saw the tall one delaying beside the driver and speaking he spoke so quietly that not a word reached her until of a sudden the driver protested loudly the man had thrown something which turned out to be a bottle this twisted loftily and dived into the stream he said something more to the driver then put his hand on the saddlehorn looked halflingeringly at the passenger on the bank dropped his grave eyes from hers and swinging upon his horse was gone just as the passenger opened her mouth and with inefficient voice murmured oh thank you at his departing back the driver drove up now a chastened creature he helped miss wood in and inquired after her welfare with a hanging head then meek as his own drenched horses he climbed back to his reins and nursed the stage on toward the bow leg mountains much as if it had been a perambulator as for miss wood she sat recovering and she wondered what the man on the horse must think of her she knew that she was not ungrateful and that if he had given her an opportunity she would have explained to him if he supposed that she did not appreciate his act here into the midst of these meditations came an abrupt memory that she had screamed she could not be sure when she rehearsed the adventure from the beginning and found one or two further uncertainties how it had all been while she was on the horse for instance it was confusing to determine precisely what she had done with her arms she knew where one of his arms had been and the handkerchief with the flowers was gone she made a few rapid dives in search of it had she or had she not seen him putting something in his pocket and why had she behaved so unlike herself in a few miles miss wood entertained sentiments of maidenly resentment toward her rescuer and of maidenly hope to see him again to that river crossing he came again alone when the days were growing short the ford was dry sand and the stream a winding lane of shingle he found a pool pools always survive the year round in this stream and having watered his pony he lunched near the spot to which he had borne the frightened passenger that day where the flowing current had been he sat regarding the now extremely safe channel she certnly wouldnt need to grip me so close this mawnin he said as he pondered over his meal i reckon it will mightily astonish her when i tell her how harmless the torrent is lookin he held out to his pony a slice of bread matted with sardines which the pony expertly accepted youre a plumb piebiter you monte he continued monte rubbed his nose on his masters shoulder i wouldnt trust you with berries and cream no seh not though yu did rescue a drownin lady presently he tightened the forward cinch got in the saddle and the pony fell into his wise mechanical jog for he had come a long way and was going a long way and he knew this as well as the man did to use the language of cattle land steers had jumped to seventyfive this was a great and prosperous leap in their value to have flourished in that golden time you need not be dead now nor even middleaged but it is wyoming mythology already quite as fabulous as the highjumping cow indeed people gathered together and behaved themselves much in the same pleasant and improbable way johnson county and natrona and converse and others to say nothing of the cheyenne club had been jumping over the moon for some weeks all on account of steers and on the strength of this vigorous price of seventyfive the stanton brothers were giving a barbecue at the goose egg outfit their ranch on bear creek of course the whole neighborhood was bidden and would come forty miles to a man some would come further the virginian was coming a hundred and eighteen it had struck him rather suddenly as shall be made plain that he should like to see how they were getting along up there on bear creek they was how he put it to his acquaintances his acquaintances did not know that he had bought himself a pair of trousers and a scarf unnecessarily excellent for such a general visit they did not know that in the spring two days after the adventure with the stage he had learned accidentally who the lady in the stage was this he had kept to himself nor did the camp ever notice that he had ceased to sing that eightieth stanza he had made about the a b c the stanza which was not printable he effaced it imperceptibly giving the boys the other seventynine at judicious intervals they dreamed of no guile but merely saw in him whether frequenting camp or town the same not overangelic comrade whom they valued and could not wholly understand all spring he had ridden trail worked at ditches during summer and now he had just finished with the beef roundup yesterday while he was spending a little comfortable money at the drybone hogranch a casual traveller from the north gossiped of bear creek and the fences up there and the farm crops the westfalls and the young schoolmarm from vermont for whom the taylors had built a cabin next door to theirs the traveller had not seen her but mrs taylor and all the ladies thought the world of her and lin mclean had told him she was away up in g she would have plenty of partners at this swinton barbecue great boon for the country wasnt it steers jumping that way the virginian heard asking no questions and left town in an hour with the scarf and trousers tied in his slicker behind his saddle after looking upon the ford again even though it was dry and not at all the same place he journeyed in attentively when you have been hard at work for months with no time to think of course you think a great deal during your first empty days step along you monte hawss he said rousing after some while he disciplined monte who flattened his ears affectedly and snorted why you surely ain thinkin of youself as a hero she wasnt really adrowndin you piebiter he rested his serious glance upon the alkali shes not likely to have forgot that mixup though i guess ill not remind her about grippin me and all that she wasnt the kind a man ought to josh about such things she had a right clear eye thus tall and loose in the saddle did he jog along the sixty miles which still lay between him and the dance x where fancy was bred two camps in the open and the virginians monte horse untired brought him to the swintons in good time for the barbecue the horse received good food at length while his rider was welcomed with good whiskey good whiskey for had not steers jumped to seventyfive inside the goose egg kitchen many small delicacies were preparing and a steer was roasting whole outside the bed of flame under it showed steadily brighter against the dusk that was beginning to veil the lowlands the busy hosts went and came while men stood and men lay near the fireglow chalkeye was there and nebrasky and trampas and honey wiggin with others enjoying the occasion but honey wiggin was enjoying himself he had an audience he was sitting up discoursing to it hello he said perceiving the virginian so youve dropped in for your turn number six aint he boys depends whos arunnin the countin said the virginian and stretched himself down among the audience ive saw him number one when nobody else was around said trampas how far away was you standin when you beheld that inquired the lounging southerner well boys said wiggin i expect it will be miss schoolmarm says whos number one tonight so shes arrived in this hyeh country observed the virginian very casually arrived said trampas again where have you been grazing lately a right smart way from the mules nebrasky and the boys was tellin me theyd missed yu off the range again interposed wiggin say nebrasky who have yu offered your canary to the schoolmarm said you mustnt give her nebrasky grinned wretchedly well shes a lady and shes square not takin a mans gift when she dont take the man but youd ought to get back all them letters yu wrote her yu sure ought to ask her for them telltales ah pshaw honey protested the youth it was well known that he could not write his name why if here aint bokay baldy cried the agile wiggin stooping to fresh prey found them slippers yet baldy tell yu boys that was turruble sad luck baldy had did yu hear about that baldy yu know he can stay on a tame horse most as well as the schoolmarm but just you give him a pair of young knittinneedles and see him make em sweat he worked an elegant pair of slippers with pink cabbages on em for miss wood i bought em at medicine bow blundered baldy so yu did assented the skilful comedian baldy he bought em and on the road to her cabin there at the taylors he got thinkin they might be too big and he got studyin what to do and he fixed up to tell her about his not bein sure of the size and how she was to let him know if they dropped off her and hed exchange em and when he got right near her door why he couldnt find his courage and so he slips the parcel under the fence and starts serenadin her but she aint inside her cabin at all shes at supper next door with the taylors and baldy singin love has conqwered pride and angwer to a lone house lin mclean was comin up by taylors corral where taylors texas bull was well it was turruble sad baldys pants got tore but he fell inside the fence and lin druv the bull back and somebody stole them medicine bow galoshes are you goin to knit her some more bokay about half that aint straight baldy commented with mildness the half that was tore off yer pants well never mind baldy lin will get left too same as all of yu is there many inquired the virginian he was still stretched on his back looking up at the sky i dont know how many shes been used to where she was raised wiggin answered a kid stagedriver come from point of rocks one day and went back the next then the foreman of the outfit and the horsewrangler from the barcirclel and two deputy marshals with punchers stringin right along all got their tumble old judge burrage from cheyenne come up in august for a hunt and stayed round here and never hunted at all there was that horse thief awful goodlookin taylor wanted to warn her about him but mrs taylor said shed look after her if it was needed mr horsethief gave it up quicker than most but the schoolmarm couldnt have knowed he had a mrs horsethief camped on poison spider till afterwards she wouldnt go ridin with him shell go with some takin a kid along bah said trampas the virginian stopped looking at the sky and watched trampas from where he lay i think she encourages a man some said poor nebrasky encourages because she lets yu teach her how to shoot said wiggin well i dont guess im a judge ive always kind o kep away from them good women dont seem to think of anything to chat about to em the only folks id say she encourages is the school kids she kisses them riding and shooting and kissing the kids sneered trampas thats a heap too pussykitten for me they laughed the sagebrush audience is readily cynical look for the man i say trampas pursued and aint he there she leaves baldy sit on the fence while she and lin mclean they laughed loudly at the blackguard picture which he drew and the laugh stopped short for the virginian stood over trampas you can rise up now and tell them you lie he said the man was still for a moment in the dead silence i thought you claimed you and her wasnt acquainted said he then stand on your laigs you polecat and say youre a liar trampass hand moved behind him quit that said the southerner or ill break your neck the eye of a man is the prince of deadly weapons trampas looked in the virginians and slowly rose i didnt mean he began and paused his face poisonously bloated well ill call that sufficient keep astandin still i ain going to trouble yu long in admittin yourself to be a liar you have spoke gods truth for onced honey wiggin you and me and the boys have hit town too frequent for any of us to play sunday on the balance of the gang he stopped and surveyed public opinion seated around in carefully inexpressive attention we aint a christian outfit a little bit and maybe we have most forgotten what decency feels like but i reckon we havent forgot what it means you can sit down now if you want the liar stood and sneered experimentally looking at public opinion but this changeful deity was no longer with him and he heard it variously assenting thats so and shes a lady and otherwise excellently moralizing so he held his peace when however the virginian had departed to the roasting steer and public opinion relaxed into that comfort which we all experience when the sermon ends trampas sat down amid the reviving cheerfulness and ventured again to be facetious shut your rank mouth said wiggin to him amiably i dont care whether he knows her or if he done it on principle ill accept the roundin up he gave us and say youll swallo your dose too us boysll stand in with him in this so trampas swallowed and what of the virginian he had championed the feeble and spoken honorably in meeting and according to all the constitutions and bylaws of morality he should have been walking in virtues especial calm but there it was he had spoken he had given them a peep through the keyhole at his inner man and as he prowled away from the assemblage before whom he stood convicted of decency it was vicious rather than virtuous that he felt other matters also disquieted him so lin mclean was hanging round that schoolmarm yet he joined ben swinton in a seemingly christian spirit he took some whiskey and praised the size of the barrel speaking with his host like this there certnly ain goin to be trouble about a second helpin hope not wed ought to have more trimmings though were shy on ducks yu have the barrel has lin mclean seen that no we tried for ducks away down as far as the laparel outfit a real barbecue theres large thirsts on bear creek lin mclean will pass on ducks lins not thirsty this month signed for one month has he signed hes spooning our schoolmarm they claim shes a right sweetfaced girl yes yes awful agreeable and next thing youre fooled clean through yu dont say she keeps ateaching the darned kids and it seems like a good growedup man cant interest her yu dont say there used to be all the ducks you wanted at the laparel but their fool cooks dead stuck on raising turkeys this year that must have been mighty close to a drowndin the schoolmarm got at south fork why i guess not when shes never spoken of any such thing that ive heard mos likely the stagedriver got it wrong then yes must have drownded somebody else here they come thats her ridin the horse theres the westfalls where are you running to to fix up got any soap around hyeh yes shouted swinton for the virginian was now some distance away towels and everything in the dugout and he went to welcome his first formal guests the virginian reached his saddle under a shed so shes never mentioned it said he untying his slicker for the trousers and scarf i didnt notice lin anywheres around her he was over in the dugout now whipping off his overalls and soon he was excellently clean and ready except for the tie in his scarf and the part in his hair id have knowed her in greenland he remarked he held the candle up and down at the lookingglass and the lookingglass up and down at his head its mighty strange why she aint mentioned that he worried the scarf a fold or two further and at length a trifle more than satisfied with his appearance he proceeded most serenely toward the sound of the tuning fiddles he passed through the storeroom behind the kitchen stepping lightly lest he should rouse the ten or twelve babies that lay on the table or beneath it on bear creek babies and children always went with their parents to a dance because nurses were unknown so little alfred and christopher lay there among the wraps parallel and crosswise with little taylors and little carmodys and lees and all the bear creek offspring that was not yet able to skip at large and hamper its indulgent elders in the ballroom why lin aint hyeh yet said the virginian looking in upon the people there was miss wood standing up for the quadrille i didnt remember her hair was that pretty said he but aint she a little little girl now she was in truth five feet three but then he could look away down on the top of her head salute your honey called the first fiddler all partners bowed to each other and as she turned miss wood saw the man in the doorway again as it had been at south fork that day his eyes dropped from hers and she divining instantly why he had come after half a year thought of the handkerchief and of that scream of hers in the river and became filled with tyranny and anticipation for indeed he was fine to look upon so she danced away carefully unaware of his existence first lady centre said her partner reminding her of her turn have you forgotten how it goes since last time molly wood did not forget again but quadrilled with the most sprightly devotion i see some new faces tonight said she presently yu always do forget our poor faces said her partner oh no theres a stranger now who is that black man well hes from virginia and he aint allowin hes black hes a tenderfoot i suppose ha ha ha thats rich too and so the simple partner explained a great deal about the virginian to molly wood at the end of the set she saw the man by the door take a step in her direction oh said she quickly to the partner how warm it is i must see how those babies are doing and she passed the virginian in a breeze of unconcern his eyes gravely lingered where she had gone she knowed me right away said he he looked for a moment then leaned against the door how warm it is said she well it aint so screechin hot hyeh and as for rushin after alfred and christopher when their natural motheh is bumpin around handy she certnly cant be offended he broke off and looked again where she had gone and then miss wood passed him brightly again and was dancing the schottische almost immediately oh yes she knows me the swarthy cowpuncher mused she has to take trouble not to see me and what shes afussin at is mighty interestin hello hello returned lin mclean sourly he had just looked into the kitchen not dancin the southerner inquired dont know how had scyarlet fever and forgot your past life len grinned better persuade the schoolmarm to learn it shes goin to give me instruction huh went mr mclean and skulked out to the barrel why they claimed you werent drinkin this month said his friend following well i am heres luck the two pledged in tin cups but im not waltzin with her blurted mr mclean grievously she called me an exception waltzin repeated the virginian quickly and hearing the fiddles he hastened away few in the bear creek country could waltz and with these few it was mostly an unsteered and ponderous exhibition therefore was the southerner bent upon profiting by his skill he entered the room and his lady saw him come where she sat alone for the moment and her thoughts grew a little hurried will you try a turn maam i beg your pardon it was a remote wellschooled eye that she lifted now upon him if you like a waltz maam will you waltz with me youre from virginia i understand said molly wood regarding him politely but not rising one gains authority immensely by keeping ones seat all good teachers know this yes maam from virginia ive heard that southerners have such good manners thats correct the cowpuncher flushed but he spoke in his unvaryingly gentle voice for in new england you know pursued miss molly noting his scarf and cleanshaven chin and then again steadily meeting his eye gentlemen ask to be presented to ladies before they ask them to waltz he stood a moment before her deeper and deeper scarlet and the more she saw his handsome face the keener rose her excitement she waited for him to speak of the river for then she was going to be surprised and gradually to remember and finally to be very nice to him but he did not wait i ask your pardon lady said he and bowing walked off leaving her at once afraid that he might not come back but she had altogether mistaken her man back he came serenely with mr taylor and was duly presented to her thus were the conventions vindicated it can never be known what the cowpuncher was going to say next for uncle hughey stepped up with a glass of water which he had left wood to bring and asking for a turn most graciously received it she danced away from a situation where she began to feel herself getting the worst of it one moment the virginian stared at his lady as she lightly circulated and then he went out to the barrel leave him for uncle hershey jealousy is a deep and delicate thing and works its spite in many ways the virginian had been ready to look at lin mclean with a hostile eye but finding him now beside the barrel he felt a brotherhood between himself and lin and his hostility had taken a new and whimsical direction heres how said he to mclean and they pledged each other in the tin cups been gettin them instructions said mr mclean grinning i thought i saw yu learning your steps through the window heres your good health said the southerner once more they pledged each other handsomely did she call you an exception or anything said lin well it would cipher out right close in that neighborhood heres how then cried the delighted lin over his cup jest because yu happen to come from vermont continued mr mclean is no cause for extra pride shoo i was raised in massachusetts myself and big men have been raised there too daniel webster and israel putnam and a lot of them politicians virginia is a good little old state observed the southerner both of ems a sight ahead of vermont she told me i was the first exception shed struck what rule were you provin at the time lin well yu see i started to kiss her yu didnt shucks i didnt mean nothin i reckon yu stopped mighty sudden why id been ridin out with her ridin to school ridin from school and acomin and agoin and she chattin cheerful and askin me a heap o questions all about myself every day and i not lyin much neither and so i figured she wouldnt mind lots of em like it but she didnt you bet no said the virginian deeply proud of his lady who had slighted him he had pulled her out of the water once and he had been her unrewarded knight even today and he felt his grievance but he spoke not of it to lin for he felt also in memory her arms clinging round him as he carried her ashore upon his horse but he muttered plumb ridiculous as her injustice struck him afresh while the outraged mclean told his tale trample is what she has done on me tonight and without notice we was startin to come here taylor and mrs were ahead in the buggy and i was holdin her horse and helpin her up in the saddle like i done for days and days who was there to see us and i figured shed not mind and she calls me an exception yud ought tove just heard her about western men respectin women so thats the last word weve spoke we come twentyfive miles then she scootin in front and her horse kickin the sand in my face mrs taylor she guessed something was up but she didnt tell miss wood did not tell not she shell never open her head she can take care of herself you bet the fiddles sounded hilariously in the house and the feet also they had warmed up altogether and their dancing figures crossed the windows back and forth the two cowpunchers drew near to a window and looked in gloomily there she goes said lin with uncle hughey again said the virginian sourly yu might suppose he didnt have a wife and twins to see the way he goes gambollin around westfall is takin a turn with her now said mclean james exclaimed the virginian hes another with a wife and famly and he gets the dancin too there she goes with taylor said lin presently another married man the southerner commented they prowled round to the storeroom and passed through the kitchen to where the dancers were robustly tramping miss wood was still the partner of mr taylor lets have some whiskey said the virginian they had it and returned and the virginians disgust and sense of injury grew deeper old carmody has got her now he drawled he polkas like a landslide she learns his monkeyfaced kid to spell dog and cow all the mawnin hed ought to be tucked up cosey in his bed right now old carmody ought they were standing in that place set apart for the sleeping children and just at this moment one of two babies that were stowed beneath a chair uttered a drowsy note a much louder cry indeed a chorus of lament would have been needed to reach the ears of the parents in the room beyond such was the noisy volume of the dance but in this quiet place the light sound caught mr mcleans attention and he turned to see if anything were wrong but both babies were sleeping peacefully thems uncle hugheys twins he said how do you happen to know that inquired the virginian suddenly interested saw his wife put em under the chair so she could find em right off when she come to go home oh said the virginian thoughtfully oh find em right off yes uncle hugheys twins he walked to a spot from which he could view the dance well he continued returning the schoolmarm must have taken quite a notion to uncle hughey he has got her for this quadrille the virginian was now speaking without rancor but his words came with a slightly augmented drawl and this with him was often a bad omen he now turned his eyes upon the collected babies wrapped in various colored shawls and knitted work nine ten eleven beautiful sleepin strangers he counted in a sweet voice any of em yourn lin not that i know of grinned mr mclean eleven twelve this hyeh is little christopher in the bluestripe quilt or maybe that other yellohead is him the angels have commenced to drop in on us right smart along bear creek lin what trash are yu talkin anyway if they look so awful alike in the heavenly gyarden the gentle southerner continued id just hate to be the folks that has the cuttin of em out o the general herd and thats a right quaint notion too he added softly them under the chair are uncle hugheys didnt you tell me and stooping he lifted the torpid babies and placed them beneath a table no that aint thorough he murmured with wonderful dexterity and solicitude for their wellfare he removed the loose wrap which was around them and this soon led to an intricate process of exchange for a moment mr mclean had been staring at the virginian puzzled then with a joyful yelp of enlightenment he sprang to abet him and while both busied themselves with the shawls and quilts the unconscious parents went dancing vigorously on and the small occasional cries of their progeny did not reach them xi you re going to love me before we get through the swinton barbecue was over the fiddles were silent the steer was eaten the barrel emptied or largely so and the tapers extinguished round the house and sunken fire all movement of guests was quiet the families were long departed homeward and after their hospitable turbulence the swintons slept mr and mrs westfall drove through the night and as they neared their cabin there came from among the bundled wraps a still small voice jim said his wife i said alfred would catch cold bosh lizzie dont you fret hes a little more than a yearlin and of course hell snuffle and young james took a kiss from his love well how you can speak of alfred that way calling him a yearling as if he was a calf and he just as much your child as mine i dont see james westfall why what under the sun do you mean there he goes again do hurry up home jim hes got a real strange cough so they hurried home soon the nine miles were finished and good james was unhitching by his stable lantern while his wife in the house hastened to commit their offspring to bed the traces had dropped and each horse marched forward for further unbuckling when james heard himself called indeed there was that in his wifes voice which made him jerk out his pistol as he ran but it was no bear or indian only two strange children on the bed his wife was glaring at them he sighed with relief and laid down the pistol put that on again james westfall youll need it look here well they wont bite whose are they where have you stowed ourn where have i utterance forsook this mother for a moment and you ask me she continued ask lin mclean ask him that sets bulls on folks and steals slippers what hes done with our innocent lambs mixing them up with other peoples coughing unhealthy brats thats charlie taylor in alfreds clothes and i know alfred didnt cough like that and i said to you it was strange and the other one thats been put in christophers new quilts is not even a bub bub boy as this crime against society loomed clear to james westfalls understanding he sat down on the nearest piece of furniture and heedless of his wifes tears and his exchanged children broke into unregenerate laughter doubtless after his sharp alarm about the bear he was unstrung his lady however promptly restrung him and by the time they had repacked the now clamorous changelings and were rattling on their way to the taylors he began to share her outraged feelings properly as a husband and a father should but when he reached the taylors and learned from miss wood that at this house a child had been unwrapped whom nobody could at all identify and that mr and mrs taylor were already far on the road to the swintons james westfall whipped up his horses and grew almost as thirsty for revenge as was his wife where the steer had been roasted the powdered ashes were now cold white and mr mclean feeling through his dreams the change of dawn come over the air sat up cautiously among the outdoor slumberers and waked his neighbor day will be soon he whispered and we must light out of this i never suspicioned yu had that much of the devil in you before i reckon some of the fellows will act haidstrong the virginian murmured luxuriously among the warmth of his blankets i tell yu we must skip said lin for the second time and he rubbed the virginians black head which alone was visible skip then you came muffled from within and keep youself mighty scace till they can appreciate our frolic the southerner withdrew deeper into his bed and mr mclean informing him that he was a fool arose and saddled his horse from the saddlebag he brought a parcel and lightly laying this beside bokay baldy he mounted and was gone when baldy awoke later he found the parcel to be a pair of flowery slippers in selecting the inert virginian as the fool mr mclean was scarcely wise it is the absent who are always guilty before ever lin could have been a mile in retreat the rattle of the wheels roused all of them and here came the taylors before the taylors knocking had brought the swintons to their door other wheels sounded and here were mr and mrs carmody and uncle hughey with his wife and close after them mr dow alone who told how his wife had gone into one of her fits she upon whom dr barker at drybone had enjoined total abstinence from all excitement voices of women and children began to be up lifted the westfalls arrived in a lather and the thomases and by sunrise what with fathers and mothers and spectators and loud offspring there was gathered such a meeting as has seldom been before among the generations of speaking men today you can hear legends of it from texas to montana but i am giving you the full particulars of course they pitched upon poor lin here was the virginian doing his best holding horses and helping ladies descend while the name of mclean began to be muttered with threats soon a party led by mr dow set forth in search of him and the southerner debated a moment if he had better not put them on a wrong track but he concluded that they might safely go on searching mrs westfall found christopher at once in the green shawl of anna maria dow but all was not achieved thus in the twinkling of an eye mr mclean had it appeared as james westfall lugubriously pointed out not merely swapped the duds he had shuffled the whole doggone deck and they cursed this satanic invention the fathers were but of moderate assistance it was the mothers who did the heavy work and by ten oclock some unsolved problems grew so delicate that a ladies caucus was organized in a private room no admittance for men and what was done there i can only surmise during its progress the search party returned it had not found mr mclean it had found a tree with a notice pegged upon it reading god bless our home this was captured but success attended the caucus each mother emerged satisfied that she had received her own and each sire now that his family was itself again began to look at his neighbor sideways after a man has been angry enough to kill another man after the fire of righteous slaughter has raged in his heart as it had certainly raged for several hours in the hearts of these fathers the flame will usually burn itself out this will be so in a generous nature unless the cause of the anger is still unchanged but the children had been identified none had taken hurt all had been humanely given their nourishment the thing was over the day was beautiful a tempting feast remained from the barbecue these bear creek fathers could not keep their ire at red heat most of them being as yet more their wives lovers than their childrens parents began to see the mirthful side of the adventure and they ceased to feel very severely toward lin mclean not so the women they cried for vengeance but they cried in vain and were met with smiles mrs westfall argued long that punishment should be dealt the offender anyway she persisted it was real defiant of him putting that up on the tree i might forgive him but for that yes spoke the virginian in their midst that wasnt sort o right especially as i am the man youre huntin they sat dumb at his assurance come and kill me he continued round upon the party ill not resist but they could not resist the way in which he had looked round upon them he had chosen the right moment for his confession as a captain of a horse awaits the proper time for a charge some rebukes he did receive the worst came from the mothers and all that he could say for himself was i am getting off too easy but what was your point said westfall blamed if i know any more i expect it must have been the whiskey i would mind it less said mrs westfall if you looked a bit sorry or ashamed the virginian shook his head at her penitently im tryin to he said and thus he sat disarming his accusers until they began to lunch upon the copious remnants of the barbecue he did not join them at this meal in telling you that mrs dow was the only lady absent upon this historic morning i was guilty of an inadvertence there was one other the virginian rode away sedately through the autumn sunshine and as he went he asked his monte horse a question do yu reckon shell have forgotten you too you piebiter said he instead of the new trousers the cowpunchers leathern chaps were on his legs but he had the new scarf knotted at his neck most men would gladly have equalled him in appearance you monte said he will she be at home it was sunday and no school day and he found her in her cabin that stood next the taylors house her eyes were very bright id thought id just call said he why thats such a pity mr and mrs taylor are away yes theyve been right busy thats why i thought id call will yu come for a ride maam dear me i you can ride my hawss hes gentle what and you walk no maam nor the two of us ride him this time either at this she turned entirely pink and he noticing went on quietly ill catch up one of taylors hawsses taylor knows me no i dont really think i could do that but thank you thank you very much i must go now and see how mrs taylors fire is ill look after that maam id like for yu to go ridin mighty well yu have no babies this mawnin to be anxious after at this shaft grandmother stark flashed awake deep within the spirit of her descendant and she made a haughty declaration of war i dont know what you mean sir she said now was his danger for it was easy to fall into mere crude impertinence and ask her why then did she speak thus abruptly there were various easy things of this kind for him to say and any rudeness would have lost him the battle but the virginian was not the man to lose such a battle in such a way his shaft had hit she thought he referred to those babies about whom last night she had shown such superfluous solicitude her conscience was guilty this was all that he had wished to make sure of before he began operations why i mean said he easily sitting down near the door that its sunday school dont hinder yu from enjoyin a ride today youll teach the kids all the better for it tomorro maam maybe its your duty and he smiled at her my duty its quite novel to have strangers am i a stranger he cut in firing his first broadside i was introduced maam he continued noting how she had flushed again and i would not be oversteppin for the world ill go away if yu want and hereupon he quietly rose and stood hat in hand molly was flustered she did not at all want him to go no one of her admirers had ever been like this creature the fringed leathern chaparreros the cartridge belt the flannel shirt the knotted scarf at the neck these things were now an old story to her since her arrival she had seen young men and old in plenty dressed thus but worn by this man now standing by her door they seemed to radiate romance she did not want him to go and she wished to win her battle and now in her agitation she became suddenly severe as she had done at hoosic junction he should have a punishment to remember you call yourself a man i suppose she said but he did not tremble in the least her fierceness filled him with delight and the tender desire of ownership flooded through him a grownup responsible man she repeated yes maam i think so he now sat down again and you let them think that that mr mclean you dare not look me in the face and say that mr mclean did that last night i reckon i dassent there i knew it i said so from the first and me a stranger to you he murmured it was his second broadside it left her badly crippled she was silent who did yu mention it to maam she hoped she had him why are you afraid and she laughed lightly i told em myself and their astonishment seemed so genuwine id just hate to think they had fooled me that thorough when they knowed it all along from you seeing me i did not see you i knew it must of course i did not tell any one when i said i said so from the first i meant you can understand perfectly what i meant yes maam poor molly was near stamping her foot and what sort of a trick she rushed on was that to play do you call it a manly thing to frighten and distress women because you for no reason at all i should never have imagined it could be the act of a person who wears a big pistol and rides a big horse i should be afraid to go riding with such an immature protector yes that was awful childish your words do cut a little for maybe theres been times when i have acted pretty near like a man but i certnly forgot to be introduced before i spoke to yu last night because why youve found me out dead in one thing wont you take a guess at this too i cannot sit guessing why people do not behave themselves who seem to know better well maam ive played square and owned up to yu and thats not what youre doin by me i ask your pardon if i say what i have a right to say in language not as good as id like to talk to yu with but at south fork crossin who did any introducin did yu complain i was a stranger then i no she flashed out then quite sweetly the driver told me it wasnt really so dangerous there you know thats not the point im makin you are a grownup woman a responsible woman youve come ever so far and all alone to a rough country to instruct young children that play games tag and hideandseek and fooleries theyll have to quit when they get old dont you think pretendin yu dont know a man his names nothin but him a man whom you were glad enough to let assist yu when somebody was needed dont you think thats mighty close to hideandseek them children plays i aint so sure but what theres a pair of us children in this hyeh room molly wood was regarding him saucily i dont think i like you said she thats all square enough youre goin to love me before we get through i wish yud come aridin maam dear dear dear so im going to love you how will you do it i know men think that they only need to sit and look strong and make chests at a girl goodness gracious i aint makin any chests at yu laughter overcame him for a moment and miss wood liked his laugh very much please come aridin he urged its the prettiest kind of a day she looked at him frankly and there was a pause i will take back two things that i said to you she then answered him i believe that i do like you and i know that if i went riding with you i should not have an immature protector and then with a final gesture of acknowledgment she held out her hand to him and i have always wanted she said to thank you for what you did at the river he took her hand and his heart bounded youre a gentleman he exclaimed it was now her turn to be overcome with merriment ive always wanted to be a man she said i am mighty glad you aint said he looking at her but molly had already received enough broadsides for one day she could allow no more of them and she took herself capably in hand where did you learn to make such pretty speeches she asked well never mind that one sees that you have had plenty of practice for one so young i am twentyseven blurted the virginian and knew instantly that he had spoken like a fool who would have dreamed it said molly with wellmeasured mockery she knew that she had scored at last and that this day was hers dont be too sure you are glad im not a man she now told him there was something like a challenge in her voice i risk it he remarked for i am almost twentythree myself she concluded and she gave him a look on her own account and youll not come aridin he persisted no she answered him no and he knew that he could not make her then i will tell yu goodby said he but i am comin again and next time ill have along a gentle hawss for yu next time next time well perhaps i will go with you do you live far i live on judge henrys ranch over yondeh he pointed across the mountains its on sunk creek a pretty rough trail but i can come hyeh to see you in a day i reckon well i hope youll certnly enjoy good health maam oh theres one thing said molly wood calling after him rather quickly i im not at all afraid of horses you neednt bring such a gentle one i was very tired that day and and i dont scream as a rule he turned and looked at her so that she could not meet his glance bless your heart said he will yu give me one o those flowers oh certainly im always so glad when people like them theyre pretty near the color of your eyes never mind my eyes cant help it maam not since south fork he put the flower in the leather band of his hat and rode away on his monte horse miss wood lingered a moment then made some steps toward her gate from which he could still be seen and then with something like a toss of the head she went in and shut her door later in the day the virginian met mr mclean who looked at his hat and innocently quoted my looloo picked a daisy dont yu lin said the southerner then i wont said lin thus for this occasion did the virginian part from his lady and nothing said one way or another about the handkerchief that had disappeared during the south fork incident as we fall asleep at night our thoughts will often ramble back and forth between the two worlds what color were his eyes wondered molly on her pillow his mustache is not bristly like so many of them sam never gave me such a look at hoosic junction no you cant come with me get off your horse the passengers are all staring and while molly was thus dreaming that the virginian had ridden his horse into the railroad car and sat down beside her the fire in the great stone chimney of her cabin flickered quietly its gleams now and again touching the miniature of grandmother stark upon the wall camped on the sunk creek trail the virginian was telling himself in his blankets i aint too old for education maybe she will lend me books and ill watch her ways and learnstand still monte i can learn a lot more than the kids on that theres monteyou piebiter stop he has ate up your book maam but ill get yu and then the virginian was fast asleep xii quality and equality to the circle at bennington a letter from bear creek was always a welcome summons to gather and hear of doings very strange to vermont and when the tale of the changed babies arrived duly by the post it created a more than usual sensation and was read to a large number of pleased and scandalized neighbors i hate her to be where such things can happen said mrs wood i wish i could have been there said her soninlaw andrew bell she does not mention who played the trick said mrs andrew bell we shouldnt be any wiser if she did said mrs wood id like to meet the perpetrator said andrew oh no said mrs wood theyre all horrible and she wrote at once begging her daughter to take good care of herself and to see as much of mrs balaam as possible and of any other ladies that are near you for you seem to me to be in a community of roughs i wish you would give it all up did you expect me to laugh about the babies mrs flynt when this story was repeated to her she had not been invited in to hear the letter remarked that she had always felt that molly wood must be a little vulgar ever since she began to go about giving music lessons like any ordinary german but mrs wood was considerably relieved when the next letter arrived it contained nothing horrible about barbecues or babies it mentioned the great beauty of the weather and how well and strong the fine air was making the writer feel and it asked that books might be sent many books of all sorts novels poetry all the good old books and any good new ones that could be spared cheap editions of course indeed she shall have them said mrs wood how her mind must be starving in that dreadful place the letter was not a long one and besides the books spoke of little else except the fine weather and the chances for outdoor exercise that this gave you have no idea it said how delightful it is to ride especially on a spirited horse which i can do now quite well how nice that is said mrs wood putting down the letter i hope the horse is not too spirited who does she go riding with asked mrs bell she doesnt say sarah why nothing she has a queer way of not mentioning things now and then sarah exclaimed mrs wood reproachfully oh well mother you know just as well as i do that she can be very independent and unconventional yes but not in that way she wouldnt ride with poor sam bannett and after all he is a suitable person nevertheless in her next letter mrs wood cautioned her daughter about trusting herself with any one of whom mrs balaam did not thoroughly approve the good lady could never grasp that mrs balaam lived a long days journey from bear creek and that molly saw her about once every three months we have sent your books the mother wrote everybody has contributed from their store shakespeare tennyson browning longfellow and a number of novels by scott thackeray george eliot hawthorne and lesser writers some volumes of emerson and jane austen complete because you admire her so particularly this consignment of literature reached bear creek about a week before christmas time by new years day the virginian had begun his education well i have managed to get through em he said as he entered mollys cabin in february and he laid two volumes upon her table and what do you think of them she inquired i think that ive certnly earned a good long ride today georgie taylor has sprained his ankle no i dont mean that kind of a ride ive earned a ride with just us two alone ive read every word of both of em yu know ill think about it did you like them no not much if id knowed that one was a detective story id have got yu to try something else on me can you guess the murderer or is the author too smart for yu thats all they amount to well he was too smart for me this time but that didnt distress me any that other book talks too much molly was scandalized and she told him it was a great work oh yes yes a fine book but it will keep up its talkin dont let you alone didnt you feel sorry for poor maggie tulliver hmp yes sorry for her and for tawmmy too but the man did right to drownd em both it wasnt a man a woman wrote that a woman did well then o course she talks too much ill not go riding with you shrieked molly but she did and he returned to sunk creek not with a detective story but this time with a russian novel it was almost april when he brought it back to her and a heavy sleet storm lost them their ride so he spent his time indoors with her not speaking a syllable of love when he came to take his departure he asked her for some other book by this same russian but she had no more i wish you had he said ive never saw a book could tell the truth like that one does why what do you like about it she exclaimed to her it had been distasteful everything he answered that young comeouter and his famly that cant understand him for he is broad gauge yu see and they are narro gauge the virginian looked at molly a moment almost shyly do you know he said and a blush spread over his face i pretty near cried when that young comeouter was dyin and said about himself i was a giant life made him broad gauge yu see and then took his chance away molly liked the virginian for his blush it made him very handsome but she thought that it came from his confession about pretty near crying the deeper cause she failed to divine that he like the dying hero in the novel felt himself to be a giant whom life had made broad gauge and denied opportunity fecund nature begets and squanders thousands of these rich seeds in the wilderness of life he took away with him a volume of shakespeare ive saw good plays of his he remarked kind mrs taylor in her cabin next door watched him ride off in the sleet bound for the lonely mountain trail if that girl dont get ready to take him pretty soon she observed to her husband ill give her a piece of my mind taylor was astonished is he thinking of her he inquired lord mr taylor and why shouldnt he mr taylor scratched his head and returned to his newspaper it was warm warm and beautiful upon bear creek snow shone upon the peaks of the bow leg range lower on their slopes the pines were stirring with a gentle song and flowers bloomed across the wide plains at their feet molly and her virginian sat at a certain spring where he had often ridden with her on this day he was bidding her farewell before undertaking the most important trust which judge henry had as yet given him for this journey she had provided him with sir walter scotts kenilworth shakespeare he had returned to her he had bought shakespeare for himself as soon as i got used to readin it he had told her i knowed for certain that i liked readin for enjoyment but it was not of books that he had spoken much today he had not spoken at all he had bade her listen to the meadowlark when its song fell upon the silence like beaded drops of music he had showed her where a covey of young willowgrouse were hiding as their horses passed and then without warning as they sat by the spring he had spoken potently of his love she did not interrupt him she waited until he was wholly finished i am not the sort of wife you want she said with an attempt of airiness he answered roughly i am the judge of that and his roughness was a pleasure to her yet it made her afraid of herself when he was absent from her and she could sit in her cabin and look at grandmother stark and read home letters then in imagination she found it easy to play the part which she had arranged to play regarding him the part of the guide and superior and indulgent companion but when he was by her side that part became a difficult one her womans fortress was shaken by a force unknown to her before sam bannett did not have it in him to look as this man could look when the cold lustre of his eyes grew hot with internal fire what color they were baffled her still can it possibly change she wondered it seemed to her that sometimes when she had been looking from a rock straight down into clear sea water this same color had lurked in its depths is it green or is it gray she asked herself but did not turn just now to see she kept her face toward the landscape all men are born equal he now remarked slowly yes she quickly answered with a combative flash well maybe that dont include women he suggested i think it does do yu tell the kids so of course i teach them what i believe he pondered i used to have to learn about the declaration of independence i hated books and truck when i was a kid but you dont any more no i certnly dont but i used to get kep in at recess for bein so dumb i was most always at the tail end of the class my brother hed be head sometimes little george taylor is my prize scholar said molly knows his tasks does he always and henry dow comes next whos last poor bob carmody i spend more time on him than on all the rest put together my said the virginian aint that strange she looked at him puzzled by his tone its not strange when you know bob she said its very strange drawled the virginian knowin bob dont help it any i dont think that i understand you said molly sticky well it is mighty confusin george taylor hes your best scholar and poor bob hes your worst and theres a lot in the middle and you tell me were all born equal molly could only sit giggling in this trap he had so ingeniously laid for her ill tell you what pursued the cowpuncher with slow and growing intensity equality is a great big bluff its easy called i didnt mean began molly wait and let me say what i mean he had made an imperious gesture with his hand i know a man that mostly wins at cyards i know a man that mostly loses he says it is his luck all right call it his luck i know a man that works hard and hes gettin rich and i know another that works hard and is gettin poor he says it is his luck all right call it his luck i look around and i see folks movin up or movin down winners or losers everywhere all luck of course but since folks can be born that different in their luck wheres your equality no seh call your failure luck or call it laziness wander around the words prospect all yu mind to and yull come out the same old trail of inequality he paused a moment and looked at her some holds four aces he went on and some holds nothin and some poor fello gets the aces and no show to play em but a man has got to prove himself my equal before ill believe him molly sat gazing at him silent i know what yu meant he told her now by sayin youre not the wife id want but i am the kind that moves up i am goin to be your best scholar he turned toward her and that fortress within her began to shake dont she murmured dont please dont what why spoil this spoil it these rides i dont love you i cant but these rides are what are they my greatest pleasure there and please i want them to go on so go on so i dont reckon yu know what youre sayin yu might as well ask fruit to stay green if the way we are now can keep bein enough for you it cant for me a pleasure to you is it well to me it is i dont know what to call it i come to yu and i hate it and i come again and i hate it and i ache and grieve all over when i go no you will have to think of some other way than just invitin me to keep green if i am to see you began the girl youre not to see me not like this i can stay away easier than what i am doin will you do me a favor a great one said she now make it as impossible as you please he cried he thought it was to be some action go on coming but dont talk to me about dont talk in that way if you can help it he laughed out not permitting himself to swear but she continued if you cant help talking that way sometimes i promise i will listen that is the only promise i make that is a bargain he said then he helped her mount her horse restraining himself like a spartan and they rode home to her cabin you have made it pretty near impossible he said as he took his leave but youve been square today and ill show you i can be square when i come back ill not do more than ask you if your minds the same and now ill not see you for quite a while i am going a long way but ill be very busy and bein busy always keeps me from grievin too much about you strange is woman she would rather have heard some other last remark than this oh very well she said ill not miss you either he smiled at her i doubt if yu can help missin me he remarked and he was gone at once galloping on his monte horse which of the two won a victory this day xiii the game and the nation act first there can be no doubt of this all america is divided into two classes the quality and the equality the latter will always recognize the former when mistaken for it both will be with us until our women bear nothing but hangs it was through the declaration of independence that we americans acknowledged the eternal equality of man for by it we abolished a cutanddried aristocracy we had seen little mere artificially held up in high places and great men artificially held down in low places and our own justiceloving hearts abhorred this violence to human nature therefore we decreed that every man should thenceforth have equal liberty to find his own level by this very decree we acknowledged and gave freedom to true aristocracy saying let the best man win whoever he is let the best man win that is americas word that is true democracy and true democracy and true aristocracy are one and the same thing if anybody cannot see this so much the worse for his eyesight the above reflections occurred to me before reaching billings montana some three weeks after i had unexpectedly met the virginian at omaha nebraska i had not known of that trust given to him by judge henry which was taking him east i was looking to ride with him before long among the clean hills of sunk creek i supposed he was there but i came upon him one morning in colonel cyrus joness eating palace did you know the palace it stood in omaha near the trains and it was ten years old which is middleaged in omaha when i first saw it it was a shell of wood painted with golden emblems the steamboat the eagle the yosemite and a live bear ate gratuities at its entrance weather permitting it opened upon the world as a stage upon the audience you sat in omahas whole sight and dined while omahas dust came and settled upon the refreshments it is gone the way of the indian and the buffalo for the west is growing old you should have seen the palace and sat there in front of you passed rainbows of men chinese indian chiefs africans general miles younger sons austrian nobility wide females in pink our continent drained prismatically through omaha once so i was passing that way also walking for the sake of ventilation from a sleepingcar toward a bath when the language of colonel cyrus jones came out to me the actual colonel i had never seen before he stood at the rear of his palace in gray flowery mustaches and a confederate uniform telling the wishes of his guests to the cook through a hole you always bought meal tickets at once else you became unwelcome guests here had foibles at times and a rapid exit was too easy therefore i bought a ticket it was spring and summer since i had heard anything like the colonel the missouri had not yet flowed into new york dialect freely and his vocabulary met me like the breeze of the plains so i went in to be fanned by it and there sat the virginian at a table alone his greeting was up to the code of indifference proper on the plains but he presently remarked im right glad to see somebody which was a good deal to say them that comes hyeh he observed next dont eat they feed and he considered the guests with a sombre attention d yu reckon they find joyful digestion in this swalloangetout trough what are you doing here then said i oh pshaw when yu cant have what you choose yu just choose what you have and he took the billoffare i began to know that he had something on his mind so i did not trouble him further meanwhile he sat studying the billoffare ever heard o them he inquired shoving me the spotted document most improbable dishes were there salmis canapes supremes all perfectly spelt and absolutely transparent it was the old trick of copying some metropolitan menu to catch travellers of the third and last dimension of innocence and whenever this is done the food is of the third and last dimension of awfulness which the cowpuncher knew as well as anybody so they keep that up here still i said but what about them he repeated his finger was at a special item frogs legs a la delmonico are they true anywheres he asked and i told him certainly i also explained to him about delmonico of new york and about augustin of philadelphia theres not a little bit o use in lyin to me this mawnin he said with his engaging smile i aint goin to awdeh anythings laigs well ill see how he gets out of it i said remembering the odd texas legend the traveller read the billoffare you know and called for a volauvent and the proprietor looked at the traveller and running a pistol into his ear observed youll take hash i was thinking of this and wondering what would happen to me so i took the step wants frogs legs does he shouted colonel cyrus jones he fixed his eye upon me and it narrowed to a slit too many brain workers breakfasting before yu came in professor said he missionary ate the last leg off me just now brown the wheat he commanded through the hole to the cook for some one had ordered hot cakes ill have fried aiggs said the virginian cooked both sides white wings sang the colonel through the hole let em fly up and down coffee an no milk said the virginian draw one in the dark the colonel roared and beefsteak rare one slaughter in the pan and let the blood drip i should like a glass of water please said i the colonel threw me a look of pity one missouri and ice for the professor he said that fellos a right live man commented the virginian but he seemed thoughtful presently he inquired yu say he was a foreigner an learned fancy cookin to new yawk that was this cowpunchers way scarcely ever would he let drop a thing new to him until he had got from you your whole information about it so i told him the history of lorenzo delmonico and his pioneer work as much as i knew and the southerner listened intently mighty interestin he said mighty he could just take little old ornry frawgs and dandy em up to suit the bloods mighty interestin i expaict though his cookin would give an outraiged stomach to a plainraised man if you want to follow it up said i by way of a sudden experiment miss molly wood might have some book about french dishes but the virginian did not turn a hair i reckon she wouldnt he answered she was raised in vermont they dont bother overly about their eatin up in vermont hyehs what miss wood recommended the las time i was seein her the cowpuncher added bringing kenilworth from his pocket right fine story that queen elizabeth must have certnly been a competent woman she was said i but talk came to an end here a dusty crew most evidently from the plains now entered and drifted to a table and each man of them gave the virginian about a quarter of a slouchy nod his greeting to them was very serene only kenilworth went back into his pocket and he breakfasted in silence among those who had greeted him i now recognized a face why thats the man you played cards with at medicine bow i said yes trampas hes got a job at the ranch now the virginian said no more but went on with his breakfast his appearance was changed aged i would scarcely say for this would seem as if he did not look young but i think that the boy was altogether gone from his face the boy whose freak with steve had turned medicine bow upside down whose other freak with the babies had outraged bear creek the boy who had loved to jingle his spurs but manhood had only trained not broken his youth it was all there only obedient to the rein and curb presently we went together to the railway yard the judge is doing a right smart o business this year he began very casually indeed so that i knew this was important besides bells and coal smoke the smell and crowded sounds of cattle rose in the air around us hyehs our first gather o beeves on the ranch continued the virginian the whole lots shipped through to chicago in two sections over the burlington the judge is fighting the elkhorn road we passed slowly along the two trains twenty cars each car packed with huddled roundeyed gazing steers he examined to see if any animals were down they aint ate or drank anything to speak of he said while the terrified brutes stared at us through their slats not since they struck the railroad theyve not drank yu might suppose they know somehow what theyre travellin to chicago for and casually always casually he told me the rest judge henry could not spare his foreman away from the second gather of beeves therefore these two tencar trains with their double crew of cowboys had been given to the virginians charge after chicago he was to return by st paul over the northern pacific for the judge had wished him to see certain of the roads directors and explain to them persuasively how good a thing it would be for them to allow especially cheap rates to the sunk creek outfit henceforth this was all the virginian told me and it contained the whole matter to be sure so youre acting foreman said i why somebody has to have the say i reckon and of course you hated the promotion i dont know about promotion he replied the boys have been used to seein me one of themselves why dont you come along with us far as plattsmouth thus he shifted the subject from himself and called to my notice the locomotives backing up to his cars and reminded me that from plattsmouth i had the choice of two trains returning but he could not hide or belittle this confidence of his employer in him it was the care of several thousand perishable dollars and the control of men it was a compliment there were more steers than men to be responsible for but none of the steers had been suddenly picked from the herd and set above his fellows moreover chicago finished up the steers but the newmade deputy foreman had then to lead his six highly unoccupied brethren away from towns and back in peace to the ranch or disappoint the judge who needed their services these things sometimes go wrong in a land where they say you are all born equal and that quarter of a nod in colonel cyrus joness eating palace held more equality than any whole nod you could see but the virginian did not see it there being a time for all things we trundled down the flopping heavyeddied missouri to plattsmouth and there they backed us on to a siding the christian endeavor being expected to pass that way and while the equality absorbed themselves in a deep but harmless game of poker by the side of the railway line the virginian and i sat on the top of a car contemplating the sandy shallows of the platte i should think youd take a hand said i poker with them kittens one flash of the inner man lightened in his eyes and died away and he finished with his gentle drawl when i play i want it to be interestin he took out sir walters kenilworth once more and turned the volume over and over slowly without opening it you cannot tell if in spirit he wandered on bear creek with the girl whose book it was the spirit will go one road and the thought another and the body its own way sometimes queen elizabeth would have played a mighty powful game was his next remark poker said i yes seh do you expaict europe has got any queen equal to her at present i doubted it victoriad get pretty nigh slain sliding chips out agaynst elizabeth only mos probly victoria shed insist on a halfcent limit you have read this hyeh kenilworth well deal elizabeth ace high an she could scare robert dudley with a full house plumb out o the bettin i said that i believed she unquestionably could and said the virginian if essexs play got next her too near i reckon shed have stacked the cyards say d yu remember shakespeares fat man falstaff oh yes indeed aint that grand why he makes men talk the way they do in life i reckon he couldnt get printed today its a right down shame shakespeare couldnt know about poker hed have had falstaff playing all day at that tearsheet outfit and the prince would have beat him the prince had the brains said i brains well didnt he i neveh thought to notice like as not he did and falstaff didnt i suppose oh yes seh falstaff could have played whist i suppose you know what youre talking about i dont said i for he was drawling again the cowpunchers eye rested a moment amiably upon me you can play whist with your brains he mused brains and cyards now cyards are only one o the manifestations of poker in this hyeh world one o the shapes yu fool with it in when the days work is oveh if a man is built like that prince boy was built and its away down deep beyond brains hell play winnin poker with whatever hand hes holdin when the trouble begins maybe it will be a mean triflin army or an empty sixshooter or a lame hawss or maybe just nothin but his natural countenance most any old thing will do for a fello like that prince boy to play poker with then id be grateful for your definition of poker said i again the virginian looked me over amiably you put up a mighty pretty game o whist yourself he remarked dont that give you the contented spirit and before i had any reply to this the christian endeavor began to come over the bridge three instalments crossed the missouri from pacific junction bound for pikes peak every car swathed in bright bunting and at each window a christian with a handkerchief joyously shrieking then the cattle trains got the open signal and i jumped off tell the judge the steers was all right this far said the virginian that was the last of the deputy foreman for a while xiv between the acts my road to sunk creek lay in no straight line by rail i diverged northwest to fort meade and thence after some stay with the kind military people i made my way on a horse up here in the black hills it sluiced rain most intolerably the horse and i enjoyed the country and ourselves but little and when finally i changed from the saddle into a stagecoach i caught a thankful expression upon the animals face and returned the same six legs inside this jerky tonight said somebody as i climbed the wheel well well give thanks for not havin eight he added cheerfully clamp your mind on to that shorty and he slapped the shoulder of his neighbor naturally i took these two for old companions but we were all total strangers they told me of the new gold excitement at rawhide and supposed it would bring up the northern pacific and when i explained the millions owed to this roads german bondholders they were of opinion that a german would strike it richer at rawhide we spoke of all sorts of things and in our silence i gloated on the autumn holiday promised me by judge henry his last letter had said that an outfit would be starting for his ranch from billings on the seventh and he would have a horse for me this was the fifth so we six legs in the jerky travelled harmoniously on over the raingutted road getting no deeper knowledge of each other than what our outsides might imply not that we concealed anything the man who had slapped shorty introduced himself early scipio le moyne from gallipolice ohio he said the eldest of us always gets called scipio its french but us folks have been white for a hundred years he was limber and lightmuscled and fell skilfully about evading bruises when the jerky reeled or rose on end he had a strange long jocular nose very warylooking and a bleached blue eye cattle was his business as a rule but of late he had been looking around some and rawhide seemed much on his brain shorty struck me as looking around also he was quite short indeed and the jerky hurt him almost every time he was lighthaired and mild think of a yellow dog that is lost and fancies each newcomer in sight is going to turn out his master and you will have shorty it was the northern pacific that surprised us into intimacy we were nearing medora we had made a last arrangement of our legs i lay stretched in silence placid in the knowledge it was soon to end so i drowsed i felt something sudden and waking saw scipio passing through the air as shorty next shot from the jerky i beheld smoke and the locomotive the northern pacific had changed its schedule a valise is a poor companion for catching a train with there was rutted sand and lumpy kneehigh grease wood in our short cut a piece of stray wire sprang from some hole and hung caracoling about my ankle tin cans spun from my stride but we made a conspicuous race two of us waved hats and there was no moment that some one of us was not screeching it meant twentyfour hours to us perhaps we failed to catch the trains attention though the theory seems monstrous as it moved off in our faces smooth and easy and insulting scipio dropped instantly to a walk and we two others outstripped him and came desperately to the empty track there went the train even still its puffs were the separated puffs of starting that bittenoff snorty kind and sweat and our true natures broke freely forth i kicked my valise and then sat on it dumb shorty yielded himself up aloud all his humble secrets came out of him he walked aimlessly round lamenting he had lost his job and he mentioned the ranch he had played cards and he mentioned the man he had sold his horse and saddle to catch a friend on this train and he mentioned what the friend had been going to do for him he told a string of griefs and names to the air as if the air knew meanwhile scipio arrived with extreme leisure at the rails he stuck his hands into his pockets and his head out at the very small train his bleached blue eyes shut to slits as he watched the rear car in its smokeblur ooze away westward among the mounded bluffs lucky its out of range i thought but now scipio spoke to it why you seem to think youve left me behind he began easily in fawning tones youre too much of a kid to have such thoughts age some his next remark grew less wheedling i wouldnt be a bit proud to meet yu why if i was seen travellin with yu id have to explain it to my friends think youve got me left do yu just because yu ride through this country on a rail do yu claim yu can find your way around i could take yu out ten yards in the brush and lose yu in ten seconds you spangleroofed hobo leave me behind you recent blanketmortgage yearlin you plushlined nickelplated whistlin wash room d yu figure i cant go east just as soon as west or ill stay right here if it suits me yu dudeinhabited hotbox why yu coonbossed facetowel but from here he rose in flights of novelty that appalled and held me spellbound and which are not for me to say to you then he came down easily again and finished with expressions of sympathy for it because it could never have known a mother do you expaict it could show a male parent offhand inquired a slow voice behind us i jumped round and there was the virginian male parent scoffed the prompt scipio aint you heard about them yet them was there two two the blamed thing was sired by a whole doggone dutch syndicate why the piebald son of a gun responded the virginian sweetly i got them steers through all right he added to me sorry to see yu get so out o breath afteh the train is your valise sufferin any whos he inquired scipio curiously turning to me the southerner sat with a newspaper on the rear platform of a caboose the caboose stood hitched behind a mile or so of freight train and the train was headed west so here was the deputy foreman his steers delivered in chicago his men i could hear them safe in the caboose his paper in his lap and his legs dangling at ease over the railing he wore the look of a man for whom things are going smooth and for me the way to billings was smooth now also whos he scipio repeated but from inside the caboose loud laughter and noise broke on us some one was reciting and its my night to howl well all howl when we get to rawhide said some other one and they howled now these hyeh steam cyars said the virginian to scipio make a mans language mighty nigh as speedy as his travel of shorty he took no notice whatever no more than of the manifestations in the caboose so yu heard me speakin to the express said scipio well i guess sometimes i see here he exclaimed for the virginian was gravely considering him i may have talked some but i walked a whole lot you didnt catch me squandering no speed soon as i noticed said the virginian thinkin came quicker to yu than runnin i was glad i was not shorty to have my measure taken merely by my way of missing a train and of course i was sorry that i had kicked my valise oh i could tell yud been enjoyin us said scipio observin somebody elses scrape always kind o rests me too maybe youre a philosopher but maybe theres a pair of us drawd in this deal approval now grew plain upon the face of the virginian by your laigs said he you are used to the saddle id be called used to it i expect by your hands said the southerner again you aint roped many steers lately been cookin or something say retorted scipio tell my future some now draw a conclusion from my mouth im right distressed unsevered the gentle southerner weve not a drop in the outfit oh drink with me uptown cried scipio im pleased to death with yu the virginian glanced where the saloons stood just behind the station and shook his head why it aint a bit far to whiskey from here urged the other plaintively step down now scipio le moynes my name yes youre lookin for my brass earrings but there aint no earrings on me ive been white for a hundred years step down ive a fortydollar thirst youre certainly white began the virginian but here the caboose resumed im wild and woolly and full of peas im hard to curry above the knees im a shewolf from bitter creek and its my night to hoowl and as they howled and stamped the wheels of the caboose began to turn gently and to murmur the virginian rose suddenly will yu save that thirst and take a fortydollar job missin trains profanity or what said scipio ill tell yu soon as im sure at this scipio looked hard at the virginian why youre talkin business said he and leaped on the caboose where i was already i was thinkin of rawhide he added but i aint any more well good luck said shorty on the track behind us oh say said scipio he wanted to go on that train just like me get on called the virginian but as to getting a job he aint just like you so shorty came like a lost dog when you whistle to him our wheels clucked over the mainline switch a trainhand threw it shut after us jumped aboard and returned forward over the roofs inside the caboose they had reached the third howling of the shewolf friends of yourn said scipio my outfit drawled the virginian do yu always travel outside inquired scipio its lonesome in there returned the deputy foreman and here one of them came out slamming the door hell he said at sight of the distant town then truculently to the virginian i told you i was going to get a bottle here have your bottle then said the deputy foreman and kicked him off into dakota it was not north dakota yet they had not divided it the virginian had aimed his pistol at about the same time with his boot therefore the man sat in dakota quietly watching us go away into montana and offering no objections just before he became too small to make out we saw him rise and remove himself back toward the saloons xv the game and the nation act second that is the only step i have had to take this whole trip said the virginian he holstered his pistol with a jerk i have been fearing he would force it on me and he looked at empty receding dakota with disgust so nyeh back home he muttered known your friend long whispered scipio to me fairly i answered scipios bleached eyes brightened with admiration as he considered the southerners back well he stated judicially start awful early when yu go to fool with him or hell make you feel unpunctual i expaict ive had them almost all of three thousand miles said the virginian tilting his head toward the noise in the caboose and ive strove to deliver them back as i received them the whole lot and i would have but he has spoiled my hopes the deputy foreman looked again at dakota its a disappointment he added you may know what i mean i had known a little but not to the very deep of the mans pride and purpose in this trust scipio gave him sympathy there must be quite a balance of em left with yu yet said scipio cheeringly i had the boys plumb contented pursued the deputy foreman hurt into open talk of himself away along as far as saynt paul i had them reconciled to my authority then this news about gold had to strike us and theyre adreamin nuggets and parisian bowleyvards suggested scipio the virginian smiled gratefully at him fortune is shinin bright and blindin to their delicate young eyes he said regaining his usual self we all listened a moment to the rejoicings within energetic aint they said the southerner but none of em was whelped savage enough to sing himself bloodthirsty and though theyre strainin mighty earnest not to be tame theyre goin back to sunk creek with me accordin to the judges awders never a calf of them will desert to rawhide for all their dangerousness nor i aint goin to have any fuss over it only one is left now that dont sing maybe i will have to make some arrangements about him the man i have parted with he said with another glance at dakota was our cook and i will ask yu to replace him colonel scipio gaped wide colonel say he stared at the virginian did i meet yu at the palace not exackly meet replied the southerner i was present one mawnin las month when this gentleman awdehed frawgs laigs sakes and saints but that was a mean position burst out scipio i had to tell all comers anything all day stand up and jump language hot off my brain at em and the pay dont near compensate for the drain on the system i dont care how good a man is you let him keep atappin his presence of mind right along without takin a layoff and youll have him sick yes sir youll hit his nerves so i told them they could hire some fresh man for i was goin back to punch cattle or fight indians or take a rest somehow for i didnt propose to get jaded and me only twentyfive years old there aint no regular colonel cyrus jones any more yu know he met a cheyenne telegraph pole in seventyfour and was buried but his palace was doin big business and he had been a kind of attraction and so they always keep a live bear outside and some poor fello fixed up like the colonel used to be inside and its a turruble mean position course ill cook for yu yuve a dandy memory for faces i wasnt right convinced till i kicked him off and you gave that shut to your eyes again said the virginian once more the door opened a man with slim black eyebrows slim black mustache and a black shirt tied with a white handkerchief was looking steadily from one to the other of us good day he remarked generally and without enthusiasm and to the virginian wheres schoffner i expaict hell have got his bottle by now trampas trampas looked from one to the other of us again didnt he say he was coming back he reminded me he was going for a bottle and afteh that he didnt wait to say a thing trampas looked at the platform and the railing and the steps he told me he was coming back he insisted i dont reckon he has come not without he clumb up ahaid somewhere an i mus say when he got off he didnt look like a man does when he has the intention o returnin at this scipio coughed and pared his nails attentively we had already been avoiding each others eye shorty did not count since he got aboard his meek seat had been the bottom step the thoughts of trampas seemed to be in difficulty how longs this train been started he demanded this hyeh train the virginian consulted his watch why its been fanning it a right smart little while said he laying no stress upon his indolent syllables huh went trampas he gave the rest of us a final unlovely scrutiny it seems to have become a passenger train he said and he returned abruptly inside the caboose is he the member who dont sing asked scipio thats the specimen replied the southerner he dont seem musical in the face said scipio pshaw returned the virginian why you surely aint the man to mind ugly mugs when theyre hollow the noise inside had dropped quickly to stillness you could scarcely catch the sound of talk our caboose was clicking comfortably westward rail after rail mile upon mile while night was beginning to rise from earth into the clouded sky i wonder if they have sent a search party forward to hunt schoffner said the virginian i think ill maybe join their meeting he opened the door upon them kind o dark hyeh aint it said he and lighting the lantern he shut us out what do yu think said scipio to me will he take them to sunk creek he evidently thinks he will said i he says he will and he has the courage of his convictions that aint near enough courage to have scipio exclaimed theres times in life when a man has got to have courage without convictions without them or he is no good now your friend is that deep constitooted that you dont know and i dont know what hes thinkin about all this if theres to be any gunplay put in the excellent shorty ill stand in with him ah go to bed with your gunplay retorted scipio entirely goodhumored is the judge paying for a carload of dead punchers to gather his beef for him and this aint a proposition worth a mans gettin hurt for himself anyway thats so shorty assented no speculated scipio as the night drew deeper round us and the caboose clickclucked and clickclucked over the rail joints hes waitin for somebody else to open this pot ill bet he dont know but one thing now and thats that nobody else shall know he dont know anything scipio had delivered himself he lighted a cigarette and no more wisdom came from him the night was established the rolling badlands sank away in it a trainhand had arrived over the roof and hanging the red lights out behind left us again without remark or symptom of curiosity the trainhands seemed interested in their own society and lived in their own caboose a chill wind with wet in it came blowing from the invisible draws and brought the feel of the distant mountains thats montana said scipio snuffing i am glad to have it inside my lungs again aint yu getting cool out there said the virginians voice plenty room inside perhaps he had expected us to follow him or perhaps he had meant us to delay long enough not to seem like a reenforcement these gentlemen missed the express at medora he observed to his men simply what they took us for upon our entrance i cannot say or what they believed the atmosphere of the caboose was charged with voiceless currents of thought by way of a friendly beginning to the three hundred miles of caboose we were now to share so intimately i recalled myself to them i trusted no more of the christian endeavor had delayed them i am so lucky to have caught you again i finished i was afraid my last chance of reaching the judges had gone thus i said a number of things designed to be agreeable but they met my small talk with the smallest talk you can have yes for instance and pretty well i guess and grave strikings of matches and thoughtful looks at the floor i suppose we had made twenty miles to the imperturbable clicking of the caboose when one at length asked his neighbor had he ever seen new york no said the other flooded with dudes aint it swimmin said the first leakin too said a third well my gracious said a fourth and beat his knee in private delight none of them ever looked at me for some reason i felt exceedingly ill at ease good clothes in new york said the third rich food said the first fresh eggs too said the third well my gracious said the fourth beating his knee why yes observed the virginian unexpectedly they tell me that aiggs there aint liable to be so rotten as yull strike em in this country none of them had a reply for this and new york was abandoned for some reason i felt much better it was a new line they adopted next led off by trampas going to the excitement he inquired selecting shorty excitement said shorty looking up going to rawhide trampas repeated and all watched shorty why im all adrift missin that express said shorty maybe i can give you employment suggested the virginian i am taking an outfit across the basin youll find most folks going to rawhide if you re looking for company pursued trampas fishing for a recruit how about rawhide anyway said scipio skillfully deflecting this missionary work are they taking much mineral out have yu seen any of the rock rock broke in the enthusiast who had beaten his knee there and he brought some from his pocket youre always showing your rock said trampas sulkily for scipio now held the conversation and shorty returned safely to his dozing hm went scipio at the rock he turned it back and forth in his hand looking it over he chucked and caught it slightingly in the air and handed it back porphyry i see that was his only word about it he said it cheerily he left no room for discussion you could not damn a thing worse ever been in santa rita pursued scipio while the enthusiast slowly pushed his rock back into his pocket thats down in new mexico ever been to globe arizona and scipio talked away about the mines he had known there was no getting at shorty any more that evening trampas was foiled of his fish or of learning how the fishs heart lay and by morning shorty had been carefully instructed to change his mind about once an hour this is apt to discourage all but very superior missionaries and i too escaped for the rest of this night at glendive we had a dim supper and i bought some blankets and after that it was late and sleep occupied the attention of us all we lay along the shelves of the caboose a peaceful sight i should think in that smoothly trundling cradle i slept almost immediately so tired that not even our stops or anything else waked me save once when the air i was breathing grew suddenly pure and i roused sitting in the door was the lonely figure of the virginian he leaned in silent contemplation of the occasional moon and beneath it the yellowstones swift ripples on the caboose shelves the others slept sound and still each stretched or coiled as he had first put himself they were not untrustworthy to look at it seemed to me except trampas you would have said the rest of that young humanity was average rough male blood merely needing to be told the proper things at the right time and one big bunchy stocking of the enthusiast stuck out of his blanket solemn and innocent and i laughed at it there was a light sound by the door and i found the virginians eye on me finding who it was he nodded and motioned with his hand to go to sleep and this i did with him in my sight still leaning in the open door through which came the interrupted moon and the swimming reaches of the yellowstone xvi the game and the nation last act it has happened to you has it not to wake in the morning and wonder for a while where on earth you are thus i came half to life in the caboose hearing voices but not the actual words at first but presently hathaway said some one more clearly portland this made no special stir in my intelligence and i drowsed off again to the pleasant rhythm of the wheels the little shock of stopping next brought me to somewhat with the voices still round me and when we were again in motion i heard rosebud portland these figures jarred me awake and i said it was before and sat up in my blankets the greeting they vouchsafed and the sight of them clustering expressionless in the caboose brought last evenings uncomfortable memory back to me our next stop revealed how things were going today forsythe one of them read on the station portland they were counting the lessening distance westward this was the undercurrent of war it broke on me as i procured fresh water at forsythe and made some toilet in their stolid presence we were drawing nearer the rawhide station the point i mean where you left the railway for the new mines now rawhide station lay this side of billings the broad path of desertion would open ready for their feet when the narrow path to duty and sunk creek was still some fifty miles more to wait here was trampass great strength he need make no move meanwhile but lie low for the immediate temptation to front and waylay them and win his battle over the deputy foreman but the virginian seemed to find nothing save enjoyment in this sunny september morning and ate his breakfast at forsythe serenely that meal done and that station gone our caboose took up again its easy trundle by the banks of the yellowstone the mutineers sat for a while digesting in idleness whats your scar inquired one at length inspecting casually the neck of his neighbor foolishness the other answered yourn mine well i dont know but i prefer to have myself to thank for a thing said the first i was displaying myself continued the second one day last summer it was we come on a big snake by torrey creek corral the boys got betting pretty lively that i dassent make my word good as to dealing with him so i loped my cayuse full tilt by mr snake and swung down and catched him up by the tail from the ground and cracked him same as a whip and snapped his head off youve saw it done he said to the audience the audience nodded wearily but the loose head flew agin me and the fangs caught i was pretty sick for a while it dont pay to be clumsy said the first man if youd snapped the snake away from yu instead of toward yu its head would have whirled off into the brush same as they do with me how like a knifecut your scar looks said i dont it said the snakesnapper theres many that gets fooled by it an antelope knows a snake is his enemy said another to me ever seen a buck circling round and round a rattler i have always wanted to see that said i heartily for this i knew to be a respectable piece of truth its worth seeing the man went on after the buck gets close in he gives an almighty jump up in the air and down comes his four hoofs in a bunch right on top of mr snake cuts him all to hash now you tell me how the buck knows that of course i could not tell him and again we sat in silence for a while friendlier silence i thought a skunkll kill yu worse than a snake bite said another presently no i dont mean that way he added for i had smiled there is a brown skunk down in arkansaw kind of prairiedog brown littler than our variety he is and he is mad the whole year round same as a dog gets only the dog has a spell and dies but this here arkansaw skunk is mad right along and it dont seem to interfere with his business in other respects well suppose youre camping out and suppose its a hot night or youre in a hurry and youve made camp late or anyway you havent got inside any tent but you have just bedded down in the open skunk comes travelling along and walks on your blankets youre warm he likes that same as a cat does and he tramps with pleasure and comfort same as a cat and you move you get bit thats all and you die of hydrophobia ask anybody most extraordinary said i but did you ever see a person die from this no sir never happened to my cousin at bald knob did died no sir saw a man but how do you know theyre not sick skunks no sir theyre well skunks well as anything youll not meet skunks in any state of the union more robust than them in arkansaw and thick thats awful true sighed another i have buried hundreds of dollars worth of clothes in arkansaw why didnt yu travel in a sponge bag inquired scipio and this brought a slight silence speakin of bites spoke up a new man hows that he held up his thumb my breathed scipio must have been a lion the man wore a wounded look i was huntin owl eggs for a botanist from boston he explained to me chiropodist werent he said scipio or maybe a sonnabulator no honest protested the man with the thumb so that i was sorry for him and begged him to go on ill listen to you i assured him and i wondered why this politeness of mine should throw one or two of them into stifled mirth scipio on the other hand gave me a disgusted look and sat back sullenly for a moment and then took himself out on the platform where the virginian was lounging the young feller wore kneepants and ever so thick spectacles with a halfmoon cut in em resumed the narrator and he carried a tin box strung to a strap i took for his lunch till it flew open on him and a horn toad hustled out then i was sure he was a botanist or whatever yu say theyre called well he would have owl eggs them little prairieowl that some claim can turn their head clean around and keep awatchin yu only thats nonsense we was ridin through that prairiedog town used to be on the flat just after yu crossed the south fork of powder river on the buffalo trail and i said id dig an owl nest out for him if he was willing to camp till id dug it i wanted to know about them owls some myself if they did live with the dogs and snakes yu know he broke off appealing to me oh yes i told him eagerly so while the botanist went glarin around the town with his glasses to see if he could spot a prairiedog and an owl usin the same hole i was diggin in a hole id seen an owl run down and thats what i got he held up his thumb again the snake i exclaimed yes sir mr rattler was keepin house that day took me right there i hauled him out of the hole hangin to me eight rattles eight said i a big one yes sir thought i was dead but the woman the woman said i yes woman didnt i tell yu the botanist had his wife along well he did and she acted better than the man for he was rosin his head and shoutin he had no whiskey and he didnt guess his knife was sharp enough to amputate my thumb and none of us chewed and the doctor was twenty miles away and if he had only remembered to bring his ammonia well he was screeching out most everything he knew in the world and without arranging it any neither but she just clawed his pocket and burrowed and kep yelling give him the stone augustus and she whipped out one of them injun medicinestones first one i ever seen and she clapped it on to my thumb and it started in right away what did it do said i sucked like blottingpaper does soft and funny it was and gray they get em from elks stomachs yu know and when it had sucked the poison out of the wound off it falls of my thumb by itself and i thanked the woman for saving my life that capable and keeping her head that cool i never knowed how excited she had been till afterward she was awful shocked i suppose she started to talk when the danger was over said i with deep silence around me no she didnt say nothing to me but when her next child was born it had eight rattles din now rose wild in the caboose they rocked together the enthusiast beat his knee tumultuously and i joined them who could help it it had been so well conducted from the imperceptible beginning fact and falsehood blended with such perfect art and this last an effect so new made with such worldold material i cared nothing that i was the victim and i joined them but ceased feeling suddenly somehow estranged or chilled it was in their laughter the loudness was too loud and i caught the eyes of trampas fixed upon the virginian with exultant malevolence scipios disgusted glance was upon me from the door dazed by these signs i went out on the platform to get away from the noise there the virginian said to me cheer up youll not be so easy for em thataway next season he said no more and with his legs dangled over the railing appeared to resume his newspaper whats the matter said i to scipio oh i dont mind if he dont scipio answered couldnt yu see i tried to head em off from yu all i knew but yu just ran in among em yourself couldnt yu see kep hinderin and spoilin me with askin those urgent questions of yourn why i had to let yu go your way why that wasnt the ordinary play with the ordinary tenderfoot they treated you to you aint a common tenderfoot this trip youre the foremans friend theyve hit him through you thats the way they count it its made them encouraged cant yu see scipio stated it plainly and as we ran by the next station howard they harshly yelled portland we had been passing gangs of workmen on the track and at that last yell the virginian rose i reckon ill join the meeting again he said this filling and repairing looks like the washout might have been true washout said scipio big horn bridge they say four days ago then i wish it came this side rawhide station do yu drawled the virginian and smiling at scipio he lounged in through the open door he beats me said scipio shaking his head his trail is turruble hard to anticipate we listened work bein done on the road i see the virginian was saying very friendly and conversational we see it too said the voice of trampas seem to be easin their grades some roads do cheaper to build em the way they want em at the start a man would think suggested the virginian most friendly there go some more italians theyre chinese said trampas thats so acknowledged the virginian with a laugh whats he monkeyin at now muttered scipio without cheap foreigners they couldnt afford all this hyeh new gradin the southerner continued grading cant you tell when a floods been eating the banks why yes said the virginian sweet as honey but aint yu heard of the improvements west of big timber all the way to missoula this season im talkin about them oh talking about them yes ive heard good moneysavin scheme aint it said the virginian lettin a freight run down one hill an up the next as far as shell go without steam an shavin the hill down to that point now this was an honest engineering fact bettern settin dudes squintin through telescopes and cypherin over one per cent reductions the southerner commented its common sense assented trampas have you heard the new scheme about the watertanks i aint right certain said the southerner i must watch this said scipio or i shall bust he went in and so did i they were all sitting over this discussion of the northern pacifics recent policy as to betterments as though they were the board of directors pins could have dropped only nobody would have cared to hear a pin they used to put all their tanks at the bottom of their grades said trampas why yu get the water easier at the bottom you can pump it to the top though said trampas growing superior and its cheaper that gets me said the virginian interested trains after watering can start down hill now and get the benefit of the gravity itll cut down operating expenses a heap thats certnly common sense exclaimed the virginian absorbed but aint it kind o tardy live and learn so they gained speed too high speed on half the coal this season until the accident accident said the virginian instantly yellowstone limited man fired at engine driver train was flying past that quick the bullet broke every window and killed a passenger on the back platform youve been running too much with aristocrats finished trampas and turned on his heel haw hew began the enthusiast but his neighbor gripped him to silence this was a triumph too serious for noise not a mutineer moved and i felt cold trampas said the virginian i thought yud be afeared to try it on me trampas whirled round his hand was at his belt afraid he sneered shorty said scipio sternly and leaping upon that youth took his halfdrawn pistol from him im obliged to yu said the virginian to scipio trampass hand left his belt he threw a slight easy look at his men and keeping his back to the virginian walked out on the platform and sat on the chair where the virginian had sat so much dont you comprehend said the virginian to shorty amiably that this hyeh question has been discussed peaceable by civilized citizens now you sit down and be good and mr le moyne will return your gun when were across that broken bridge if they have got it fixed for heavy trains yet this train will be lighter when it gets to that bridge spoke trampas out on his chair why thats true too said the virginian maybe none of us are crossin that big horn bridge now except me funny if yu should end by persuadin me to quit and go to rawhide myself but i reckon ill not i reckon ill worry along to sunk creek somehow dont forget im cookin for yu said scipio gruffy im obliged to yu said the southerner you were speaking of a job for me said shorty im right obliged but yu see i aint exackly foreman the way this comes out and my promises might not bind judge henry to pay salaries a push came through the train from forward we were slowing for the rawhide station and all began to be busy and to talk going up to the mines today oh lets grub first guess its too late anyway and so forth while they rolled and roped their bedding and put on their coats with a good deal of elbow motion and otherwise showed off it was wasted the virginian did not know what was going on in the caboose he was leaning and looking out ahead and scipios puzzled eye never left him and as we halted for the watertank the southerner exclaimed they ain t got away yet as if it were good news to him he meant the delayed trains four stalled expresses were in front of us besides several freights and two hours more at least before the bridge would be ready travellers stood and sat about forlorn near the cars out in the sagebrush anywhere people in hats and spurs watched them and indian chiefs offered them painted bows and arrows and shiny horns i reckon them passengers would prefer a laig o mutton said the virginian to a man loafing near the caboose bet your life said the man first lot has been stuck here four days plumb starved aint they inquired the virginian bet your life theyve eat up their dining cars and theyve eat up this town well said the virginian looking at the town i expaict the diningcyars contained more nourishment say youre about right there said the man he walked beside the caboose as we puffed slowly forward from the watertank to our siding fine business here if wed only been ready he continued and the crow agent has let his indians come over from the reservation there has been a little beef brought in and game and fish and big money in it bet your life them eastern passengers has just been robbed i wisht i had somethin to sell anything starting for rawhide this afternoon said trampas out of the caboose door not until morning said the man you going to the mines he resumed to the virginian why answered the southerner slowly and casually and addressing himself strictly to the man while trampas on his side paid obvious inattention this hyeh delay yu see may unsettle our plans some but itll be one of two ways were all goin to rawhide or were all goin to billings were all one party yu see trampas laughed audibly inside the door as he rejoined his men let him keep up appearances i heard him tell them it dont hurt us what he says to strangers but im goin to eat hearty either way continued the virginian and i ain goin to be robbed ive been kind o promisin myself a treat if we stopped hyeh towns eat clean out said the man so yu tell me but all you folks has forgot one source of revenue that yu have right close by mighty handy if you have got a gunny sack ill show you how to make some money bet your life said the man mr le moyne said the virginian the outfits cookin stuff is aboard and if youll get the fire ready well try how frawgs laigs go fried he walked off at once the man following like a dog inside the caboose rose a gust of laughter frogs muttered scipio and then turning a blank face to me frogs colonel cyrus jones had them on his bill of fare i said frogs legs a la delmonico shoo i didnt get up that thing they had it when i came never looked at it frogs he went down the steps very slowly with a long frown reaching the ground he shook his head that mans trail is surely hard to anticipate he said but i must hurry up that fire for his appearance has given me encouragement scipio concluded and became brisk shorty helped him and i brought wood trampas and the other people strolled off to the station a compact band our little fire was built beside the caboose so the cooking things might be easily reached and put back you would scarcely think such operations held any interest even for the hungry when there seemed to be nothing to cook a few sticks blazing tamely in the dust a fryingpan half a tin bucket of lard some water and barren plates and knives and forks and three silent men attending to them that was all but the travellers came to see these waifs drew near us and stood a sad lone shifting fringe of audience four to begin with and then two wandered away and presently one of these came back finding it worse elsewhere supper boys said he breakfast said scipio crossly and no more of them addressed us i heard them joylessly mention wall street to each other and saratoga i even heard the name bryn mawr which is near philadelphia but these fragments of home dropped in the wilderness here in montana beside a freight caboose were of no interest to me now looks like frogs down there too said scipio see them marshy slogs full of weeds we took a little turn and had a sight of the virginian quite active among the ponds hush im getting some thoughts continued scipio he wasnt sorry enough dont interrupt me im not said i no but id most caught ahold and scipio muttered to himself again he wasnt sorry enough presently he swore loud and brilliantly tell yu he cried what did he say to trampas after that play they exchanged over railroad improvements and trampas put the josh on him didnt he say trampas i thought youd be afraid to do it well sir trampas had better have been afraid and thats what he meant theres where he was bringin it to trampas made an awful bad play then you wait glory but hes a knowin man course he wasnt sorry i guess he had the hardest kind of work to look as sorry as he did you wait wait what for go on man what for i dont know i dont know whatever hand hes been holdin up this is the showdown hes played for a showdown here before the caboose gets off the bridge come back to the fire or shortyll be leavin it go out grow happy some shorty he cried on arriving and his hand cracked on shortys shoulder suppers in sight shorty food for reflection none for the stomach asked the passenger who had spoken once before were figuring on that too said scipio his crossness had melted entirely away why theyre cowboys exclaimed another passenger and he moved nearer from the station trampas now came back his herd following him less compactly they had found famine and no hope of supplies until the next train from the east this was no fault of trampass but they were following him less compactly they carried one piece of cheese the size of a fist the weight of a brick the hue of a corpse and the passengers seeing it exclaimed theres old faithful again and took off their hats you gentlemen met that cheese before then said scipio delighted its been offered me three times a day for four days said the passenger did he want a dollar or a dollar and a half two dollars blurted out the enthusiast and all of us save trampas fell into fits of imbecile laughter here comes our grub anyway said scipio looking off toward the marshes and his hilarity sobered away in a moment well the train will be in soon stated trampas i guess well get a decent supper without frogs all interest settled now upon the virginian he was coming with his man and his gunny sack and the gunny sack hung from his shoulder heavily as a full sack should he took no notice of the gathering but sat down and partly emptied the sack there said he very businesslike to his assistant thats all well want i think youll find a ready market for the balance well my gracious said the enthusiast what fool eats a frog oh im fool enough for a tadpole cried the passenger and they began to take out their pocketbooks you can cook yours right hyeh gentlemen said the virginian with his slow southern courtesy the diningcyars dont look like they were fired up how much will you sell a couple for inquired the enthusiast the virginian looked at him with friendly surprise why help yourself were all together yet awhile help yourselves he repeated to trampas and his followers these hung back a moment then with a slinking motion set the cheese upon the earth and came forward nearer the fire to receive some supper it wont scarcely be delmonico style said the virginian to the passengers nor yet saynt augustine he meant the great augustin the traditional chef of philadelphia whose history i had sketched for him at colonel cyrus joness eating palace scipio now officiated his fryingpan was busy and prosperous odors rose from it run for a bucket of fresh water shorty the virginian continued beginning his meal colonel yu cook pretty near good if yu had sold em as advertised yud have certnly made a name several were now eating with satisfaction but not scipio it was all that he could do to cook straight the whole man seemed to glisten his eye was shut to a slit once more while the innocent passengers thankfully swallowed now you see you have made some money began the virginian to the native who had helped him get the frogs bet your life exclaimed the man divvy wont you and he held out half his gains keep em returned the southerner i reckon were square but i expaict theyll not equal delmonicos seh he said to a passenger dont trust the judgment of a man as hungry as i am exclaimed the traveller with a laugh and he turned to his fellowtravellers did you ever enjoy supper at delmonicos more than this never they sighed why look here said the traveller what fools the people of this town are here weve been all these starving days and you come and get ahead of them thats right easy explained said the virginian ive been where there was big money in frawgs and they aint been theyre all cattle hyeh talk cattle think cattle and theyre bankrupt in consequence fallen through aint that so he inquired of the native thats about the way said the man its mighty hard to do what your neighbors aint doin pursued the virginian montana is all cattle an these folks must be cattle an never notice the country right hyeh is too small for a range an swampy anyway an just waitin to be a frawg ranch at this all wore a face of careful reserve im not claimin to be smarter than you folks hyeh said the virginian deprecatingly to his assistant but travellin learns a man many customs you wouldnt do the business they done at tulare california north side o the lake they certnly utilized them hopeless swamps splendid of course they put up big capital and went into it scientific gettin advice from the government fish commission an such like knowledge yu see they had big markets for their frawgs san francisco los angeles and clear to new york afteh the southern pacific was through but up hyeh yu could sell to passengers every day like yu done this one day they would get to know yu along the line competing swamps are scarce the diningcyars would take your frawgs and yu would have the yellowstone park for four months in the year them hotels are anxious to please an they would buy off yu what their eastern patrons esteem as fineeatin and you folks would be sellin something instead o nothin thats a practical idea said a traveller and little cost and little cost said the virginian would eastern people eat frogs inquired the man look at us said the traveller delmonico doesnt give yu such a treat said the virginian not exactly the traveller exclaimed how much would be paid for frogs said trampas to him and i saw scipio bend closer to his cooking oh i dont know said the traveller weve paid pretty well you see youre late for tulare trampas said the virginian i was not thinking of tulare trampas retorted scipios nose was in the fryingpan mos comical spot you ever struck said the virginian looking round upon the whole company he allowed himself a broad smile of retrospect to hear em talk frawgs at tulare same as other folks talks hawsses or steers or whatever theyre raising to sell yud fall into it yourselves if yu started the business anything a mans bread and butter depends on hes going to be earnest about dont care if it is a frawg thats so said the native and it paid good the only money in the county was right there answered the virginian it was a dead county and only frawgs was movin but that business was afannin to beat four of a kind it made yu feel strange at first as i said for all the men had been cattlemen at one time or another till yu got accustomed it would give most anybody a shock to hear em speak about herdin the bulls in a pasture by themselves the virginian allowed himself another smile but became serious again that was their policy he explained except at certain times o year they kept the bulls separate the fish commission told em theyd better and it certnly worked mighty well it or something did for gentlemen hush but there was millions youd have said all the frawgs in the world had taken charge at tulare and the money rolled in gentlemen hush twas a gold mine for the owners forty per cent they netted some years and they paid generous wages for they could sell to all them french restaurants in san francisco yu see and there was the cliff house and the palace hotel made it a specialty and the officers took frawgs at the presidio an angel island an alcatraz an benicia los angeles was beginnin its boom the cornerlot sharps wanted something by way of varnish an so they dazzled eastern investors with advertisin tulare frawgs clear to new orleans an new york twas only in sacramento frawgs was dull i expaict the california legislature was too ornry for them fineraised luxuries they tell of one of them senators that he raked a million out of los angeles real estate and started in for a bangup meal with champagne wanted to scatter his new gold thick an quick but he got astray among all the fancy dishes an just yelled right out before the ladies damn it bring me forty dollars worth of ham and aiggs he was a funny senator now the virginian paused and finished eating a leg and then with diabolic art he made a feint at wandering to new fields of anecdote talkin of senators he resumed senator wise how much did you say wages were at tulare inquired one of the trampas faction how much why i never knew what the foreman got the regular hands got a hundred senator wise a hundred a month why it was wet an muddy work yu see a man risked rheumatism some he risked it a good deal well i was going to tell about senator wise when senator wise was speaking of his visit to alaska forty per cent was it said trampas oh i must call my wife said the traveller behind me this is what i came west for and he hurried away not forty per cent the bad years replied the virginian the frawgs had enemies same as cattle i remember when a pelican got in the spring pasture and the herd broke through the fence fence said a passenger ditch seh and wire net every pasture was a square swamp with a ditch around and a wire net yuve heard the mournful mixedup sound a big bunch of cattle will make well seh as yu druv from the railroad to the tulare frawg ranch yu could hear em a mile springtime theyd sing like girls in the organ loft and by august they were about ready to hire out for bass and all was fit to be soloists if im a judge but in a bad year it might only be twenty per cent the pelican rushed em from the pasture right into the san joaquin river which was close by the property the big balance of the herd stampeded and though of course they came out on the banks again the news had went around and folks below at hemlen eat most of em just to spite the company yu see a frawg in a river is more hopeless than any maverick loose on the range and they never struck any plan to brand their stock and prove ownership well twenty per cent is good enough for me said trampas if rawhide dont suit me a hundred a month said the enthusiast and busy calculations began to arise among them it went to fifty per cent pursued the virginian when new york and philadelphia got to biddin agaynst each other both cities had signs all over em claiming to furnish the tulare frawg and both had em all right and same as cattle trains yud see frawg trains tearing acrosst arizona big glass tanks with wire over em through to new york an the frawgs starin out why george whispered a womans voice behind me hes merely deceiving them hes merely making that stuff up out of his head yes my dear thats merely what hes doing well i dont see why you imagined i should care for this i think ill go back better see it out daisy this beats the geysers or anything were likely to find in the yellowstone then i wish we had gone to bar harbor as usual said the lady and she returned to her pullman but her husband stayed indeed the male crowd now was a goodly sight to see how the men edged close drawn by a common tie their different kinds of feet told the strength of the bond yellow sleepingcar slippers planted miscellaneous and motionless near a pair of mexican spurs all eyes watched the virginian and gave him their entire sympathy though they could not know his motive for it what he was doing had fallen as light upon them all except the excited calculators these were loudly making their fortunes at both rawhide and tulare drugged by their satanically aroused hopes of gold heedless of the slippers and the spurs had a man given any sign to warn them i think he would have been lynched even the indian chiefs had come to see in their show war bonnets and blankets they naturally understood nothing of it yet magnetically knew that the virginian was the great man and they watched him with approval he sat by the fire with the fryingpan looking his daily self engaging and saturnine and now as trampas declared tickets to california would be dear and rawhide had better come first the southerner let loose his heavenborn imagination theres a better reason for rawhide than tickets trampas said he i said it was too late for tulare i heard you said trampas opinions may differ you and i dont think alike on several points gawd trampas said the virginian d yu reckon id be rotting hyeh on forty dollars if tulare was like it used to be tulare is broke what broke it your leaving revenge broke it and disease said the virginian striking the fryingpan on his knee for the frogs were all gone at those lurid words their untamed child minds took fire and they drew round him again to hear a tale of blood the crowd seemed to lean nearer but for a short moment it threatened to be spoiled a passenger came along demanding in an important voice where are these frogs he was a prominent new york afterdinner speaker they whispered me and out for a holiday in his private car reaching us and walking to the virginian he said cheerily how much do you want for your frogs my friend you got a friend hyeh said the virginian thats good for yu need care taken of yu and the prominent afterdinner speaker did not further discommode us thats worth my trip whispered a new york passenger to me yes it was a case of revenge resumed the virginian and disease there was a man named saynt augustine got run out of domingo which is a dago island he come to philadelphia an he was dead broke but saynt augustine was a live man an he saw philadelphia was full o quakers that dressed plain an eat humdrum so he started cookin domingo way for em an they caught right ahold terrapin he gave em an croakeets an hed use forty chickens to make a broth he called consommay an he got rich and philadelphia got well known an delmonico in new york he got jealous he was the cook that had the sayso in new york was delmonico one of them italians inquired a fascinated mutineer i dont know but he acted like one lorenzo was his front name he aimed to cut domingos throat breathed the enthusiast aimed to cut away the trade from saynt augustine an put philadelphia back where he thought she belonged frawgs was the fashionable rage then these foreign cooks set the fashion in eatin same as foreign dressmakers do womens clothes both cities was catchin and swallowin all the frawgs tulare could throw at em so he lorenzo said the enthusiast yes lorenzo delmonico he bid a dollar a tank higher an saynt augustine raised him fifty cents an lorenzo raised him a dollar an saynt augustine shoved her up three lorenzo he didnt expect philadelphia would go that high and he got hot in the collar an flew round his kitchen in new york an claimed hed twist saynt augustines domingo tail for him and crack his ossified system lorenzo raised his language to a high temperature they say an then quite sudden off he starts for tulare he buys tickets over the santa fe and he goes afannin and afoggin but gentlemen hush the very same day saynt augustine he tears out of philadelphia he travelled by the way o washington an out he comes afannin an afoggin over the southern pacific of course tulare didnt know nothin of this all it knowed was how the frawg market was on soarin wings and it was feelin like a flight o rawckets if only thered been some preparation a telegram or something the disaster would never have occurred but lorenzo and saynt augustine was that absorbed watchin each other for yu see the santa fe and the southern pacific come together at mojave an the two cooks travelled a matter of two hundred an ten miles in the same cyar they never thought about a telegram and when they arruv breathless an started in to screechin what theyd give for the monopoly why them unsuspectin tulare boys got amused at em i never heard just all they done but they had lorenzo singin and dancin while saynt augustine played the fiddle for him and one of lorenzos heels did get a trifle grazed well them two cooks quit that ranch without disclosin their identity and soon as they got to a safe distance they swore eternal friendship in their excitable foreign way and they went home over the union pacific sharing the same stateroom their revenge killed frawgs the disease how killed frogs demanded trampas just killed em delmonico and saynt augustine wiped frawgs off the slate of fashion not a banker in fifth avenuell touch one now if another bankers around watchin him and if ever yu see a man that hides his feet an wont take off his socks in company he has worked in them tulare swamps an got the disease catch him wadin and yull find hes webfooted frawgs are dead trampas and so are you rise up liars and salute your king yelled scipio oh im in love with you and he threw his arms round the virginian let me shake hands with you said the traveller who had failed to interest his wife in these things i wish i was going to have more of your company thank ye seh said the virginian other passengers greeted him and the indian chiefs came saying how because they followed their feelings without understanding dont show so humbled boys said the deputy foreman to his most sheepish crew these gentlemen from the east have been enjoying yu some i know but think what a weary wait they have had hyeh and you insisted on playing the game with me this way yu see what outlet did yu give me didnt i have it to do and ill tell yu one thing for your consolation when i got to the middle of the frawgs i most believed it myself and he laughed out the first laugh i had heard him give the enthusiast came up and shook hands that led off and the rest followed with trampas at the end the tide was too strong for him he was not a graceful loser but he got through this and the virginian eased him down by treating him precisely like the others apparently possibly the supreme the most american moment of all was when word came that the bridge was open and the pullman trains with noise and triumph began to move westward at last every one waved farewell to every one craning from steps and windows so that the cars twinkled with hilarity and in twenty minutes the whole procession in front had moved and our turn came last chance for rawhide said the virginian last chance for sunk creek said a reconstructed mutineer and all sprang aboard there was no question who had won his spurs now our caboose trundled on to billings along the shingly cottonwooded yellowstone and as the plains and bluffs and the distant snow began to grow well known even to me we turned to our baggage that was to come off since camp would begin in the morning thus i saw the virginian carefully rewrapping kenilworth that he might bring it to its owner unharmed and i said dont you think you could have played poker with queen elizabeth no i expaict shed have beat me he replied she was a lady it was at billings on this day that i made those reflections about equality for the virginian had been equal to the occasion that is the only kind of equality which i recognize xvii scipio moralizes into what mood was it that the virginian now fell being less busy did he begin to grieve about the girl on bear creek i only know that after talking so lengthily he fell into a nine days silence the talking part of him deeply and unbrokenly slept official words of course came from him as we rode southward from the railroad gathering the judges stray cattle during the many weeks since the spring roundup some of these animals had as usual got very far off their range and getting them on again became the present business of our party directions and commands whatever communications to his subordinates were needful to the forwarding of this he duly gave but routine has never at any time of the world passed for conversation his utterances such as well work willo creek tomorro mawnin or i want the wagon to be at the fawks o stinkin water by thursday though on some occasions numerous enough to sound like discourse never once broke the mans true silence seeming to keep easy company with the camp he yet kept altogether to himself that talking part of him the mood which brings out for you your friends spirit and mind as a free gift or as an exchange was down in some dark cave of his nature hidden away perhaps it had been dreaming perhaps completely reposing the virginian was one of those rare ones who are able to refresh themselves in sections to have a thing on his mind did not keep his body from resting during our recent journey it felt years ago now while our caboose on the freight train had trundled endlessly westward and the men were on the ragged edge the very jumpingoff place of mutiny and possible murder i had seen him sleep like a child he snatched the moments not necessary for vigil i had also seen him sit all night watching his responsibility ready to spring on it and fasten his teeth in it and now that he had confounded them with their own attempted weapon of ridicule his powers seemed to be profoundly dormant that final pitched battle of wits had made the men his captives and admirers all save trampas and of him the virginian did not seem to be aware but scipio le moyne would say to me now and then if i was trampas id pull my freight and once he added pull it kind of casual yu know like i wasnt noticing myself do it yes our friend shorty murmured pregnantly with his eye upon the quiet virginian hes sure studying his revenge studying your pussycat said scipio he knows what hell do the time aint arrived this was the way they felt about it and not unnaturally this was the way they made me the inexperienced easterner feel about it that trampas also felt something about it was easy to know like the leaven which leavens the whole lump one spot of sulkiness in camp will spread its dull flavor through any company that sits near it and we had to sit near trampas at meals for nine days his sullenness was not wonderful to feel himself forsaken by his recent adherents to see them gone over to his enemy could not have made his reflections pleasant why he did not take himself off to other climes pull his freight casual as scipio said i can explain only thus pay was due him time as it was called in cowland if he would have this money he must stay under the virginians command until the judges ranch on sunk creek should be reached meanwhile each days work added to the wages in store for him and finally once at sunk creek it would be no more the virginian who commanded him it would be the real ranch foreman at the ranch he would be the virginians equal again both of them taking orders from their officially recognized superior this foreman shortys word about revenge seemed to me like putting the thing backwards revenge as i told scipio was what i should be thinking about if i were trampas he dassent was scipios immediate view not till hes got strong again he got laughed plumb sick by the bystanders and whatever spirit he had was broke in the presence of us all hell have to recuperate scipio then spoke of the virginians attitude maybe revenge aint just the right word for where this affair has got to now with him when yu beat another man at his own game like he done to trampas why yuve had all the revenge yu can want unless youre a hog and hes no hog but he has got it in for trampas theyve not reckoned to a finish would you let a man try such spitework on you and quit thinkin about him just because yud headed him off to this i offered his own notion about hogs and being satisfied hogs went on scipio in a way that dashed my suggestion to pieces hogs aint in the case hes got to deal with trampas somehow man to man trampas and him cant stay this way when they get back and go workin same as they worked before no sir ive seen his eye twice and i know hes goin to reckon to a finish i still must in scipios opinion have been slow to understand when on the afternoon following this talk i invited him to tell me what sort of finish he wanted after such a finishing as had been dealt trampas already getting laughed plumb sick by the bystanders i borrowed his own not overstated expression seemed to me a highly final finishing while i was running my notions off to him scipio rose and with the fryingpan he had been washing walked slowly at me i do believe youd oughtnt to be let travel alone the way you do he put his face close to mine his long nose grew eloquent in its shrewdness while the fire in his bleached blue eye burned with amiable satire what has come and gone between them two has only settled the one point he was aimin to make he was appointed boss of this outfit in the absence of the regular foreman since then all he has been playin for is to hand back his men to the ranch in as good shape as theyd been handed to him and without losing any on the road through desertion or shooting or what not he had to kick his cook off the train that day and the loss made him sorrowful i could see but id happened to come along and he jumped me into the vacancy and i expect he is pretty near consoled and as boss of the outfit he beat trampas who was settin up for opposition boss and the outfit is better than satisfied it come out that way and theyre stayin with him and hell hand them all back in good condition barrin that lost cook so for the present his point is made yu see but look ahead a little it may not be so very far ahead yull have to look we get back to the ranch hes not boss there any more his responsibility is over he is just one of us again taking orders from a foreman they tell me has showed partiality to trampas moren a few times partiality thats what trampas is plainly trusting to trusting it will fix him all right and fix his enemy all wrong hed not otherwise dare to keep sour like hes doing partiality d yu think itll scare off the enemy scipio looked across a little creek to where the virginian was helping throw the gathered cattle on the bedground what odds he pointed the fryingpan at the southerner d yu figure trampass being under any foremans wing will make to a man like him hes going to remember mr trampas and his spitework if hes got to tear him out from under the wing and maybe tear off the wing in the operation and i am goin to advise your folks ended the complete scipio not to leave you travel so much alone not till youve learned more life he had made me feel my inexperience convinced me of innocence undoubtedly and during the final days of our journey i no longer invoked his aid to my reflections upon this especial topic what would the virginian do to trampas would it be another intellectual crushing of him like the frog story or would there be something this time more material say muscle or possibly gunpowder in it and was scipio after all infallible i didnt pretend to understand the virginian after several years knowledge of him he remained utterly beyond me scipios experience was not yet three weeks long so i let him alone as to all this discussing with him most other things good and evil in the world and being convinced of much further innocence for scipios twenty odd years were indeed a library of life i have never met a better heart a shrewder wit and looser morals with yet a native sense of decency and duty somewhere hard and fast enshrined but all the while i was wondering about the virginian eating with him sleeping with him only not so sound as he did and riding beside him often for many hours experiments in conversation i did make and failed one day particularly while after a sudden storm of hail had chilled the earth numb and white like winter in fifteen minutes we sat drying and warming ourselves by a fire that we built i touched upon that theme of equality on which i knew him to hold opinions as strong as mine oh he would reply and certnly and when i asked him what it was in a man that made him a leader of men he shook his head and puffed his pipe so then noticing how the sun had brought the earth in half an hour back from winter to summer again i spoke of our american climate it was a potent drug i said for millions to be swallowing every day yes said he wiping the damp from his winchester rifle our american climate i said had worked remarkable changes at least yes he said and did not ask what they were so i had to tell him it has made successful politicians of the irish thats one and it has given our whole race the habit of poker bang went his winchester the bullet struck close to my left i sat up angrily thats the first foolish thing i ever saw you do i said yes he drawled slowly id ought to have done it sooner he was pretty near lively again and then he picked up a rattlesnake six feet behind me it had been numbed by the hail part revived by the sun and he had shot its head off xviii would you be a parson after this i gave up my experiments in conversation so that by the final afternoon of our journey with sunk creek actually in sight and the great grasshoppers slatting their dry song over the sagebrush and the time at hand when the virginian and trampas would be man to man my thoughts rose to a considerable pitch of speculation and now that talking part of the virginian which had been nine days asleep gave its first yawn and stretch of waking without preface he suddenly asked me would you be a parson i was mentally so far away that i couldnt get back in time to comprehend or answer before he had repeated what would yu take to be a parson he drawled it out in his gentle way precisely as if no nine days stood between it and our last real intercourse take i was still vaguely moving in my distance how his next question brought me home i expect the popes is the biggest of them parson jobs it was with an oh that i now entirely took his idea well yes decidedly the biggest beats the english one archbishop aint it of canterbury the pope comes ahead of him his holiness would say so if his grace did not the virginian turned half in his saddle to see my face i was at the moment riding not quite abreast of him and i saw the gleam of his teeth beneath his mustache it was seldom i could make him smile even to this slight extent but his eyes grew with his next words remote again in their speculation his holiness and his grace now if i was to hear em namin me thataway every mawnin id scacely get down to business oh youd get used to the pride of it tisnt the pride the laugh is what would ruin me twould take most all my attention keeping a straight face the archbishop here he took one of his wide mental turns is apt to be a big man in them shakespeare plays kings take talk from him theyd not stand from anybody else and he talks fine frequently about the bees for instance when henry is going to fight france he tells him a beehive is similar to a kingdom i learned that piece the virginian could not have expected to blush at uttering these last words he knew that his sudden color must tell me in whose book it was he had learned the piece was not her copy of kenilworth even now in his cherishing pocket so he now to cover his blush very deliberately recited to me the archbishops discourse upon bees and their kingdom where some like magistrates correct at home others like soldiers armed in their stings make loot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor he busied in his majesty surveys the singing masons building roofs of gold aint that a fine description of bees aworkin the singing masons building roofs of gold puts em right before yu and is poetry without bein foolish his holiness and his grace well they could not hire me for either o those positions how many religions are there all over the earth yu can begin with ourselves right hyeh at home i know theres romanists and episcopals two kinds i put in at least two of episcopals thats three then methodists and baptists and three methodists well you do the countin i accordingly did it feeling my revolving memory slip cogs all the way round anyhow there are safely fifteen fifteen he held this fact a moment and they dont worship a whole heap o different gods like the ancients did oh no its just the same one the same one the virginian folded his hands over the horn of his saddle and leaned forward upon them in contemplation of the wide beautiful landscape one god and fifteen religions was his reflection thats a right smart of religions for just one god this way of reducing it was if obvious to him so novel to me that my laugh evidently struck him as a louder and livelier comment than was required he turned on me as if i had somehow perverted the spirit of his words i aint religious i know that but i aint unreligious and i know that too so do i know it my friend do you think there ought to be fifteen varieties of good people his voice while it now had an edge that could cut anything it came against was still not raised there aint fifteen there aint two theres one kind and when i meet it i respect it it is not praying nor preaching that has ever caught me and made me ashamed of myself but one or two people i have knowed that never said a superior word to me they thought more o me than i deserved and that made me behave better than i naturally wanted to made me quit a girl onced in time for her not to lose her good name and so thats one thing i have never done and if ever i was to have a son or somebody i set store by i would wish their lot to be to know one or two good folks mighty well men or women women preferred he had looked away again to the hills behind sunk creek ranch to which our walking horses had now almost brought us as for parsons the gesture of his arm was a disclaiming one i reckon some parsons have a right to tell yu to be good the bishop of this hyeh territory has a right but ill tell yu this a middlin doctor is a pore thing and a middlin lawyer is a pore thing but keep me from a middlin man of god once again he had reduced it but i did not laugh this time i thought there should in truth be heavy damages for malpractice on human souls but the hot glow of his words and the vision of his deepest inner man it revealed faded away abruptly what do yu make of the proposition yondeh as he pointed to the cause of this question he had become again his daily engaging saturnine self then i saw over in a fenced meadow to which we were now close what he was pleased to call the proposition proposition in the west does in fact mean whatever you at the moment please an offer to sell you a mine a cloudburst a glass of whiskey a steamboat this time it meant a stranger clad in black and of a clerical deportment which would in that atmosphere and to a watchful eye be visible for a mile or two i reckoned yu hadnt noticed him was the virginians reply to my ejaculation yes he set me goin on the subject a while back i expect he is another missionary to us pore cowboys i seemed from a hundred yards to feel the strangers forceful personality it was in his walk i should better say stalk as he promenaded along the creek his hands were behind his back and there was an air of waiting of displeased waiting in his movement yes hell be a missionary said the virginian conclusively and he took to singing or rather to whining with his head tilted at an absurd angle upward at the sky dar is a big carlina nigger about de size of dis chile or praps a little bigger by de name of jim crow dat what de white folks call him if ever i sees him i tends for to maul him just to let de white folks see such an animos as he cant walk around the streets and scandalize me the lane which was conducting us to the group of ranch buildings now turned a corner of the meadow and the virginian went on with his second verse great big fool he hasnt any knowledge gosh how could he when hes never been to scollege neither has i but ise come mighty nigh i peaked through de door as i went by he was beginning a third stanza but stopped short a horse had neighed close behind us trampas said he without turning his head we are home it looks that way some ten yards were between ourselves and trampas where he followed and ill trouble yu for my rope yu took this mawnin instead o your own i dont know as its your rope ive got trampas skilfully spoke this so that a precisely opposite meaning flowed from his words if it was discussion he tried for he failed the virginians hand moved and for one thick flashing moment my thoughts were evidently also the thoughts of trampas but the virginian only held out to trampas the rope which he had detached from his saddle take your hand off your gun trampas if i had wanted to kill yu youd be lying nine days back on the road now heres your rope did yu expect id not know it its the only one in camp the stiffness aint all drug out of yet or maybe yu expected me to notice and not take notice i dont spend my time in expectations about you if the virginian wheeled his horse across the road yure talkin too soon after reachin safety trampas i didnt tell yu to hand me that rope this mawnin because i was busy i aint foreman now and i want that rope trampas produced a smile as skilful as his voice well i guess your having mine proves this one is yours he rode up and received the coil which the virginian held out unloosing the disputed one on his saddle if he had meant to devise a slippery evasive insult no small trick in cowland could be more offensive than this taking another mans rope and it is the small tricks which lead to the big bullets trampas put a smooth coating of plausibility over the whole transaction after the rope corral we had to make this morning his tone was mock explanatory the ropes was all strewed round camp and in the hustle i pardon me said a sonorous voice behind us do you happen to have seen judge henry it was the reverend gentleman in his meadow come to the fence as we turned round to him he spoke on with much rotund authority in his eye from his answer to my letter judge henry undoubtedly expects me here i have arrived from fetterman according to my plan which i announced to him to find that he has been absent all day absent the whole day the virginian sat sidewise to talk one long straight leg supporting him on one stirrup the other bent at ease the boot half lifted from its dangling stirrup he made himself the perfection of courtesy the judge is frequently absent all night seh scarcely tonight i think i thought you might know something about him i have been absent myself seh ah on a vacation perhaps the divine had a ruddy facet his strong glance was straight and frank and fearless but his smile too much reminded me of days bygone when we used to return to school from the christmas holidays and the masters would shake our hands and welcome us with robert john edward glad to see you all looking so well rested and ready for hard work im sure that smile does not really please even good tame little boys and the virginian was nearing thirty it has not been vacation this trip seh said he settling straight in his saddle theres the judge driving in now in time for all questions yu have to ask him his horse took a step but was stopped short there lay the virginians rope on the ground i had been aware of trampass quite proper departure during the talk and as he was leaving i seemed also to be aware of his placing the coil across the cantle of its owners saddle had he intended it to fall and have to be picked up it was another evasive little business and quite successful if designed to nag the owner of the rope a few hundred yards ahead of us trampas was now shouting loud cowboy shouts were they to announce his return to those at home or did they mean derision the virginian leaned keeping his seat and swinging down his arm caught up the rope and hung it on his saddle somewhat carefully but the hue of rage spread over his face from his fence the divine now spoke in approbation but with another strong cheerless smile you pick up that rope as if you were well trained to it its part of our business seh and we try to mind it like the rest but this stated in a gentle drawl did not pierce the missionarys armor his superiority was very thick we now rode on and i was impressed by the reverend gentlemans robust dictatorial back as he proceeded by a short cut through the meadow to the ranch you could take him for nothing but a vigorous sincere dominating man full of the highest purpose but whatever his creed i already doubted if he were the right one to sow it and make it grow in these new wild fields he seemed more the sort of gardener to keep old walks and vines pruned in their antique rigidity i admired him for coming all this way with his clean short gray whiskers and his black wellbrushed suit and he made me think of a powerful locomotive stuck puffing on a grade meanwhile the virginian rode beside me so silent in his volcanic wrath that i did not perceive it the missionary coming on top of trampas had been more than he could stand but i did not know and i spoke with innocent cheeriness is the parson going to save us i asked and i fairly jumped at his voicedont talk so much he burst out i had got the whole accumulation whos been talking i in equal anger screeched back im not trying to save you i didnt take your rope and having poured this out i whipped up my pony but he spurred his own alongside of me and glancing at him i saw that he was now convulsed with internal mirth i therefore drew down to a walk and he straightened into gravity im right obliged to yu he laid his hand in its buckskin gauntlet upon my horses mane as he spoke for bringing me back out o my nonsense ill be as serene as a bird now whatever they do a man he stated reflectively any fullsized man ought to own a big lot of temper and like all his valuable possessions hed ought to keep it and not lose any this was his full apology as for salvation i have got this far somebody he swept an arm at the sunset and the mountains must have made all that i know but i know one more thing i would tell him to his face if i cant do nothing long enough and good enough to earn eternal happiness i cant do nothing long enough and bad enough to be damned i reckon he plays a square game with us if he plays at all and i aint bothering my haid about other worlds as we reached the stables he had become the serene bird he promised and was sentimentally continuing de sun is made of mud from de bottom of de river de moon is made o foxfire as you might disciver de stars like de ladies eyes all round de world dey flies to give a little light when de moon dont rise if words were meant to conceal our thoughts melody is perhaps a still thicker veil for them whatever temper he had lost he had certainly found again but this all the more fitted him to deal with trampas when the dealing should begin i had half a mind to speak to the judge only it seemed beyond a mere visitors business our missionary was at this moment himself speaking to judge henry at the door of the home ranch i reckon hes explaining he has been awaiting the virginian was throwing his saddle off as i loosened the cinches of mine and the judge dont look like he was hopelessly distressed i now surveyed the distant parley and the judge from the wagonful of guests whom he had evidently been driving upon a days excursion waved me a welcome which i waved back hes got miss molly wood there i exclaimed yes the virginian was brief about this fact ill look afteh your saddle you go and get acquainted with the company this favor i accepted it was the means he chose for saying he hoped after our recent boiling over that all was now more than right between us so for the while i left him to his horses and his corrals and his trampas and his foreman and his imminent problem xix dr macbride begs pardon judge and mrs henry molly wood and two strangers a lady and a gentleman were the party which had been driving in the large threeseated wagon they had seemed a merry party but as i came within hearing of their talk it was a fragment of the ministers sonority which reached me first more opportunity for them to have the benefit of hearing frequent sermons was the sentence i heard him bring to completion yes to be sure sir judge henry gave me it almost seemed additional warmth of welcome for arriving to break up the present discourse let me introduce you to the rev dr alexander macbride doctor another guest we have been hoping for about this time was my hosts cordial explanation to him of me there remained the gentleman with his wife from new york and to these i made my final bows but i had not broken up the discourse we may be said to have met already dr macbride had fixed upon me his full mastering eye and it occurred to me that if they had policemen in heaven he would be at least a centurion in the force but he did not mean to be unpleasant it was only that in a mind full of matters less worldly pleasure was left out i observed your friend was a skilful horseman he continued i was saying to judge henry that i could wish such skilful horsemen might ride to a church upon the sabbath a church that is of right doctrine where they would have opportunity to hear frequent sermons yes said judge henry yes it would be a good thing mrs henry with some murmur about the kitchen here went into the house i was informed dr macbride held the rest of us before undertaking my journey that i should find a desolate and mainly godless country but nobody gave me to understand that from medicine bow i was to drive three hundred miles and pass no church of any faith the judge explained that there had been a few a long way to the right and left of him still he conceded you are quite right but dont forget that this is the newest part of a new world judge said his wife coming to the door how can you keep them standing in the dust with your talking this most efficiently did break up the discourse as our little party with the smiles and the polite holdings back of new acquaintanceship moved into the house the judge detained me behind all of them long enough to whisper dolorously hes going to stay a whole week i had hopes that he would not stay a whole week when i presently learned of the crowded arrangements which our hosts with many hospitable apologies disclosed to us they were delighted to have us but they hadnt foreseen that we should all be simultaneous the foremans house had been prepared for two of us and did we mind the two of us were dr macbride and myself and i expected him to mind but i wronged him grossly it would be much better he assured mrs henry than straw in a stable which he had tried several times and was quite ready for so i saw that though he kept his vigorous body clean when he could he cared nothing for it in the face of his mission how the foreman and his wife relished being turned out during a week for a missionary and myself was not my concern although while he and i made ready for supper over there it struck me as hard on them the room with its two cots and furniture was as nice as possible and we closed the door upon the adjoining room which however seemed also untenanted mrs henry gave us a meal so good that i have remembered it and her husband the judge strove his best that we should eat it in merriment he poured out his anecdotes like wine and we should have quickly warmed to them but dr macbride sat among us giving occasional heavy hahas which produced as miss molly wood whispered to me a dreadfully cavernous effect was it his sermon we wondered that he was thinking over i told her of the copious sheaf of them i had seen him pull from his wallet over at the foremans goodness said she then are we to hear one every evening this i doubted he had probably been picking one out suitable for the occasion putting his best foot foremost was her comment i suppose they have best feet like the rest of us then she grew delightfully sharp do you know when i first heard him i thought his voice was hearty but if you listen youll find its merely militant he never really meets you with it hes off on his hill watching the battlefield the whole time he will find a hardened pagan here judge henry oh no the wild man youre taming brought you kenilworth safe back she was smooth oh as for taming him but dont you find him intelligent suddenly i somehow knew that she didnt want to tame him but what did she want to do the thought of her had made him blush this afternoon no thought of him made her blush this evening a great laugh from the rest of the company made me aware that the judge had consummated his tale of the sole survivor and so he finished they all went off as mad as hops because it hadnt been a massacre mr and mrs ogden they were the new yorkersgave this story much applause and dr macbride half a minute later laid his haha like a heavy stone upon the gayety ill never be able to stand seven sermons said miss wood to me talking of massacres i now hastened to address the already saddened table i have recently escaped one myself the judge had come to an end of his powers oh tell us he implored seriously sir i think we grazed pretty wet tragedy but your extraordinary man brought us out into comedy safe and dry this gave me their attention and from that afternoon in dakota when i had first stepped aboard the caboose i told them the whole tale of my experience how i grew immediately aware that all was not right by the virginians kicking the cook off the train how as we journeyed the dark bubble of mutiny swelled hourly beneath my eyes and how when it was threatening i know not what explosion the virginian had pricked it with humor so that it burst in nothing but harmless laughter their eyes followed my narrative the new yorkers because such events do not happen upon the shores of the hudson mrs henry because she was my hostess miss wood followed for whatever her reasons were i couldnt see her eyes rather i felt her listening intently to the deeds and dangers of the man she didnt care to tame but it was the eyes of the judge and the missionary which i saw riveted upon me indeed until the end and they forthwith made plain their quite dissimilar opinions judge henry struck the table lightly with his fist i knew it and he leaned back in his chair with a face of contentment he had trusted his man and his man had proved worthy pardon me dr macbride had a manner of saying pardon me which rendered forgiveness wellnigh impossible the judge waited for him am i to understand that these a cowboys attempted to mutiny and were discouraged in this attempt upon finding themselves less skilful at lying than the man they had plotted to depose i began an answer it was other qualities sir that happened to be revealed and asserted by what you call his lying that and what am i to call it if it is not lying a competition in deceit in which i admit he out did them its their way to pardon me their way to lie they bow down to the greatest in this oh said miss wood in my ear give him up the judge took a turn weell doctor he seemed to stick here mr ogden handsomely assisted him youve said the word yourself doctor its the competition dont you see the trial of strength by no matter what test yes said miss wood unexpectedly and it wasnt that george washington couldnt tell a lie he just wouldnt im sure if hed undertaken to hed have told a much better one than cornwalls haha madam you draw an ingenious subtlety from your books its all plain to me ogden pursued the men were morose this foreman was in the minority he cajoled them into a bout of tall stories and told the tallest himself and when they found they had swallowed it whole well it would certainly take the starch out of me he concluded i couldnt be a serious mutineer after that dr macbride now sounded his strongest bass pardon me i cannot accept such a view sir there is a levity abroad in our land which i must deplore no matter how leniently you may try to put it in the end we have the spectacle of a struggle between men where lying decides the survival of the fittest better far better if it was to come that they had shot honest bullets there are worse evils than war the doctors eye glared righteously about him none of us i think trembled or if we did it was with emotions other than fear mrs henry at once introduced the subject of troutfishing and thus happily removed us from the edge of whatever sort of precipice we seemed to have approached for dr macbride had brought his rod he dilated upon this sport with fervor and we assured him that the streams upon the west slope of the bow leg mountains would afford him plenty of it thus we ended our meal in carefully preserved amity xx the judge ignores particulars do you often have these visitations ogden inquired of judge henry our host was giving us whiskey in his office and dr macbride while we smoked apart from the ladies had repaired to his quarters in the foremans house previous to the service which he was shortly to hold the judge laughed they come now and then through the year i like the bishop to come and the men always like it but i fear our friend will scarcely please them so well you dont mean theyll oh no theyll keep quiet the fact is they have a good deal better manners than he has if he only knew it theyll be able to bear him but as for any good hell do i doubt if he knows a word of science said i musing about the doctor science he doesnt know what christianity is yet ive entertained many guests but none the whole secret broke off judge henry lies in the way you treat people as soon as you treat men as your brothers they are ready to acknowledge you if you deserve it as their superior thats the whole bottom of christianity and thats what our missionary will never know there was a somewhat heavy knock at the office door and i think we all feared it was dr macbride but when the judge opened the virginian was standing there in the darkness so the judge opened the door wide he was very hearty to the man he had trusted youre back at last i came to repawt while they shook hands ogden nudged me that the fellow i nodded fellow who kicked the cook off the train i again nodded and he looked at the virginian his eye and his stature judge henry properly democratic now introduced him to ogden the new yorker also meant to be properly democratic youre the man ive been hearing such a lot about but familiarity is not equality then i expect yu have the advantage of me seh said the virginian very politely shall i repawt tomorro his grave eyes were on the judge again of me he had taken no notice he had come as an employee to see his employer yes yes ill want to hear about the cattle tomorrow but step inside a moment now theres a matter the virginian stepped inside and took off his hat sit down you had trouble ive heard something about it the judge went on the virginian sat down grave and graceful but he held the brim of his hat all the while he looked at ogden and me and then back at his employer there was reluctance in his eye i wondered if his employer could be going to make him tell his own exploits in the presence of us outsiders and there came into my memory the bengal tiger at a trainedanimal show i had once seen you had some trouble repeated the judge well there was a time when they maybe wanted to have notions theyre good boys and he smiled a very little contentment increased in the judges face trampas a good boy too but this time the bengal tiger did not smile he sat with his eye fastened on his employer the judge passed rather quickly on to his next point youve brought them all back though i understand safe and sound without a scratch the virginian looked down at his hat then up again at the judge mildly i had to part with my cook there was no use ogden and myself exploded even upon the embarrassed virginian a large grin slowly forced itself i guess yu know about it he murmured and he looked at me with a sort of reproach he knew it was i who had told tales out of school i only want to say said ogden conciliatingly that i know i couldnt have handled those men the virginian relented yu never tried seh the judge had remained serious but he showed himself plainly more and more contented quite right he said you had to part with your cook when i put a man in charge i put him in charge i dont make particulars my business theyre to be always his do you understand thank yu the virginian understood that his employer was praising his management of the expedition but i dont think he at all discerned as i did presently that his employer had just been putting him to a further test had laid before him the temptation of complaining of a fellowworkman and blowing his own trumpet and was delighted with his reticence he made a movement to rise i havent finished said the judge i was coming to the matter theres one particular since i do happen to have been told i fancy trampas has learned something he didnt expect this time the virginian evidently did not understand any more than i did one hand played with his hat mechanically turning it round the judge explained i mean about roberts a pulse of triumph shot over the southerners face turning it savage for that fleeting instant he understood now and was unable to suppress this much answer but he was silent you see the judge explained to me i was obliged to let roberts my old foreman go last week his wife could not have stood another winter here and a good position was offered to him near los angeles i did see i saw a number of things i saw why the foremans house had been empty to receive dr macbride and me and i saw that the judge had been very clever indeed for i had abstained from telling any tales about the present feeling between trampas and the virginian but he had divined it well enough for him to say that particulars were something he let alone he evidently kept a deep eye on the undercurrents at his ranch he knew that in roberts trampas had lost a powerful friend and this was what i most saw this final fact that trampas had no longer any intervening shield he and the virginian stood indeed man to man and so the judge continued speaking to me here i am at a very inconvenient time without a foreman unless i caught the twinkle in his eyes before he turned to the virginian unless youre willing to take the position yourself will you i saw the southerners hand grip his hat as he was turning it round he held it still now and his other hand found it and gradually crumpled the soft crown in it meant everything to him recognition higher station better fortune a separate house of his own and perhaps one step nearer to the woman he wanted i dont know what words he might have said to the judge had they been alone but the judge had chosen to do it in our presence the whole thing from beginning to end the virginian sat with the damp coming out on his forehead and his eyes dropped from his employers thank yu was what he managed at last to say well now im greatly relieved exclaimed the judge rising at once he spoke with haste and lightly thats excellent i was in some thing of a hole he said to ogden and me and this gives me one thing less to think of saves me a lot of particulars he jocosely added to the virginian who was now also standing up begin right off leave the bunk house the gentlemen wont mind your sleeping in your own house thus he dismissed his new foreman gayly but the new foreman when he got outside turned back for one gruff word ill try to please yu that was all he was gone in the darkness but there was light enough for me looking after him to see him lay his hand on a shoulderhigh gate and vault it as if he had been the wind sounds of cheering came to us a few moments later from the bunk house evidently he had begun right away as the judge had directed he had told his fortune to his brother cowpunchers and this was their answer i wonder if trampas is shouting too inquired ogden hm said the judge that is one of the particulars i wash my hands of i knew that he entirely meant it i knew once his decision taken of appointing the virginian his lieutenant for good and all that like a wise commanderinchief he would trust his lieutenant to take care of his own business well ogden pursued with interest havent you landed trampas plump at his mercy the phrase tickled the judge that is where ive landed him he declared and here is dr macbride xxi in a state of sin thunder sat imminent upon the missionarys brow many were to be at his mercy soon but for us he had sunshine still i am truly sorry to be turning you upside down he said importantly but it seems the best place for my service he spoke of the tables pushed back and the chairs gathered in the hall where the storm would presently break upon the congregation eightthirty he inquired this was the hour appointed and it was only twenty minutes off we threw the unsmoked fractions of our cigars away and returned to offer our services to the ladies this amused the ladies they had done without us all was ready in the hall we got the cook to help us mrs ogden told me so as not to disturb your cigars in spite of the cowboys i still recognize my own country in the cook i rather densely asked oh no i dont have a chinaman its in the length of afterdinner cigars had you been smoking i returned you would have found them short this evening you make it worse said the lady we have had nothing but dr mac bride well share him with you now i exclaimed has he announced his text ive got one for him said molly wood joining us she stood on tiptoe and spoke it comically in our ears i said in my haste all men are liars this made us merry as we stood among the chairs in the congested hall i left the ladies and sought the bunk house i had heard the cheers but i was curious also to see the men and how they were taking it there was but little for the eye there was much noise in the room they were getting ready to come to church brushing their hair shaving and making themselves clean amid talk occasionally profane and continuously diverting well im a christian anyway one declared im a mormon i guess said another i belong to the knights of pythias said a third im a mohammedist said a fourth i hope i aint goin to hear nothin to shock me and they went on with their joking but trampas was out of the joking he lay on his bed reading a newspaper and took no pains to look pleasant my eyes were considering him when the blithe scipio came in dont look so bashful said he theres only us girls here he had been helping the virginian move his belongings from the bunk house over to the foremans cabin he himself was to occupy the virginians old bed here and i hope sleepin in it will bring me some of his luck said scipio yud ought tove seen us when he told us in his quiet way well scipio sighed a little it must feel good to have your friends glad about you especially trampas said i the judge knows about that i added knows does he whats he say scipio drew me quickly out of the bunk house says its no business of his said nothing but that scipios curiosity seemed strangely intense made no suggestion not a thing not a thing said he didnt want to know and didnt care how did he happen to hear about it snapped scipio you told him he immediately guessed he never would and scipio jerked his thumb at the virginian who appeared for a moment in the lighted window of the new quarters he was arranging he never would tell scipio repeated and so the judge never made a suggestion to him he muttered nodding in the darkness so its just his own notion just like him too come to think of it only i didnt expect well i guess he could surprise me any day he tried youre surprising me now i said whats it all about oh him and trampas what nothing surely happened yet i was as curious as scipio had been no not yet but there will great heavens man when just as soon as trampas makes the first move scipio replied easily i became dignified scipio had evidently been told things by the virginian yes i up and asked him plumb out scipio answered i was liftin his trunk in at the door and i couldnt stand it no longer and i asked him plumb out yuve sure got trampas where yu want him thats what i said and he up and answered and told me so i know at this point scipio stopped i was not to know i had no idea i said that your system held so much meanness oh it aint meanness and he laughed ecstatically what do you call it then hed call it discretion said scipio then he became serious its too blamed grand to tell yu ill leave yu to see it happen keep around thats all keep around i pretty near wish i didnt know it myself what with my feelings at scipios discretion and my human curiosity i was not in that mood which best profits from a sermon yet even though my expectations had been cruelly left quivering in mid air i was not sure how much i really wanted to keep around you will therefore understand how dr macbride was able to make a prayer and to read scripture without my being conscious of a word that he had uttered it was when i saw him opening the manuscript of his sermon that i suddenly remembered i was sitting so to speak in church and began once more to think of the preacher and his congregation our chairs were in the front line of course but being next the wall i could easily see the cowboys behind me they were perfectly decorous if mrs ogden had looked for pistols daredevil attitudes and so forth she must have been greatly disappointed except for their weatherbeaten cheeks and eyes they were simply american young men with mustaches and without and might have been sitting say in danbury connecticut even trampas merged quietly with the general placidity the virginian did not to be sure look like danbury and his frame and his features showed out of the mass but his eyes were upon dr macbride with a creamlike propriety our missionary did not choose miss woods text he made his selection from another of the psalms and when it came i did not dare to look at anybody i was much nearer unseemly conduct than the cowboys dr mac bride gave us his text sonorously they are altogether become filthy there is none of them that doeth good no not one his eye showed us plainly that present company was not excepted from this he repeated the text once more then launching upon his discourse gave none of us a ray of hope i had heard it all often before but preached to cowboys it took on a new glare of untimeliness of grotesque obsoleteness as if some one should say let me persuade you to admire woman and forthwith hold out her bleached bones to you the cowboys were told that not only they could do no good but that if they did contrive to it would not help them nay more not only honest deeds availed them nothing but even if they accepted this especial creed which was being explained to them as necessary for salvation still it might not save them their sin was indeed the cause of their damnation yet keeping from sin they might nevertheless be lost it had all been settled for them not only before they were born but before adam was shaped having told them this he invited them to glorify the creator of the scheme even if damned they must praise the person who had made them expressly for damnation that is what i heard him prove by logic to these cowboys stone upon stone he built the black cellar of his theology leaving out its beautiful park and the sunshine of its garden he did not tell them the splendor of its past the noble fortress for good that it had been how its tonic had strengthened generations of their fathers no wrath he spoke of and never once of love it was the bishops way i knew well to hold cowboys by homely talk of their special hardships and temptations and when they fell he spoke to them of forgiveness and brought them encouragement but dr macbride never thought once of the lives of these waifs like himself like all mankind they were invisible dots in creation like him they were to feel as nothing to be swept up in the potent heat of his faith so he thrust out to them none of the sweet but all the bitter of his creed naked and stern as iron dogma was his all in all and poor humanity was nothing but flesh for its canyons thus to kill what chance he had for being of use seemed to me more deplorable than it did evidently to them their attention merely wandered three hundred years ago they would have been frightened but not in this electric day i saw scipio stifling a smile when it came to the doctrine of original sin we know of its truth said dr macbride from the severe troubles and distresses to which infants are liable and from death passing upon them before they are capable of sinning yet i knew he was a good man and i also knew that if a missionary is to be tactless he might almost as well be bad i said their attention wandered but i forgot the virginian at first his attitude might have been mere propriety one can look respectfully at a preacher and be internally breaking all the commandments but even with the text i saw real attention light in the virginians eye and keeping track of the concentration that grew on him with each minute made the sermon short for me he missed nothing before the end his gaze at the preacher had become swerveless was he convert or critic convert was incredible thus was an hour passed before i had thought of time when it was over we took it variously the preacher was genial and spoke of having now broken ground for the lessons that he hoped to instil he discoursed for a while about troutfishing and about the rumored uneasiness of the indians northward where he was going it was plain that his personal safety never gave him a thought he soon bade us good night the ogdens shrugged their shoulders and were amused that was their way of taking it dr macbride sat too heavily on the judges shoulders for him to shrug them as a leading citizen in the territory he kept open house for all comers policy and good nature made him bid welcome a wide variety of travellers the cowboy out of employment found bed and a meal for himself and his horse and missionaries had before now been well received at sunk creek ranch i suppose ill have to take him fishing said the judge ruefully yes my dear said his wife you will and i shall have to make his tea for six days otherwise ogden suggested it might be reported that you were enemies of religion thats about it said the judge i can get on with most people but elephants depress me so we named the doctor jumbo and i departed to my quarters at the bunk house the comments were similar but more highly salted the men were going to bed in spite of their outward decorum at the service they had not liked to be told that they were altogether become filthy it was easy to call names they could do that themselves and they appealed to me several speaking at once like a concerted piece at the opera say do you believe babies go to hell ah of course he dont there aint no hereafter anyway aint there who told yu same man as told the preacher we were all a sifted set of sonsofguns well im going to stay a mormon well im going to quit fleeing from temptation thats so better get it in the neck after a good time than a poor one and so forth their wit was not extreme yet i should like dr macbride to have heard it one fellow put his natural soul pretty well into words if i happened to learn what they had predestinated me to do id do the other thing just to show em and trampas and the virginian they were out of it the virginian had gone straight to his new abode trampas lay in his bed not asleep and sullen as ever he aint got religion this trip said scipio to me did his new foreman get it i asked huh it would spoil him you keep around thats all keep around scipio was not to be probed and i went still baffled to my repose no light burned in the cabin as i approached its door the virginians room was quiet and dark and that dr macbride slumbered was plainly audible to me even before i entered go fishing with him i thought as i undressed and i selfishly decided that the judge might have this privilege entirely to himself sleep came to me fairly soon in spite of the doctor i was wakened from it by my beds being jolted not a pleasant thing that night i must have started and it was the quiet voice of the virginian that told me he was sorry to have accidentally disturbed me this disturbed me a good deal more but his steps did not go to the bunk house as my sensational mind had suggested he was not wearing much and in the dimness he seemed taller than common i next made out that he was bending over dr mac bride the divine at last sprang upright i am armed he said take care who are you you can lay down your gun seh i feel like my spirit was going to bear witness i feel like i might get an enlightening he was using some of the missionarys own language the baffling i had been treated to by scipio melted to nothing in this did living men petrify i should have changed to mineral between the sheets the doctor got out of bed lighted his lamp and found a book and the two retired into the virginians room where i could hear the exhortations as i lay amazed in time the doctor returned blew out his lamp and settled himself i had been very much awake but was nearly gone to sleep again when the door creaked and the virginian stood by the doctors side are you awake seh what whats that what is it excuse me seh the enemy is winning on me im feeling less inward opposition to sin the lamp was lighted and i listened to some further exhortations they must have taken half an hour when the doctor was in bed again i thought that i heard him sigh this upset my composure in the dark but i lay face downward in the pillow and the doctor was soon again snoring i envied him for a while his faculty of easy sleep but i must have dropped off myself for it was the lamp in my eyes that now waked me as he came back for the third time from the virginians room before blowing the light out he looked at his watch and thereupon i inquired the hour of him three said he i could not sleep any more now and i lay watching the darkness im afeared to be alone said the virginians voice presently in the next room im afeared there was a short pause and then he shouted very loud im losin my desire afteh the sincere milk of the word what whats that what the doctors cot gave a great crack as he started up listening and i put my face deep in the pillow im afeared im afeared sin has quit being bitter in my belly courage my good man the doctor was out of bed with his lamp again and the door shut behind him between them they made it long this time i saw the window become gray then the corners of the furniture grow visible and outside the dry chorus of the blackbirds began to fill the dawn to these the sounds of chickens and impatient hoofs in the stable were added and some cow wandered by loudly calling for her calf next some one whistling passed near and grew distant but although the cold hue that i lay staring at through the window warmed and changed the doctor continued working hard over his patient in the next room only a word here and there was distinct but it was plain from the virginians fewer remarks that the sin in his belly was alarming him less yes they made this time long but it proved indeed the last one and though some sort of catastrophe was bound to fall upon us it was myself who precipitated the thing that did happen day was wholly come i looked at my own watch and it was six i had been about seven hours in my bed and the doctor had been about seven hours out of his the door opened and he came in with his book and lamp he seemed to be shivering a little and i saw him cast a longing eye at his couch but the virginian followed him even as he blew out the now quite superfluous light they made a noticeable couple in their underclothes the virginian with his lean racehorse shanks running to a point at his ankle and the doctor with his stomach and his fat sedentary calves youll be going to breakfast and the ladies seh pretty soon said the virginian with a chastened voice but ill worry through the day somehow without yu and tonight you can turn your wolf loose on me again once more it was no use my face was deep in the pillow but i made sounds as of a hen who has laid an egg it broke on the doctor with a total instantaneous smash quite like an ego he tried to speak calmly this is a disgrace an infamous disgrace never in my life have i words forsook him and his face grew redder never in my life he stopped again because at the sight of him being dignified in his red drawers i was making the noise of a dozen hens it was suddenly too much for the virginian he hastened into his room and there sank on the floor with his head in his hands the doctor immediately slammed the door upon him and this rendered me easily fit for a lunatic asylum i cried into my pillow and wondered if the doctor would come and kill me but he took no notice of me whatever i could hear the virginians convulsions through the door and also the doctor furiously making his toilet within three feet of my head and i lay quite still with my face the other way for i was really afraid to look at him when i heard him walk to the door in his boots i ventured to peep and there he was going out with his bag in his hand as i still continued to lie weak and sore and with a mind that had ceased an operation the virginians door opened he was clean and dressed and decent but the devil still sported in his eye i have never seen a creature more irresistibly handsome then my mind worked again youve gone and done it said i hes packed his valise hell not sleep here the virginian looked quickly out of the door why hes leavin us he exclaimed drivin away right now in his little old buggy he turned to me and our eyes met solemnly over this large fact i thought that i perceived the faintest tincture of dismay in the features of judge henrys new responsible trusty foreman this was the first act of his administration once again he looked out at the departing missionary well he vindictively stated i certnly aint goin to run afteh him and he looked at me again do you suppose the judge knows i inquired he shook his head the windo shades is all down still oveh yondeh he paused i dont care he stated quite as if he had been ten years old then he grinned guiltily i was mighty respectful to him all night oh yes respectful especially when you invited him to turn his wolf loose the virginian gave a joyous gulp he now came and sat down on the edge of my bed i spoke awful good english to him most of the time said he i can yu know when i cinch my attention tight on to it yes i certnly spoke a lot o good english i didnt understand some of it myself he was now growing frankly pleased with his exploit he had builded so much better than he knew he got up and looked out across the crystal world of light the doctor is at onemile crossing he said hell get breakfast at the nlazyy then he returned and sat again on my bed and began to give me his real heart i never set up for being better than others not even to myself my thoughts aint apt to travel around making comparisons and i shouldnt wonder if my memory took as much notice of the meannesses i have done as of as of the other actions but to have to sit like a dumb lamb and let a stranger tell yu for an hour that yure a hawg and a swine just after you have acted in a way which them that know the facts would call pretty near white trampas i could not help exclaiming for there are moments of insight when a guess amounts to knowledge has scipio told no not a word he wouldnt tell me well yu see i arrived home hyeh this evenin with several thoughts workin and stirrin inside me and not one o them thoughts was what yud call christian i aint the least little bit ashamed of em im a human but after the judge well yu heard him and so when i went away from that talk and saw how positions was changed a step outside stopped him short nothing more could be read in his face for there was trampas himself in the open door good morning said trampas not looking at us he spoke with the same cool sullenness of yesterday we returned his greeting i believe im late in congratulating you on your promotion said he the virginian consulted his watch its only half afteh six he returned trampass sullenness deepened any man is to be congratulated on getting a rise i expect this time the virginian let him have it certnly and i aint forgetting how much i owe mine to you trampas would have liked to let himself go ive not come here for any forgiveness he sneered when did yu feel yu needed any the virginian was impregnable trampas seemed to feel how little he was going this way he came out straight now oh i havent any judge behind me i know i heard youd be paying the boys this morning and ive come for my time youre thinking of leaving us asked the new foreman whats your dissatisfaction oh im not needing anybody back of me ill get along by myself it was thus he revealed his expectation of being dismissed by his enemy this would have knocked any meditated generosity out of my heart but i was not the virginian he shifted his legs leaned back a little and laughed go back to your job trampas if thats all your complaint youre right about me being in luck but maybe theres two of us in luck it was this that scipio had preferred me to see with my own eyes the fight was between man and man no longer the case could not be one of forgiveness but the virginian would not use his official position to crush his subordinate trampas departed with something muttered that i did not hear and the virginian closed intimate conversation by saying youll be late for breakfast with that he also took himself away the ladies were inclined to be scandalized but not the judge when my whole story was done he brought his fist down on the table and not lightly this time id make him lieutenant general if the ranch offered that position he declared miss molly wood said nothing at the time but in the afternoon by her wish she went fishing with the virginian deputed to escort her i rode with them for a while i was not going to continue a third in that party the virginian was too becomingly dressed and i saw kenilworth peeping out of his pocket i meant to be fishing by myself when that volume was returned but miss wood talked with skilful openness as we rode ive heard all about you and dr macbride she said how could you do it when the judge places such confidence in you he looked pleased i reckon he said i couldnt be so good if i wasnt bad onced in a while why theres a skunk said i noticing the pretty little animal trotting in front of us at the edge of the thickets oh where is it dont let me see it screamed molly and at this deeply feminine remark the virginian looked at her with such a smile that had i been a woman it would have made me his to do what he pleased with on the spot upon the lady however it seemed to make less impression or rather i had better say whatever were her feelings she very naturally made no display of them and contrived not to be aware of that expression which had passed over the virginians face it was later that these few words reached me while i was fishing alone have you anything different to tell me yet i heard him say yes i have she spoke in accents light and well intrenched i wish to say that i have never liked any man better than you but i expect to he must have drawn small comfort from such an answer as that but he laughed out indomitably dont yu go betting on any such expectation and then their words ceased to be distinct and it was only their two voices that i heard wandering among the windings of the stream xxii what is a rustler we all know what birds of a feather do and it may be safely surmised that if a bird of any particular feather has been for a long while unable to see other birds of its kind it will flock with them all the more assiduously when they happen to alight in its vicinity now the ogdens were birds of mollys feather they wore eastern and not western plumage and their song was a different song from that which the bear creek birds sang to be sure the piping of little george taylor was full of hopeful interest and many other strains both striking and melodious were lifted in cattle land and had given pleasure to mollys ear but although indians and bears and mavericks make worthy themes for song these are not the only songs in the world therefore the eastern warblings of the ogdens sounded doubly sweet to molly wood such words as newport bar harbor and tiffanys thrilled her exceedingly it made no difference that she herself had never been to newport or bar harbor and had visited tiffanys more often to admire than to purchase on the contrary this rather added a dazzle to the music of the ogdens and molly whose eastern song had been silent in this strange land began to chirp it again during the visit that she made at the sunk creek ranch thus the virginians cause by no means prospered at this time his forces were scattered while mollys were concentrated the girl was not at that point where absence makes the heart grow fonder while the virginian was trundling his long responsible miles in the caboose delivering the cattle at chicago vanquishing trampas along the yellowstone she had regained herself thus it was that she could tell him so easily during those first hours that they were alone after his return i expect to like another man better than you absence had recruited her and then the ogdens had reenforced her they brought the east back powerfully to her memory and her thoughts filled with it they did not dream that they were assisting in any battle no one ever had more unconscious allies than did molly at that time but she used them consciously or almost consciously she frequented them she spoke of eastern matters she found that she had acquaintances whom the ogdens also knew and she often brought them into the conversation for it may be said i think that she was fighting a battle nay a campaign and perhaps this was a hopeful sign for the virginian had he but known it that the girl resorted to allies she surrounded herself she steeped herself with the east to have as it were a sort of counteractant against the spell of the blackhaired horse man and his forces were as i have said scattered for his promotion gave him no more time for lovemaking he was foreman now he had said to judge henry ill try to please yu and after the throb of emotion which these words had both concealed and conveyed there came to him that sort of intention to win which amounts to a certainty yes he would please judge henry he did not know how much he had already pleased him he did not know that the judge was humorously undecided which of his new foremans first acts had the more delighted him his performance with the missionary or his magnanimity to trampas good feeling is a great thing in any one the judge would say but i like to know that my foreman has so much sense i am personally very grateful to him said mrs henry and indeed so was the whole company to be afflicted with dr macbride for one night instead of six was a great liberation but the virginian never saw his sweetheart alone again while she was at the sunk creek ranch his duties called him away so much that there was no chance for him worse still that habit of birds of a feather brought about a separation more considerable she arranged to go east with the ogdens it was so good an opportunity to travel with friends instead of making the journey alone mollys term of ministration at the schoolhouse had so pleased bear creek that she was warmly urged to take a holiday school could afford to begin a little late accordingly she departed the virginian hid his sore heart from her during the moment of farewell that they had no ill not want any more books he said till yu come back and then he made cheerfulness its just the other way round said he what is the other way round why last time it was me that went travelling and you that stayed behind so it was and here she gave him a last scratch but youll be busier than ever she said no spare time to grieve about me she could wound him and she knew it nobody else could that is why she did it but he gave her something to remember too next time he said neither of us will stay behind well both go together and with these words he gave her no laughing glance it was a look that mingled with the words so that now and again in the train both came back to her and she sat pensive drawing near to bennington and hearing his voice and seeing his eyes how is it that this girl could cry at having to tell sam bannett she could not think of him and then treat another lover as she treated the virginian i cannot tell you having never as i said before been a woman myself bennington opened its arms to its venturesome daughter much was made of molly wood old faces and old places welcomed her fatted calves of varying dimensions made their appearance and although the fatted calf is an animal that can assume more divergent shapes than any other known creature being sometimes champagne and partridges and again cake and currant wine through each disguise you can always identify the same calf the girl from bear creek met it at every turn the bannetts at hoosic falls offered a large specimen to molly a dinner perhaps i should say a banquet of twentyfour and sam bannett of course took her to drive more than once i want to see the hoosic bridge she would say and when they reached that wellremembered point how lovely it is she exclaimed and as she gazed at the view up and down the valley she would grow pensive how natural the church looks she continued and then having crossed both bridges oh theres the dear old lodge gate or again while they drove up the valley of the little hoosic i had forgotten it was so nice and lonely but after all no woods are so interesting as those where you might possibly see a bear or an elk and upon another occasion after a cry of enthusiasm at the view from the top of mount anthony its lovely lovely lovely she said with diminishing cadence ending in pensiveness once more do you see that little bit just there no not where the trees are that bare spot that looks brown and warm in the sun with a little sagebrush that spot would look something like a place i know on bear creek only of course you dont get the clear air here i dont forget you said sam do you remember me or is it out of sight out of mind and with this beginning he renewed his suit she told him that she forgot no one that she should return always lest they might forget her return always he exclaimed you talk as if your anchor was dragging was it at all events sam failed in his suit over in the house at dunbarton the old lady held mollys hand and looked a long while at her you have changed very much she said finally i am a year older said the girl pshaw my dear said the greataunt who is he nobody cried molly with indignation then you shouldnt answer so loud said the greataunt the girl suddenly hid her face i dont believe i can love any one she said except myself and then that old lady who in her day had made her courtesy to lafayette began to stroke her nieces buried head because she more than half understood and understanding thus much she asked no prying questions but thought of the days of her own youth and only spoke a little quiet love and confidence to molly i am an old old woman she said but i havent forgotten about it they objected to him because he had no fortune but he was brave and handsome and i loved him my dear only i ought to have loved him more i gave him my promise to think about it and he and his ship were lost the greataunts voice had become very soft and low and she spoke with many pauses so then i knew if i had if perhaps i should have lost trim but it would have been after ah well so long as you can help it never marry but when you cannot help it a moment longer then listen to nothing but that for my dear i know your choice would be worthy of the starks and now let me see his picture why aunty said molly well i wont pretend to be supernatural said the aunt but i thought you kept one back when you were showing us those western views last night now this was the precise truth molly had brought a number of photographs from wyoming to show to her friends at home these however with one exception were not portraits they were views of scenery and of cattle roundups and other scenes characteristic of ranch life of young men she had in her possession several photographs and all but one of these she had left behind her her aunts penetration had in a way mesmerized the girl she rose obediently and sought that picture of the virginian it was full length displaying him in all his cowboy trappings the leathern chaps the belt and pistol and in his hand a coil of rope not one of her family had seen it or suspected its existence she now brought it downstairs and placed it in her aunts hand mercy cried the old lady molly was silent but her eye grew warlike is that the way began the aunt mercy she murmured and she sat staring at the picture molly remained silent her aunt looked slowly up at her has a man like that presumed hes not a bit like that yes hes exactly like that said molly and she would have snatched the photograph away but her aunt retained it well she said i suppose there are days when he does not kill people he never killed anybody and molly laughed are you seriously said the old lady i almost might at times he is perfectly splendid my dear you have fallen in love with his clothes its not his clothes and im not in love he often wears others he wears a white collar like anybody then that would be a more suitable way to be photographed i think he couldnt go round like that here i could not receive him myself hed never think of such a thing why you talk as if he were a savage the old lady studied the picture closely for a minute i think it is a good face she finally remarked is the fellow as handsome as that my dear more so molly thought and who was he and what were his prospects were the aunts next inquiries she shook her head at the answers which she received and she also shook her head over her nieces emphatic denial that her heart was lost to this man but when their parting came the old lady said god bless you and keep you my dear ill not try to manage you they managed me a sigh spoke the rest of this sentence but im not worried about you at least not very much you have never done anything that was not worthy of the starks and if youre going to take him do it before i die so that i can bid him welcome for your sake god bless you my dear and after the girl had gone back to bennington the greataunt had this thought she is like us all she wants a man that is a man nor did the old lady breathe her knowledge to any member of the family for she was a loyal spirit and her girls confidence was sacred to her besides she reflected if even i can do nothing with her what a mess theyd make of it we should hear of her elopement next so mollys immediate family never saw that photograph and never heard a word from her upon this subject but on the day that she left for bear creek as they sat missing her and discussing her visit in the evening mrs bell observed mother how did you think she was i never saw her better sarah that horrible place seems to agree with her oh yes agree it seemed to me well oh just somehow that she was thinking thinking well i believe she has something on her mind you mean a man said andrew bell a man andrew yes mrs wood thats what sarah always means it may be mentioned that sarahs surmises did not greatly contribute to her mothers happiness and rumor is so strange a thing that presently from the malicious outside air came a vague and dreadful word one of those words that cannot be traced to its source somebody said to andrew bell that they heard miss molly wood was engaged to marry a rustler heavens andrew said his wife what is a rustler it was not in any dictionary and current translations of it were inconsistent a man at hoosic falls said that he had passed through cheyenne and heard the term applied in a complimentary way to people who were alive and pushing another man had always supposed it meant some kind of horse but the most alarming version of all was that a rustler was a cattle thief now the truth is that all these meanings were right the word ran a sort of progress in the cattle country gathering many meanings as it went it gathered more however in bennington in a very few days gossip had it that molly was engaged to a gambler a gold miner an escaped stage robber and a mexican bandit while mrs flynt feared she had married a mormon along bear creek however molly and her rustler took a ride soon after her return they were neither married nor engaged and she was telling him about vermont i never was there said he never happened to strike in that direction what decided your direction oh looking for chances i reckon i must have been more ambitious than my brothers or more restless they stayed around on farms but i got out when i went back again six years afterward i was twenty they was talking about the same old things men of twentyfive and thirty yet just sittin and talkin about the same old things i told my mother about what id seen here and there and she liked it right to her death but the others well when i found this whole world was hawgs and turkeys to them with a little gunnin afteh small game throwed in i put on my hat one mawnin and told em maybe when i was fifty id look in on em again to see if theyd got any new subjects but theyll never my brothers dont seem to want chances you have lost a good many yourself said molly thats correct and yet said she sometimes i think you know a great deal more than i ever shall why of course i do said he quite simply i have earned my living since i was fourteen and thats from old mexico to british columbia i have never stolen or begged a cent id not want yu to know what i know she was looking at him half listening and half thinking of her greataunt i am not losing chances any more he continued and you are the best ive got she was not sorry to have georgie taylor come galloping along at this moment and join them but the virginian swore profanely under his breath and on this ride nothing more happened xxiii various points love had been snowbound for many weeks before this imprisonment its course had run neither smooth nor rough so far as eye could see it had run either not at all or as an undercurrent deep out of sight in their rides in their talks love had been dumb as to spoken words at least for the virginian had set himself a heavy task of silence and of patience then where winter barred his visits to bear creek and there was for the while no ranch work or responsibility to fill his thoughts and blood with action he set himself a task much lighter often instead of shakespeare and fiction school books lay open on his cabin table and penmanship and spelling helped the hours to pass many sheets of paper did he fill with various exercises and mrs henry gave him her assistance in advice and corrections i shall presently be in love with him myself she told the judge and its time for you to become anxious i am perfectly safe he retorted theres only one woman for him any more she is not good enough for him declared mrs henry but hell never see that so the snow fell the world froze and the spellingbooks and exercises went on but this was not the only case of education which was progressing at the sunk creek ranch while love was snowbound one morning scipio le moyne entered the virginians sitting room that apartment where dr macbride had wrestled with sin so courageously all night the virginian sat at his desk open books lay around him a halffinished piece of writing was beneath his fist his fingers were coated with ink education enveloped him it may be said but there was none in his eye that was upon the window looking far across the cold plain the foreman did not move when scipio came in and this humorous spirit smiled to himself its bear creek hes havin a vision of he concluded but he knew instantly that this was not so the virginian was looking at something real and scipio went to the window to see for himself well he said having seen when is he going to leave us the foreman continued looking at two horsemen riding together their shapes small in the distance showed black against the universal whiteness when d yu figure hell leave us repeated scipio he murmured the virginian always watching the distant horsemen and again he scipio sprawled down familiarly across a chair he and the virginian had come to know each other very well since that first meeting at medora they were birds many of whose feathers were the same and the virginian often talked to scipio without reserve consequently scipio now understood those two syllables that the virginian had pronounced precisely as though the sentences which lay between them had been fully expressed hm he remarked well one will be a gain and the other wont be no loss poor shorty said the virginian poor fool scipio was less compassionate no he persisted i aint sorry for him any man old enough to have hair on his face ought to see through trampas the virginian looked out of the window again and watched shorty and trampas as they rode in the distance shorty is kind to animals he said he has gentled that hawss pedro he bought with his first money gentled him wonderful when a man is kind to dumb animals i always say he had got some good in him yes scipio reluctantly admitted yes but i always did hate a fool this hyeh is a mighty cruel country pursued the virginian to animals that is think of it think what we do to hundreds an thousands of little calves throw em down brand em cut em ear mark em turn em loose and on to the next it has got to be of course but i say this if a man can go jammin hot irons on to little calves and slicin pieces off em with his knife and live along keepin a kindness for animals in his heart he has got some good in him and thats what shorty has got but he is lettin trampas get a hold of him and both of them will leave us and the virginian looked out across the huge winter whiteness again but the riders had now vanished behind some foothills scipio sat silent he had never put these thoughts about men and animals to himself and when they were put to him he saw that they were true queer he observed finally what everything nothings queer stated the virginian except marriage and lightning them two occurrences can still give me a sensation of surprise all the same it is queer scipio insisted well let her go at me why trampas he done you dirt you pass that over you could have fired him but you let him stay and keep his job thats goodness and badness is resultin from it straight badness right from goodness youre off the trail a whole lot said the virginian which side am i off then north south east and west first point i didnt expect to do trampas any good by not killin him which i came pretty near doin three times nor i didnt expect to do trampas any good by lettin him keep his job but i am foreman of this ranch and i can sit and tell all men to their face i was above that meanness point two it aint any goodness it is trampas that badness has resulted from put him anywhere and it will be the same put him under my eye and i can follow his moves a little anyway you have noticed maybe that since you and i run on to that dead polled angus cow that was still warm when we got to her we have found no more cows dead of sudden death we came mighty close to catchin whoever it was that killed that cow and ran her calf off to his own bunch he wasnt ten minutes ahead of us we can prove nothin and he knows that just as well as we do but our cows have all quit dyin of sudden death and trampas hes gettin ready for a change of residence as soon as all the outfits begin hirin new hands in the spring trampas will leave us and take a job with some of them and maybe our cowsll commence gettin killed again and well have to take steps that will be more emphatic maybe scipio meditated i wonder what killin a man feels like he said why nothing to bother yu when hed ought to have been killed next point trampas hell take shorty with him which is certainly bad for shorty but its me that has kept shorty out of harms way this long if i had fired trampas hed have worked shorty into dissatisfaction that much sooner scipio meditated again i knowed trampas would pull his freight he said but i didnt think of shorty what makes you think it he asked me for a raise he aint worth the pay hes getting now trampas has told him different when a man aint got no ideas of his own said scipio hed ought to be kind o careful who he borrows em from thats mighty correct said the virginian poor shorty he has told me about his life it is sorrowful and he will never get wise it was too late for him to get wise when he was born d yu know why hes after higher wages he sends most all his money east i dont see what trampas wants him for said scipio oh a handy tool some day not very handy said scipio well trampas is aimin to train him yu see supposin yu were figuring to turn professional thief yud be lookin around for a nice young trustful accomplice to take all the punishment and let you take the rest no such thing cried scipio angrily im no shirker and then perceiving the virginians expression he broke out laughing well he exclaimed yu fooled me that time looks that way but i do mean it about trampas presently scipio rose and noticed the halffinished exercise upon the virginians desk trampas is a rolling stone he said a rolling piece of mud corrected the virginian mud thats right im a rolling stone sometimes id most like to quit being thats easy done said the virginian no doubt when yuve found the moss yu want to gather as scipio glanced at the school books again a sparkle lurked in his bleached blue eye i can cipher some he said but i expect ive got my own notions about spelling i retain a few private ideas that way myself remarked the virginian innocently and scipios sparkle gathered light as to my geography he pursued thats away out loose in the brush is bennington the capital of vermont and how d yu spell bridegroom last point shouted the virginian letting a book fly after him dont let badness and goodness worry yu for yull never be a judge of them but scipio had dodged the book and was gone as he went his way he said to himself all the same it must pay to fall regular in love at the bunk house that afternoon it was observed that he was unusually silent his exit from the foremans cabin had let in a breath of winter so chill that the virginian went to see his thermometer a christmas present from mrs henry it registered twenty below zero after reviving the fire to a white blaze the foreman sat thinking over the story of shorty what its useless feeble past had been what would be its useless feeble future he shook his head over the sombre question was there any way out for shorty it may be he reflected that them whose pleasure brings yu into this world owes yu a living but that dont make the world responsible the world did not beget you i reckon man helps them that help themselves as for the universe it looks like it did too wholesale a business to turn out an article up to standard every clip yes it is sorrowful for shorty is kind to his hawss in the evening the virginian brought shorty into his room he usually knew what he had to say usually found it easy to arrange his thoughts and after such arranging the words came of themselves but as he looked at shorty this did not happen to him there was not a line of badness in the face yet also there was not a line of strength no promise in eye or nose or chin the whole thing melted to a stubby featureless mediocrity it was a countenance like thousands and hopelessness filled the virginian as he looked at this lost dog and his dull wistful eyes but some beginning must be made i wonder what the thermometer has got to be he said yu can see it if yull hold the lamp to that right side of the window shorty held the lamp i never used any he said looking out at the instrument nevertheless the virginian had forgotten that shorty could not read so he looked out of the window himself and found that it was twentytwo below zero this is pretty good tobacco he remarked and shorty helped himself and filled his pipe i had to rub my left ear with snow today said he i was just in time i thought it looked pretty freezy out where yu was riding said the foreman the lost dogs eyes showed plain astonishment we didnt see you out there said he well said the foreman itll soon not be freezing any more and then well all be warm enough with work everybody will be working all over the range and i wish i knew somebody that had a lot of stable work to be attended to i certnly do for your sake why said shorty because its the right kind of a job for you i can make more began shorty and stopped there is a time coming said the virginian when ill want somebody that knows how to get the friendship of hawsses ill want him to handle some special hawsses the judge has plans about judge henry would pay fifty a month for that i can make more said shorty this time with stubbornness well yes sometimes a man can when hes not worth it i mean but it dont generally last shorty was silent i used to make more myself said the virginian youre making a lot more now said shorty oh yes but i mean when i was fooling around the earth jumping from job to job and helling all over town between whiles i was not worth fifty a month then nor twentyfive but there was nights i made a heap more at cyards shortys eyes grew large and then bang it was gone with treatin the men and the girls i dont always said shorty and stopped again the virginian knew that he was thinking about the money he sent east after a while he continued i noticed a right strange fact the money i made easy that i wasnt worth it went like it came i strained myself none gettin or spendin it but the money i made hard that i was worth why i began to feel right careful about that and now i have got savings stowed away if once yu could know how good that feels so i would know said shorty with your luck whats my luck said the virginian sternly well if i had took up land along a creek that never goes dry and proved upon it like you have and if i had saw that land raise its value on me with me lifting no finger why did you lift no finger cut in the virginian who stopped yu taking up land did it not stretch in front of yu behind yu all around yu the biggest baldest opportunity in sight that was the time i lifted my finger but yu didnt shorty stood stubborn but never mind that said the virginian take my land away tomorrow and id still have my savings in bank because you see i had to work right hard gathering them in i found out what i could do and i settled down and did it now you can do that too the only tough part is the finding out what youre good for and for you that is found if youll just decide to work at this thing you can do and gentle those hawsses for the judge youll be having savings in a bank yourself i can make more said the lost dog the virginian was on the point of saying then get out but instead he spoke kindness to the end the weather is freezing yet he said and it will be for a good long while take your time and tell me if yu change your mind after that shorty returned to the bunk house and the virginian knew that the boy had learned his lesson of discontent from trampas with a thoroughness past all unteaching this petty triumph of evil seemed scarce of the size to count as any victory over the virginian but all men grasp at straws since that first moment when in the medicine bow saloon the virginian had shut the mouth of trampas by a word the man had been trying to get even without risk and at each successive clash of his weapon with the virginians he had merely met another public humiliation therefore now at the sunk creek ranch in these cold white days a certain lurking insolence in his gait showed plainly his opinion that by disaffecting shorty he had made some sort of reprisal yes he had poisoned the lost dog in the springtime when the neighboring ranches needed additional hands it happened as the virginian had foreseen trampas departed to a better job as he took pains to say and with him the docile shorty rode away upon his horse pedro love now was not any longer snowbound the mountain trails were open enough for the sure feet of loves steed that horse called monte but duty blocked the path of love instead of turning his face to bear creek the foreman had other journeys to make full of heavy work and watchfulness and councils with the judge the cattle thieves were growing bold and winter had scattered the cattle widely over the range therefore the virginian instead of going to see her wrote a letter to his sweetheart it was his first xxiv a letter with a moral the letter which the virginian wrote to molly wood was as has been stated the first that he had ever addressed to her i think perhaps he may have been a little shy as to his skill in the epistolary art a little anxious lest any sustained production from his pen might contain blunders that would too staringly remind her of his scant learning he could turn off a business communication about steers or stock cars or any other of the subjects involved in his profession with a brevity and a clearness that led the judge to confide threequarters of such correspondence to his foreman write to the outfit the judge would say and tell them that my wagon cannot start for the roundup until etc or write to cheyenne and say that if they will hold a meeting next monday week i will etc and then the virginian would write such communications with ease but his first message to his lady was scarcely written with ease it must be classed i think among those productions which are styled literary efforts it was completed in pencil before it was copied in ink and that first draft of it in pencil was wellnigh illegible with erasures and amendments the state of mind of the writer during its composition may be gathered without further description on my part from a slight interruption which occurred in the middle the door opened and scipio put his head in you coming to dinner he inquired you go to hell replied the virginian my links said scipio quietly and he shut the door without further observation to tell the truth i doubt if this letter would ever have been undertaken far less completed and despatched had not the lovers heart been wrung with disappointment all winter long he had looked to that day when he should knock at the girls door and hear her voice bid him come in all winter long he had been choosing the ride he would take her he had imagined a sunny afternoon a hidden grove a sheltering cleft of rock a running spring and some words of his that should conquer her at last and leave his lips upon hers and with this controlled fire pent up within him he had counted the days scratching them off his calendar with a dig each night that once or twice snapped the pen then when the trail stood open this meeting was deferred put off for indefinite days or weeks he could not tell how long so gripping his pencil and tracing heavy words he gave himself what consolation he could by writing her the letter duly stamped and addressed to bear creek set forth upon its travels and these were devious and long when it reached its destination it was some twenty days old it had gone by private hand at the outset taken the stagecoach at a way point become late in that stagecoach reached a point of transfer and waited there for the postmaster to begin continue end and recover from a game of poker mingled with whiskey then it once more proceeded was dropped at the right way point and carried by private hand to bear creek the experience of this letter however was not at all a remarkable one at that time in wyoming molly wood looked at the envelope she had never before seen the virginians handwriting she knew it instantly she closed her door and sat down to read it with a beating heart sunk creek ranch may my dear miss wood i am sorry about this my plan was different it was to get over for a ride with you about now or sooner this year spring is early the snow is off the flats this side the range and where the sun gets a chance to hit the earth strong all day it is green and has flowers too a good many you can see them bob and mix together in the wind the quakingasps down low on the south side are in small leaf and will soon be twinkling like the flowers do now i had planned to take a look at this with you and that was a better plan than what i have got to do the water is high but i could have got over and as for the snow on top of the mountain a man told me nobody could cross it for a week yet because he had just done it himself was not he a funny man you ought to see how the birds have streamed across the sky while spring was coming but you have seen them on your side of the mountain but i cant come now miss wood there is a lot for me to do that has to be done and judge henry needs more than two eyes just now i could not think much of myself if i left him for my own wishes but the days will be warmer when i come we will not have to quit by five and we can get off and sit too we could not sit now unless for a very short while if i know when i can come i will try to let you know but i think it will be this way i think you will just see me coming for i have things to do of an unsure nature and a good number of such do not believe reports about indians they are started by editors to keep the soldiers in the country the friends of the editors get the hay and beef contracts indians do not come to settled parts like bear creek is it is all editors and politicianists nothing has happened worth telling you i have read that play othello no man should write down such a thing do you know if it is true i have seen one worse affair down in arizona he killed his little child as well as his wife but such things should not be put down in fine language for the public i have read romeo and juliet that is beautiful language but romeo is no man i like his friend mercutio that gets killed he is a man if he had got juliet there would have been no foolishness and trouble well miss wood i would like to see you today do you know what i think monte would do if i rode him out and let the rein slack he would come straight to your gate for he is a horse of great judgement thats the first word he has misspelled said molly i suppose you are sitting with george taylor and those children right now then george will get old enough to help his father but uncle hewies twins will be ready for you about then and the supply will keep coming from all quarters all sizes for you to say big a little a to them there is no news here only calves and cows and the hens are laying now which does always seem news to a hen every time she does it did i ever tell you about a hen emily we had here she was venturesome to an extent i have not seen in other hens only she had poor judgement and would make no family ties she would keep trying to get interest in the ties of others taking charge of little chicks and bantams and turkeys and puppies one time and she thought most anything was an egg i will tell you about her sometime she died without family ties one day while i was building a house for her to teach school in the outrageous wretch cried molly and her cheeks turned deep pink as she sat alone with her lovers letter i am coming the first day i am free i will be a hundred miles from you most of the time when i am not more but i will ride a hundred miles for one hour and monte is up to that after never seeing you for so long i will make one hour do if i have to here is a flower i have just been out and picked i have kissed it now that is the best i can do yet molly laid the letter in her lap and looked at the flower then suddenly she jumped up and pressed it to her lips and after a long moment held it away from her no she said no no no she sat down it was some time before she finished the letter then once more she got up and put on her hat mrs taylor wondered where the girl could be walking so fast but she was not walking anywhere and in half an hour she returned rosy with her swift exercise but with a spirit as perturbed as when she had set out next morning at six when she looked out of her window there was monte tied to the taylors gate ah could he have come the day before could she have found him when she returned from that swift walk of hers xxv progress of the lost dog it was not even an hours visit that the virginian was able to pay his lady love but neither had he come a hundred miles to see her the necessities of his wandering work had chanced to bring him close enough for a glimpse of her and this glimpse he took almost on the wing for he had to rejoin a company of men at once yu got my letter he said yesterday yesterday i wrote it three weeks ago well yu got it this cannot be the hour with you that i mentioned that is coming and maybe very soon she could say nothing relief she felt and yet with it something like a pang today does not count he told her except that every time i see you counts with me but this is not the hour that i mentioned what little else was said between them upon this early morning shall be told duly for this visit in its own good time did count momentously though both of them took it lightly while its fleeting minutes passed he returned to her two volumes that she had lent him long ago and with taylor he left a horse which he had brought for her to ride as a goodby he put a bunch of flowers in her hand then he was gone and she watched him going by the thick bushes along the stream they were pink with wild roses and the meadowlarks invisible in the grass like hiding choristers sent up across the empty miles of air their unexpected song earth and sky had been propitious could he have stayed and perhaps one portion of her heart had been propitious too so as he rode away on monte she watched him half chilled by reason half melted by passion selfthwarted selfaccusing unresolved therefore the days that came for her now were all of them unhappy ones while for him they were filled with work well done and with changeless longing one day it seemed as if a lull was coming a pause in which he could at last attain that hour with her he left the camp and turned his face toward bear creek the way led him along butte creek across the stream lay balaams large ranch and presently on the other bank he saw balaam himself and reined in monte for a moment to watch what balaam was doing thats what ive heard he muttered to himself for balaam had led some horses to the water and was lashing them heavily because they would not drink he looked at this spectacle so intently that he did not see shorty approaching along the trail morning said shorty to him with some constraint but the virginian gave him a pleasant greeting i was afraid id not catch you so quick said shorty this is for you he handed his recent foreman a letter of much battered appearance it was from the judge it had not come straight but very gradually in the pockets of three successive cowpunchers as the virginian glanced over it and saw that the enclosure it contained was for balaam his heart fell here were new orders for him and he could not go to see his sweetheart hello shorty said balaam from over the creek to the virginian he gave a slight nod he did not know him although he knew well enough who he was hyehs a letter from judge henry for yu said the virginian and he crossed the creek many weeks before in the early spring balaam had borrowed two horses from the judge promising to return them at once but the judge of course wrote very civilly he hoped that this dunning reminder might be excused as balaam read the reminder he wished that he had sent the horses before the judge was a greater man than he in the territory balaam could not but excuse the dunning reminder but he was ready to be disagreeable to somebody at once well he said musing aloud in his annoyance judge henry wants them by the th well this is the th and time enough yet this is the th said the virginian briefly that made a difference not so easy to reach sunk creek in good order by the th balaam had drifted three sunrises behind the progress of the month days look alike and often lose their very names in the quiet depths of cattle land the horses were not even here at the ranch balaam was ready to be very disagreeable now suddenly he perceived the date of the judges letter he held it out to the virginian and struck the paper whats your idea in bringing this here two weeks late he said now when he had struck that paper shorty looked at the virginian but nothing happened beyond a certain change of light in the southerners eyes and when the southerner spoke it was with his usual gentleness and civility he explained that the letter had been put in his hands just now by shorty oh said balaam he looked at shorty how had he come to be a messenger you working for the sunk creek outfit again said he no said shorty balaam turned to the virginian again how do you expect me to get those horses to sunk creek by the th the virginian levelled a lazy eye on balaam i ain doin any expecting said he his native dialect was on top today the judge has friends goin to arrive from new yawk for a trip across the basin he added the hawsses are for them balaam grunted with displeasure and thought of the sixty or seventy days since he had told the judge he would return the horses at once he looked across at shorty seated in the shade and through his uneasy thoughts his instinct irrelevantly noted what a good pony the youth rode it was the same animal he had seen once or twice before but something must be done the judges horses were far out on the big range and must be found and driven in which would take certainly the rest of this day possibly part of the next balaam called to one of his men and gave some sharp orders emphasizing details and enjoining haste while the virginian leaned slightly against his horse with one arm over the saddle hearing and understanding but not smiling outwardly the man departed to saddle up for his search on the big range and balaam resumed the unhitching of his team so youre not working for the sunk creek outfit now he inquired of shorty he ignored the virginian working for the goose egg no said shorty sand hill outfit then no said shorty balaam grinned he noticed how shortys yellow hair stuck through a hole in his hat and how old and battered were shortys overalls shorty had been glad to take a little accidental pay for becoming the bearer of the letter which he had delivered to the virginian but even that sum was no longer in his possession he had passed through drybone on his way and at drybone there had been a game of poker shortys money was now in the pocket of trampas but he had one valuable possession in the world left to him and that was his horse pedro good pony of yours said balaam to him now from across butte creek then he struck his own horse in the jaw because he held back from coming to the water as the other had done your trace aint unhitched commented the virginian pointing balaam loosed the strap he had forgotten and cut the horse again for consistencys sake the animal bewildered now came down to the water with its head in the air and snuffing as it took short nervous steps the virginian looked on at this silent and sombre he could scarcely interfere between another man and his own beast neither he nor balaam was among those who say their prayers yet in this omission they were not equal a halfgreat poet once had a wholly great day and in that great day he was able to write a poem that has lived and become with many a household word he called it the rime of the ancient mariner and it is rich with many lines that possess the memory but these are the golden ones he prayeth well who loveth well both man and bird and beast he prayeth best who loveth best all things both great and small for the dear god who loveth us he made and loveth all these lines are the pure gold they are good to teach children because after the children come to be men they may believe at least some part of them still the virginian did not know them but his heart had taught him many things i doubt if balaam knew them either but on him they would have been as pearls to swine so youve quit the roundup he resumed to shorty shorty nodded and looked sidewise at the virginian for the virginian knew that he had been turned off for going to sleep while nightherding then balaam threw another glance on pedro the horse hello shorty he called out for the boy was departing dont you like dinner any more its ready about now shorty forded the creek and slung his saddle off and on invitation turned pedro his buckskin pony into balaams pasture this was green the rest of the wide world being yellow except only where butte creek with its bordering cottonwoods coiled away into the desert distance like a green snake without end the virginian also turned his horse into the pasture he must stay at the ranch till the judges horses should be found mrs balaams east yet said her lord leading the way to his dining room he wanted shorty to dine with him and could not exclude the virginian much as he should have enjoyed this see any indians he enquired naa said shorty in disdain of recent rumors theyre headin the other way observed the virginian bow laig range is where they was repawted what business have they got off the reservation id like to know said the ranchman bow leg or anywhere oh its just a hunt and a kind of visitin their friends on the south reservation shorty explained squaws along and all well if the folks at washington dont keep squaws and all where they belong said balaam in a rage the folks in wyoming territory ill do a little job that way themselves theres a petition out said shorty papers goin east with a lot of names to it but they aint no harm them indians aint no harm rasped out balaam was it white men druv off the o c yearlings balaams eastern grammar was sometimes at the mercy of his western feelings the thought of the perennial stultification of indian affairs at washington whether by politician or philanthropist was always sure to arouse him he walked impatiently about while he spoke and halted impatiently at the window out in the world the unclouded day was shining and balaams eye travelled across the plains to where a blue line faint and pale lay along the end of the vast yellow distance that was the beginning of the bow leg mountains somewhere over there were the red men ranging in unfrequented depths of rock and pine their forbidden ground dinner was ready and they sat down and i suppose balaam continued still hot on the subject youd claim indians object to killing a white man when they run on to him good and far from human help these peaceable indians are just the worst in the business thats so assented the easyopinioned shorty exactly as if he had always maintained this view chap started for sunk creek three weeks ago trapper he was old like with a red shirt one of his horses come into the roundup toosday man aint been heard from he ate in silence for a while evidently brooding in his childlike mind then he said querulously id sooner trust one of them indians than i would trampas balaam slanted his fat bullet head far to one side and laying his spoon down he had opened some canned grapes laughed steadily at his guest with a harsh relish of irony the guest ate a grape and perceiving he was seen through smiled back rather miserably say shorty said balaam his head still slanted over whats the figures of your bank balance just now i aint usin banks murmured the youth balaam put some more grapes on shortys plate and drawing a cigar from his waistcoat sent it rolling to his guest matches are behind you he added he gave a cigar to the virginian as an afterthought but to his disgust the southerner put it in his pocket and lighted a pipe balaam accompanied his guest shorty when he went to the pasture to saddle up and depart got a rope he asked the guest as they lifted down the bars dont need to rope him i can walk right up to pedro you stay back hiding his bridle behind him shorty walked to the riverbank where the pony was switching his long tail in the shade and speaking persuasively to him he came nearer till he laid his hand on pedros dusky mane which was many shades darker than his hide he turned expectantly and his master came up to his expectations with a piece of bread eats that does he said balaam over the bars likes the salt said shorty now nnow here yu dont guess yull be bridled dont you open your teeth yud like to play yu was nobodys horse and live private or maybe yud prefer ownin a saloon pedro evidently enjoyed this talk and the dodging he made about the bit once fairly in his mouth he accepted the inevitable and followed shorty to the bars then shorty turned and extended his hand shake he said to his pony who lifted his forefoot quietly and put it in his masters hand then the master tickled his nose and he wrinkled it and flattened his ears pretending to bite his face wore an expression of knowing relish over this performance now the other hoof said shorty and the horse and master shook hands with their left i learned him that said the cowboy with pride and affection say pede he continued in pedros ear aint yu the best little horse in the country what here now keep out of that you deadbeat there aint no more bread he pinched the ponys nose one quarter of which was wedged into his pocket quite a ladys little pet said balaam with the rasp in his voice pity this isnt new york now where theres a big market for harmless horses geegees the children call them he aint no geegee said shorty offended hell beat any cowpony workin youve got yu can turn him on a halfdollar dont need to touch the reins hang em on one finger and swing your body and hell turn balaam knew this and he knew that the pony was only a fouryearold well he said drybones had no circus this season maybe theyd buy tickets to see pedro hes good for that anyway shorty became gloomy the virginian was grimly smoking here was something else going on not to his taste but none of his business try a circus persisted balaam alter your plans for spending cash in town and make a little money instead shorty having no plans to alter and no cash to spend grew still more gloomy whatll you take for that pony said balaam shorty spoke up instantly a hundred dollars couldnt buy that piece of stale mud off his back he asserted looking off into the sky grandiosely but balaam looked at shorty you keep the mud he said and ill give you thirty dollars for the horse shorty did a little professional laughing and began to walk toward his saddle give you thirty dollars repeated balaam picking a stone up and slinging it into the river how far do yu call it to drybone shorty remarked stooping to investigate the buckingstrap on his saddle a superfluous performance for pedro never bucked you wont have to walk said balaam stay all night and ill send you over comfortably in the morning when the wagon goes for the mail walk shorty retorted drybones twentyfive miles pedroll put me there in three hours and not know he done it he lifted the saddle on the horses back come pedro said he come pedro mocked balaam there followed a little silence no sir mumbled shorty with his head under pedros belly busily cinching a hundred dollars is bottom figures balaam in his turn now duly performed some professional laughing which was noted by shorty under the horses belly he stood up and squared round on balaam well then he said whatll yu give for him thirty dollars said balaam looking far off into the sky as shorty had looked oh come now expostulated shorty it was he who now did the feeling for an offer and this was what balaam liked to see why yes he said thirty and looked surprised that he should have to mention the sum so often i thought yud quit them first figures said the cowpuncher for yu can see i aint goin to look at em balaam climbed on the fence and sat there im not crying for your pedro he observed dispassionately only it struck me you were dead broke and wanted to raise cash and keep yourself going till you hunted up a job and could buy him back he hooked his right thumb inside his waistcoat pocket but im not cryin for him he repeated hed stay right here of course i wouldnt part with him why does he stand that way hello balaam suddenly straightened himself like a man who has made a discovery hello what said shorty on the defensive balaam was staring at pedro with a judicial frown then he stuck out a finger at the horse keeping the thumb hooked in his pocket so meagre a gesture was felt by the ruffled shorty to be no just way to point at pedro whats the matter with that foreleg there said balaam which nothins the matter with it snapped shorty balaam climbed down from his fence and came over with elaborate deliberation he passed his hand up and down the off foreleg then he spit slenderly mm he said thoughtfully and added with a shade of sadness thats always to be expected when theyre worked too young shorty slid his hand slowly over the disputed leg whats to be expected he inquired that theyll eat hearty well he does at this retort the virginian permitted himself to laugh in audible sympathy sprung continued balaam with a sigh whirling round short when his bones were soft did that yes sprung shorty said with a bark of indignation come on pede you and mell spring for town he caught the horn of the saddle and as he swung into place the horse rushed away with him oee yoiyup yup yup sang shorty in the shrill cow dialect he made pedro play an exhibition game of speed bringing him round close to balaam in a wide circle and then he vanished in dust down the leftbank trail balaam looked after him and laughed harshly he had seen trout dash about like that when the hook in their jaw first surprised them he knew shorty would show the pony off and he knew shortys love for pedro was not equal to his need of money he called to one of his men asked something about the dam at the mouth of the canyon where the main irrigation ditch began made a remark about the prolonged drought and then walked to his diningroom door where as he expected shorty met him say said the youth do you consider thats any way to talk about a good horse any dude could see the legs sprung said balaam but he looked at pedros shoulder which was well laid back and he admired his points dark in contrast with the buckskin and also the width between the eyes now you know whined shorty that it aint sprung any more than your legs cork if you mean the right leg aint plumb straight i can tell you he was born so that dont make no difference for it aint weak try him onced just as sound and strong as iron never stumbles and he dont never go to jumpin with yu hes kind and hes smart and the master petted his pony who lifted a hoof for another handshake of course balaam had never thought the leg was sprung and he now took on an unprejudiced air of wanting to believe shortys statements if he only could maybe theres two years work left in that leg he now observed better give your hawss away shorty said the virginian is this your deal my friend inquired balaam and he slanted his bullet head at the virginian give him away shorty drawled the southerner his laig is busted mr balaam says so balaams face grew evil with baffled fury but the virginian was gravely considering pedro he too was not pleased but he could not interfere already he had overstepped the code in these matters he would have dearly liked for reasons good and bad spite and mercy mingled to have spoiled balaams market to have offered a reasonable or even an unreasonable price for pedro and taken possession of the horse himself but this might not be in bets in card games in all horse transactions and other matters of similar business a man must take care of himself and wiser onlookers must suppress their wisdom and hold their peace that evening shorty again had a cigar he had parted with pedro for forty dollars a striped mexican blanket and a pair of spurs undressing over in the bunk house he said to the virginian ill sure buy pedro back off him just as soon as ever i rustle some cash the virginian grunted he was thinking he should have to travel hard to get the horses to the judge by the th and below that thought lay his aching disappointment and his longing for bear creek in the early dawn shorty sat up among his blankets on the floor of the bunk house and saw the various sleepers coiled or sprawled in their beds their breathing had not yet grown restless at the nearing of day he stepped to the door carefully and saw the crowding blackbirds begin their walk and chatter in the mud of the littered and trodden corrals from beyond among the cotton woods came continually the smooth unemphatic sound of the doves answering each other invisibly and against the empty ridge of the riverbluff lay the moon no longer shining for there was established a new light through the sky pedro stood in the pasture close to the bars the cowboy slowly closed the door behind him and sitting down on the step drew his money out and idly handled it taking no comfort just then from its possession then he put it back and after dragging on his boots crossed to the pasture and held a last talk with his pony brushing the cakes of mud from his hide where he had rolled and passing a lingering hand over his mane as the sounds of the morning came increasingly from tree and plain shorty glanced back to see that no one was yet out of the cabin and then put his arms round the horses neck laying his head against him for a moment the cowboys insignificant face was exalted by the emotion he would never have let others see he hugged tight this animal who was dearer to his heart than anybody in the world goodby pedro he said goodby pedro looked for bread no said his master sorrowfully not any more yu know well id give it yu if i had it you and me didnt figure on this did we pedro goodby he hugged his pony again and got as far as the bars of the pasture but returned once more goodby my little horse my dear horse my little little pedro he said as his tears wet the ponys neck then he wiped them with his hand and got himself back to the bunk house after breakfast he and his belongings departed to drybone and pedro from his field calmly watched this departure for horses must recognize even less than men the black corners that their destinies turn the pony stopped feeding to look at the mailwagon pass by but the master sitting in the wagon forebore to turn his head xxvi balaam and pedro resigned to wait for the judges horses balaam went into his office this dry bright morning and read nine accumulated newspapers for he was behindhand then he rode out on the ditches and met his man returning with the troublesome animals at last he hastened home and sent for the virginian he had made a decision see here he said those horses are coming what trail would you take over to the judges shortest trails right through the bow laig mountains said the foreman in his gentle voice guess youre right its dinnertime well start right afterward well make little muddy crossing by sundown and sunk creek tomorrow and the next dayll see us through can a wagon get through sunk creek canyon the virginian smiled i reckon it cant seh and stay resembling a wagon balaam told them to saddle pedro and one packhorse and drive the bunch of horses into a corral roping the judges two who proved extremely wild he had decided to take this journey himself on remembering certain politics soon to be rife in cheyenne for judge henry was indeed a greater man than balaam this personally conducted return of the horses would temper its tardiness and moreover the sight of some new york visitors would be a good thing after seven months of no warmer touch with that metropolis than the sunday herald always eight days old when it reached the butte creek ranch they forded butte creek and crossing the welltravelled trail which follows down to drybone turned their faces toward the uninhabited country that began immediately as the ocean begins off a sandy shore and as a single mast on which no sail is shining stands at the horizon and seems to add a loneliness to the surrounding sea so the long gray line of fence almost a mile away that ended balaams land on this side the creek stretched along the waste ground and added desolation to the plain no solitary watercourse with margin of cottonwoods or willow thickets flowed here to stripe the dingy yellow world with interrupting green nor were cattle to be seen dotting the distance nor moving objects at all nor any bird in the soundless air the last gate was shut by the virginian who looked back at the pleasant trees of the ranch and then followed on in single file across the alkali of no mans land no cloud was in the sky the deserts grim noon shone sombrely on flat and hill the sagebrush was dull like zinc thick heat rose near at hand from the caked alkali and pale heat shrouded the distant peaks there were five horses balaam led on pedro his squat figure stiff in the saddle but solid as a rock and tilted a little forward as his habit was one of the judges horses came next a sorrel dragging back continually on the rope by which he was led after him ambled balaams wise packanimal carrying the light burden of two days food and lodging she was an old mare who could still go when she chose but had been schooled by the years and kept the trail giving no trouble to the virginian who came behind her he also sat solid as a rock yet subtly bending to the struggles of the wild horse he led as a steel spring bends and balances and resumes its poise thus they made but slow time and when they topped the last dull rise of ground and looked down on the long slant of ragged caked earth to the crossing of little muddy with its single tree and few mean bushes the final distance where eyesight ends had deepened to violet from the thin steady blue they had stared at for so many hours and all heat was gone from the universal dryness the horses drank a long time from the sluggish yellow water and its alkaline taste and warmth were equally welcome to the men they built a little fire and when supper was ended smoked but a short while and in silence before they got in the blankets that were spread in a smooth place beside the water they had picketed the two horses of the judge in the best grass they could find letting the rest go free to find pasture where they could when the first light came the virginian attended to breakfast while balaam rode away on the sorrel to bring in the loose horses they had gone far out of sight and when he returned with them after some two hours he was on pedro pedro was soaking with sweat and red froth creamed from his mouth the virginian saw the horses must have been hard to drive in especially after balaam brought them the wild sorrel as a leader if youd kep ridin him stead of changin off on your hawss theyd have behaved quieter said the foreman thats good seasonable advice said balaam sarcastically i could have told you that now i could have told you when you started said the virginian heating the coffee for balaam balaam was eloquent on the outrageous conduct of the horses he had come up with them evidently striking back for butte creek with the old mare in the lead but i soon showed her the road she was to go he said as he drove them now to the water the virginian noticed the slight limp of the mare and how her pastern was cut as if with a stone or the sharp heel of a boot i guess shell not be in a hurry to travel except when shes wanted to continued balaam he sat down and sullenly poured himself some coffee well be in luck if we make any sunk creek this night he went on with his breakfast thinking aloud for the benefit of his companion who made no comments preferring silence to the discomfort of talking with a man whose vindictive humor was so thoroughly uppermost he did not even listen very attentively but continued his preparations for departure washing the dishes rolling the blankets and moving about in his usual way of easy and visible good nature six oclock already said balaam saddling the horses and well not get started for ten minutes more then he came to pedro so you havent quit fooling yet havent you he exclaimed for the pony shrank as he lifted the bridle take that for your sore mouth and he rammed the bit in at which pedro flung back and reared well i never saw pedro act that way yet said the virginian ah rubbish said balaam theyre all the same not a bastard one buts laying for his chance to do for you somell buck you off and somell roll with you and somell fight you with their fore feet they may play good for a year but the western ponys mans enemy and when he judges hes got his chance hes going to do his best and if you come out alive it wont be his fault balaam paused for a while packing youve got to keep them afraid of you he said next thats what youve got to do if you dont want trouble that pedro horse there has been fed handfed and fooled with like a damn pet and whats that policy done why he goes ugly when he thinks its time and decides hell not drive any horses into camp this morning he knows better now mr balaam said the virginian ill buy that hawss off yu right now balaam shook his head youll not do that right now or any other time said he i happen to want him the virginian could do no more he had heard cowpunchers say to refractory ponies you keep still or ill balaam you and he now understood the aptness of the expression meanwhile balaam began to lead pedro to the creek for a last drink before starting across the torrid drought the horse held back on the rein a little and balaam turned and cut the whip across his forehead a delay of forcing and backing followed while the virginian already in the saddle waited the minutes passed and no immediate prospect apparently of getting nearer sunk creek he ain goin to follow you while youre beatin his haid the southerner at length remarked do you think you can teach me anything about horses retorted balaam well it dont look like i could said the virginian lazily then dont try it so long as its not your horse my friend again the southerner levelled his eye on balaam all right he said in the same gentle voice and dont you call me your friend youve made that mistake twiced the road was shadeless as it had been from the start and they could not travel fast during the first few hours all coolness was driven out of the glassy morning and another day of illimitable sun invested the world with its blaze the pale bow leg range was coming nearer but its hard hot slants and rifts suggested no sort of freshness and even the pines that spread for wide miles along near the summit counted for nothing in the distance and the glare but seemed mere patches of dull dry discoloration no talk was exchanged between the two travellers for the cowpuncher had nothing to say and balaam was sulky so they moved along in silent endurance of each others company and the tedium of the journey but the slow succession of rise and fall in the plain changed and shortened the earths surface became lumpy rising into mounds and knotted systems of steep small hills cut apart by staring gashes of sand where water poured in the spring from the melting snow after a time they ascended through the foothills till the plain below was for a while concealed but came again into view in its entirety distant and a thing of the past while some magpies sailed down to meet them from the new country they were entering they passed up through a small transparent forest of dead trees standing stark and white and a little higher came on a line of narrow moisture that crossed the way and formed a stale pool among some willow thickets they turned aside to water their horses and found near the pool a circular spot of ashes and some poles lying and beside these a cagelike edifice of willow wands built in the ground indian camp observed the virginian there were the tracks of five or six horses on the farther side of the pool and they did not come into the trail but led off among the rocks on some system of their own theyre about a week old said balaam its part of that outfit thats been hunting theyve gone on to visit their friends added the cowpuncher yes on the southern reservation how far do you call sunk creek now well said the virginian calculating its mighty nigh foty miles from muddy crossin an i reckon weve come eighteen just about its noon balaam snapped his watch shut well rest here till when it was time to go the virginian looked musingly at the mountains well need to travel right smart to get through the canyon tonight he said tell you what said balaam well rope the judges horses together and drive em in front of us thatll make speed mightnt they get away on us objected the virginian theyre powful wild they cant get away from me i guess said balaam and the arrangement was adopted were the first this season over this piece of the trail he observed presently his companion had noticed the ground already and assented there were no tracks anywhere to be seen over which winter had not come and gone since they had been made presently the trail wound into a sultry gulch that hemmed in the heat and seemed to draw down the suns rays more vertically the sorrel horse chose this place to make a try for liberty he suddenly whirled from the trail dragging with him his less inventive fellow leaving the virginian with the old mare balaam headed them off for pedro was quick and they came jumping down the bank together but swiftly crossed up on the other side getting much higher before they could be reached it was no place for this sort of game as the sides of the ravine were ploughed with steep channels broken with jutting knobs of rock and impeded by short twisted pines that swung out from their roots horizontally over the pitch of the hill the virginian helped but used his horse with more judgment keeping as much on the level as possible and endeavoring to anticipate the next turn of the runaways before they made it while balaam attempted to follow them close wheeling short when they doubled heavily beating up the face of the slope veering again to come down to the point he had left and whenever he felt pedro begin to flag driving his spurs into the horse and forcing him to keep up the pace he had set out to overtake and capture on the side of the mountain these two animals who had been running wild for many weeks and now carried no weight but themselves and the futility of such work could not penetrate his obstinate and rising temper he had made up his mind not to give in the virginian soon decided to move slowly along for the present preventing the wild horses from passing down the gulch again but otherwise saving his own animal from useless fatigue he saw that pedro was reeking wet with mouth open and constantly stumbling though he galloped on the cowpuncher kept the group in sight driving the packhorse in front of him and watching the tactics of the sorrel who had now undoubtedly become the leader of the expedition and was at the top of the gulch in vain trying to find an outlet through its rocky rim to the levels above he soon judged this to be no thoroughfare and changing his plan trotted down to the bottom and up the other side gaining more and more for in this new descent pedro had fallen twice then the sorrel showed the cleverness of a genuinely vicious horse the virginian saw him stop and fall to kicking his companion with all the energy that a short rope would permit the rope slipped and both unencumbered reached the top and disappeared leaving the packhorse for balaam the virginian started after them and came into a high tableland beyond which the mountains began in earnest the runaways were moving across toward these at an easy rate he followed for a moment then looking back and seeing no sign of balaam waited for the horses were sure not to go fast when they reached good pasture or water he got out of the saddle and sat on the ground watching till the mare came up slowly into sight and balaam behind her when they were near balaam dismounted and struck pedro fearfully until the stick broke and he raised the splintered half to continue seeing the ponys condition the virginian spoke and said id let that hawss alone balaam turned to him but wholly possessed by passion did not seem to hear and the southerner noticed how white and like that of a maniac his face was the stick slid to the ground he played he was tired said balaam looking at the virginian with glazed eyes the violence of his rage affected him physically like some stroke of illness he played out on me on purpose the mans voice was dry and light hes perfectly fresh now he continued and turned again to the coughing swaying horse whose eyes were closed not having the stick he seized the animals unresisting head and shook it the virginian watched him a moment and rose to stop such a spectacle then as if conscious he was doing no real hurt balaam ceased and turning again in slow fashion looked across the level where the runaways were still visible ill have to take your horse he said mines played out on me you ain goin to touch my hawss again the words seemed not entirely to reach balaams understanding so dulled by rage were his senses he made no answer but mounted pedro and the failing pony walked mechanically forward while the virginian puzzled stood looking after him balaam seemed without purpose of going anywhere and stopped in a moment suddenly he was at work at something this sight was odd and new to look at for a few seconds it had no meaning to the virginian as he watched then his mind grasped the horror too late even with his cry of execration and the tiger spring that he gave to stop balaam the monstrosity was wrought pedro sank motionless his head rolling flat on the earth balaam was jammed beneath him the man had struggled to his feet before the virginian reached the spot and the horse then lifted his head and turned it piteously round then vengeance like a blast struck balaam the virginian hurled him to the ground lifted and hurled him again lifted him and beat his face and struck his jaw the mans strong oxlike fighting availed nothing he fended his eyes as best he could against these sledgehammer blows of justice he felt blindly for his pistol that arm was caught and wrenched backward and crushed and doubled he seemed to hear his own bones and set up a hideous screaming of hate and pain then the pistol at last came out and together with the hand that grasped it was instantly stamped into the dust once again the creature was lifted and slung so that he lay across pedros saddle a blurred dingy wet pulp vengeance had come and gone the man and the horse were motionless around them silence seemed to gather like a witness if you are dead said the virginian i am glad of it he stood looking down at balaam and pedro prone in the middle of the open tableland then he saw balaam looking at him it was the quiet stare of sight without thought or feeling the mere visual sense alone almost frightful in its separation from any self but as he watched those eyes the self came back into them i have not killed you said the virginian well i aint goin to do any more to yu if thats a satisfaction to know then he began to attend to balaam with impersonal skill like some one hired for the purpose he aint hurt bad he asserted aloud as if the man were some nameless patient and then to balaam he remarked i reckon it might have put a less tough man than you out of business for quite a while im goin to get some water now when he returned with the water balsam was sitting up looking about him he had not yet spoken nor did he now speak the sunlight flashed on the sixshooter where it lay and the virginian secured it she aint so pretty as she was he remarked as he examined the weapon but shell go right handy yet strength was in a measure returning to pedro he was a young horse and the exhaustion neither of anguish nor of overriding was enough to affect him long or seriously he got himself on his feet and walked waveringly over to the old mare and stood by her for comfort the cowpuncher came up to him and pedro after starting back slightly seemed to comprehend that he was in friendly hands it was plain that he would soon be able to travel slowly if no weight was on him and that he would be a very good horse again whether they abandoned the runaways or not there was no staying here for night to overtake them without food or water the day was still high and what its next few hours had in store the virginian could not say and he left them to take care of themselves determining meanwhile that he would take command of the minutes and maintain the position he had assumed both as to balaam and pedro he took pedros saddle off threw the mares pack to the ground put balaams saddle on her and on that stowed or tied her original pack which he could do since it was so light then he went to balaam who was sitting up i reckon you can travel said the virginian and your hawss can if youre comin with me youll ride your mare im goin to trail them hawsses if youre not comin with me your hawss comes with me and youll take fifty dollars for him balaam was indifferent to this good bargain he did not look at the other or speak but rose and searched about him on the ground the virginian was also indifferent as to whether balaam chose to answer or not seeing balaam searching the ground he finished what he had to say i have your sixshooter and youll have it when im ready for you to now im goin he concluded balaams intellect was clear enough now and he saw that though the rest of this journey would be nearly intolerable it must go on he looked at the impassive cowpuncher getting ready to go and tying a rope on pedros neck to lead him then he looked at the mountains where the runaways had vanished and it did not seem credible to him that he had come into such straits he was helped stiffly on the mare and the three horses in single file took up their journey once more and came slowly among the mountains the perpetual desert was ended and they crossed a small brook where they missed the trail the virginian dismounted to find where the horses had turned off and discovered that they had gone straight up the ridge by the watercourse theres been a man camped in hyeh inside a month he said kicking up a rag of red flannel white man and two hawsses ours have went up his old tracks it was not easy for balaam to speak yet and he kept his silence but he remembered that shorty had spoken of a trapper who had started for sunk creek for three hours they followed the runaways course over softer ground and steadily ascending passed one or two springs at length where the mud was not yet settled in the hoofprints then they came through a corner of pine forest and down a sudden bank among quakingasps to a green park here the runaways beside a stream were grazing at ease but saw them coming and started on again following down the stream for the present all to be done was to keep them in sight this creek received tributaries and widened making a valley for itself above the bottom lining the first terrace of the ridge began the pines and stretched back unbroken over intervening summit and basin to cease at last where the higher peaks presided this hyehs the middle fork of sunk creek said the virginian well get on to our right road again where they join soon a game trail marked itself along the stream if this would only continue the runaways would be nearly sure to follow it down into the canyon then there would be no way for them but to go on and come out into their own country where they would make for the judges ranch of their own accord the great point was to reach the canyon before dark they passed into permanent shadow for though the other side of the creek shone in full day the sun had departed behind the ridges immediately above them coolness filled the air and the silence which in this deep valley of invading shadow seemed too silent was relieved by the birds not birds of song but a freakish band of gray talkative observers who came calling and croaking along through the pines and inspected the cavalcade keeping it company for a while and then flying up into the woods again the travellers came round a corner on a little spread of marsh and from somewhere in the middle of it rose a buzzard and sailed on its black pinions into the air above them wheeling and wheeling but did not grow distant as it swept over the trail something fell from its claw a rag of red flannel and each man in turn looked at it as his horse went by i wonder if theres plenty elk and deer hyeh said the virginian i guess there is balaam replied speaking at last the travellers had become strangely reconciled theres game most all over these mountains the virginian continued country not been settled long enough to scare them out so they fell into casual conversation and for the first time were glad of each others company the sound of a new bird came from the pines above the hoot of an owl and was answered from some other part of the wood this they did not particularly notice at first but soon they heard the same note unexpectedly distant like an echo the game trail now quite a defined path beside the river showed no sign of changing its course or fading out into blank ground as these uncertain guides do so often it led consistently in the desired direction and the two men were relieved to see it continue not only were the runaways easier to keep track of but better speed was made along this valley the pervading imminence of night more and more dispelled the lingering afternoon though there was yet no twilight in the open and the high peaks opposite shone yellow in the invisible sun but now the owls hooted again their music had something in it that caused both the virginian and balaam to look up at the pines and wish that this valley would end perhaps it was early for nightbirds to begin or perhaps it was that the sound never seemed to fall behind but moved abreast of them among the trees above as they rode on without pause down below some influence made the faces of the travellers grave the spell of evil which the sight of the wheeling buzzard had begun deepened as evening grew while ever and again along the creek the singular call and answer of the owls wandered among the darkness of the trees not far away the sun was gone from the peaks when at length the other side of the stream opened into a long wide meadow the trail they followed after crossing a flat willow thicket by the water ran into dense pines that here for the first time reached all the way down to the waters edge the two men came out of the willows and saw ahead the capricious runaways leave the bottom and go up the hill and enter the wood we must hinder that said the virginian and he dropped pedros rope theres your sixshooter you keep the trail and camp down there he pointed to where the trees came to the water till i head them hawsses off i may not get back right away he galloped up the open hill and went into the pine choosing a place above where the vagrants had disappeared balaam dismounted and picking up his sixshooter took the rope off pedros neck and drove him slowly down toward where the wood began its interior was already dim and balaam saw that here must be their stoppingplace tonight since there was no telling how wide this pine strip might extend along the trail before they could come out of it and reach another suitable campingground pedro had recovered his strength and he now showed signs of restlessness he shied where there was not even a stone in the trail and finally turned sharply round balaam expected he was going to rush back on the way they had come but the horse stood still breathing excitedly he was urged forward again though he turned more than once but when they were a few paces from the wood and balaam had got off preparatory to camping the horse snorted and dashed into the water and stood still there the astonished balaam followed to turn him but pedro seemed to lose control of himself and plunged to the middle of the river and was evidently intending to cross fearing that he would escape to the opposite meadow and add to their difficulties balaam with the idea of turning him round drew his sixshooter and fired in front of the horse divining even as the flash cut the dusk the secret of all this the indians but too late his bruised hand had stiffened marring his aim and he saw pedro fall over in the water then rise and struggle up the bank on the farther shore where he now hurried also to find that he had broken the ponys leg he needed no interpreter for the voices of the seeming owls that had haunted the latter hour of their journey and he knew that his beasts keener instinct had perceived the destruction that lurked in the interior of the wood the history of the trapper whose horse had returned without him might have been might still be his own and he thought of the rag that had fallen from the buzzards talons when he had been disturbed at his meal in the marsh peaceable indians were still in these mountains and some few of them had for the past hour been skirting his journey unseen and now waited for him in the wood which they expected him to enter they had been too wary to use their rifles or show themselves lest these travellers should be only part of a larger company following who would hear the noise of a shot and catch them in the act of murder so safe under the cover of the pines they had planned to sling their silent noose and drag the white man from his horse as he passed through the trees balaam looked over the river at the ominous wood and then he looked at pedro the horse that he had first maimed and now ruined to whom he probably owed his life he was lying on the ground quietly looking over the green meadow where dusk was gathering perhaps he was not suffering from his wound yet as he rested on the ground and into his animal intelligence there probably came no knowledge of this final stroke of his fate at any rate no sound of pain came from pedro whose friendly and gentle face remained turned toward the meadow once more balaam fired his pistol and this time the aim was true and the horse rolled over with a ball through his brain it was the best reward that remained for him then balaam rejoined the old mare and turned from the middle fork of sunk creek he dashed across the wide field and went over a ridge and found his way along in the night till he came to the old trail the road which they would never have left but for him and his obstinacy he unsaddled the weary mare by sunk creek where the canyon begins letting her drag a rope and find pasture and water while he lighting no fire to betray him crouched close under a tree till the light came he thought of the virginian in the wood but what could either have done for the other had he stayed to look for him among the pines if the cowpuncher came back to the corner he would follow balaams tracks or not they would meet at any rate where the creeks joined but they did not meet and then to balaam the prospect of going onward to the sunk creek ranch became more than he could bear to come without the horses to meet judge henry to meet the guests of the judges looking as he did now after his punishment by the virginian to give the news about the judges favorite man no how could he tell such a story as this balaam went no farther than a certain cabin where he slept and wrote a letter to the judge this the owner of the cabin delivered and so having spread news which would at once cause a search for the virginian and having constructed such sentences to the judge as would most smoothly explain how being overtaken by illness he had not wished to be a burden at sunk creek balaam turned homeward by himself by the time he was once more at butte creek his general appearance was a thing less to be noticed and there was shorty waiting one way and another the lost dog had been able to gather some ready money he was cheerful because of this momentary purseful of prosperity and so i come back yu see he said for i figured on getting pedro back as soon as i could when i sold him to yu youre behind the times shorty said balaam shorty looked blank youve sure not sold pedro he exclaimed them indians said balaam got after me on the bow leg trail got after me and that virginia man but they didnt get me balaam wagged his bullet head to imply that this escape was due to his own superior intelligence the virginian had been stupid and so the indians had got him and they shot your horse balaam finished stop and get some dinner with the boys having eaten shorty rode away in mournful spirits for he had made so sure of once more riding and talking with pedro his friend whom he had taught to shake hands xxvii grandmother stark except for its chair and bed the cabin was stripped almost bare amid its emptiness of dismantled shelves and walls and floor only the tiny ancestress still hung in her place last token of the home that had been this miniature tacked against the despoiled boards and its descendant the angry girl with her hand on an open boxlid made a sort of couple in the loneliness she on the wall sweet and serene she by the box sweet and stormy the picture was her final treasure waiting to be packed for the journey in whatever room she had called her own since childhood there it had also lived and looked at her not quite familiar not quite smiling but in its prim colonial hues delicate as some pressed flower its pale oval of color blue and rose and flaxen in a battered pretty gold frame unconquerably pervaded any surroundings with a something like last years lavender till yesterday a crow indian warbonnet had hung next it a sumptuous cascade of feathers on the other side a bow with arrows had dangled opposite had been the skin of a silver fox over the door had spread the antlers of a blacktail deer a bearskin stretched beneath it thus had the whole cosey log cabin been upholstered lavish with trophies of the frontier and yet it was in front of the miniature that the visitors used to stop shining quietly now in the cabins blackness this summer day the heirloom was presiding until the end and as molly woods eyes fell upon her ancestress of bennington there flashed a spark of steel in them alone here in the room that she was leaving forever she was not going to teach school any more on bear creek wyoming she was going home to bennington vermont when time came for school to open again there should be a new schoolmarm this was the momentous result of that visit which the virginian had paid her he had told her that he was coming for his hour soon from that hour she had decided to escape she was running away from her own heart she did not dare to trust herself face to face again with her potent indomitable lover she longed for him and therefore she would never see him again no greataunt at dunbarton or anybody else that knew her and her family should ever say that she had married below her station had been an unworthy stark accordingly she had written to the virginian bidding him goodby and wishing him everything in the world as she happened to be aware that she was taking everything in the world away from him this letter was not the most easy of letters to write but she had made the language very kind yes it was a thoroughly kind communication and all because of that momentary visit when he had brought back to her two novels emma and pride and prejudice how do you like them she had then inquired and he had smiled slowly at her you havent read them she exclaimed no are you going to tell me there has been no time no then molly had scolded her cowpuncher and to this he had listened with pleasure undisguised as indeed he listened to every word that she said why it has come too late he had told her when the scolding was over if i was one of your little scholars hyeh in bear creek schoolhouse yu could learn me to like such frillery i reckon but im a mighty ignorant growedup man so much the worse for you said molly no i am pretty glad i am a man else i could not have learned the thing you have taught me but she shut her lips and looked away on the desk was a letter written from vermont if you dont tell me at once when you decide had said the arch writer never hope to speak to me again mary wood seriously i am suspicious why do you never mention him nowadays how exciting to have you bring a live cowboy to bennington we should all come to dinner though of course i understand now that many of them have excellent manners but would he wear his pistol at table so the letter ran on it recounted the latest home gossip and jokes in answering it molly wood had taken no notice of its childish tone here and there hyehs some of them cactus blossoms yu wanted said the virginian his voice recalled the girl with almost a start ive brought a good hawss ive gentled for yu and taylorll keep him till i need him thank you so much but i wish i reckon yu cant stop me lendin taylor a hawss and you certnlyll get sick schoolteachin if yu dont keep outdoors some goodby till that next time yes theres always a next time she answered as lightly as she could there always will be dont yu know that she did not reply i have discouraged spells he pursued but i down them for ive told yu you were going to love me you are goin to learn back the thing you have taught me im not askin anything now i dont want you to speak a word to me but im never goin to quit till next time is no more and its all the time for you and me with that he had ridden away not even touching her hand long after he had gone she was still in her chair her eyes lingering upon his flowers those yellow cups of the prickly pear at length she had risen impatiently caught up the flowers gone with them to the open windowand then after all set them with pains in water but today bear creek was over she was going home now by the weeks end she would be started by the time the mail brought him her goodby letter she would be gone she had acted to bear creek the neighborly the friendly the not comprehending this move had come unlooked for and had brought regret only one hard word had been spoken to molly and that by her nextdoor neighbor and kindest friend in mrs taylors house the girl had daily come and gone as a daughter and that lady reached the subject thuswhen i took taylor said she sitting by as robert browning and jane austen were going into their box i married for love do you wish it had been money said molly stooping to her industries you know both of us better than that child i know ive seen people at home who couldnt possibly have had any other reason they seemed satisfied too maybe the poor ignorant things were and so i have never been sure how i might choose yes you are sure deary dont you think i know you and when it comes over taylor once in a while and he tells me im the best thing in his life and i tell him he aint merely the best thing but the only thing in mine him and the children why we just agree wed do it all over the same way if we had the chance molly continued to be industrious and thats why said mrs taylor i want every girl thats anything to me to know her luck when it comes for i was that near telling taylor i wouldnt if ever my luck comes said molly with her back to her friend i shall say i will at once then youll say it at bennington next week molly wheeled round why you surely will do you expect hes going to stay here and you in bennington and the campaigner sat back in her chair he goodness who is he child child youre talking cross today because youre at outs with yourself youve been at outs ever since you took this idea of leaving the school and us and everything this needless way you have not treated him right and why i cant make out to save me what have you found out all of a sudden if he was not good enough for you i but oh its a prime one youre losing molly when a man like that stays faithful to a girl spite all the chances he gets her luck is come oh my luck people have different notions of luck notions he has been very kind kind and now without further simmering mrs taylors wrath boiled up and poured copiously over molly wood kind theres a word you shouldnt use my dear no doubt you can spell it but more than its spelling i guess you dont know the children can learn what it means from some of the rest of us folks that dont spell so correct maybe mrs taylor mrs taylor i cant wait deary since the roughness looks bigger to you than the diamond you had better go back to vermont i expect youll find better grammar there deary the good dame stalked out and across to her own cabin and left the angry girl among her boxes it was in vain she fell to work upon them presently something had to be done over again and when it was the box held several chattels less than before the readjustment she played a sort of desperate dominos to fit these objects in the space but here were a paperweight a portfolio with two wretched volumes that no chink would harbor and letting them fall all at once she straightened herself still stormy with revolt eyes and cheeks still hot from the sting of longparried truth there on her wall still was the miniature the little silent ancestress and upon this face the girls glance rested it was as if she appealed to grandmother stark for support and comfort across the hundred years which lay between them so the flaxen girl on the wall and she among the boxes stood a moment face to face in seeming communion and then the descendant turned again to her work but after a desultory touch here and there she drew a long breath and walked to the open door what use was in finishing today when she had nearly a week this first spurt of toil had swept the cabin bare of all indwelling charm and its look was chill across the lane his horse the one he had gentled for her was grazing idly she walked there and caught him and led him to her gate mrs taylor saw her go in and soon come out in ridingdress and she watched the girl throw the saddle on with quick ease the ease he had taught her mrs taylor also saw the sharp cut she gave the horse and laughed grimly to herself in her window as horse and rider galloped into the beautiful sunny loneliness to the punished animal this switching was new and at its third repetition he turned his head in surprise but was no more heeded than were the bluffs and flowers where he was taking his own undirected choice of way he carried her over ground she knew by heart corncliff mesa crowheart butte westfalls crossing upper canyon open land and woodland pines and sagebrush all silent and grave and lustrous in the sunshine once and again a ranchman greeted her and wondered if she had forgotten who he was once she passed some cowpunchers with a small herd of steers and they stared after her too bear creek narrowed its mountainsides drew near its little falls began to rush white in midday shadow and the horse suddenly pricked his ears unguided he was taking this advantage to go home though he had made but little way a mere beginning yet on this trail over to sunk creek here was already a sunk creek friend whinnying good day to him so he whinnied back and quickened his pace and molly started to life what was monte doing here she saw the black horse she knew also saddled with reins dragging on the trail as the rider had dropped them to dismount a cold spring bubbled out beyond the next rock and she knew her lovers horse was waiting for him while he drank she pulled at the reins but loosed them for to turn and escape now was ridiculous and riding boldly round the rock she came upon him by the spring one of his arms hung up to its elbow in the pool the other was crooked beside his head but the face was sunk downward against the shelving rock so that she saw only his black tangled hair as her horse snorted and tossed his head she looked swiftly at monte as if to question him seeing now the sweat matted on his coat and noting the white rim of his eye she sprang and ran to the motionless figure a patch of blood at his shoulder behind stained the soft flannel shirt spreading down beneath his belt and the mans whole strong body lay slack and pitifully helpless she touched the hand beside his head but it seemed neither warm nor cold to her she felt for the pulse as nearly as she could remember the doctors did but could not tell whether she imagined or not that it was still twice with painful care her fingers sought and waited for the beat and her face seemed like one of listening she leaned down and lifted his other arm and hand from the water and as their icecoldness reached her senses clearly she saw the patch near the shoulder she had moved grow wet with new blood and at that sight she grasped at the stones upon which she herself now sank she held tight by two rocks sitting straight beside him staring and murmuring aloud i must not faint i will not faint and the standing horses looked at her pricking their ears in this cuplike spread of the ravine the sun shone warmly down the tall red cliff was warm the pines were a warm film and filter of green outside the shade across bear creek rose the steep soft open yellow hill warm and high to the blue and bear creek tumbled upon its sunsparkling stones the two horses on the margin trail still looked at the spring and trees where sat the neat flaxen girl so rigid by the slack prone body in its flannel shirt and leathern chaps suddenly her face livened but the blood ran she exclaimed as if to the horses her companions in this she moved to him and put her hand in through his shirt against his heart next moment she had sprung up and was at his saddle searching then swiftly went on to her own and got her small flask and was back beside him here was the cold water he had sought and she put it against his forehead and drenched the wounded shoulder with it three times she tried to move him so he might lie more easy but his dead weight was too much and desisting she sat close and raised his head to let it rest against her thus she saw the blood that was running from in front of the shoulder also but she said no more about fainting she tore strips from her dress and soaked them keeping them cold and wet upon both openings of his wound and she drew her pocketknife out and cut his shirt away from the place as she continually rinsed and cleaned it she watched his eyelashes long and soft and thick but they did not stir again she tried the flask but failed from being still too gentle and her searching eyes fell upon ashes near the pool still undispersed by the weather lay the small charred ends of a fire he and she had made once here together to boil coffee and fry trout she built another fire now and when the flames were going well filled her flaskcup from the spring and set it to heat meanwhile she returned to nurse his head and wound her cold water had stopped the bleeding then she poured her brandy in the steaming cup and made rough by her desperate helplessness forced some between his lips and teeth instantly almost she felt the tremble of life creeping back and as his deep eyes opened upon her she sat still and mute but the gaze seemed luminous with an unnoting calm and she wondered if perhaps he could not recognize her she watched this internal clearness of his vision scarcely daring to breathe until presently he began to speak with the same profound and clear impersonality sounding in his slowly uttered words i thought they had found me i expected they were going to kill me he stopped and she gave him more of the hot drink which he took still lying and looking at her as if the present did not reach his senses i knew hands were touching me i reckon i was not dead i knew about them soon as they began only i could not interfere he waited again it is mighty strange where i have been no mighty natural then he went back into his revery and lay with his eyes still full open upon her where she sat motionless she began to feel a greater awe in this living presence than when it had been his body with an icecold hand and she quietly spoke his name venturing scarcely more than a whisper at this some nearer thing wakened in his look but it was you all along he resumed it is you now you must not stay weakness overcame him and his eyes closed she sat ministering to him and when he roused again he began anxiously at once you must not stay they would get you too she glanced at him with a sort of fierceness then reached for his pistol in which was nothing but blackened empty cartridges she threw these out and drew six from his belt loaded the weapon and snapped shut its hinge please take it he said more anxious and more himself i aint worth tryin to keep look at me are you giving up she inquired trying to put scorn in her tone then she seated herself where is the sense in both of us you had better save your strength she interrupted he tried to sit up lie down she ordered he sank obediently and began to smile when she saw that she smiled too and unexpectedly took his hand listen friend said she nobody shall get you and nobody shall get me now take some more brandy it must be noon said the cowpuncher when she had drawn her hand away from him i remember it was dark when when when i can remember i reckon they were scared to follow me in so close to settlers else they would have been here you must rest she observed she broke the soft ends of some evergreen and putting them beneath his head went to the horses loosened the cinches took off the bridles led them to drink and picketed them to feed further still to leave nothing undone which she could herself manage she took the horses saddles off to refold the blankets when the time should come and meanwhile brought them for him but he put them away from him he was sitting up against a rock stronger evidently and asking for cold water his head was firehot and the paleness beneath his swarthy skin had changed to a deepening flush only five miles she said to him bathing his head yes i must hold it steady he answered waving his hand at the cliff she told him to try and keep it steady until they got home yes he repeated only five miles but its fightin to turn around half aware that he was becoming lightheaded he looked from the rock to her and from her to the rock with dilating eyes we can hold it together she said you must get on your horse she took his handkerchief from round his neck knotting it with her own and to make more bandage she ran to the roll of clothes behind his saddle and tore in halves a clean shirt a handkerchief fell from it which she seized also and opening saw her own initials by the hem then she remembered she saw again their first meeting the swollen river the overset stage the unknown horseman who carried her to the bank on his saddle and went away unthanked her whole first adventure on that first day of her coming to this new country and now she knew how her longforgotten handkerchief had gone that day she refolded it gently and put it back in his bundle for there was enough bandage without it she said not a word to him and he placed a wrong meaning upon the look which she gave him as she returned to bind his shoulder it dont hurt so much he assured her though extreme pain was clearing his head for the moment and he had been able to hold the cliff from turning yu must not squander your pity do not squander your strength said she oh i could put up a pretty good fight now but he tottered in showing her how strong he was and she told him that after all he was a child still yes he slowly said looking after her as she went to bring his horse the same child that wanted to touch the moon i guess and during the slow climb down into the saddle from a rock to which she helped him he said you have got to be the man all through this mess she saw his teeth clinched and his drooping muscles compelled by will and as he rode and she walked to lend him support leading her horse by a backwardstretched left hand she counted off the distance to him continually the increasing gain the lessening road the landmarks nearing and dropping behind here was the tree with the waspnest gone now the burned cabin was passed now the cottonwoods at the ford were in sight he was silent and held to the saddlehorn leaning more and more against his two hands clasped over it and just after they had made the crossing he fell without a sound slipping to the grass and his descent broken by her but it started the blood a little and she dared not leave him to seek help she gave him the last of the flask and all the water he craved revived he managed to smile yu see i aint worth keeping its only a mile said she so she found a log a fallen trunk and he crawled to that and from there crawled to his saddle and she marched on with him talking bidding him note the steps accomplished for the next halfmile they went thus the silent man clinched on the horse and by his side the girl walking and cheering him forward when suddenly he began to speaki will say goodby to you now maam she did not understand at first the significance of this he is getting away pursued the virginian i must ask you to excuse me maam it was a long while since her lord had addressed her as maam as she looked at him in growing apprehension he turned monte and would have ridden away but she caught the bridle you must take me home said she with ready inspiration i am afraid of the indians why you why theyve all gone there he goes maam that hawss no said she holding firmly his rein and quickening her step a gentleman does not invite a lady to go out riding and leave her his eyes lost their purpose ill certnly take you home that sorrel has gone in there by the wallow and judge henry will understand with his eyes watching imaginary objects he rode and rambled and it was now the girl who was silent except to keep his mind from its halffixed idea of the sorrel as he grew more fluent she hastened still more listening to head off that notion of return skilfully inventing questions to engage him so that when she brought him to her gate she held him in a manner subjected answering faithfully the shrewd unrealities which she devised whatever makeshifts she could summon to her mind and next she had got him inside her dwelling and set him down docile but now completely wandering and then no help was at hand even here she had made sure of aid from next door and there she hastened to find the taylors cabin locked and silent and this meant that parents and children were gone to drive nor might she be luckier at her next nearest neighbors should she travel the intervening mile to fetch them with a mind jostled once more into uncertainty she returned to her room and saw a change in him already illness had stridden upon him his face was not as she had left it and the whole body the splendid supple horseman showed sickness in every line and limb its spurs and pistol and bold leather chaps a mockery of trappings she looked at him and decision came back to her clear and steady she supported him over to her bed and laid him on it his head sank flat and his loose nerveless arms stayed as she left them then among her packingboxes and beneath the little miniature blue and flaxen and gold upon its lonely wall she undressed him he was cold and she covered him to the face and arranged the pillow and got from its box her scarlet and black navajo blanket and spread it over him there was no more that she could do and she sat down by him to wait among the many and many things that came into her mind was a word he said to her lightly a long while ago cowpunchers do not live long enough to get old he had told her and now she looked at the head upon the pillow grave and strong but still the head of splendid unworn youth at the distant jingle of the wagon in the lane she was out and had met her returning neighbors midway they heard her with amazement and came in haste to the bedside then taylor departed to spread news of the indians and bring the doctor twentyfive miles away the two women friends stood alone again as they had stood in the morning when anger had been between them kiss me deary said mrs taylor now i will look after him and youll need some looking after yourself but on returning from her cabin with what store she possessed of lint and stimulants she encountered a rebel independent as ever molly would hear no talk about saving her strength would not be in any room but this one until the doctor should arrive then perhaps it would be time to think about resting so together the dame and the girl rinsed the mans wound and wrapped him in clean things and did all the little that they knew which was in truth the very thing needed then they sat watching him toss and mutter it was no longer upon indians or the sorrel horse that his talk seemed to run or anything recent apparently always excepting his work this flowingly merged with whatever scene he was inventing or living again and he wandered unendingly in that incompatible world we dream in through the medley of events and names often thickly spoken but rising at times to grotesque coherence the listeners now and then could piece out the reference from their own knowledge monte for example continually addressed and molly heard her own name but invariably as miss wood nothing less respectful came out and frequently he answered some one as maam at these fragments of revelation mrs taylor abstained from speech but eyed molly wood with caustic reproach as the night wore on short lulls of silence intervened and the watchers were deceived into hope that the fever was abating and when the virginian sat quietly up in bed essayed to move his bandage and looked steadily at mrs taylor she rose quickly and went to him with a question as to how he was doing rise on your laigs you polecat said he and tell them youre a liar the good dame gasped then bade him lie down and he obeyed her with that strange double understanding of the delirious for even while submitting he muttered liar polecat and then trampas at that name light flashed on mrs taylor and she turned to molly and there was the girl struggling with a fit of mirth at his speech but the laughter was fast becoming a painful seizure mrs taylor walked molly up and down speaking mmediately to arrest her attention you might as well know it she said he would blame me for speaking of it but wheres the harm all this while after and you would never hear it from his mouth molly child they say trampas would kill him if he dared and thats on account of you i never saw trampas said molly fixing her eyes upon the speaker no deary but before a lot of men taylor has told me about it trampas spoke disrespectfully of you and before them all he made trampas say he was a liar that is what he did when you were almost a stranger among us and he had not started seeing so much of you i expect trampas is the only enemy he ever had in this country but he would never let you know about that no whispered molly i did not know steve the sick man now cried out in poignant appeal steve to the women it was a name unknown unknown as was also this deep inward tide of feeling which he could no longer conceal being himself no longer no steve he said next and muttering followed it aint so he shouted and then cunningly in a lowered voice steve i have lied for you in time mrs taylor spoke some advice you had better go to bed child you look about ready for the doctor yourself then i will wait for him said molly so the two nurses continued to sit until darkness at the windows weakened into gray and the lamp was no more needed their patient was rambling again yet into whatever scenes he went there in some guise did the throb of his pain evidently follow him and he lay hitching his great shoulder as if to rid it of the cumbrance they waited for the doctor not daring much more than to turn pillows and give what other ease they could and then instead of the doctor came a messenger about noon to say he was gone on a visit some thirty miles beyond where taylor had followed to bring him here as soon as might be at this molly consented to rest and to watch turn about and once she was over in her friends house lying down they tried to keep her there but the revolutionist could not be put down and when as a last pretext mrs taylor urged the proprieties and conventions the pale girl from vermont laughed sweetly n her face and returned to sit by the sick man with the approach of the second night his fever seemed to rise and master him more completely than they had yet seen it and presently it so raged that the women called in stronger arms to hold him down there were times when he broke out in the language of the roundup and mrs taylor renewed her protests why said molly dont you suppose i knew they could swear so the dame in deepening astonishment and affection gave up these shifts at decorum nor did the delirium run into the intimate coarse matters that she dreaded the cowpuncher had lived like his kind but his natural daily thoughts were clean and came from the untamed but unstained mind of a man and toward morning as mrs taylor sat taking her turn suddenly he asked had he been sick long and looked at her with a quieted eye the wandering seemed to drop from him at a stroke leaving him altogether himself he lay very feeble and inquired once or twice of his state and how he came here nor was anything left in his memory of even coming to the spring where he had been found when the doctor arrived he pronounced that it would be long or very short he praised their clean water treatment the wound was fortunately well up on the shoulder and gave so far no bad signs there were not any bad signs and the blood and strength of the patient had been as few mens were each hour was now an hour nearer certainty and meanwhile meanwhile the doctor would remain as long as he could he had many inquiries to satisfy dusty fellows would ride up listen to him and reply as they rode away dont yu let him die doc and judge henry sent over from sunk creek to answer for any attendance or medicine that might help his foreman the country was moved with concern and interest and in mollys ears its words of good feeling seemed to unite and sum up a burden dont yu let him die doc the indians who had done this were now in military custody they had come unpermitted from a southern reservation hunting next thieving and as the slumbering spirit roused in one or two of the young and ambitious they had ventured this in the secret mountains and perhaps had killed a trapper found there editors immediately reared a tall war out of it but from five indians in a guardhouse waiting punishment not even an editor can supply spar for more than two editions and if the recent alarm was still a matter of talk anywhere it was not here in the sickroom whichever way the case should turn it was through molly alone the doctor told her that the wounded man had got this chance this good chance he related and he told her she had not done a womans part but a mans part and now had no more to do no more till the patient got well and could thank her in his own way said the doctor smiling and supposing things that were not so misled perhaps by mrs taylor im afraid ill be gone by the time he is well said molly coldly and the discreet physician said ah and that she would find bennington quite a change from bear creek but mrs taylor spoke otherwise and at that the girl said i shall stay as long as i am needed i will nurse him i want to nurse him i will do everything for him that i can she exclaimed with force and that wont be anything deary said mrs taylor harshly a year of nursing dont equal a day of sweetheart the girl took a walk she was of no more service in the room at present but she turned without going far and mrs taylor spied her come to lean over the pasture fence and watch the two horses that one the virginian had gentled for her and his own monte during this suspense came a new call for the doctor neighbors profiting by his visit to bear creek and in his going away to them even under promise of quick return mrs taylor suspected a favorable sign he kept his word as punctually as had been possible arriving after some six hours with a confident face and spending now upon the patient a care not needed save to reassure the bystanders he spoke his opinion that all was even better than he could have hoped it would be so soon here was now the beginning of the fifth day the wounds look was wholesome no further delirium had come and the fever had abated a degree while he was absent he believed the serious dangerline lay behind and short of the unforeseen the mans deep untainted strength would reassert its control he had much blood to make and must be cared for during weeks three four five there was no saying how long yet these next few days it must be utter quiet for him he must not talk nor hear anything likely to disturb him and then the time for cheerfulness and gradual company would come sooner than later the doctor hoped so he departed and sent next day some bottles with further cautions regarding the wound and dirt and to say he should be calling the day after tomorrow upon that occasion he found two patients molly wood lay in bed at mrs taylors filled with apology and indignation with little to do and deprived of the strong stimulant of anxiety and action her strength had quite suddenly left her so that she had spoken only in a sort of whisper but upon waking from a long sleep after mrs taylor had taken her firmly almost severely in hand her natural voice had returned and now the chief treatment the doctor gave her was a sort of scolding which it pleased mrs taylor to hear the doctor even dropped a phrase concerning the arrogance of strong nerves in slender bodies and of undertaking several peoples work when several people were at hand to do it for themselves and this pleased mrs taylor remarkably as for the wounded man he was behaving himself properly perhaps in another week he could be moved to a more cheerful room just now with cleanliness and pure air any barn would do we are real lucky to have such a sensible doctor in the country mrs taylor observed after the physician had gone no doubt said molly he said my room was a barn thats what youve made it deary but sick men dont notice much nevertheless one may believe without going widely astray that illness so far from veiling more often quickens the perceptions at any rate those of the naturally keen on a later day and the interval was brief while molly was on her second drive to take the air with mrs taylor that lady informed her that the sick man had noticed and i could not tell him things liable to disturb him said she and so i well i expect i just didnt exactly tell him the facts i said yes you were packing up for a little visit to your folks they had not seen you for quite a while i said and he looked at those boxes kind of silent like theres no need to move him said molly it is simpler to move them the boxes i could take out some of my things you know just while he has to be kept there i mean you see if the doctor says the room should be cheerful yes deary i will ask the doctor next time said molly if he believes i am competent to spread a rug upon a floor mollys references to the doctor were usually acid these days and this he totally failed to observe telling her when he came why to be sure the very thing and if she could play cards or read aloud or afford any other light distractions provided they did not lead the patient to talk and tire himself that she would be most useful accordingly she took over the cribbage board and came with unexpected hesitation face to face again with the swarthy man she had saved and tended he was not so swarthy now but neat with chin clean and hair and mustache trimmed and smooth and he sat propped among pillows watching for her you are better she said speaking first and with uncertain voice yes they have given me awdehs not to talk said the southerner smiling oh yes please do not talk not today no only this he looked at her and saw her seem to shrink thank you for what you have done he said simply she took tenderly the hand he stretched to her and upon these terms they set to work at cribbage she won and won again and the third time laid down her cards and reproached him with playing in order to lose no he said and his eye wandered to the boxes but my thoughts get away from me ill be strong enough to hold them on the cyards next time i reckon many tones in his voice she had heard but never the tone of sadness until today then they played a little more and she put away the board for this first time you are going now he asked when i have made this room look a little less forlorn they havent wanted to meddle with my things i suppose and molly stooped once again among the chattels destined for vermont out they came again the bearskin was spread on the floor various possessions and ornaments went back into their ancient niches the shelves grew comfortable with books and last some flowers were stood on the table more like old times said the virginian but sadly its too bad said molly you had to be brought into such a looking place and your folks waiting for you said he oh ill pay my visit later said molly putting the rug a trifle straighter may i ask one thing pleaded the virginian and at the gentleness of his voice her face grew rosy and she fixed her eyes on him with a sort of dread anything that i can answer said she oh yes did i tell yu to quit me and did yu load up my gun and stay was that a real business i have been mixed up in my haid that was real said molly what else was there to do just nothing for such as you he exclaimed my haid has been mighty crazy and that little grandmother of yours yondeh she but i cant just quite catch ahold of these things he passed a hand over his forehead so many or else one right along well its all foolishness he concluded with something almost savage in his tone and after she had gone from the cabin he lay very still looking at the miniature on the wall he was in another sort of mood the next time cribbage not interesting him in the least your folks will be wondering about you said he i dont think they will mind which month i go to them said molly especially when they know the reason dont let me keep you maam said he molly stared at him but he pursued with the same edge lurking in his slow words though ill never forget how could i forget any of all you have done and been if there had been none of this why i had enough to remember but please dont stay maam well say i had a claim when yu found me pretty well dead but im gettin well yu see right smart too i cant understand indeed i cant said molly why youre talking so he seemed to have certain moods when he would address her as maam and this she did not like but could not prevent oh a sick man is funny and yu know im grateful to you please say no more about that or i shall go this afternoon i dont want to go i am not ready i think i had better read something now why yes thats certnly a good notion why this is the best show youll ever get to give me education wont yu please try that emma book now maam listening to you will be different this was said with softness and humility uncertain as his gravity often left her precisely what he meant by what he said molly proceeded with emma slackly at first but soon with the enthusiasm that miss austen invariably gave her she held the volume and read away at it commenting briefly and then finishing a chapter of the sprightly classic found her pupil slumbering peacefully there was no uncertainty about that you couldnt be doing a healthier thing for him deary said mrs taylor if it gets to make him wakeful try something harder this was the ladys scarcely sympathetic view but it turned out to be not obscurity in which miss austen sinned when molly next appeared at the virginians threshold he said plaintively i reckon i am a dunce and he sued for pardon when i waked up he said i was ashamed of myself for a plumb halfhour nor could she doubt this day that he meant what he said his mood was again serene and gentle and without referring to his singular words that had distressed her he made her feel his contrition even in his silence i am right glad you have come he said and as he saw her going to the bookshelf he continued with diffidence as regyards that emma book yu see yu see the doins and sayins of folks like them are above me but i think he spoke most diffidently if yu could read me something that was about something i id be liable to keep awake and he smiled with a certain shyness something about something queried molly at a loss why yes shakespeare henry the fourth the british king is fighting and there is his son the prince he certnly must have been a jimdandy boy if that is all true only he would go around town with a mighty triflin gang they sported and they held up citizens and his father hated his travelling with trash like them it was right natural the boy and the old man but the boy showed himself a man too he killed a big fighter on the other side who was another jimdandy and he was sorry for having it to do the virginian warmed to his recital i understand most all of that there was a fat man kept everybody laughing he was awful natural too except yu dont commonly meet em so fat but the prince that play is bedrock maam have you got something like that yes i think so she replied i believe i see what you would appreciate she took her browning her idol her imagined affinity for the pale decadence of new england had somewhat watered her good old revolutionary blood too and she was inclined to think under glass and to live underdone when there were no indians to shoot she would have joyed to venture paracelsus on him and some lengthy rhymed discourses and she fondly turned leaves and leaves of her pet doggerel analytics pippa passes and others she had to skip from discreet motives pages which he would have doubtless stayed awake at but she chose a poem at length this was better than emma he pronounced and short the horse was a good horse he thought a man whose horse must not play out on him would watch the ground he was galloping over for holes and not be likely to see what color the rims of his animals eyesockets were you could not see them if you sat as you ought to for such a hard ride of the next piece that she read him he thought still better and it is short said he but the last part drops molly instantly exacted particulars the soldier should not have told the general he was killed stated the cowpuncher what should he have told him id like to know said molly why just nothing if the soldier could ride out of the battle all shot up and tell his general about their takin the town that was being gritty yu see but that truck at the finish will yu please say it again so molly read youre wounded nay the soldiers pride touched to the quick he said im killed sire and his chief beside smiling the boy fell dead nay im killed sire drawled the virginian amiably for symptom of convalescence his freakish irony was revived in him now a man who was man enough to act like he did yu see would fall dead without mentioning it none of mollys sweet girl friends had ever thus challenged mr browning they had been wont to cluster over him with a joyous awe that deepened proportionally with their misunderstanding molly paused to consider this novelty of view about the soldier he was a frenchman you know she said under inspiration a frenchman murmured the grave cowpuncher i never knowed a frenchman but i reckon they might perform that class of foolishness but why was it foolish she cried his soldiers pride dont you see no molly now burst into a luxury of discussion she leaned toward her cowpuncher with bright eyes searching his with elbow on knee and hand propping chin her lap became a slant and from it browning the poet slid and toppled and lay unrescued for the slow cowpuncher unfolded his notions of masculine courage and modesty though he did not deal in such highsounding names and molly forgot everything to listen to him as he forgot himself and his inveterate shyness and grew talkative to her i would never have supposed that she would exclaim as she heard him or presently again i never had such an idea and her mind opened with delight to these new things which came from the mans mind so simple and direct to browning they did come back but the virginian though interested conceived a dislike for him he is a smarty said he once or twice now here is something said molly i have never known what to think oh heavens murmured the sick man smiling is it short very short now please attend and she read him twelve lines about a lover who rowed to a beach in the dusk crossed a field tapped at a pane and was admitted that is the best yet said the virginian theres only one thing yu can think about that but wait said the girl swiftly here is how they parted round the cape of a sudden came the sea and the sun looked over the mountains rim and straight was a path of gold for him and the need of a world of men for me that is very very true murmured the virginian dropping his eyes from the girls intent ones had they quarrelled she inquired oh no but i reckon he loved her very much then youre sure they hadnt quarrelled dead sure maam he would come back afteh he had played some more of the game the game life maam whatever he was adoin in the world of men thats a bedrock piece maam well i dont see why you think its so much better than some of the others i could scacely explain answered the man but that writer does know something i am glad they hadnt quarrelled said molly thoughtfully and she began to like having her opinions refuted his bandages becoming a little irksome had to be shifted and this turned their discourse from literature to wyoming and molly inquired had he ever been shot before only once he told her i have been lucky in having few fusses said he i hate them if a man has to be killed you never broke in molly she had started back a little well she added hastily dont tell me if i shouldnt wonder if i got one of those indians he said quietly but i wasnt waitin to see but i came mighty near doing for a white man that day he had been hurtin a hawss hurting said molly injurin i will not tell yu about that it would hurt yu to hear such things but hawsses dont they depend on us aint they somethin like children i did not lay up the man very bad he was able to travel most right away why youd have wanted to kill him yourself so the virginian talked nor knew what he was doing to the girl nor was she aware of what she was receiving from him as he unwittingly spoke himself out to her in these browning meetings they had each day but mrs taylor grew pleased the kindly dame would sometimes cross the road to see if she were needed and steal away again after a peep at the window there inside among the restored home treasures sat the two the rosy alert girl sweet as she talked or read to him and he the grave halfweak giant among his wraps watching her of her delayed home visit he never again spoke either to her or to mrs taylor and molly veered aside from any trend of talk she foresaw was leading toward that subject but in those hours when no visitors came and he was by himself in the quiet he would lie often sombrely contemplating the girls room her little dainty knickknacks her home photographs all the delicate manifestations of what she came from and what she was strength was flowing back into him each day and judge henrys latest messenger had brought him clothes and mail from sunk creek and many inquiries of kindness and returned taking the news of the cowpunchers improvement and how soon he would be permitted the fresh air hence molly found him waiting in a flannel shirt of highly becoming shade and with a silk handkerchief knotted round his throat and he told her it was good to feel respectable again she had come to read to him for the allotted time and she threw around his shoulders the scarlet and black navajo blanket striped with its splendid zigzags of barbarity thus he half sat half leaned languid but at ease in his lap lay one of the letters brought over by the messenger and though she was midway in a book that engaged his full attention david copperfeld his silence and absent look this morning stopped her and she accused him of not attending no he admitted i am thinking of something else she looked at him with that apprehension which he knew it had to come said he and today i see my thoughts straighter than ive been up to managing since since my haid got clear and now i must say these thoughts if i can if i can he stopped his eyes were intent upon her one hand was gripping the arm of his chair you promised trembled molly i promised you should love me he sternly interrupted promised that to myself i have broken that word she shut david copperhead mechanically and grew white your letter has come to me hyeh he continued gentle again my she had forgotten it the letter you wrote to tell me goodby you wrote it a little while ago not a month yet but its away and away long gone for me i have never let you know began molly the doctor he interrupted once more but very gently now he gave awdehs i must be kept quiet i reckon yu thought tellin me might forgive me cried the girl indeed i ought to have told you sooner indeed i had no excuse why should yu tell me if yu preferred not you had written and you speak he lifted the letter of never being able to repay kindness but you have turned the tables i can never repay you by anything by anything so i had figured i would just jog back to sunk creek and let you get away if you did not want to say that kind of goodby for i saw the boxes mrs taylor is too nice a woman to know the trick of lyin and she could not deceive me i have knowed yu were going away for good ever since i saw those boxes but now hyeh comes your letter and it seems no way but i must speak i have thought a deal lyin in this room and today i can say what i have thought i could not make you happy he stopped but she did not answer his voice had grown softer than whispering but yet was not a whisper from its quiet syllables she turned away blinded with sudden tears once i thought love must surely be enough he continued and i thought if i could make you love me you could learn me to be less lessmore your kind and i think i could give you a pretty good sort of love but that dont help the little mean pesky things of day by day that make roughness or smoothness for folks tied together so awful close mrs taylor hyeh she dont know anything better than taylor does she dont want anything he cant give her her friends will do for him and his for her and when i dreamed of you in my home he closed his eyes and drew a long breath at last he looked at her again this is no country for a lady will yu forget and forgive the bothering i have done oh cried molly oh and she put her hands to her eyes she had risen and stood with her face covered i surely had to tell you this all out didnt i said the cowpuncher faintly in his chair oh said molly again i have put it clear how it is he pursued i ought to have seen from the start i was not the sort to keep you happy but said molly but i you ought please try to keep me happy and sinking by his chair she hid her face on his knees speechless he bent down and folded her round putting his hands on the hair that had been always his delight presently he whisperedyou have beat me how can i fight this she answered nothing the navajos scarlet and black folds fell over both not with words not even with meeting eyes did the two plight their troth in this first new hour so they remained long the fair head nesting in the great arms and the black head laid against it while over the silent room presided the little grandmother stark in her frame rosy blue and flaxen not quite familiar not quite smiling xxviii no dream to wake from for a long while after she had left him he lay still stretched in his chair his eyes were fixed steadily upon the open window and the sunshine outside there he watched the movement of the leaves upon the green cottonwoods what had she said to him when she went she had said now i know how unhappy i have been these sweet words he repeated to himself over and over fearing in some way that he might lose them they almost slipped from him at times but with a jump of his mind he caught them again and held them and thenim not all strong yet he murmured i must have been very sick and weak from his bullet wound and fever he closed his eyes without knowing it there were the cottonwoods again waving waving and he felt the cool pleasant air from the window he saw the light draught stir the ashes in the great stone fireplace i have been asleep he said but she was certnly here herself oh yes surely she always has to go away every day because the doctor says why she was readin he broke off aloud david copperfield there it was on the floor aha nailed you anyway he said but how scared i am of myself youre a fool of course its so no fever business could make yu feel like this his eye dwelt awhile on the fireplace next on the deer horns and next it travelled toward the shelf where her books were but it stopped before reaching them better say off the names before i look said he ive had a heap o misreading visions and and supposin if this was just my sickness fooling me some more id want to die i would die now well see if copperfield is on the floor he looked stealthily to be sure that it was then she was readin to me when everything happened and then there should be a hole in the book row top left top left he repeated and warily brought his glance to the place proved he cried its all so he now noticed the miniature of grandmother stark you are awful like her he whispered youre certnly awful like her may i kiss you too maam then tottering he rose from his sickchair the navajo blanket fell from his shoulders and gradually experimentally he stood upright helping himself with his hand slowly along the wall of the room and round to the opposite wall with many a pause he reached the picture and very gently touched the forehead of the ancestral dame with his lips i promise to make your little girl happy he whispered he almost fell in stooping to the portrait but caught himself and stood carefully quiet trembling and speaking to himself where is your strength he demanded i reckon it is joy that has unsteadied your laigs the door opened it was she come back with his dinner my heavens she said and setting the tray down she rushed to him she helped him back to his chair and covered him again he had suffered no hurt but she clung to him and presently he moved and let himself kiss her with fuller passion i will be good he whispered you must she said you looked so pale you are speakin low like me he answered but we have no dream we can wake from had she surrendered on this day to her cowpuncher her wild man was she forever wholly his had the virginians fire so melted her heart that no rift in it remained so she would have thought if any thought had come to her but in his arms today thought was lost in something more divine xxix word to bennington they kept their secret for a while or at least they had that special joy of believing that no one in all the world but themselves knew this that had happened to them but i think that there was one person who knew how to keep a secret even better than these two lovers mrs taylor made no remarks to any one whatever nobody on bear creek however was so extraordinarily cheerful and serene that peculiar severity which she had manifested in the days when molly was packing her possessions had now altogether changed in these days she was endlessly kind and indulgent to her deary although as a housekeeper mrs taylor believed in punctuality at meals and visited her offspring with discipline when they were late without good and sufficient excuse molly was now exempt from the faintest hint of reprimand and its not because youre not her mother said george taylor bitterly she used to get it too and were the only ones that get it there she comes just as were about ready to quit arent you going to say nothing to her george said his mother when youve saved a mans life itll be time for you to talk so molly would come in to her meals with much irregularity and her remarks about the imperfections of her clock met with no rejoinder and yet one can scarcely be so severe as had been mrs taylor and become wholly as mild as milk there was one recurrent event that could invariably awaken hostile symptoms in the dame whenever she saw a letter arrive with the bennington postmark upon it she shook her fist at that letter whats family pride she would say to herself taylor could be a son of the revolution if hed a mind to i wonder if she has told her folks yet and when letters directed to bennington would go out mrs taylor would inspect every one as if its envelope ought to grow transparent beneath her eyes and yield up to her its great secret if it had one but in truth these letters had no great secret to yield up until one day yes one day mrs taylor would have burst were bursting a thing that people often did three letters were the cause of this emotion on mrs taylors part one addressed to bennington one to dunbarton and the third here was the great excitement to bennington but not in the little schoolmarms delicate writing a mans hand had traced those plain steady vowels and consonants its come exclaimed mrs taylor at this sight he has written to her mother himself that is what the virginian had done and here is how it had come about the sick mans convalescence was achieved the weeks had brought back to him not his whole strength yet that could come only by many miles of open air on the back of monte but he was strong enough now to get strength when a patient reaches this stage he is out of the woods he had gone for a little walk with his nurse they had taken under the doctors recommendation several such little walks beginning with a fiveminute one and at last today accomplishing three miles no it has not been too far said he i am afraid i could walk twice as far afraid yes because it means i can go to work again this thing we have had together is over for reply she leaned against him look at you he said only a little while ago you had to help me stand on my laigs and now for a while there was silence between them i have never had a right down sickness before he presently went on not to remember that is if any person had told me i could enjoy such a thing he said no more for she reached up and no more speech was possible how long has it been he next asked her she told him well if it could be forever no not forever with no more than this i reckon id be sick again but if it could be forever with just you and me and no one else to bother with but any longer would not be doing right by your mother she would have a right to think ill of me oh said the girl let us keep it not after i am gone your mother must be told it seems so cant we oh why need anybody know your mother aint anybody she is your mother i feel mighty responsible to her for what i have done but i did it do you think so your mother will not think so i am going to write to her today you write to my mother oh then everything will be so different they will all molly stopped before the rising visions of bennington upon the fairytale that she had been living with her cowboy lover broke the voices of the world she could hear them from afar she could see the eyes of bennington watching this man at her side she could imagine the ears of bennington listening for slips in his english there loomed upon her the round of visits which they would have to make the ringing of the doorbells the waiting in drawingrooms for the mistress to descend and utter her prepared congratulations while her secret eye devoured the virginians appearance and his manner of standing and sitting he would be wearing gloves instead of fringed gauntlets of buckskin in a smooth black coat and waistcoat how could they perceive the man he was during those short formal interviews what would they ever find out of the things that she knew about him the things for which she was proud of him he would speak shortly and simply they would say oh yes and how different you must find this from wyoming and then after the door was shut behind his departing back they would say he would be totally underrated not in the least understood why should he be subjected to this he should never be now in all these halfformed hurried distressing thoughts which streamed through the girls mind she altogether forgot one truth true it was that the voice of the world would speak as she imagined true it was that in the eyes of her family and acquaintance this lover of her choice would be examined even more like a specimen than are other lovers upon these occasions and all accepted lovers have to face this ordeal of being treated like specimens by the other family but dear me most of us manage to stand it dont we it isnt perhaps the most delicious experience that we can recall in connection with our engagement but it didnt prove fatal we got through it somehow we dined with aunt jane and wined with uncle joseph and perhaps had two fingers given to us by old cousin horatio whose enormous fortune was of the greatest importance to everybody and perhaps fragments of the other familys estimate of us subsequently reached our own ears but if a chosen lover cannot stand being treated as a specimen by the other family hes a very weak vessel and not worth any good girls love thats all i can say for him now the virginian was scarcely what even his enemy would term a weak vessel and mollys jealousy of the impression which he might make upon bennington was vastly superfluous she should have known that he would indeed care to make a good impression but that such anxiety on his part would be wholly for her sake that in the eyes of her friends she might stand justified in taking him for her wedded husband so far as he was concerned apart from her aunt jane and uncle joseph might say anything they pleased or think anything they pleased his character was open for investigation judge henry would vouch for him this is what he would have said to his sweetheart had she but revealed to him her perturbations but she did not reveal them and they were not of the order that he with his nature was likely to divine i do not know what good would have come from her speaking out to him unless that perfect understanding between lovers which indeed is a good thing but i do not believe that he could have reassured her and i am certain that she could not have prevented his writing to her mother well then she sighed at last if you think so i will tell her that sigh of hers be it well understood was not only because of those faroff voices which the world would in consequence of her news be lifting presently it came also from bidding farewell to the fairytale which she must leave now that land in which she and he had been living close together alone unhindered unmindful of all things yes you will tell her said her lover and i must tell her too both of us questioned the girl what would he say to her mother how would her mother like such a letter as he would write to her suppose he should misspell a word would not sentences from him at this time written sentences be a further bar to his welcome acceptance at bennington why dont you send messages by me she asked him he shook his head she is not going to like it anyway he answered i must speak to her direct it would be like shirking molly saw how true his instinct was here and a little flame shot upward from the glow of her love and pride in him oh if they could all only know that he was like this when you understood him she did not dare say out to him what her fear was about this letter of his to her mother she did not dare because well because she lacked a little faith that is it i am afraid and for that sin she was her own punishment for in this day and in many days to come the pure joy of her love was vexed and clouded all through a little lack of faith while for him perfect in his faith his joy was like crystal tell me what youre going to write she said he smiled at her no arent you going to let me see it when its done no then a freakish look came into his eyes ill let yu see anything i write to other women and he gave her one of his long kisses lets get through with it together he suggested when they were once more in his sickroom that room which she had given to him youll sit one side o the table and ill sit the other and well go ahaid and pretty soon it will be done o dear she said yes i suppose that is the best way and so accordingly they took their places the inkstand stood between them beside each of them she distributed paper enough almost for a presidential message and pens and pencils were in plenty was this not the headquarters of the bear creek schoolmarm why arent you going to do it in pencil first she exclaimed looking up from her vacant sheet his pen was moving slowly but steadily no i dont reckon i need to he answered with his nose close to the paper oh damnation theres a blot he tore his spoiled beginning in small bits and threw them into the fireplace youve got it too full he commented and taking the inkstand he tipped a little from it out of the window she sat lost among her false starts had she heard him swear she would not have minded she rather liked it when he swore he possessed that quality in his profanity of not offending by it it is quite wonderful how much worse the same word will sound in one mans lips than in anothers but she did not hear him her mind was among a litter of broken sentences each thought which she began ran out into the empty air or came against some stone wall so there she sat her eyes now upon that inexorable blank sheet that lay before her waiting and now turned with vacant hopelessness upon the sundry objects in the room and while she thus sat accomplishing nothing opposite to her the black head bent down and the steady pen moved from phrase to phrase she became aware of his gazing at her flushed and solemn that strange color of the seawater which she could never name was lustrous in his eyes he was folding his letter you have finished she said yes his voice was very quiet i feel like an honester man perhaps i can do something tonight at mrs taylors she said looking at her paper on it were a few words crossed out this was all she had to show at this set task in letterwriting the cowpuncher had greatly excelled the schoolmarm but that night while he lay quite fast asleep in his bed she was keeping vigil in her room at mrs taylors accordingly the next day those three letters departed for the mail and mrs taylor consequently made her exclamation its come on the day before the virginian returned to take up his work at judge henrys ranch he and molly announced their news what molly said to mrs taylor and what mrs taylor said to her is of no interest to us though it was of much to them but mr mclean happened to make a call quite early in the morning to inquire for his friends health lin began the virginian there is no harm in your knowing an hour or so before the rest i am lord said mr mclean indulgently everybody has knowed that since the day she found yu at the spring it was not so then said the virginian crossly lord everybody has knowed it right along hmp said the virginian i didnt know this country was that rank with gossips mr mclean laughed mirthfully at the lover well he said mrs mclean will be glad she told me to give yu her congratulations quite a while ago i was to have em ready just as soon as ever yu asked for em yourself lin had been made a happy man some twelve months previous to this and now by way of an exchange of news he added were expectin a little mclean down on box elder thats what youll be expectin some of these days i hope yes murmured the virginian i hope so too and i dont guess said lin that you and i will do much shufflin of other folks children any more whereupon he and the virginian shook hands silently and understood each other very well on the day that the virginian parted with molly beside the weight of farewell which lay heavy on his heart his thoughts were also grave with news the cattle thieves had grown more audacious horses and cattle both were being missed and each man began almost to doubt his neighbor steps will have to be taken soon by somebody i reckon said the lover by you she asked quickly most likely ill get mixed up with it what will you have to do cant say ill tell yu when i come back so did he part from her leaving her more kisses than words to remember and what was doing at bennington meanwhile and at dunbarton those three letters which by their mere outside had so moved mrs taylor produced by their contents much painful disturbance it will be remembered that molly wrote to her mother and to her greataunt that announcement to her mother was undertaken first its composition occupied three hours and a half and it filled eleven pages not counting a postscript upon the twelfth the letter to the greataunt took only ten minutes i cannot pretend to explain why this one was so greatly superior to the other but such is the remarkable fact its beginning to be sure did give the old lady a start she had dismissed the cowboy from her probabilities tut tut tut she exclaimed out loud in her bedroom she has thrown herself away on that fellow but some sentences at the end made her pause and sit still for a long while the severity upon her face changed to tenderness gradually ah me she sighed if marriage were as simple as love then she went slowly downstairs and out into her garden where she walked long between the box borders but if she has found a great love said the old lady at length and she returned to her bedroom and opened an old desk and read some old letters there came to her the next morning a communication from bennington this had been penned frantically by poor mrs wood as soon as she had been able to gather her senses after the shock of her daughters eleven pages and the postscript the mother had poured out eight pages herself to the eldest member of the family there had been indeed much excuse for the poor lady to begin with molly had constructed her whole opening page with the express and merciful intention of preparing her mother consequently it made no sense whatever its effect was the usual effect of remarks designed to break a thing gently it merely made mrs woods head swim and filled her with a sickening dread oh mercy sarah she had cried come here what does this mean and then fortified by her elder daughter she had turned over that first page and found what it meant on the top of the second a savage with knives and pistols she wailed well mother i always told you so said her daughter sarah what is a foreman exclaimed the mother and who is judge henry she has taken a sort of upper servant said sarah if it is allowed to go as far as a wedding i doubt if i can bring myself to be present this threat she proceeded to make to molly with results that shall be set forth in their proper place the man appears to have written to me himself said mrs wood he knows no better said sarah bosh said sarahs husband later it was a very manly thing to do thus did consternation rage in the house at bennington molly might have spared herself the many assurances that she gave concerning the universal esteem in which her cowpuncher was held and the fair prospects which were his so in the first throes of her despair mrs wood wrote those eight not maturely considered pages to the greataunt tut tut tut said the greataunt as she read them her face was much more severe today youd suppose she said that the girl had been kidnapped why she has kept him waiting three years and then she read more but soon put the letter down with laughter for mrs wood had repeated in writing that early outburst of hers about a savage with knives and pistols law said the greataunt law what a fool lizzie is so she sat down and wrote to mrs wood a wholesome reply about putting a little more trust in her own flesh and blood and reminding her among other things that general stark had himself been wont to carry knives and pistols owing to the necessities of his career but that he had occasionally taken them off as did probably this young man in wyoming you had better send me the letter he has written you she concluded i shall know much better what to think after i have seen that it is not probable that mrs wood got much comfort from this communication and her daughter sarah was actually enraged by it she grows more perverse as she nears her dotage said sarah but the virginians letter was sent to dunbarton where the old lady sat herself down to read it with much attention here is what the virginian had said to the unknown mother of his sweetheart mrs john stark wood bennington vermont madam if your daughter miss wood has ever told you about her saving a mans life here when some indians had shot him that is the man who writes to you now i dont think she can have told you right about that affair for she is the only one in this country who thinks it was a little thing so i must tell you it the main points such an action would have been thought highly of in a western girl but with miss woods raising nobody had a right to expect it indeed snorted the greataunt well he would be right if i had not had a good deal more to do with her raising than ever lizzie had and she went on with the letter i was starting in to die when she found me i did not know anything then and she pulled me back from where i was half in the next world she did not know but what indians would get her too but i could not make her leave me i am a heavy man one hundred and seventythree stripped when in full health she lifted me herself from the ground me helping scarce any for there was not much help in me that day she washed my wound and brought me to with her own whiskey before she could get me home i was out of my head but she kept me on my horse somehow and talked wisely to me so i minded her and did not go clean crazy till she had got me safe to bed the doctor says i would have died all the same if she had not nursed me the way she did it made me love her more which i did not know i could but there is no end for this writing it down makes me love her more as i write it and now mrs wood i am sorry this will be bad news for you to hear i know you would never choose such a man as i am for her for i have got no education and must write humble against my birth i wish i could make the news easier but truth is the best i am of old stock in virginia english and one scotch irish grandmother my fathers father brought from kentucky we have always stayed at the same place farmers and hunters not bettering our lot and very plain we have fought when we got the chance under old hickory and in mexico and my father and two brothers were killed in the valley sixtyfour always with us one son has been apt to run away and i was the one this time i had too much older brothering to suit me but now i am doing well being in full sight of prosperity and not too old and very strong my health having stood the sundries it has been put through she shall teach school no more when she is mine i wish i could make this news easier for you mrs wood i do not like promises i have heard so many i will tell any man of your family anything he likes to ask one and judge henry would tell you about my reputation i have seen plenty rough things but can say i have never killed for pleasure or profit and am not one of that kind always preferring peace i have had to live in places where they had courts and lawyers so called but an honest man was all the law you could find in five hundred miles i have not told her about those things not because i am ashamed of them but there are so many things too dark for a girl like her to hear about i had better tell you the way i know i love miss wood i am not a boy now and women are no new thing to me a man like me who has travelled meets many of them as he goes and passes on but i stopped when i came to miss wood that is three years but i have not gone on what right has such as he you will say so did i say it after she had saved my life it was hard to get to that point and keep there with her around me all day but i said to myself you have bothered her for three years with your love and if you let your love bother her you dont love her like you should and you must quit for her sake who has saved your life i did not know what i was going to do with my life after that but i supposed i could go somewhere and work hard and so mrs wood i told her i would give her up but she said no it is going to be hard for her to get used to a man like me but at this point in the virginians letter the old greataunt could read no more she rose and went over to that desk where lay those faded letters of her own she laid her head down upon the package and as her tears flowed quietly upon it o dear she whispered o dear and this is what i lost to her girl upon bear creek she wrote the next day and this word from dunbarton was like balm among the harsh stings molly was receiving the voices of the world reached her in gathering numbers and not one of them save that greataunts was sweet her days were full of hurts and there was no one by to kiss the hurts away nor did she even hear from her lover any more now she only knew he had gone into lonely regions upon his errand that errand took him faracross the basin among the secret places of owl creek past the washakie needles over the divide to gros ventre and so through a final barrier of peaks into the borders of east idaho there by reason of his bidding me i met him and came to share in a part of his errand it was with no guide that i travelled to him he had named a little station on the railroad and from thence he had charted my route by means of landmarks did i believe in omens the black storm that i set out in upon my horse would seem like one today but i had been living in cities and smoke and idaho even with rain was delightful to me xxx a stable on the flat when the first landmark the lone clump of cottonwoods came at length in sight dark and blurred in the gentle rain standing out perhaps a mile beyond the distant buildings my whole weary body hailed the approach of repose saving the noon hour i had been in the saddle since six and now six was come round again the ranch my restingplace for this night was a ruin cabin stable and corral yet after the twelve hours of pushing on and on through silence still to have silence still to eat and go to sleep in it perfectly fitted the mood of both my flesh and spirit at noon when for a while i had thrown off my long oilskin coat merely the sight of the newspaper half crowded into my pocket had been a displeasing reminder of the railway and cities and affairs but for its possible help to build fires it would have come no farther with me the great levels around me lay cooled and freed of dust by the wet weather and full of sweet airs far in front the foothills rose through the rain indefinite and mystic i wanted no speech with any one nor to be near human beings at all i was steeped in a revery as of the primal earth even thoughts themselves had almost ceased motion to lie down with wild animals with elk and deer would have made my waking dream complete and since such dream could not be the cattle around the deserted buildings mere dots as yet across separating space were my proper companions for this evening tomorrow night i should probably be camping with the virginian in the foothills at his letters bidding i had come eastward across idaho abandoning my hunting in the saw tooth range to make this journey with him back through the tetons it was a trail known to him and not to many other honest men horse thief pass was the name his letter gave it business he was always brief would call him over there at this time returning he must attend to certain matters in the wind river country there i could leave by stage for the railroad or go on with him the whole way back to sunk creek he designated for our meeting the forks of a certain little stream in the foothills which todays ride had brought in sight there would be no chance for him to receive an answer from me in the intervening time if by a certain day which was four days off still i had not reached the forks he would understand i had other plans to me it was like living back in ages gone this way of meeting my friend this choice of a stream so far and lonely that its very course upon the maps was wrongly traced and to leave behind all noise and mechanisms and set out at ease slowly with one packhorse into the wilderness made me feel that the ancient earth was indeed my mother and that i had found her again after being lost among houses customs and restraints i should arrive three days early at the forks three days of margin seeming to me a wise precaution against delays unforeseen if the virginian were not there good i could fish and be happy if he were there but not ready to start good i could still fish and be happy and remembering my eastern helplessness in the year when we had met first i enjoyed thinking how i had come to be trusted in those days i had not been allowed to go from the ranch for so much as an afternoons ride unless tied to him by a string so to speak now i was crossing unmapped spaces with no guidance the man who could do this was scarce any longer a tenderfoot my vision as i rode took in serenely the dim foothills tomorrows goal and nearer in the vast wet plain the clump of cottonwoods and still nearer my lodging for tonight with the dotted cattle round it and now my horse neighed i felt his gait freshen for the journeys end and leaning to pat his neck i noticed his ears no longer slack and inattentive but pointing forward to where food and rest awaited both of us twice he neighed impatiently and long and as he quickened his gait still more the packhorse did the same and i realized that there was about me still a spice of the tenderfoot those dots were not cattle they were horses my horse had put me in the wrong he had known his kind from afar and was hastening to them the plainsmans eye was not yet mine and i smiled a little as i rode when was i going to know as by instinct the different look of horses and cattle across some two or three miles of plain these miles we finished soon the buildings changed in their aspect as they grew to my approach showing their desolation more clearly and in some way bringing apprehension into my mood and around them the horses too all standing with ears erect watching me as i came there was something about them or was it the silence for the silence which i had liked until now seemed suddenly to be made too great by the presence of the deserted buildings and then the door of the stable opened and men came out and stood also watching me arrive by the time i was dismounting more were there it was senseless to feel as unpleasant as i did and i strove to give to them a greeting that should sound easy i told them that i hoped there was room for one more here tonight some of them had answered my greeting but none of them answered this and as i began to be sure that i recognized several of their strangely imperturbable faces the virginian came from the stable and at that welcome sight my relief spoke out instantly i am here you see yes i do see i looked hard at him for in his voice was the same strangeness that i felt in everything around me but he was looking at his companions this gentleman is all right he told them that may be said one whom i now knew that i had seen before at sunk creek but he was not due tonight nor tomorrow said another nor yet the day after a third added the virginian fell into his drawl none of you was ever early for anything i presume one retorted laughing oh were not suspicioning you of complicity and another not even when we remember how thick you and steve used to be whatever jokes they meant by this he did not receive as jokes i saw something like a wince pass over his face and a flush follow it but he now spoke to me we expected to be through before this he began im right sorry you have come tonight i know youd have preferred to keep away we want him to explain himself put in one of the others if he satisfies us hes free to go away free to go away i now exclaimed but at the indulgence in their frontier smile i cooled down gentlemen i said i dont know why my movements interest you so much its quite a compliment may i get under shelter while i explain no request could have been more natural for the rain had now begun to fall in straight floods yet there was a pause before one of them said he might as well the virginian chose to say nothing more but he walked beside me into the stable two men sat there together and a third guarded them at that sight i knew suddenly what i had stumbled upon and on the impulse i murmured to the virginian youre hanging them tomorrow he kept his silence you may have three guesses said a man behind me but i did not need them and in the recoil of my insight the clump of cottonwoods came into my mind black and grim no other trees high enough grew within ten miles this then was the business that the virginians letter had so curtly mentioned my eyes went into all corners of the stable but no other prisoners were here i half expected to see trampas and i half feared to see shorty for poor stupid shortys honesty had not been proof against frontier temptations and he had fallen away from the company of his old friends often of late i had heard talk at sunk creek of breaking up a certain gang of horse and cattle thieves that stole in one territory and sold in the next and knew where to hide in the mountains between and now it had come to the point forces had been gathered a long expedition made and here they were successful under the virginians lead but a little later than their calculations and here was i a little too early and a witness in consequence my presence seemed a simple thing to account for but when i had thus accounted for it one of them said with good natureso you find us here and we find you here which is the most surprised i wonder theres no telling said i keeping as amiable as i could nor any telling which objects the most oh theres no objection here youre welcome to stay but not welcome to go i expect he aint welcome to go is he by the answers that their faces gave him it was plain that i was not not till we are through said one he neednt to see anything another added better sleep late tomorrow morning a third suggested to me i did not wish to stay here i could have made some sort of camp apart from them before dark but in the face of their needless caution i was helpless i made no attempt to inquire what kind of spy they imagined i could be what sort of rescue i could bring in this lonely country my too early appearance seemed to be all that they looked at and again my eyes sought the prisoners certainly there were only two one was chewing tobacco and talking now and then to his guard as if nothing were the matter the other sat dull in silence not moving his eyes but his face worked and i noticed how he continually moistened his dry lips as i looked at these doomed prisoners whose fate i was invited to sleep through tomorrow morning the one who was chewing quietly nodded to me you dont remember me he said it was steve steve of medicine bow the pleasant steve of my first evening in the west some change of beard had delayed my instant recognition of his face here he sat sentenced to die a shock chill and painful deprived me of speech he had no such weak feelings have yu been to medicine bow lately he inquired thats getting to be quite a while ago i assented i should have liked to say something natural and kind but words stuck against my will and i stood awkward and ill at ease noticing idly that the silent one wore a gray flannel shirt like mine steve looked me over and saw in my pocket the newspaper which i had brought from the railroad and on which i had pencilled a few expenses he asked me would i mind letting him have it for a while and i gave it to him eagerly begging him to keep it as long as he wanted i was overeager in my embarrassment you need not return it at all i said those notes are nothing do keep it he gave me a short glance and a smile thank you he said ill not need it beyond tomorrow morning and he began to search through it jakes election is considered sure he said to his companion who made no response well fremont county owes it to jake and i left him interested in the local news dead men i have seen not a few times even some lying pale and terrible after violent ends and the edge of this wears off but i hope i shall never again have to be in the company with men waiting to be killed by this time tomorrow the gray flannel shirt would be buttoned round a corpse until what moment would steve chew against such fancies as these i managed presently to barricade my mind but i made a plea to be allowed to pass the night elsewhere and i suggested the adjacent cabin by their faces i saw that my words merely helped their distrust of me the cabin leaked too much they said i would sleep drier here one man gave it to me more directly if you figured on camping in this stable what has changed your mind how could i tell them that i shrunk from any contact with what they were doing although i knew that only so could justice be dealt in this country their wholesome frontier nerves knew nothing of such refinements but the virginian understood part of it i am right sorry for your annoyance he said and now i noticed he was under a constraint very different from the ease of the others after the twelve hours ride my bones were hungry for rest i spread my blankets on some straw in a stall by myself and rolled up in them yet i lay growing broader awake every inch of weariness stricken from my excited senses for a while they sat over their councils whispering cautiously so that i was made curious to hear them by not being able was it the names of trampas and shorty that were once or twice spokeni could not be sure i heard the whisperers cease and separate i heard their boots as they cast them off upon the ground and i heard the breathing of slumber begin and grow in the interior silence to one after one sleep came but not to me outside the dull fall of the rain beat evenly and in some angle dripped the spouting pulses of a leak sometimes a cold air blew in bearing with it the keen wet odor of the sagebrush on hundreds of other nights this perfume had been my last waking remembrance it had seemed to help drowsiness and now i lay staring thinking of this twice through the hours the thieves shifted their positions with clumsy sounds exchanging muted words with their guard so often had i heard other companions move and mutter in the darkness and lie down again it was the very naturalness and usualness of every fact of the night the stable straw the rain outside my familiar blankets the cool visits of the wind and with all this the thought of steve chewing and the man in the gray flannel shirt that made the hours unearthly and strung me tight with suspense and at last i heard some one get up and begin to dress in a little while i saw light suddenly through my closed eyelids and then darkness shut again abruptly upon them they had swung in a lantern and found me by mistake i was the only one they did not wish to rouse moving and quiet talking set up around me and they began to go out of the stable at the gleams of new daylight which they let in my thoughts went to the clump of cottonwoods and i lay still with hands and feet growing steadily cold now it was going to happen i wondered how they would do it one instance had been described to me by a witness but that was done from a bridge and there had been but a single victim this morning would one have to wait and see the other go through with it first the smell of smoke reached me and next the rattle of tin dishes breakfast was something i had forgotten and one of them was cooking it now in the dry shelter of the stable he was alone because the talking and the steps were outside the stable and i could hear the sounds of horses being driven into the corral and saddled then i perceived that the coffee was ready and almost immediately the cook called them one came in shutting the door behind him as he reentered which the rest as they followed imitated for at each opening of the door i saw the light of day leap into the stable and heard the louder sounds of the rain then the sound and the light would again be shut out until some one at length spoke out bluntly bidding the door be left open on account of the smoke what were they hiding from he asked the runaways that had escaped a laugh followed this sally and the door was left open thus i learned that there had been more thieves than the two that were captured it gave a little more ground for their suspicion about me and my anxiety to pass the night elsewhere it cost nothing to detain me and they were taking no chances however remote the fresh air and the light now filled the stable and i lay listening while their breakfast brought more talk from them they were more at ease now than was i who had nothing to do but carry out my role of slumber in the stall they spoke in a friendly ordinary way as if this were like every other morning of the week to them they addressed the prisoners with a sort of fraternal kindness not bringing them pointedly into the conversation nor yet pointedly leaving them out i made out that they must all be sitting round the breakfast together those who had to die and those who had to kill them the virginian i never heard speak but i heard the voice of steve he discussed with his captors the sundry points of his capture do you remember a haystack he asked away up the south fork of gros ventre that was thursday afternoon said one of the captors there was a shower yes it rained we had you fooled that time i was laying on the ledge above to report your movements several of them laughed we thought you were over on spread creek then i figured you thought so by the trail you left after the stack saturday we watched you turn your back on us up spread creek we were snug among the trees the other side of snake river that was another time we had you fooled they laughed again at their own expense i have heard men pick to pieces a hand of whist with more antagonism steve continued would we head for idaho would we swing back over the divide you didnt know which and when we generalled you on to that band of horses you thought was the band you were hunting ah we were a strong combination he broke off with the first touch of bitterness i had felt in his words nothing is any stronger than its weakest point it was the virginian who said this and it was the first word he had spoken naturally said steve his tone in addressing the virginian was so different so curt that i supposed he took the weakest point to mean himself but the others now showed me that i was wrong in this explanation thats so one said its weakest point is where a rope or a gang of men is going to break when the strain comes and you was linked with a poor partner steve youre right i was said the prisoner back in his easy casual voice you ought to have got yourself separated from him steve there was a pause yes said the prisoner moodily im sitting here because one of us blundered he cursed the blunderer lighting his fool fire queered the whole deal he added as he again heavily cursed the blunderer the others murmured to each other various i told you sos youd never have built that fire steve said one i said that when we spied the smoke said another i said thats none of steves work lighting fires and revealing to us their whereabouts it struck me that they were plying steve with compliments pretty hard to have the fool get away and you get caught a third suggested at this they seemed to wait i felt something curious in all this last talk oh did he get away said the prisoner then again they waited and a new voice spoke huskilyi built that fire boys it was the prisoner in the gray flannel shirt too late ed they told him kindly you aint a good liar what makes you laugh steve said some one oh the things i notice meaning ed was pretty slow in backing up your play the joke is really on you steve youd ought never to have cursed the firebuilder if you wanted us to believe he was present but wed not have done much to shorty even if we had caught him all he wants is to be scared good and hard and hell go back into virtuousness which is his nature when not travelling with trampas steves voice sounded hard now you have caught ed and me that should satisfy you for one gather well we think different steve trampas escaping leaves this thing unfinished so trampas escaped too did he said the prisoner yes steve trampas escaped this time and shorty with him this time we know it most as well as if wed seen them go and were glad shorty is loose for hell build another fire or do some other foolishness next time and thats the time well get trampas their talk drifted to other points and i lay thinking of the skirmish that had played beneath the surface of their banter yes the joke as they put it was on steve he had lost one point in the game to them they were playing for names he being a chivalrous thief was playing to hide names they could only among several likely confederates guess trampas and shorty so it had been a slip for him to curse the man who built the fire at least they so held it for they with subtlety reasoned one curses the absent and i agreed with them that ed did not know how to lie well he should have at once claimed the disgrace of having spoiled the expedition if shorty was the blunderer then certainly trampas was the other man for the two were as inseparable as don and master trampas had enticed shorty away from good and trained him in evil it now struck me that after his single remark the virginian had been silent throughout their shrewd discussion it was the other prisoner that i heard them next address you dont eat any breakfast ed brace up ed look at steve how hardy he eats but ed it seemed wanted no breakfast and the tin dishes rattled as they were gathered and taken to be packed drink this coffee anyway another urged youll feel warmer these words almost made it seem like my own execution my whole body turned cold in company with the prisoners and as if with a clank the situation tightened throughout my senses i reckon if every ones ready well start it was the virginians voice once more and different from the rest i heard them rise at his bidding and i put the blanket over my head i felt their tread as they walked out passing my stall the straw that was half under me and half out in the stable was stirred as by something heavy dragged or half lifted along over it look out youre hurting eds arm one said to another as the steps with tangled sounds passed slowly out i heard another among those who followed say poor ed couldnt swallow his coffee outside they began getting on their horses and next their hoofs grew distant until all was silence round the stable except the dull even falling of the rain xxxi the cottonwoods i do not know how long i stayed there alone it was the virginian who came back and as he stood at the foot of my blankets his eye after meeting mine full for a moment turned aside i had never seen him look as he did now not even in pitchstone canyon when we came upon the bodies of hank and his wife until this moment we had found no chance of speaking together except in the presence of others seems to be raining still i began after a little yes its a wet spell he stared out of the door smoothing his mustache it was again i that spoke what time is it he brooded over his watch twelve minutes to seven i rose and stood drawing on my clothes the fires out said he and he assembled some new sticks over the ashes presently he looked round with a cup never mind that for me i said weve a long ride he suggested i know ive crackers in my pocket my boots being pulled on i walked to the door and watched the clouds they seem as if they might lift i said and i took out my watch what time is it he asked a quarter of its run down while i wound it he seemed to be consulting his own well i inquired ten minutes past seven as i was setting my watch he slowly said steve wound his all regular i had to nightguard him till two his speech was like that of one in a trance so at least it sounds in my memory today again i looked at the weather and the rainy immensity of the plain the foothills eastward where we were going were a soft yellow over the graygreen sagebrush moved shapeless places of light not yet the uncovered sunlight but spots where the storm was wearing thin and wandering streams of warmth passed by slowly in the surrounding air as i watched the clouds and the earth my eyes chanced to fall on the distant clump of cottonwoods vapors from the enfeebled storm floated round them and they were indeed far away but i came inside and began rolling up my blankets you will not change your mind said the virginian by the fire it is thirtyfive miles i shook my head feeling a certain shame that he should see how unnerved i was he swallowed a hot cupful and after it sat thinking and presently he passed his hand across his brow shutting his eyes again he poured out a cup and emptying this rose abruptly to his feet as if shaking himself free from something lets pack and quit here he said our horses were in the corral and our belongings in the shelter of what had been once the cabin at this forlorn place he collected them in silence while i saddled my own animal and in silence we packed the two packhorses and threw the diamond hitch and hauled tight the slack damp ropes soon we had mounted and as we turned into the trail i gave a look back at my last nights lodging the virginian noticed me goodby forever he interpreted by god i hope so same here he confessed and these were our first natural words this morning this will go well said i holding my flask out to him and both of us took some and felt easier for it and the natural words for an hour we had been shirking real talk holding fast to the weather or anything and all the while that silent thing we were keeping off spoke plainly in the air around us and in every syllable that we uttered but now we were going to get away from it leave it behind in the stable and set ourselves free from it by talking it out already relief had begun to stir in my spirits you never did this before i said no i never had it to do he was riding beside me looking down at his saddlehorn i do not think i should ever be able i pursued defiance sounded in his answer i would do it again this morning oh i dont mean that its all right here theres no other way i would do it all over again the same this morning just the same why so should i if i could do it at all i still thought he was justifying their justice to me he made no answer as he rode along looking all the while at his saddle but again he passed his hand over his forehead with that frown and shutting of the eyes i should like to be sure i should behave myself if i were condemned i said next for it now came to me which should i resemble could i read the newspaper and be interested in county elections and discuss coming death as if i had lost a game of cards or would they have to drag me out that poor wretch in the gray flannel shirt it was bad in the stable i said aloud for an aftershiver of it went through me a third time his hand brushed his forehead and i ventured some sympathy im afraid your head aches i dont want to keep seeing steve he muttered steve i was astounded why he why all i saw of him was splendid since it had to be it was oh yes ed youre thinking about him id forgot him so you didnt enjoy ed at this i looked at him blankly it isnt possible that again he cut me short with a laugh almost savage you neednt to worry about steve he stayed game what then had been the matter that he should keep seeing steve that his vision should so obliterate from him what i still shivered at and so shake him now for he seemed to be growing more stirred as i grew less i asked him no further questions however and we went on for several minutes he brooding always in the same fashion until he resumed with the hard indifference that had before surprised meso ed gave you feelings dumb ague and so forth no doubt were not made the same way i retorted he took no notice of this and youd have been more comfortable if hed acted same as steve did it certnly was bad seeing ed take it that way i reckon and you didnt see him when the time came for business well heres what it is a man maybe such a confirrned miscreant that killings the only cure for him but still hes your own species and you dont want to have him fall around and grab your laigs and show you his fear naked it makes you feel ashamed so ed gave you feelings and steve made everything right easy for you there was irony in his voice as he surveyed me but it fell away at once into sadness both was miscreants but if steve had played the coward too it would have been a whole heap easier for me he paused before adding and steve was not a miscreant once his voice had trembled and i felt the deep emotion that seemed to gain upon him now that action was over and he had nothing to do but think and his view was simple enough you must die brave failure is a sort of treason to the brotherhood and forfeits pity it was steves perfect bearing that had caught his heart so that he forgot even his scorn of the other man but this was by no means all that was to come he harked back to that notion of a prisoner helping to make it easy for his executioner easy plumb to the end he pursued his mind reviewing the acts of the morning why he tried to give me your newspaper i didnt oh no i said hastily i had finished with it well he took dying as naturally as he took living like a man should like i hope to again he looked at the pictures in his mind no playacting nor last words he just told goodby to the boys as we led his horse under the limb you neednt to look so dainty he broke off you aint going to get any more shocking particulars i know im whitelivered i said with a species of laugh i never crowd and stare when somebody is hurt in the street i get away he thought this over you dont mean all of that youd not have spoke just that way about crowding and staring if you thought well of them that stare staring aint courage its trashy curiosity now you did not have this thing he had stretched out his hand to point but it fell and his utterance stopped and he jerked his horse to a stand my nerves sprang like a wire at his suddenness and i looked where he was looking there were the cottonwoods close in front of us as we had travelled and talked we had forgotten them now they were looming within a hundred yards and our trail lay straight through them lets go around them said the virginian when we had come back from our circuit into the trail he continued you did not have that thing to do but a man goes through with his responsibilities and i reckon you could i hope so i answered how about ed he was not a man though we thought he was till this steve and i started punching cattle together at the bordeaux outfit north of cheyenne we did everything together in those days work and play six years ago steve had many good points onced we must have gone two miles before he spoke again you probly didnt notice steve i mean the way he acted to me it was a question but he did not wait for my answer steve never said a word to me all through he shunned it and you saw how neighborly he talked to the other boys where have they all gone i asked he smiled at me it certnly is lonesome now for a fact i didnt know you felt it said i feel it theyve went to the railroad three of them are witnesses in a case at evanston and the judge wants our outfit at medicine bow steve shunned me did he think i was going back on him what if he did you were not and so nobodys going to wind river but you no did you notice steve would not give us any information about shorty that was right i would have acted that way too thus each time he brought me back to the subject the sun was now shining warm during two or three minutes together and gulfs of blue opened in the great white clouds these moved and met among each other and parted like hands spread out slowly weaving a spell of sleep over the day after the wakeful night storm the huge contours of the earth lay basking and drying and not one living creature bird or beast was in sight quiet was returning to my revived spirits but there was none for the virginian and as he reasoned matters out aloud his mood grew more overcast you have a friend and his ways are your ways you travel together you spree together confidentially and you suit each other down to the ground then one day you find him putting his iron on another mans calf you tell him fair and square those ways have never been your ways and aint going to be your ways well that does not change him any for it seems hes disturbed over getting rich quick and being a big man in the territory and the years go on until you are foreman of judge henrys ranch and he is dangling back in the cottonwoods what can he claim who made the choice he cannot say here is my old friend that i would have stood by can he say that but he didnt say it i protested no he shunned me listen i said suppose while you were on guard he had whispered get me off would you have done it no sir said the virginian hotly then what do you want i asked what did you want he could not answer me but i had not answered him i saw so i pushed it farther did you want indorsement from the man you were hanging thats asking a little too much but he had now another confusion steve stood by shorty he said musingly it was shortys mistake cost him his life but all the same he didnt want us to catch you are mixing things i interrupted i never heard you mix things before and it was not shortys mistake he showed momentary interest whose then the mistake of whoever took a fool into their enterprise thats correct well trampas took shorty in and steve would not tell on him either i still tried it saying they were all in the same boat but logic was useless he had lost his bearings in a fog of sentiment he knew knew passionately that he had done right but the silence of his old friend to him through those last hours left a sting that no reasoning could assuage he told goodby to the rest of the boys but not to me and nothing that i could point out in common sense turned him from the thread of his own argument he worked round the circle again to selfjustification was it him i was deserting was not the deserting done by him the day i spoke my mind about stealing calves i have kept my ways the same he is the one that took to new ones the man i used to travel with is not the man back there same name to be sure and same body but different in and yet he had the memory you cant never change your memory he gave a sob it was the first i had ever heard from him and before i knew what i was doing i had reined my horse up to his and put my arm around his shoulders i had no sooner touched him than he was utterly overcome i knew steve awful well he said thus we had actually come to change places for early in the morning he had been firm while i was unnerved while now it was i who attempted to steady and comfort him i had the sense to keep silent and presently he shook my hand not looking at me as he did so he was always very shy of demonstration and he took to patting the neck of his pony you monte hawss said he you think you are wise but theres a lot of things you dont savvy then he made a new beginning of talk between us it is kind of pitiful about shorty very pitiful i said do you know about him the virginian asked i know theres no real harm in him and some real good and that he has not got the brains necessary to be a horse thief thats so thats very true trampas has led him in deeper than his stature can stand now back east you can be middling and get along but if you go to try a thing on in this western country youve got to do it well youve got to deal cyards well youve got to steal well and if you claim to be quick with your gun you must be quick for youre a public temptation and some man will not resist trying to prove he is the quicker you must break all the commandments well in this western country and shorty should have stayed in brooklyn for he will be a novice his livelong days you dont know about him he has told me his circumstances he dont remember his father and it was like he could have claimed three or four and i expect his mother was not much interested in him before or after he was born he ran around and when he was eighteen he got to be help to a grocery man but a girl he ran with kept taking all his pay and teasing him for more and so one day the grocery man caught shorty robbing his till and fired him there wasnt no one to tell goodby to for the girl had to go to the country to see her aunt she said so shorty hung around the store and kissed the grocery cat goodby hed been used to feeding the cat and shed sit in his lap and purr he told me he sends money back to that girl now this hyeh country is no country for shorty for he will be a conspicuous novice all his days perhaps hell prefer honesty after his narrow shave i said but the virginian shook his head trampas has got hold of him the day was now all blue above and all warm and dry beneath we had begun to wind in and rise among the first slopes of the foothills and we had talked ourselves into silence at the first running water we made a long nooning and i slept on the bare ground my body was lodged so fast and deep in slumber that when the virginian shook me awake i could not come back to life at once it was the clump of cottonwoods small and far out in the plain below us that recalled me itll not be watching us much longer said the virginian he made it a sort of joke but i knew that both of us were glad when presently we rode into a steeper country and among its folds and carvings lost all sight of the plain he had not slept i found his explanation was that the packs needed better balancing and after that he had gone up and down the stream on the chance of trout but his haunted eyes gave me the real reason they spoke of steve no matter what he spoke of it was to be no short thing with him xxxii superstition trail we did not make thirtyfive miles that day nor yet twentyfive for he had let me sleep we made an early camp and tried some unsuccessful fishing over which he was cheerful promising trout tomorrow when we should be higher among the mountains he never again touched or came near the subject that was on his mind but while i sat writing my diary he went off to his horse monte and i could hear that he occasionally talked to that friend next day we swung southward from what is known to many as the conant trail and headed for that short cut through the tetons which is known to but a few bitch creek was the name of the stream we now followed and here there was such good fishing that we idled and the horses and i at least enjoyed ourselves for they found fresh pastures and shade in the now plentiful woods and the mountain odors and the mountain heights were enough for me when the fish refused to rise this road of ours now became the road which the pursuit had taken before the capture going along i noticed the footprints of many hoofs rainblurred but recent and these were the tracks of the people i had met in the stable you can notice montes said the virginian he is the only one that has his hind feet shod theres several trails from this point down to where we have come from we mounted now over a long slant of rock smooth and of wide extent above us it went up easily into a little side canyon but ahead where our way was it grew so steep that we got off and led our horses this brought us to the next higher level of the mountain a space of sagebrush more open where the rainwashed tracks appeared again in the softer ground some one has been here since the rain i called to the virginian who was still on the rock walking up behind the packhorses since the rain he exclaimed thats not two days yet he came and examined the footprints a man and a hawss he said frowning going the same way we are how did he come to pass us and us not see him one of the other trails i reminded him yes but theres not many that knows them they are pretty rough trails worse than this one were taking not much only how does he come to know any of them and why dont he take the conant trail thats open and easy and not much longer one man and a hawss i dont see who he is or what he wants here probably a prospector i suggested only one outfit of prospectors has ever been here and they claimed there was no mineralbearing rock in these parts we got back into our saddles with the mystery unsolved to the virginian it was a greater one apparently than to me why should one have to account for every stray traveller in the mountains thats queer too said the virginian he was now riding in front of me and he stopped looking down at the trail dont you notice it did not strike me why he keeps walking beside his hawss he dont get on him now we of course had mounted at the beginning of the better trail after the steep rock and that was quite half a mile back still i had a natural explanation hes leading a packhorse hes a poor trapper and walks packhorses aint usually shod before and behind said the virginian and sliding to the ground he touched the footprints they are not four hours old said he this banks in shadow by one oclock and the sun has not cooked them dusty we continued on our way and although it seemed no very particular thing to me that a man should choose to walk and lead his horse for a while i often did so to limber my muscles nevertheless i began to catch the virginians uncertain feeling about this traveller whose steps had appeared on our path in midjourney as if he had alighted from the midair and to remind myself that he had come over the great face of rock from another trail and thus joined us and that indigent trappers are to be found owning but a single horse and leading him with their belongings through the deepest solitudes of the mountains none of this quite brought back to me the comfort which had been mine since we left the cottonwoods out of sight down in the plain hence i called out sharply whats the matter now when the virginian suddenly stopped his horse again he looked down at the trail and then he very slowly turned round in his saddle and stared back steadily at me theres two of them he said two what i dont know you must know whether its two horses or two men i said almost angrily but to this he made no answer sitting quite still on his horse and contemplating the ground the silence was fastening on me like a spell and i spurred my horse impatiently forward to see for myself the footprints of two men were there in the trail what do you say to that said the virginian kind of ridiculous aint it very quaint i answered groping for the explanation there was no rock here to walk over and step from into the softer trail these second steps came more out of the air than the first and my brain played me the evil trick of showing me a dead man in a gray flannel shirt its two you see travelling with one hawss and they take turns riding him why of course i exclaimed and we went along for a few paces there you are said the virginian as the trail proved him right number one has got on my god whats that at a crashing in the woods very close to us we both flung round and caught sight of a vanishing elk it left us confronted smiling a little and sounding each other with our eyes well we didnt need him for meat said the virginian a spikehorn wasnt it said i yes just a spikehorn for a while now as we rode we kept up a cheerful conversation about elk we wondered if we should meet many more close to the trail like this but it was not long before our words died away we had come into a veritable gulf of mountain peaks sharp at their bare summits like teeth holding fields of snow lower down and glittering still in full day up there while down among our pines and parks the afternoon was growing sombre all the while the fresh hoofprints of the horse and the fresh footprints of the man preceded us in the trees and in the opens across the levels and up the steeps they were there and so they were not four hours old were they so much might we not round some turn come upon the makers of them i began to watch for this and again my brain played me an evil trick against which i found myself actually reasoning thus if they took turns riding then walking must tire them as it did me or any man and besides there was a horse with such thoughts i combated the fancy that those footprints were being made immediately in front of us all the while and that they were the only sign of any presence which our eyes could see but my fancy overcame my thoughts it was shame only which held me from asking this question of the virginian had one horse served in both cases of justice down at the cottonwoods i wondered about this one horse or had the strangling nooses dragged two saddles empty at the same signal most likely and therefore these people up here was i going back to the nursery i brought myself up short and i told myself to be steady there lurked in this brainprocess which was going on beneath my reason a threat worse than the childish apprehensions it created i reminded myself that i was a man grown twentyfive years old and that i must not merely seem like one but feel like one youre not afraid of the dark i suppose this i uttered aloud unwittingly whats that i started but it was only the virginian behind me oh nothing the air is getting colder up here i had presently a great relief we came to a place where again this trail mounted so abruptly that we once more got off to lead our horses so likewise had our predecessors done and as i watched the two different sets of footprints i observed something and hastened to speak of it one man is much heavier than the other i was hoping id not have to tell you that said the virginian youre always ahead of me well still my education is progressing why yes youll equal an injun if you keep on it was good to be facetious and i smiled to myself as i trudged upward we came off the steep place leaving the canyon beneath us and took to horseback and as we proceeded over the final gentle slant up to the rim of the great basin that was set among the peaks the virginian was jocular once more pounds has got on said he and ounces is walking i glanced over my shoulder at him and he nodded as he fixed the weatherbeaten crimson handkerchief round his neck then he threw a stone at a pack animal that was delaying on the trail damn your buckskin hide he drawled you can view the scenery from the top he was so natural sitting loose in the saddle and cursing in his gentle voice that i laughed to think what visions i had been harboring the two dead men riding one horse through the mountains vanished and i came back to every day do you think well catch up with those people i asked not likely theyre travelling about the same gait we are ounces ought to be the best walker up hill yes but pounds will go down afoggin we gained the rim of the basin it lay below us a great cup of country rocks woods opens and streams the tall peaks rose like spires around it magnificent and bare in the last of the sun and we surveyed this upper world letting our animals get breath our bleak crumbled rim ran like a rampart between the towering tops a half circle of five miles or six very wide in some parts and in some shrinking to a scanty foothold as here here our trail crossed over it between two eroded and fantastic shapes of stone like mushrooms or misshapen heads on pikes banks of snow spread up here against the black rocks but half an hour would see us descended to the green and the woods i looked down both of us looked down but our forerunners were not there theyll be camping somewhere in this basin though said the virginian staring at the dark pines they have not come this trail by accident a cold little wind blew down between our stone shapes and upward again eddying and round a corner upward with it came fluttering a leaf of newspaper and caught against an edge close to me whats the latest inquired the virginian from his horse for i had dismounted and had picked up the leaf seems to be interesting i next heard him say cant you tell a man whats making your eyes bug out so yes my voice replied to him and it sounded like some stranger speaking lightly near by oh yes decidedly interesting my voice mimicked his pronunciation its quite the latest i imagine you had better read it yourself and i handed it to him with a smile watching his countenance while my brain felt as if clouds were rushing through it i saw his eyes quietly run the headings over well he inquired after scanning it on both sides i dont seem to catch the excitement fremont county is going to hold elections i see they claim jake its mine i cut him off my own paper those are my pencil marks i do not think that a microscope could have discerned a change in his face oh he commented holding the paper and fixing it with a critical eye you mean this is the one you lent steve and he wanted to give me to give back to you and so them are your own marks for a moment more he held it judicially as i have seen men hold a contract upon whose terms they were finally passing well you have got it back now anyway and he handed it to me only a piece of it i exclaimed always lightly and as i took it from him his hand chanced to touch mine it was cold as ice they aint through readin the rest he explained easily dont you throw it away after theyve taken such trouble thats true i answered i wonder if its pounds or ounces im indebted to thus we made further merriment as we rode down into the great basin before us the horse and boot tracks showed plain in the soft slough where melted snow ran half the day if its a paper chase said the virginian theyll drop no more along here unless it gets dark said i well camp before that maybe well see their fire we did not see their fire we descended in the chill silence while the mushroom rocks grew far and the sombre woods approached by a stream we got off where two banks sheltered us for a bleak wind cut down over the crags now and then making the pines send out a great note through the basin like breakers in a heavy sea but we made cosey in the tent we pitched the tent this night and i was glad to have it shut out the mountain peaks they showed above the banks where we camped and in the starlight their black shapes rose stark against the sky they with the pines and the wind were a bedroom too unearthly this night and as soon as our supper dishes were washed we went inside to our lantern and our game of cribbage this is snug said the virginian as we played that wind dont get down here smoking is snug too said i and we marked our points for an hour with no words save about the cards ill be pretty near glad when we get out of these mountains said the virginian theyre most too big the pines had altogether ceased but their silence was as tremendous as their roar had been i dont know though he resumed theres times when the plains can be awful big too presently we finished a hand and he said let me see that paper he sat readin it apparently through while i arranged my blankets to make a warm bed then since the paper continued to absorb him i got myself ready and slid between my blankets for the night youll need another candle soon in that lantern said i he put the paper down i would do it all over again he began the whole thing just the same he knowed the customs of the country and he played the game no call to blame me for the customs of the country you leave other folks cattle alone or you take the consequences and it was all known to steve from the start would he have me take the judges wages and give him the wink he must have changed a heap from the steve i knew if he expected that i dont believe he expected that he knew well enough the only thing that would have let him off would have been a regular jury for the thieves have got hold of the juries in johnson county i would do it all over just the same the expiring flame leaped in the lantern and fell blue he broke off in his words as if to arrange the light but did not sitting silent instead just visible and seeming to watch the death struggle of the flame i could find nothing to say to him and i believed he was now winning his way back to serenity by himself he kept his outward man so nearly natural that i forgot about that cold touch of his hand and never guessed how far out from reason the tide of emotion was even now whirling him i remember at cheyenne onced he resumed and he told me of a thanksgiving visit to town that he had made with steve we was just colts then he said he dwelt on their coltish doings their adventures sought and wrought in the perfect fellowship of youth for steve and me most always hunted in couples back in them gamesome years he explained and he fell into the elemental talk of sex such talk as would be an elks or tigers and spoken so by him simply and naturally as we speak of the seasons or of death or of any actuality it was without offense it would be offense should i repeat it then abruptly ending these memories of himself and steve he went out of the tent and i heard him dragging a log to the fire when it had blazed up there on the tent wall was his shadow and that of the log where he sat with his halfbroken heart and all the while i supposed he was master of himself and selfjustified against steves omission to bid him goodby i must have fallen asleep before he returned for i remember nothing except waking and finding him in his blankets beside me the fire shadow was gone and gray cold light was dimly on the tent he slept restlessly and his forehead was ploughed by lines of pain while i looked at him he began to mutter and suddenly started up with violence no he cried out no just the same and thus wakened himself staring whats the matter he demanded he was slow in getting back to where we were and full consciousness found him sitting up with his eyes fixed on mine they were more haunted than they had been at all and his next speech came straight from his dream maybe youd better quit me this aint your trouble i laughed why what is the trouble his eyes still intently fixed on mine do you think if we changed our trail we could lose them from us i was framing a jocose reply about ounces being a good walker when the sound of hoofs rushing in the distance stopped me and he ran out of the tent with his rifle when i followed with mine he was up the bank and all his powers alert but nothing came out of the dimness save our three stampeded horses they crashed over fallen timber and across the open to where their picketed comrade grazed at the end of his rope by him they came to a stand and told him i suppose what they had seen for all four now faced in the same direction looking away into the mysterious dawn we likewise stood peering and my rifle barrel felt cold in my hand the dawn was all we saw the inscrutable dawn coming and coming through the black pines and the gray open of the basin there above lifted the peaks no sun yet on them and behind us our stream made a little tinkling a bear i suppose said i at length his strange look fixed me again and then his eyes went to the horses they smell things we cant smell said he very slowly will you prove to me they dont see things we cant see a chill shot through me and i could not help a frightened glance where we had been watching but one of the horses began to graze and i had a wholesome thought hes tired of whatever he sees then said i pointing a smile came for a moment in the virginians face must be a poor show he observed all the horses were grazing now and he added it aint hurt their appetites any we made our own breakfast then and what uncanny dread i may have been touched with up to this time henceforth left me in the face of a real alarm the shock of steve was working upon the virginian he was aware of it himself he was fighting it with all his might and he was being overcome he was indeed like a gallant swimmer against whom both wind and tide have conspired and in this now foreboding solitude there was only myself to throw him ropes his strokes for safety were as bold as was the undertow that ceaselessly annulled them i reckon i made a fuss in the tent said he feeling his way with me i threw him a rope yes nightmare indigestion too much newspaper before retiring he caught the rope thats correct i had a hell of a foolish dream for a growedup man youd not think it of me oh yes i should ive had them after prolonged lobster and champagne ah he murmured prolonged prolonged is what does it he glanced behind him steve came back in your lobster dream i put in but he missed this rope yes he answered with his eyes searching me and he handed me the paper by the way where is that i asked i built the fire with it but when i took it from him it was a sixshooter i had hold of and pointing at my breast and then steve spoke do you think youre fit to live steve said and i got hot at him and i reckon i must have told him what i thought of him you heard me i expect glad i didnt your language sometimes is he laughed out oh i account for all this thats happening just like you do if we gave our explanations theyd be pretty near twins the horses saw a bear then maybe a bear maybe but here the tide caught him again whats your idea about dreams my ropes were all out liver nerves was the best i could do but now he swam strongly by himself you may think im discreditable he said but i know i am it ought to take more than well men have lost their friendships before feuds and wars have cloven a right smart of bonds in twain and if my haid is going to get shook by a little old piece of newspaper im ashamed i burned that im ashamed to have been that weak any man gets unstrung i told him my ropes had become straws and i strove to frame some policy for the next hours we now finished breakfast and set forth to catch the horses as we drove them in i found that the virginian was telling me a ghost story at halfpast three in the morning she saw her runaway daughter standing with a babe in her arms but when she moved it was all gone later they found it was the very same hour the young mother died in nogales and she sent for the child and raised it herself i knowed them both back home do you believe that i said nothing no more do i believe it he asserted and see here nogales time is three hours different from richmond i didnt know about that point then once out of these mountains i knew he could right himself but even i who had no steve to dream about felt this silence of the peaks was preying on me her daughter and her might have been thinkin mighty hard about each other just then he pursued but steve is dead finished you certnly dont believe theres anything more i wish i could i told him no im satisfied heaven didnt never interest me much but if there was a world of dreams after you went he stopped himself and turned his searching eyes away from mine theres a heap o darkness wherever you try to step he said and i thought id left off wasting thoughts on the subject you see he dexterously roped a horse and once more his splendid sanity was turned to gold by his imagination i expect in many growedup men youd call sensible theres a little boy sleepin the little kid they onced was that still keeps his fear of the dark you mentioned the dark yourself yesterday well this experience has woke up that kid in me and blamed if i can coax the little cuss to go to sleep again i keep atelling him daylight will sure come but he keeps acrying and holding on to me somewhere far in the basin there was a faint sound and we stood still hush he said but it was like our watching the dawn nothing more followed they have shot that bear i remarked he did not answer and we put the saddles on without talk we made no haste but we were not over half an hour i suppose in getting off with the packs it was not a new thing to hear a shot where wild game was in plenty yet as we rode that shot sounded already in my mind different from others perhaps i should not believe this today but for what i look back to to make camp last night we had turned off the trail and now followed the stream down for a while taking next a cut through the wood in this way we came upon the tracks of our horses where they had been galloping back to the camp after their fright they had kicked up the damp and matted pine needles very plainly all along nothing has been here but themselves though said i and they aint showing signs of remembering any scare said the virginian in a little while we emerged upon an open heres where they was grazing said the virginian and the signs were clear enough heres where they must have got their scare he pursued you stay with them while i circle a little so i stayed and certainly our animals were very calm at visiting this scene when you bring a horse back to where he has recently encountered a wild animal his ears and his nostrils are apt to be wide awake the virginian had stopped and was beckoning to me heres your bear said he as i arrived twolegged you see and he had a hawss of his own there was a stake driven down where an animal had been picketed for the night looks like ounces i said considering the footprints its ounces and ounces wanted another hawss very bad so him and pounds could travel like gentlemen should but pounds doesnt seem to have been with him oh pounds he was making coffee somewheres in yonder when this happened neither of them guessed thered be other hawsses wandering here in the night or they both would have come he turned back to our pack animals then youll not hunt for this camp to make sure i prefer making sure first we might be expected at that camp he took out his rifle from beneath his leg and set it across his saddle at halfcock i did the same and thus cautiously we resumed our journey in a slightly different direction this aint all were going to find out said the virginian ounces had a good idea but i reckon he made a bad mistake later we had found out a good deal without any more i thought ounces had gone to bring in their single horse and coming upon three more in the pasture had undertaken to catch one and failed merely driving them where he feared to follow shorty never could rope a horse alone i remarked the virginian grinned shorty well shorty sounds as well as ounces but that aint the mistake im thinking he made i knew that he would not tell me but that was just like him for the last twenty minutes having something to do he had become himself again had come to earth from that unsafe country of the brain where beckoned a spectral steve nothing was left but in his eyes that question which pain had set there and i wondered if his friend of old who seemed so brave and amiable would have dealt him that hurt at the solemn end had he known what a poisoned wound it would be we came out on a ridge from which we could look down you always want to ride on high places when theres folks around whose intentions aint been declared said the virginian and we went along our ridge for some distance then suddenly he turned down and guided us almost at once to the trail thats it he said see the track of a horse was very fresh on the trail but it was a galloping horse now and no bootprints were keeping up with it any more no boots could have kept up with it the rider was making time today yesterday that horse had been ridden up into the mountains at leisure who was on him there was never to be any certain answer to that but who was not on him we turned back in our journey back into the heart of that basin with the tall peaks all rising like teeth in the cloudless sun and the snowfields shining white he was afraid of us said the virginian he did not know how many of us had come up here three hawsses might mean a dozen more around we followed the backward trail in among the pines and came after a time upon their camp and then i understood the mistake that shorty had made he had returned after his failure and had told that other man of the presence of new horses he should have kept this a secret for haste had to be made at once and two cannot get away quickly upon one horse but it was poor shortys last blunder he lay there by their extinct fire with his wistful lostdog face upward and his thick yellow hair unparted as it had always been the murder had been done from behind we closed the eyes there was no natural harm in him said the virginian but you must do a thing well in this country there was not a trace not a clew of the other man and we found a place where we could soon cover shorty with earth as we lifted him we saw the newspaper that he had been reading he had brought it from the clump of cottonwoods where he and the other man had made a later visit than ours to be sure of the fate of their friends or possibly in hopes of another horse evidently when the party were surprised they had been able to escape with only one all of the newspaper was there save the leaf i had picked up all and more for this had pencil writing on it that was not mine nor did i at first take it in i thought it might be a clew and i read it aloud goodby jeff it said i could not have spoke to you without playing the baby whos jeff i asked but it came over me when i looked at the virginian he was standing beside me quite motionless and then he put out his hand and took the paper and stood still looking at the words steve used to call me jeff he said because i was southern i reckon nobody else ever did he slowly folded the message from the dead brought by the dead and rolled it in the coat behind his saddle for a halfminute he stood leaning his forehead down against the saddle after this he came back and contemplated shortys face awhile i wish i could thank him he said i wish i could we carried shorty over and covered him with earth and on that laid a few pine branches then we took up our journey and by the end of the forenoon we had gone some distance upon our trail through the teton mountains but in front of us the hoofprints ever held their stride of haste drawing farther from us through the hours until by the next afternoon somewhere we noticed they were no longer to be seen and after that they never came upon the trail again xxxiii the spinster loses some sleep somewhere at the eastern base of the tetons did those hoofprints disappear into a mountain sanctuary where many crooked paths have led he that took another mans possessions or he that took another mans life could always run here if the law or popular justice were too hot at his heels steep ranges and forests walled him in from the world on all four sides almost without a break and every entrance lay through intricate solitudes snake river came into the place through canyons and mournful pines and marshes to the north and went out at the south between formidable chasms every tributary to this stream rose among high peaks and ridges and descended into the valley by wellnigh impenetrable courses pacific creek from two ocean pass buffalo fork from no pass at all black rock from the towogetee pass all these and many more were the waters of loneliness among whose thousand hidingplaces it was easy to be lost down in the bottom was a spread of level land broad and beautiful with the blue and silver tetons rising from its chain of lakes to the west and other heights presiding over its other sides and up and down and in and out of this hollow square of mountains where waters plentifully flowed and game and natural pasture abounded there skulked a nomadic and distrustful population this in due time built cabins took wives begot children and came to speak of itself as the honest settlers of jacksons hole it is a commodious title and doubtless today more accurate than it was once into this place the hoofprints disappeared not many cabins were yet built there but the unknown rider of the horse knew well that he would find shelter and welcome among the felons of his stripe law and order might guess his name correctly but there was no next step for lack of evidence and he would wait whoever he was until the rage of popular justice which had been pursuing him and his brother thieves should subside then feeling his way gradually with prudence he would let himself be seen again and now as mysteriously as he had melted away rumor passed over the country no tongue seemed to be heard telling the first news the news was there one day a matter of whispered knowledge on sunk creek and on bear creek and elsewhere far and wide before men talked men seemed secretly to know that steve and ed and shorty would never again be seen riders met each other in the road and drew rein to discuss the event and its bearing upon the cattle interests in town saloons men took each other aside and muttered over it in corners thus it reached the ears of molly wood beginning in a veiled and harmless shape a neighbor joined her when she was out riding by herself good morning said he dont you find it lonesome and when she answered lightly he continued meaning well youll be having company again soon now he has finished his job wish hed finished it more well good day molly thought these words over she could not tell why they gave her a strange feeling to her vermont mind no suspicion of the truth would come naturally but suspicion began to come when she returned from her ride for entering the cabin of the taylors she came upon several people who all dropped their talk short and were not skilful at resuming it she sat there awhile uneasily aware that all of them knew something which she did not know and was not intended to know a thought pierced herhad anything happened to her lover no that was not it the man she had met on horseback spoke of her having company soon again how soon she wondered he had been unable to say when he should return and now she suddenly felt that a great silence had enveloped him lately not the mere silence of absence of receiving no messages or letters but another sort of silence which now at this moment was weighing strangely upon her and then the next day it came out at the schoolhouse during that interval known as recess she became aware through the open window that they were playing a new game outside lusty screeches of delight reached her ears jump a voice ordered jump i dont want to returned another voice uneasily you said you would said several didnt he say he would ah he said he would jump now quick but i dont want to quavered the voice in a tone so dismal that molly went out to see they had got bob carmody on the top of the gate by a tree with a rope round his neck the other end of which four little boys were joyously holding the rest looked on eagerly three little girls clasping their hands and springing up and down with excitement why children exclaimed molly hes said his prayers and everything they all screamed out hes a rustler and were lynchin him jump bob i dont want ah coward wont take his medicine let him go boys said molly you might really hurt him and so she broke up this game but not without general protest from wyomings young voice he said he would henry dow assured her and george taylor further explained he said hed be steve but steve didnt scare then george proceeded to tell the schoolmarm eagerly all about steve and ed while the schoolmarm looked at him with a rigid face you promised your mother youd not tell said henry dow after all had been told youve gone and done it and henry wagged his head n a superior manner thus did the new england girl learn what her cowboy lover had done she spoke of it to nobody she kept her misery to herself he was not there to defend his act perhaps in a way that was better but these were hours of darkness indeed to molly wood on that visit to dunbarton when at the first sight of her lovers photograph in frontier dress her aunt had exclaimed i suppose there are days when he does not kill people she had cried in all good faith and mirth he never killed anybody later when he was lying in her cabin weak from his bullet wound but each day stronger beneath her nursing at a certain word of his there had gone through her a shudder of doubt perhaps in his many wanderings he had done such a thing in selfdefence or in the cause of popular justice but she had pushed the idea away from her hastily back into the days before she had ever seen him if this had ever happened let her not know of it then as a cruel reward for his candor and his laying himself bare to her mother the letters from bennington had used that very letter of his as a weapon against him her sister sarah had quoted from it he says with apparent pride wrote sarah that he has never killed for pleasure or profit those are his exact words and you may guess their dreadful effect upon mother i congratulate you my dear on having chosen a protector so scrupulous thus her elder sister had seen fit to write and letters from less near relatives made hints at the same subject so she was compelled to accept this piece of knowledge thrust upon her yet still still those events had been before she knew him they were remote without detail or context he had been little more than a boy no doubt it was to save his own life and so she bore the hurt of her discovery all the more easily because her sisters tone roused her to defend her cowboy but now in her cabin alone after midnight she arose from her sleepless bed and lighting the candle stood before his photograph it is a good face her greataunt had said after some study of it and these words were in her mind now there his likeness stood at full length confronting her the spurs on the boots the fringed leathern chaparreros the coiled rope in hand the pistol at hip the rough flannel shirt and the scarf knotted at the throat and then the grave eyes looking at her it thrilled her to meet them even so she could read life into them she seemed to feel passion come from them and then something like reproach she stood for a long while looking at him and then beating her hands together suddenly she blew out her light and went back into bed but not to sleep youre looking pale deary said mrs taylor to her a few days later am i and you dont eat anything oh yes i do and molly retired to her cabin george said mrs taylor you come here it may seem severe i think that it was severe that evening when mr taylor came home to his family george received a thrashing for disobedience and i suppose said mrs taylor to her husband that she came out just in time to stop em breaking bob carmodys neck for him upon the day following mrs taylor essayed the impossible she took herself over to molly woods cabin the girl gave her a listless greeting and the dame sat slowly down and surveyed the comfortable room a very nice home deary said she if it was a home but youll fix something like this in your real home i have no doubt molly made no answer what were going to do without you i cant see said mrs taylor but id not have it different for worlds hell be coming back soon i expect mrs taylor said molly all at once please dont say anything now i cant stand it and she broke into wretched tears why deary he no not a word please please ill go out if you do the older woman went to the younger one and then put her arms round her but when the tears were over they had not done any good it was not the storm that clears the sky all storms do not clear the sky and mrs taylor looked at the pale girl and saw that she could do nothing to help her toward peace of mind of course she said to her husband after returning from her profitless errand you might know shed feel dreadful what about said taylor why you know just as well as i do and ill say for myself i hope youll never have to help hang folks well said taylor mildly if i had to id have to i guess well i dont want it to come but that poor girl is eating her heart right out over it what does she say its what she dont say shell not talk and shell not let me talk and she sits and sits ill go talk some to her said the man well taylor i thought you had more sense youd not get a word in shell be sick soon if her worry aint stopped someway though what does she want this country to do inquired taylor does she expect it to be like vermont when it we cant help what she expects his wife interrupted but i wish we could help her they could not however and help came from another source judge henry rode by the next day to him good mrs taylor at once confided her anxiety the judge looked grave must i meddle he said yes judge you must said mrs taylor but why cant i send him over here when he gets back then theyll just settle it between themselves mrs taylor shook her head that would unsettle it worse than it is she assured him they mustnt meet just now the judge sighed well he said very well ill sacrifice my character since you insist judge henry sat thinking waiting until school should be out he did not at all relish what lay before him he would like to have got out of it he had been a federal judge he had been an upright judge he had met the responsibilities of his difficult office not only with learning which is desirable but also with courage and common sense besides and these are essential he had been a stanch servant of the law and now he was invited to defend that which at first sight nay even at second and third sight must always seem a defiance of the law more injurious than crime itself every good man in this world has convictions about right and wrong they are his souls riches his spiritual gold when his conduct is at variance with these he knows that it is a departure a falling and this is a simple and clear matter if falling were all that ever happened to a good man all his days would be a simple matter of striving and repentance but it is not all there come to him certain junctures crises when life like a highwayman springs upon him demanding that he stand and deliver his convictions in the name of some righteous cause bidding him do evil that good may come i cannot say that i believe in doing evil that good may come i do not i think that any man who honestly justifies such course deceives himself but this i can say to call any act evil instantly begs the question many an act that man does is right or wrong according to the time and place which form so to speak its context strip it of its surrounding circumstances and you tear away its meaning gentlemen reformers beware of this common practice of yours beware of calling an act evil on tuesday because that same act was evil on monday do you fail to follow my meaning then here is an illustration on monday i walk over my neighbors field there is no wrong in such walking by tuesday he has put up a sign that trespassers will be prosecuted according to law i walk again on tuesday and am a lawbreaker do you begin to see my point or are you inclined to object to the illustration because the walking on tuesday was not wrong but merely illegal then here is another illustration which you will find it a trifle more embarrassing to answer consider carefully let me beg you the case of a young man and a young woman who walk out of a door on tuesday pronounced man and wife by a third party inside the door it matters not that on monday they were in their own hearts sacredly vowed to each other if they had omitted stepping inside that door if they had dispensed with that third party and gone away on monday sacredly vowed to each other in their own hearts you would have scarcely found their conduct moral consider these things carefully the signpost and the third party and the difference they make and now for a finish we will return to the signpost suppose that i went over my neighbors field on tuesday after the signpost was put up because i saw a murder about to be committed in the field and therefore ran in and stopped it was i doing evil that good might come do you not think that to stay out and let the murder be done would have been the evil act in this case to disobey the signpost was right and i trust that you now perceive the same act may wear as many different hues of right or wrong as the rainbow according to the atmosphere in which it is done it is not safe to say of any man he did evil that good might come was the thing that he did in the first place evil that is the question forgive my asking you to use your mind it is a thing which no novelist should expect of his reader and we will go back at once to judge henry and his meditations about lynching he was well aware that if he was to touch at all upon this subject with the new england girl he could not put her off with mere platitudes and humdrum formulas not at least if he expected to do any good she was far too intelligent and he was really anxious to do good for her sake he wanted the course of the girls true love to run more smoothly and still more did he desire this for the sake of his virginian i sent him myself on that business the judge reflected uncomfortably i am partly responsible for the lynching it has brought him one great unhappiness already through the death of steve if it gets running in this girls mind she may dear me the judge broke off what a nuisance and he sighed for as all men know he also knew that many things should be done in this world in silence and that talking about them is a mistake but when school was out and the girl gone to her cabin his mind had set the subject in order thoroughly and he knocked at her door ready as he had put it to sacrifice his character in the cause of true love well he said coming straight to the point some dark things have happened and when she made no answer to this he continued but you must not misunderstand us were too fond of you for that judge henry said molly wood also coming straight to the point have you come to tell me that you think well of lynching he met her of burning southern negroes in public no of hanging wyoming cattle thieves in private yes you perceive theres a difference dont you not in principle said the girl dry and short oh dear me slowly exclaimed the judge i am sorry that you cannot see that because i think that i can and i think that you have just as much sense as i have the judge made himself very grave and very goodhumored at the same time the poor girl was strung to a high pitch and spoke harshly in spite of herself what is the difference in principle she demanded well said the judge easy and thoughtful what do you mean by principle i didnt think youd quibble flashed molly im not a lawyer myself a man less wise than judge henry would have smiled at this and then war would have exploded hopelessly between them and harm been added to what was going wrong already but the judge knew that he must give to every word that the girl said now his perfect consideration i dont mean to quibble he assured her i know the trick of escaping from one question by asking another but i dont want to escape from anything you hold me to answer if you can show me that i am wrong i want you to do so but and here the judge smiled i want you to play fair too and how am i not i want you to be just as willing to be put right by me as i am to be put right by you and so when you use such a word as principle you must help me to answer by saying what principle you mean for in all sincerity i see no likeness in principle whatever between burning southern negroes in public and hanging wyoming horsethieves in private i consider the burning a proof that the south is semibarbarous and the hanging a proof that wyoming is determined to become civilized we do not torture our criminals when we lynch them we do not invite spectators to enjoy their death agony we put no such hideous disgrace upon the united states we execute our criminals by the swiftest means and in the quietest way do you think the principle is the same molly had listened to him with attention the way is different she admitted only the way so it seems to me both defy law and order ah but do they both now were getting near the principle why yes ordinary citizens take the law in their own hands the principle at last exclaimed the judge now tell me some more things out of whose hands do they take the law the courts what made the courts i dont understand how did there come to be any courts the constitution how did there come to be any constitution who made it the delegates i suppose who made the delegates i suppose they were elected or appointed or something and who elected them of course the people elected them call them the ordinary citizens said the judge i like your term they are where the law comes from you see for they chose the delegates who made the constitution that provided for the courts theres your machinery these are the hands into which ordinary citizens have put the law so you see at best when they lynch they only take back what they once gave now well take your two cases that you say are the same in principle i think that they are not for in the south they take a negro from jail where he was waiting to be duly hung the south has never claimed that the law would let him go but in wyoming the law has been letting our cattlethieves go for two years we are in a very bad way and we are trying to make that way a little better until civilization can reach us at present we lie beyond its pale the courts or rather the juries into whose hands we have put the law are not dealing the law they are withered hands or rather they are imitation hands made for show with no life in them no grip they cannot hold a cattlethief and so when your ordinary citizen sees this and sees that he has placed justice in a dead hand he must take justice back into his own hands where it was once at the beginning of all things call this primitive if you will but so far from being a defiance of the law it is an assertion of it the fundamental assertion of self governing men upon whom our whole social fabric is based there is your principle miss wood as i see it now can you help me to see anything different she could not but perhaps you are of the same opinion still the judge inquired it is all terrible to me she said yes and so is capital punishment terrible and so is war and perhaps some day we shall do without them but they are none of them so terrible as unchecked theft and murder would be after the judge had departed on his way to sunk creek no one spoke to molly upon this subject but her face did not grow cheerful at once it was plain from her fits of silence that her thoughts were not at rest and sometimes at night she would stand in front of her lovers likeness gazing upon it with both love and shrinking xxxiv to fit her finger it was two rings that the virginian wrote for when next i heard from him after my dark sight of what the cattle land could be i soon had journeyed home by way of washakie and rawlins steve and shorty did not leave my memory nor will they ever i suppose the virginian had touched the whole thing the day i left him he had noticed me looking a sort of farewell at the plains and mountains you will come back to it he said if there was a headstone for every man that once pleasured in his freedom here yud see one most every time yu turned your head its a heap sadder than a graveyard but yu love it all the same sadness had passed from him from his uppermost mood at least when he wrote about the rings deep in him was sadness of course as well as joy for he had known steve and he had covered shorty with earth he had looked upon life with a marksmans eyes very close and no one if he have a heart can pass through this and not carry sadness in his spirit with him forever but he seldom shows it openly it bides within him enriching his cheerfulness and rendering him of better service to his fellowmen it was a commission of cheerfulness that he now gave being distant from where rings are to be bought he could not go so far as the east to procure what he had planned rings were to be had in cheyenne and a still greater choice in denver and so far as either of these towns his affairs would have permitted him to travel but he was set upon having rings from the east they must come from the best place in the country nothing short of that was good enough to fit her finger as he said the wedding ring was a simple matter let it be right that was all the purest gold that could be used with her initials and his together graven round the inside with the day of the month and the year the date was now set it had come so far as this july third was to be the day then for sixty days and nights he was to be a bridegroom free from his duties at sunk creek free to take his bride wheresoever she might choose to go and she had chosen those voices of the world had more than angered her for after the anger a set purpose was left her sister should have the chance neither to come nor to stay away had her mother even answered the virginians letter there could have been some relenting but the poor lady had been inadequate in this as in all other searching moments of her life she had sent messages kind ones to be sure but only messages if this had hurt the virginian no one knew it in the world least of all the girl in whose heart it had left a cold frozen spot not a good spirit in which to be married you will say no frozen spots are not good at any time but mollys own nature gave her due punishment through all these days of her warm happiness a chill current ran like those which interrupt the swimmers perfect joy the girl was only half as happy as her lover but she hid this deep from him hid it until that final fierce hour of reckoning that her nature had with her nay was bound to have with her before the punishment was lifted and the frozen spot melted at length from her heart so meanwhile she made her decree against bennington not vermont but wyoming should be her wedding place no worlds voices should be whispering no worlds eyes should be looking on when she made her vow to him and received his vow those voices should be spoken and that ring put on in this wild cattle land where first she had seen him ride into the flooded river and lift her ashore upon his horse it was this open sky which should shine down on them and this frontier soil upon which their feet should tread the world should take its turn second after a month with him by stream and canyon a month far deeper into the mountain wilds than ever yet he had been free to take her a month with sometimes a tent and sometimes the stars above them and only their horses besides themselves after such a month as this she would take him to her mother and to bennington and the old aunt over at dunbarton would look at him and be once more able to declare that the storks had always preferred a man who was a man and so july third was to be engraved inside the wedding ring upon the other ring the virginian had spent much delicious meditation all in his secret mind he had even got the right measure of her finger without her suspecting the reason but this step was the final one in his plan during the time that his thoughts had begun to be busy over the other ring by a chance he had learned from mrs henry a number of old fancies regarding precious stones mrs henry often accompanied the judge in venturesome mountain climbs and sometimes the steepness of the rocks required her to use her hands for safety one day when the virginian went with them to help mark out certain boundary corners she removed her rings lest they should get scratched and he being just behind her took them during the climb i see youre looking at my topaz she had said as he returned them if i could have chosen it would have been a ruby but i was born in november he did not understand her in the least but her words awakened exceeding interest in him and they had descended some five miles of mountain before he spoke again then he became ingenious for he had half worked out what mrs henrys meaning must be but he must make quite sure therefore according to his wild shy nature he became ingenious men wear rings he began some of the men on the ranch do i dont see any harm in a mans wearin a ring but i never have well said the lady not yet suspecting that he was undertaking to circumvent her probably those men have sweethearts no maam not sweethearts worth wearin rings for in two cases anyway they won em at cyards and they like to see em shine i never saw a man wear a topaz mrs henry did not have any further remark to make i was born in january myself pursued the virginian very thoughtfully then the lady gave him one look and without further process of mind perceived exactly what he was driving at thats very extravagant for rings said she january is diamonds diamonds murmured the virginian more and more thoughtfully well it dont matter for id not wear a ring and november is what did yu say maam topaz yes well jewels are certnly pretty things in the spanish missions yull see large ones now and again and theyre not glass i think and so they have got some jewel that kind of belongs to each month right around the twelve yes said mrs henry smiling one for each month but the opal is what you want he looked at her and began to blush october is the opal she added and she laughed outright for miss woods birthday was on the fifteenth of that month the virginian smiled guiltily at her through his crimson ive no doubt you can beat around the bush very well with men said mrs henry but its perfectly transparent with us in matters of sentiment at least well i am sorry he presently said i dont want to give her an opal i have no superstition but i dont want to give her an opal if her mother did or anybody like that why all right but not from me d yu understand maam mrs henry did understand this subtle trait in the wild man and she rejoiced to be able to give him immediate reassurance concerning opals dont worry about that she said the opal is said to bring ill luck but not when it is your own month stone then it is supposed to be not only deprived of evil influence but to possess peculiarly fortunate power let it be an opal ring then he asked her boldly various questions and she showed him her rings and gave him advice about the setting there was no special custom she told him ruling such rings as this he desired to bestow the gem might be the ladys favorite or the lovers favorite and to choose the ladys month stone was very well indeed very well indeed the virginian thought but not quite well enough for him his mind now busied itself with this lore concerning jewels and soon his sentiment had suggested something which he forthwith carried out when the ring was achieved it was an opal but set with four small embracing diamonds thus was her month stone joined with his that their luck and their love might be inseparably clasped he found the size of her finger one day when winter had departed and the early grass was green he made a ring of twisted grass for her while she held her hand for him to bind it he made another for himself then after each had worn their grass ring for a while he begged her to exchange he did not send his token away from him but most carefully measured it thus the ring fitted her well and the lustrous flame within the opal thrilled his heart each time he saw it for now june was near its end and that other plain gold ring which for safe keeping he cherished suspended round his neck day and night seemed to burn with an inward glow that was deeper than the opals so in due course arrived the second of july mollys punishment had got as far as this she longed for her mother to be near her at this time but it was too late xxxv with malice aforethought town lay twelve straight miles before the lover and his sweetheart when they came to the brow of the last long hill all beneath them was like a map neither man nor beast distinguishable but the veined and tinted image of a country knobs and flats set out in order clearly shining extensive and motionless in the sun it opened on the sight of the lovers as they reached the sudden edge of the tableland where since morning they had ridden with the head of neither horse ever in advance of the other at the view of their journeys end the virginian looked down at his girl beside him his eyes filled with a bridegrooms light and hanging safe upon his breast he could feel the gold ring that he would slowly press upon her finger tomorrow he drew off the glove from her left hand and stooping kissed the jewel in that other ring which he had given her the crimson fire in the opal seemed to mingle with that in his heart and his arm lifted her during a moment from the saddle as he held her to him but in her heart the love of him was troubled by that cold pang of loneliness which had crept upon her like a tide as the day drew near none of her own people were waiting in that distant town to see her become his bride friendly faces she might pass on the way but all of them new friends made in this wild country not a face of her childhood would smile upon her and deep within her a voice cried for the mother who was far away in vermont that she would see mrs taylors kind face at her wedding was no comfort now there lay the town in the splendor of wyoming space around it spread the watered fields westward for a little way eastward to a great distance making squares of green and yellow crops and the town was but a poor rag in the midst of this quilted harvest after the fields to the east the tawny plain began and with one faint furrow of river lining its undulations it stretched beyond sight but west of the town rose the bow leg mountains cool with their still unmelted snows and their dull blue gulfs of pine from three canyons flowed three clear forks which began the river their confluence was above the town a good two miles it looked but a few paces from up here while each side the river straggled the margin cottonwoods like thin borders along a garden walk over all this map hung silence like a harmony tremendous yet serene how beautiful how i love it whispered the girl but oh how big it is and she leaned against her lover for an instant it was her spirit seeking shelter today this vast beauty this primal calm had in it for her something almost of dread the small comfortable green hills of home rose before her she closed her eyes and saw vermont a village street and the postoffice and ivy covering an old front door and her mother picking some yellow roses from a bush at a sound her eyes quickly opened and here was her lover turned in his saddle watching another horseman approach she saw the virginians hand in a certain position and knew that his pistol was ready but the other merely overtook and passed them as they stood at the brow of the hill the man had given one nod to the virginian and the virginian one to him and now he was already below them on the descending road to molly wood he was a stranger but she had seen his eyes when he nodded to her lover and she knew even without the pistol that this was not enmity at first sight it was not indeed five years of gathered hate had looked out of the mans eyes and she asked her lover who this was oh said he easily just a man i see now and then is his name trampas said molly wood the virginian looked at her in surprise why where have you seen him he asked never till now but i knew my gracious yu never told me yu had mindreading powers and he smiled serenely at her i knew it was trampas as soon as i saw his eyes my gracious her lover repeated with indulgent irony i must be mighty careful of my eyes when youre lookin at em i believe he did that murder said the girl whose mind are yu readin now he drawled affectionately but he could not joke her off the subject she took his strong hand in hers tremulously so much of it as her little hand could hold i know something about that that last autumn she said shrinking from words more definite and i know that you only did what i had to he finished very sadly but sternly too yes she asserted keeping hold of his hand i suppose that lynching she almost whispered the word is the only way but when they had to die just for stealing horses it seems so wicked that this murderer who can prove it asked the virginian but dont you know it i know a heap o things inside my heart but thats not proving there was only the body and the hoofprints and what folks guessed he was never even arrested the girl said no he helped elect the sheriff in that county then molly ventured a step inside the border of her lovers reticence i saw she hesitated just now i saw what you did he returned to his caressing irony youll have me plumb scared if you keep on seein things you had your pistol ready for him why i believe i did it was mighty unnecessary and the virginian took out the pistol again and shook his head over it like one who has been caught in a blunder she looked at him and knew that she must step outside his reticence again by love and her surrender to him their positions had been exchanged he was not now as through his long courting he had been her halfobeying halfrefractory worshipper she was no longer his halfindulgent halfscornful superior her better birth and schooling that had once been weapons to keep him at his distance or bring her off victorious in their encounters had given way before the onset of the natural man himself she knew her cowboy lover with all that he lacked to be more than ever she could be with all that she had he was her worshipper still but her master too therefore now against the baffling smile he gave her she felt powerless and once again a pang of yearning for her mother to be near her today shot through the girl she looked from her untamed man to the untamed desert of wyoming and the town where she was to take him as her wedded husband but for his sake she would not let him guess her loneliness he sat on his horse monte considering the pistol then he showed her a rattlesnake coiled by the roots of some sagebrush can i hit it he inquired you dont often miss them said she striving to be cheerful well im told getting married unstrings some men he aimed and the snake was shattered maybe its too early yet for the unstringing to begin and with some deliberation he sent three more bullets into the snake i reckon thats enough said he was not the first one oh yes for the snake and then with one leg crooked cowboy fashion across in front of his saddlehorn he cleaned his pistol and replaced the empty cartridges once more she ventured near the line of his reticence has has trampas seen you much lately why no not for a right smart while but i reckon he has not missed me the virginian spoke this in his gentlest voice but his rebuffed sweetheart turned her face away and from her eyes she brushed a tear he reined his horse monte beside her and upon her cheek she felt his kiss you are not the only mindreader said he very tenderly and at this she clung to him and laid her head upon his breast i had been thinking he went on that the way our marriage is to be was the most beautiful way it is the most beautiful she murmured he slowly spoke out his thought as if she had not said this no folks to stare no fuss no jokes and ribbons and best bonnets no public eye nor talkin of tongues when most yu want to hear nothing and say nothing she answered by holding him closer just the bishop of wyoming to join us and not even him after were once joined i did think that would be ahead of all ways to get married i have seen he paused again and she made no rejoinder but we have left out your mother she looked in his face with quick astonishment it was as if his spirit had heard the cry of her spirit that is nowhere near right he said that is wrong she could never have come here said the girl we should have gone there i dont know how i can ask her to forgive me but it was not you cried molly yes because i did not object i did not tell you we must go to her i missed the point thinking so much about my own feelings for you see and ive never said this to you until now your mother did hurt me when you said you would have me after my years of waiting and i wrote her that letter telling her all about myself and how my family was not like yours and and all the rest i told her why you see it hurt me never to get a word back from her except just messages through you for i had talked to her about my hopes and my failings i had said more than ever ive said to you because she was your mother i wanted her to forgive me if she could and feel that maybe i could take good care of you after all for it was bad enough to have her daughter quit her home to teach school out hyeh on bear creek bad enough without havin me to come along and make it worse i have missed the point in thinking of my own feelings but its not your doing repeated molly with his deep delicacy he had put the whole matter as a hardship to her mother alone he had saved her any pain of confession or denial yes it is my doing he now said shall we give it up give what she did not understand why the order weve got it fixed in plans are well theyre no more than plans i hate the notion of changing but i hate hurting your mother more or anyway i ought to hate it more so we can shift if yu say so its not too late shift she faltered i mean we can go to your home now we can start by the stage tonight your mother can see us married we can come back and finish in the mountains instead of beginning in them itll be just merely shifting yu see he could scarcely bring himself to say this at all yet he said it almost as if he were urging it it implied a renunciation that he could hardly bear to think of to put off his wedding day the bliss upon whose threshold he stood after his three years of faithful battle for it and that wedding journey he had arranged for there were the mountains in sight the woods and canyons where he had planned to go with her after the bishop had joined them the solitudes where only the wild animals would be besides themselves his horses his tent his rifle his rod all were waiting ready in the town for their start tomorrow he had provided many dainty things to make her comfortable well he could wait a little more having waited three years it would not be what his heart most desired there would be the public eye and the talking of tongues but he could wait the hour would come when he could be alone with his bride at last and so he spoke as if he urged it never she cried never never she pushed it from her she would not brook such sacrifice on his part were they not going to her mother in four weeks if her family had warmly accepted him but they had not and in any case it had gone too far it was too late she told her lover that she would not hear him that if he said any more she would gallop into town separately from him and for his sake she would hide deep from him this loneliness of hers and the hurt that he had given her in refusing to share with her his trouble with trampas when others must know of it accordingly they descended the hill slowly together lingering to spin out these last miles long many rides had taught their horses to go side by side and so they went now the girl sweet and thoughtful in her sedate gray habit and the man in his leathern chaps and cartridge belt and flannel shirt looking gravely into the distance with the level gaze of the frontier having read his sweethearts mind very plainly the lover now broke his dearest custom it was his code never to speak ill of any man to any woman mens quarrels were not for womens ears in his scheme good women were to know only a fragment of mens lives he had lived many outlaw years and his wide knowledge of evil made innocence doubly precious to him but today he must depart from his code having read her mind well he would speak evil of one man to one woman because his reticence had hurt her and was she not far from her mother and very lonely do what he could she should know the story of his quarrel in language as light and casual as he could veil it with he made an oblique start he did not say to her ill tell you about this you saw me get ready for trampas because i have been ready for him any time these five years he began far off from the point with that rooted caution of his that caution which is shared by the primal savage and the perfected diplomat theres certnly a right smart o difference between men and women he observed youre quite sure she retorted aint it fortunate that theres both i mean i dont know about fortunate machinery could probably do all the heavy work for us without your help and whod invent the machinery she laughed we shouldnt need the huge noisy things you do our world would be a gentle one oh my gracious what do you mean by that oh my gracious get along monte a gentle world all full of ladies do you call men gentle inquired molly now its a funny thing about that have yu ever noticed a joke about fathersinlaw theres just as many fathersas mothersinlaw but which side are your jokes molly was not vanquished thats because the men write the comic papers said she hear that monte the men write em well if the ladies wrote a comic paper i expect that might be gentle she gave up this battle in mirth and he resumedbut dont you really reckon its uncommon to meet a fatherinlaw flouncin around the house as for gentle once i had to sleep in a room next a ladies temperance meetin oh heavens well i couldnt change my room and the hotel man he apologized to me next mawnin said it didnt surprise him the husbands drank some here the virginian broke down over his own fantastic inventions and gave a joyous chuckle in company with his sweetheart yes theres a big heap o difference between men and women he said take that fello and myself now trampas said molly quickly serious she looked along the road ahead and discerned the figure of trampas still visible on its way to town the virginian did not wish her to be serious more than could be helped why yes he replied with a waving gesture at trampas take him and me he dont think much o me how could he and i expect hell never but yu saw just now how it was between us we were not a bit like a temperance meetin she could not help laughing at the twist he gave to his voice and she felt happiness warming her for in the virginians tone about trampas was something now that no longer excluded her thus he began his gradual recital in a cadence always easy and more and more musical with the native accent of the south with the light turn he gave it its pure ugliness melted into charm no he dont think anything of me once a man in the john day valley didnt think much and by canada de oro i met another it will always be so here and there but trampas beats em all for the others have always expressed themselves got shut of their poor opinion in the open air yu see i had to explain myself to trampas a right smart while ago long before ever i laid my eyes on yu it was just nothing at all a little matter of cyards in the days when i was apt to spend my money and my holidays pretty headlong my gracious what nonsensical times i have had but i was apt to win at cyards specially poker and trampas he met me one night and i expect he must have thought i looked kind o young so he hated losin his money to such a younglookin man and he took his way of sayin as much i had to explain myself to him plainly so that he learned right away my age had got its growth well i expect he hated that worse having to receive my explanation with folks lookin on at us publicly thataway and him without further ideas occurrin to him at the moment thats what started his poor opinion of me not havin ideas at the moment and so the boys resumed their cyards id most forgot about it but trampass memry is one of his strong points next thing oh its a good while later he gets to losin flesh because judge henry gave me charge of him and some other punchers taking cattle thats not next interrupted the girl not why dont you remember she said timid yet eager dont you blamed if i do the first time we met yes my memry keeps that like i keep this and he brought from his pocket her own handkerchief the token he had picked up at a rivers brink when he had carried her from an overturned stage we did not exactly meet then she said it was at that dance i hadnt seen you yet but trampas was saying something horrid about me and you said you said rise on your legs you pole cat and tell them youre a liar when i heard that i think i think it finished me and crimson suffused mollys countenance id forgot the virginian murmured then sharply how did you hear it mrs taylor oh well a man would never have told a woman that molly laughed triumphantly then who told mrs taylor being caught he grinned at her i reckon husbands are a special kind of man was all that he found to say well since you do know about that it was the next move in the game trampas thought i had no call to stop him sayin what he pleased about a woman who was nothin to me then but all women ought to be somethin to a man so i had to give trampas another explanation in the presence of folks lookin on and it was just like the cyards no ideas occurred to him again and down goes his opinion of me some more well i have not been able to raise it there has been this and that and the other yu know most of the later doings yourself and today is the first time ive happened to see the man since the doings last autumn yu seem to know about them too he knows i cant prove he was with that gang of horse thieves and i cant prove he killed poor shorty but he knows i missed him awful close and spoiled his thieving for a while so d yu wonder he dont think much of me but if i had lived to be twentynine years old like i am and with all my chances made no enemy id feel myself a failure his story was finished he had made her his confidant in matters he had never spoken of before and she was happy to be thus much nearer to him it diminished a certain fear that was mingled with her love of him during the next several miles he was silent and his silence was enough for her vermont sank away from her thoughts and wyoming held less of loneliness they descended altogether into the map which had stretched below them so that it was a map no longer but earth with growing things and prairiedogs sitting upon it and now and then a bird flying over it and after a while she said to him what are you thinking about i have been doing sums figured in hours it sounds right short figured in minutes it boils up into quite a mess twenty by sixty is twelve hundred put that into seconds and yu get seventytwo thousand seconds seventytwo thousand seventytwo thousand seconds yet before we get married seconds to think of its having come to seconds i am thinkin about it im choppin sixty of em off every minute with such chopping time wears away more miles of the road lay behind them and in the virgin wilderness the scars of newscraped water ditches began to appear and the first wire fences next they were passing cabins and occasional fields the outposts of habitation the free road became wholly imprisoned running between unbroken stretches of barbed wire far off to the eastward a flowing column of dust marked the approaching stage bringing the bishop probably for whose visit here they had timed their wedding the day still brimmed with heat and sunshine but the great daily shadow was beginning to move from the feet of the bow leg mountains outward toward the town presently they began to meet citizens some of these knew them and nodded while some did not and stared turning a corner into the towns chief street where stood the hotel the bank the drug store the general store and the seven saloons they were hailed heartily here were three friends honey wiggin scipio le moyne and lin mclean all desirous of drinking the virginians health if his lady would she mind the three stood grinning with their hats off but behind their gayety the virginian read some other purpose well all be very good said honey wiggin pretty good said lin good said scipio which is the honest man inquired molly glad to see them not one said the virginian my old friends scare me when i think of their ways its bein engaged scares yu retorted mr mclean marriage restores your courage i find well ill trust all of you said molly hes going to take me to the hotel and then you can drink his health as much as you please with a smile to them she turned to proceed and he let his horse move with hers but he looked at his friends then scipios bleached blue eyes narrowed to a slit and he said what they had all come out on the street to saydont change your clothes oh protested molly isnt he rather dusty and countrified but the virginian had taken scipios meaning dont change yours clothes innocent molly appreciated these words no more than the average reader who reads a masterpiece complacently unaware that its style differs from that of the morning paper such was scipios intention wishing to spare her from alarm so at the hotel she let her lover go with a kiss and without a thought of trampas she in her room unlocked the possessions which were there waiting for her and changed her dress wedding garments and other civilized apparel proper for a genuine frontiersman when he comes to town were also in the hotel ready for the virginian to wear it is only the somewhat green and unseasoned cowpuncher who struts before the public in spurs and deadly weapons for many a year the virginian had put away these childish things he made a sober toilet for the streets nothing but his face and bearing remained out of the common when he was in a town but scipio had told him not to change his clothes therefore he went out with his pistol at his hip soon he had joined his three friends im obliged to yu he said he passed me this mawnin we dont know his intentions said wiggin except that hes hangin around said mclean and fillin up said scipio which reminds me they strolled into the saloon of a friend where unfortunately sat some foolish people but one cannot always tell how much of a fool a man is at sight it was a temperate healthdrinking that they made heres how they muttered softly to the virginian and how he returned softly looking away from them but they had a brief meeting of eyes standing and lounging near each other shyly and scipio shook hands with the bridegroom some day he stated tapping himself for in his vagrant heart he began to envy the man who could bring himself to marry and he nodded again repeating heres how they stood at the bar full of sentiment empty of words memory and affection busy in their hearts all of them had seen rough days together and they felt guilty with emotion its hot weather said wiggin hotter on box elder said mclean my kid has started teething words ran dry again they shifted their positions looked in their glasses read the labels on the bottles they dropped a word now and then to the proprietor about his trade and his ornaments good head commented mclean big old ram assented the proprietor shot him myself on gray bull last fall sheep was thick in the tetons last fall said the virginian on the bar stood a machine into which the idle customer might drop his nickel the coin then bounced among an arrangement of pegs descending at length into one or another of various holes you might win as much as ten times your stake but this was not the most usual result and with nickels the three friends and the bridegroom now mildly sported for a while buying them with silver when their store ran out was it sheep you went after in the tetons inquired the proprietor knowing it was horse thieves yes said the virginian ill have ten more nickels did you get all the sheep you wanted the proprietor continued poor luck said the virginian think theres a friend of yours in town this afternoon said the proprietor did he mention he was my friend the proprietor laughed the virginian watched another nickel click down among the pegs honey wiggin now made the bridegroom a straight offer well take this thing off your hands said he any or all of us said lin but scipio held his peace his loyalty went every inch as far as theirs but his understanding of his friend went deeper dont change your clothes was the first and the last help he would be likely to give in this matter the rest must be as such matters must always be between man and man to the other two friends however this seemed a very special case falling outside established precedent therefore they ventured offers of interference a man dont get married every day apologized mclean well just run him out of town for yu save yu the trouble urged wiggin say the word the proprietor now added his voice itll sober him up to spend his night out in the brush hell quit his talk then but the virginian did not say the word or any word he stood playing with the nickels think of her muttered mclean who else would i be thinking of returned the southerner his face had become very sombre she has been raised so different he murmured he pondered a little while the others waited solicitous a new idea came to the proprietor i am acting mayor of this town said he ill put him in the calaboose and keep him till you get married and away say the word repeated honey wiggin scipios eye met the proprietors and he shook his head about a quarter of an inch the proprietor shook his to the same amount they understood each other it had come to that point where there was no way out save only the ancient eternal way between man and man it is only the great mediocrity that goes to law in these personal matters so he has talked about me some said the virginian its the whiskey scipio explained i expect said mclean hed run a mile if he was in a state to appreciate his insinuations which we are careful not to mention to yu said wiggin unless yu inquire for em some of the fools present had drawn closer to hear this interesting conversation in gatherings of more than six there will generally be at least one fool and this company must have numbered twenty men this country knows well enough said one fool who hungered to be important that you dont brand no calves that aint your own the saturnine virginian looked at him thank yu said he gravely for your indorsement of my character the fool felt flattered the virginian turned to his friends his hand slowly pushed his hat back and he rubbed his black head in thought glad to see yuve got your gun with you continued the happy fool you know what trampas claims about that affair of yours in the tetons he claims that if everything was known about the killing of shorty take one on the house suggested the proprietor to him amiably your news will be fresher and he pushed him the bottle the fool felt less important this talk had went the rounds before it got to us said scipio or wed have headed it off he has got friends in town perplexity knotted the virginians brows this community knew that a man had implied he was a thief and a murderer it also knew that he knew it but the case was one of peculiar circumstances assuredly could he avoid meeting the man soon the stage would be starting south for the railroad he had already today proposed to his sweetheart that they should take it could he for her sake leave unanswered a talking enemy upon the field his own ears had not heard the enemy into these reflections the fool stepped once more of course this country dont believe trampas said he this country but he contributed no further thoughts from somewhere in the rear of the building where it opened upon the tin cans and the hinder purlieus of the town came a movement and trampas was among them courageous with whiskey all the fools now made themselves conspicuous one lay on the floor knocked there by the virginian whose arm he had attempted to hold others struggled with trampas and his bullet smashed the ceiling before they could drag the pistol from him there now there now they interposed you dont want to talk like that for he was pouring out a tide of hate and vilification yet the virginian stood quiet by the bar and many an eye of astonishment was turned upon him id not stand half that language some muttered to each other still the virginian waited quietly while the fools reasoned with trampas but no earthly foot can step between a man and his destiny trampas broke suddenly free your friends have saved your life he rang out with obscene epithets ill give you till sundown to leave town there was total silence instantly trampas spoke the virginian i dont want trouble with you he never has wanted it trampas sneered to the bystanders he has been dodging it five years but ive got him coralled some of the trampas faction smiled trampas said the virginian again are yu sure yu really mean that the whiskey bottle flew through the air hurled by trampas and crashed through the saloon window behind the virginian that was surplusage trampas said he if yu mean the other get out by sundown thats all said trampas and wheeling he went out of the saloon by the rear as he had entered gentlemen said the virginian i know you will all oblige me sure exclaimed the proprietor heartily well see that everybody lets this thing alone the virginian gave a general nod to the company and walked out into the street its a turruble shame sighed scipio that he couldnt have postponed it the virginian walked in the open air with thoughts disturbed i am of two minds about one thing he said to himself uneasily gossip ran in advance of him but as he came by the talk fell away until he had passed then they looked after him and their words again rose audibly thus everywhere a little eddy of silence accompanied his steps it dont trouble him much one said having read nothing in the virginians face it may trouble his girl some said another shell not know said a third until its over hell not tell her i wouldnt its no womans business maybe thats so well it would have suited me to have trampas die sooner how would it suit you to have him live longer inquired a member of the opposite faction suspected of being himself a cattle thief i could answer your question if i had other folks calves i wanted to brand this raised both a laugh and a silence thus the town talked filling in the time before sunset the virginian still walking aloof in the open air paused at the edge of the town id sooner have a sickness than be undecided this way he said and he looked up and down then a grim smile came at his own expense i reckon it would make me sick but theres not time over there in the hotel sat his sweetheart alone away from her mother her friends her home waiting his return knowing nothing he looked into the west between the sun and the bright ridges of the mountains was still a space of sky but the shadow from the mountains feet had drawn halfway toward the town about forty minutes more he said aloud she has been raised so different and he sighed as he turned back as he went slowly he did not know how great was his own unhappiness she has been raised so different he said again opposite the postoffice the bishop of wyoming met him and greeted him his lonely heart throbbed at the warm firm grasp of this friends hand the bishop saw his eyes glow suddenly as if tears were close but none came and no word more open than im glad to see you but gossip had reached the bishop and he was sorely troubled also what is all this said he coming straight to it the virginian looked at the clergyman frankly yu know just as much about it as i do he said and ill tell yu anything yu ask have you told miss wood inquired the bishop the eyes of the bridegroom fell and the bishops face grew at once more keen and more troubled then the bridegroom raised his eyes again and the bishop almost loved him he touched his arm like a brother this is hard luck he said the bridegroom could scarce keep his voice steady i want to do right today more than any day i have ever lived said he then go and tell her at once it will just do nothing but scare her go and tell her at once i expected you was going to tell me to run away from trampas i cant do that yu know the bishop did know never before in all his wilderness work had he faced such a thing he knew that trampas was an evil in the country and that the virginian was a good he knew that the cattle thieves the rustlers were gaining in numbers and audacity that they led many weak young fellows to ruin that they elected their men to office and controlled juries that they were a staring menace to wyoming his heart was with the virginian but there was his gospel that he preached and believed and tried to live he stood looking at the ground and drawing a finger along his eyebrow he wished that he might have heard nothing about all this but he was not one to blink his responsibility as a christian server of the church militant am i right he now slowly asked in believing that you think i am a sincere man i dont believe anything about it i know it i should run away from trampas said the bishop that aint quite fair seh we all understand you have got to do the things you tell other folks to do and you do them seh you never talk like anything but a man and you never set yourself above others you can saddle your own horses and i saw yu walk unarmed into that white river excitement when those two other parsons was afoggin and afannin for their own safety damn scoundrels the bishop instantly rebuked such language about brothers of his cloth even though he disapproved both of them and their doctrines every one may be an instrument of providence he concluded well said the virginian if that is so then providence makes use of instruments id not touch with a tenfoot pole now if you was me seh and not a bishop would you run away from trampas thats not quite fair either exclaimed the bishop with a smile because you are asking me to take another mans convictions and yet remain myself yes seh i am thats so that dont get at it i reckon you and i cant get at it if the bible said the bishop which i believe to be gods word was anything to you it is something to me seh i have found fine truths in it thou shalt not kill quoted the bishop that is plain the virginian took his turn at smiling mighty plain to me seh make it plain to trampas and therell be no killin we cant get at it that way once more the bishop quoted earnestly vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord how about instruments of providence seh why we cant get at it that way if you start usin the bible that way it will mix you up mighty quick seh my friend the bishop urged and all his good warm heart was in it my dear fellow go away for the one night hell change his mind the virginian shook his head he cannot change his word seh or at least i must stay around till he does why i have given him the sayso hes got the choice most men would not have took what i took from him in the saloon why dont you ask him to leave town the good bishop was at a standstill of all kicking against the pricks none is so hard as this kick of a professing christian against the whole instinct of human man but you have helped me some said the virginian i will go and tell her at least if i think it will be good for her i will tell her the bishop thought that he saw one last chance to move him youre twentynine he began and a little over said the virginian and you were fourteen when you ran away from your family well i was weary yu know of havin elder brothers lay down my law night and mawnin yes i know so that your life has been your own for fifteen years but it is not your own now you have given it to a woman yes i have given it to her but my lifes not the whole of me id give her twice my life fifty a thousand of em but i cant give her her nor anybody in heaven or earth i cant give my my well never get at it seh theres no good in words goodby the virginian wrung the bishops hand and left him god bless him said the bishop god bless him the virginian unlocked the room in the hotel where he kept stored his tent his blankets his packsaddles and his many accoutrements for the bridal journey in the mountains out of the window he saw the mountains blue in shadow but some cottonwoods distant in the flat between were still bright green in the sun from among his possessions he took quickly a pistol wiping and loading it then from its holster he removed the pistol which he had tried and made sure of in the morning this according to his wont when going into a risk he shoved between his trousers and his shirt in front the untried weapon he placed in the holster letting it hang visibly at his hip he glanced out of the window again and saw the mountains of the same deep blue but the cottonwoods were no longer in the sunlight the shadow had come past them nearer the town for fifteen of the forty minutes were gone the bishop is wrong he said there is no sense in telling her and he turned to the door just as she came to it herself oh she cried out at once and rushed to him he swore as he held her close the fools he said the fools it has been so frightful waiting for you said she leaning her head against him who had to tell you this he demanded i dont know somebody just came and said it this is mean luck he murmured patting her this is mean luck she went on i wanted to run out and find you but i didnt i didnt i stayed quiet in my room till they said you had come back it is mean luck mighty mean he repeated how could you be so long she asked never mind ive got you now it is over anger and sorrow filled him i might have known some fool would tell you he said its all over never mind her arms tightened their hold of him then she let him go what shall we do she said what now now he answered nothing now she looked at him without understanding i know it is a heap worse for you he pursued speaking slowly i knew it would be but it is over she exclaimed again he did not understand her now he kissed her did you think it was over he said simply there is some waiting still before us i wish you did not have to wait alone but it will not be long he was looking down and did not see the happiness grow chilled upon her face and then fade into bewildered fear i did my best he went on i think i did i know i tried i let him say to me before them all what no man has ever said or ever will again i kept thinking hard of you with all my might or i reckon id have killed him right there and i gave him a show to change his mind i gave it to him twice i spoke as quiet as i am speaking to you now but he stood to it and i expect he knows he went too far in the hearing of others to go back on his threat he will have to go on to the finish now the finish she echoed almost voiceless yes he answered very gently her dilated eves were fixed upon him but she could scarce form utterance but you i have got myself ready he said did you think why what did you think she recoiled a step what are you going she put her two hands to her head oh god she almost shrieked you are going he made a step and would have put his arm round her but she backed against the wall staring speechless at him i am not going to let him shoot me he said quietly you mean you mean but you can come away she cried its not too late yet you can take yourself out of his reach everybody knows that you are brave what is he to you you can leave him in this place ill go with you anywhere to any house to the mountains to anywhere away well leave this horrible place together and and oh wont you listen to me she stretched her hands to him wont you listen he took her hands i must stay here her hands clung to his no no no theres something else theres something better than shedding blood in cold blood only think what it means only think of having to remember such a thing why its what they hang people for its murder he dropped her hands dont call it that name he said sternly when there was the choice she exclaimed half to herself like a person stunned and speaking to the air to get ready for it when you have the choice he did the choosing answered the virginian listen to me are you listening he asked for her gaze was dull she nodded i work hyeh i belong hyeh its my life if folks came to think i was a coward who would think you were a coward everybody my friends would be sorry and ashamed and my enemies would walk around saying they had always said so i could not hold up my head again among enemies or friends when it was explained thered be nothing to explain thered just be the fact he was nearly angry there is a higher courage than fear of outside opinion said the new england girl her southern lover looked at her certnly there is thats what im showing in going against yours but if you know that you are brave and if i know that you are brave oh my dear my dear what difference does the world make how much higher courage to go your own course i am goin my own course he broke in cant yu see how it must be about a man its not for their benefit friends or enemies that i have got this thing to do if any man happened to say i was a thief and i heard about it would i let him go on spreadin such a thing of me dont i owe my own honesty something better than that would i sit down in a corner rubbin my honesty and whisperin to it there there i know you aint a thief no seh not a little bit what men say about my nature is not just merely an outside thing for the fact that i let em keep on sayin it is a proof i dont value my nature enough to shield it from their slander and give them their punishment and thats being a poor sort of a jay she had grown very white cant yu see how it must be about a man he repeated i cannot she answered in a voice that scarcely seemed her own if i ought to i cannot to shed blood in cold blood when i heard about that last fall about the killing of those cattle thieves i kept saying to myself he had to do it it was a public duty and lying sleepless i got used to wyoming being different from vermont but this she gave a shudder when i think of tomorrow of you and me and of if you do this there can be no tomorrow for you and me at these words he also turned white do you mean he asked and could go no farther nor could she answer him but turned her head away this would be the end he asked her head faintly moved to signify yes he stood still his hand shaking a little will you look at me and say that he murmured at length she did not move can you do it he said his sweetness made her turn but could not pierce her frozen resolve she gazed at him across the great distance of her despair then it is really so he said her lips tried to form words but failed he looked out of the window and saw nothing but shadow the blue of the mountains was now become a deep purple suddenly his hand closed hard goodby then he said at that word she was at his feet clutching him for my sake she begged him for my sake a tremble passed through his frame she felt his legs shake as she held them and looking up she saw that his eyes were closed with misery then he opened them and in their steady look she read her answer he unclasped her hands from holding him and raised her to her feet i have no right to kiss you any more he said and then before his desire could break him down from this he was gone and she was alone she did not fall or totter but stood motionless and next it seemed a moment and it seemed eternity she heard in the distance a shot and then two shots out of the window she saw people beginning to run at that she turned and fled to her room and flung herself face downward upon the floor trampas had departed into solitude from the saloon leaving behind him his ultimatum his loud and public threat was town knowledge already would very likely be county knowledge tonight riders would take it with them to entertain distant cabins up the river and down the river and by dark the stage would go south with the news of it and the news of its outcome for everything would be over by dark after five years here was the end coming coming before dark trampas had got up this morning with no such thought it seemed very strange to look back upon the morning it lay so distant so irrevocable and he thought of how he had eaten his breakfast how would he eat his supper for supper would come afterward some people were eating theirs now with nothing like this before them his heart ached and grew cold to think of them easy and comfortable with plates and cups of coffee he looked at the mountains and saw the sun above their ridges and the shadow coming from their feet and there close behind him was the morning he could never go back to he could see it clearly his thoughts reached out like arms to touch it once more and be in it again the night that was coming he could not see and his eyes and his thoughts shrank from it he had given his enemy until sundown he could not trace the path which had led him to this he remembered their first meeting five years back in medicine bow and the words which at once began his hate no it was before any words it was the encounter of their eyes for out of the eyes of every stranger looks either a friend or an enemy waiting to be known but how had five years of hate come to play him such a trick suddenly today since last autumn he had meant sometime to get even with this man who seemed to stand at every turn of his crookedness and rob him of his spoils but how had he come to choose such a way of getting even as this face to face he knew many better ways and now his own rash proclamation had trapped him his words were like doors shutting him in to perform his threat to the letter with witnesses at hand to see that he did so trampas looked at the sun and the shadow again he had till sundown the heart inside him was turning it round in this opposite way it was to himself that in his rage he had given this lessening margin of grace but he dared not leave town in all the worlds sight after all the world had heard him even his friends would fall from him after such an act could he the thought actually came to him could he strike before the time set but the thought was useless even if his friends could harbor him after such a deed his enemies would find him and his life would be forfeit to a certainty his own trap was closing upon him he came upon the main street and saw some distance off the virginian standing in talk with the bishop he slunk between two houses and cursed both of them the sight had been good for him bringing some warmth of rage back to his desperate heart and he went into a place and drank some whiskey in your shoes said the barkeeper id be afraid to take so much but the nerves of trampas were almost beyond the reach of intoxication and he swallowed some more and went out again presently he fell in with some of his brothers in cattle stealing and walked along with them for a little well it will not be long now they said to him and he had never heard words so desolate no he made out to say soon now their cheerfulness seemed unearthly to him and his heart almost broke beneath it well have one to your success they suggested so with them he repaired to another place and the sight of a man leaning against the bar made him start so that they noticed him then he saw that the man was a stranger whom he had never laid eyes on till now it looked like shorty he said and could have bitten his tongue off shorty is quiet up in the tetons said a friend you dont want to be thinking about him heres how then they clapped him on the back and he left them he thought of his enemy and his hate beating his rage like a failing horse and treading the courage of his drink across a space he saw wiggin walking with mclean and scipio they were watching the town to see that his friends made no foul play were giving you a clear field said wiggin this race will not be pulled said mclean be with you at the finish said scipio and they passed on they did not seem like real people to him trampas looked at the walls and windows of the houses were they real was he here walking in this street something had changed he looked everywhere and feeling it everywhere wondered what this could be then he knew it was the sun that had gone entirely behind the mountains and he drew out his pistol the virginian for precaution did not walk out of the front door of the hotel he went through back ways and paused once against his breast he felt the wedding ring where he had it suspended by a chain from his neck his hand went up to it and he drew it out and looked at it he took it off the chain and his arm went back to hurl it from him as far as he could but he stopped and kissed it with one sob and thrust it in his pocket then he walked out into the open watching he saw men here and there and they let him pass as before without speaking he saw his three friends and they said no word to him but they turned and followed in his rear at a little distance because it was known that shorty had been found shot from behind the virginian gained a position soon where no one could come at him except from in front and the sight of the mountains was almost more than he could endure because it was there that he had been going tomorrow it is quite a while after sunset he heard himself say a wind seemed to blow his sleeve off his arm and he replied to it and saw trampas pitch forward he saw trampas raise his arm from the ground and fall again and lie there this time still a little smoke was rising from the pistol on the ground and he looked at his own and saw the smoke flowing upward out of it i expect thats all he said aloud but as he came nearer trampas he covered him with his weapon he stopped a moment seeing the hand on the ground move two fingers twitched and then ceased for it was all the virginian stood looking down at trampas both of mine hit he said once more aloud his must have gone mighty close to my arm i told her it would not be me he had scarcely noticed that he was being surrounded and congratulated his hand was being shaken and he saw it was scipio in tears scipios joy made his heart like lead within him he was near telling his friend everything but he did not if anybody wants me about this he said i will be at the hotel wholl want you said scipio three of us saw his gun out and he vented his admiration you were that cool that quick ill see you boys again said the virginian heavily and he walked away scipio looked after him astonished yu might suppose he was in poor luck he said to mclean the virginian walked to the hotel and stood on the threshold of his sweethearts room she had heard his step and was upon her feet her lips were parted and her eyes fixed on him nor did she move or speak yu have to know it said he i have killed trampas oh thank god she said and he found her in his arms long they embraced without speaking and what they whispered then with their kisses matters not thus did her new england conscience battle to the end and in the end capitulate to love and the next day with the bishops blessing and mrs taylors broadest smile and the ring on her finger the virginian departed with his bride into the mountains xxxvi at dunbarton for their first bridal camp he chose an island long weeks beforehand he had thought of this place and set his heart upon it once established in his mind the thought became a picture that he saw waking and sleeping he had stopped at the island many times alone and in all seasons but at this special moment of the year he liked it best often he had added several needless miles to his journey that he might finish the day at this point might catch the trout for his supper beside a certain rock upon its edge and fall asleep hearing the stream on either side of him always for him the first signs that he had gained the true world of the mountains began at the island the first pine trees stood upon it the first white columbine grew in their shade and it seemed to him that he always met here the first of the true mountain air the coolness and the new fragrance below there were only the cottonwoods and the knolls and steep foothills with their sagebrush and the great warm air of the plains here at this altitude came the definite change out of the lower country and its air he would urge his horse upward talking to him aloud and promising fine pasture in a little while then when at length he had ridden abreast of the island pines he would ford to the sheltered circle of his campground throw off the saddle and blanket from the horses hot wet back throw his own clothes off and shouting spring upon the horse bare and with a rope for bridle cross with him to the promised pasture here there was a pause in the mountain steepness a level space of open green with thick grass riding his horse to this he would leap off him and with the flat of his hand give him a blow that cracked sharp in the stillness and sent the horse galloping and gambolling to his nights freedom and while the animal rolled in the grass often his master would roll also and stretch and take the grass in his two hands and so draw his body along limbering his muscles after a long ride then he would slide into the stream below his fishing place where it was deep enough for swimming and cross back to his island and dressing again fit his rod together and begin his casting after the darkness had set in there would follow the lying drowsily with his head upon his saddle the campfire sinking as he watched it and sleep approaching to the murmur of the water on either side of him so many visits to this island had he made and counted so many hours of revery spent in its haunting sweetness that the spot had come to seem his own it belonged to no man for it was deep in the unsurveyed and virgin wilderness neither had he ever made his camp here with any man nor shared with any the intimate delight which the place gave him therefore for many weeks he had planned to bring her here after their wedding upon the day itself and show her and share with her his pines and his fishing rock he would bid her smell the first true breath of the mountains would watch with her the sinking campfire and with her listen to the water as it flowed round the island until this wedding plan it had by no means come home to him how deep a hold upon him the island had taken he knew that he liked to go there and go alone but so little was it his way to scan himself his mind or his feelings unless some action called for it that he first learned his love of the place through his love of her but he told her nothing of it after the thought of taking her there came to him he kept his island as something to let break upon her own eyes lest by looking forward she should look for more than the reality hence as they rode along when the houses of the town were shrunk to dots behind them and they were nearing the gates of the foothills she asked him questions she hoped they would find a camp a long way from the town she could ride as many miles as necessary she was not tired should they not go on until they found a good place far enough within the solitude had he fixed upon any and at the nod and the silence that he gave her for reply she knew that he had thoughts and intentions which she must wait to learn they passed through the gates of the foothills following the stream up among them the outstretching fences and the widely trodden dust were no more now and then they rose again into view of the fields and houses down in the plain below but as the sum of the miles and hours grew they were glad to see the road less worn with travel and the traces of men passing from sight the ploughed and planted country that quilt of manycolored harvests which they had watched yesterday lay in another world from this where they rode now no hand but natures had sown these crops of yellow flowers these willow thickets and tall cottonwoods somewhere in a passage of red rocks the last sign of wagon wheels was lost and after this the trail became a wild mountain trail but it was still the warm air of the plains bearing the sagebrush odor and not the pine that they breathed nor did any forest yet cloak the shapes of the tawny hills among which they were ascending twice the steepness loosened the pack ropes and he jumped down to tighten them lest the horses should get sore backs and twice the stream that they followed went into deep canyons so that for a while they parted from it when they came back to its margin for the second time he bade her notice how its water had become at last wholly clear to her it had seemed clear enough all along even in the plain above the town but now she saw that it flowed lustrously with flashes and she knew the soil had changed to mountain soil lower down the water had carried the slightest cloud of alkali and this had dulled the keen edge of its transparence full solitude was around them now so that their words grew scarce and when they spoke it was with low voices they began to pass nooks and points favorable for camping with wood and water at hand and pasture for the horses more than once as they reached such places she thought he must surely stop but still he rode on in advance of her for the trail was narrow until when she was not thinking of it he drew rein and pointed what she asked timidly the pines he answered she looked and saw the island and the water folding it with ripples and with smooth spaces the sun was throwing upon the pine boughs a light of deepening red gold and the shadow of the fishing rock lay over a little bay of quiet water and sandy shore in this forerunning glow of the sunset the pasture spread like emerald for the dry touch of summer had not yet come near it he pointed upward to the high mountains which they had approached and showed her where the stream led into their first unfoldings tomorrow we shall be among them said he then she murmured to him tonight is here he nodded for answer and she gazed at the island and understood why he had not stopped before nothing they had passed had been so lovely as this place there was room in the trail for them to go side by side and side by side they rode to the ford and crossed driving the packhorses in front of them until they came to the sheltered circle and he helped her down where the soft pine needles lay they felt each other tremble and for a moment she stood hiding her head upon his breast then she looked round at the trees and the shores and the flowing stream and he heard her whispering how beautiful it was i am glad he said still holding her this is how i have dreamed it would happen only it is better than my dreams and when she pressed him in silence he finished i have meant we should see our first sundown here and our first sunrise she wished to help him take the packs from their horses to make the camp together with him to have for her share the building of the fire and the cooking she bade him remember his promise to her that he would teach her how to loop and draw the packropes and the swingropes on the packsaddles and how to pitch a tent why might not the first lesson be now but he told her that this should be fulfilled later this night he was to do all himself and he sent her away until he should have camp ready for them he bade her explore the island or take her horse and ride over to the pasture where she could see the surrounding hills and the circle of seclusion that they made the whole world is far from here he said and so she obeyed him and went away to wander about in their hidingplace nor was she to return he told her until he called her then at once as soon as she was gone he fell to the packs and saddles came off the horses which he turned loose upon the pasture on the main land the tent was unfolded first he had long seen in his mind where it should go and how its white shape would look beneath the green of the encircling pines the ground was level in the spot he had chosen without stones or roots and matted with the fallen needles of the pines if there should come any wind or storm of rain the branches were thick overhead and around them on three sides tall rocks and undergrowth made a barrier he cut the pegs for the tent and the front pole stretching and tightening the rope one end of it pegged down and one round a pine tree when the tightening rope had lifted the canvas to the proper height from the ground he spread and pegged down the sides and back leaving the opening so that they could look out upon the fire and a piece of the stream beyond he cut tufts of young pine and strewed them thickly for a soft floor in the tent and over them spread the buffalo hide and the blankets at the head he placed the neat sack of her belongings for his own he made a shelter with crossed poles and a sheet of canvas beyond the first pines he built the fire where its smoke would float outward from the trees and the tent and near it he stood the cooking things and his provisions and made this first supper ready in the twilight he had brought much with him but for ten minutes he fished catching trout enough when at length she came riding over the stream at his call there was nothing for her to do but sit and eat at the table he had laid they sat together watching the last of the twilight and the gentle oncoming of the dusk the final afterglow of day left the sky and through the purple which followed it came slowly the first stars bright and wide apart they watched the spaces between them fill with more stars while near them the flames and embers of their fire grew brighter then he sent her to the tent while he cleaned the dishes and visited the horses to see that they did not stray from the pasture some while after the darkness was fully come he rejoined her all had been as he had seen it in his thoughts beforehand the pines with the setting sun upon them the sinking campfire and now the sound of the water as it flowed murmuring by the shores of the island the tent opened to the east and from it they watched together their first sunrise in his thoughts he had seen this morning beforehand also the waking the gentle sound of the water murmuring ceaselessly the growing day the vision of the stream the sense that the world was shut away far from them so did it all happen except that he whispered to her againbetter than my dreams they saw the sunlight begin upon a hilltop and presently came the sun itself and lakes of warmth flowed into the air slowly filling the green solitude along the island shores the ripples caught flashes from the sun i am going into the stream he said to her and rising he left her in the tent this was his side of the island he had told her last night the other was hers where he had made a place for her to bathe when he was gone she found it walking through the trees and rocks to the waters edge and so with the island between them the two bathed in the cold stream when he came back he found her already busy at their camp the blue smoke of the fire was floating out from the trees loitering undispersed in the quiet air and she was getting their breakfast she had been able to forestall him because he had delayed long at his dressing not willing to return to her unshaven she looked at his eyes that were clear as the water he had leaped into and at his soft silk neckerchief knotted with care do not let us ever go away from here she cried and ran to him as he camethey sat long together at breakfast breathing the morning breath of the earth that was fragrant with woodland moisture and with the pines after the meal he could not prevent her helping him make everything clean then by all customs of mountain journeys it was time they should break camp and be moving before the heat of the day but first they delayed for no reason save that in these hours they so loved to do nothing and next when with some energy he got upon his feet and declared he must go and drive the horses in she asked why would it not be well for him to fish here that they might be sure of trout at their nooning and though he knew that where they should stop for noon trout would be as sure as here he took this chance for more delay she went with him to his fishing rock and sat watching him the rock was tall higher than his head when he stood it jutted out halfway across the stream and the water flowed round it in quick foam and fell into a pool he caught several fish but the sun was getting high and after a time it was plain the fish had ceased to rise yet still he stood casting in silence while she sat by and watched him across the stream the horses wandered or lay down in their pasture at length he said with half a sigh that perhaps they ought to go ought she repeated softly if we are to get anywhere today he answered need we get anywhere she asked her question sent delight through him like a flood then you do not want to move camp today said he she shook her head at this he laid down his rod and came and sat by her i am very glad we shall not go till tomorrow he murmured not tomorrow she said nor next day nor any day until we must and she stretched her hands out to the island and the stream exclaiming nothing can surpass this he took her in his arms you feel about it the way i do he almost whispered i could not have hoped thered be two of us to care so much presently while they remained without speaking by the pool came a little wild animal swimming round the rock from above it had not seen them nor suspected their presence they held themselves still watching its alert head cross through the waves quickly and come down through the pool and so swim to the other side there it came out on a small stretch of sand turned its gray head and its pointed black nose this way and that never seeing them and then rolled upon its back in the warm dry sand after a minute of rolling it got on its feet again shook its fur and trotted away then the bridegroom husband opened his shy heart deep down i am like that fellow he said dreamily i have often done the same and stretching slowly his arms and legs he lay full length upon his back letting his head rest upon her if i could talk his animal language i could talk to him he pursued and he would say to me come and roll on the sands wheres the use of fretting whats the gain in being a man come roll on the sands with me thats what he would say the virginian paused but he continued the trouble is i am responsible if that could only be forgot forever by you and me again he paused and went on always dreamily often when i have camped here it has made me want to become the ground become the water become the trees mix with the whole thing not know myself from it never unmix again why is that he demanded looking at her what is it you dont know nor i dont i wonder would everybody feel that way here i think not everybody she answered no none except the ones who understand things they cant put words to but you did he put up a hand and touched her softly you understood about this place and thats what makes it makes you and me as we are now better than my dreams and my dreams were pretty good he sighed with supreme quiet and happiness and seemed to stretch his length closer to the earth and so he lay and talked to her as he had never talked to any one not even to himself thus she learned secrets of his heart new to her his visits here what they were to him and why he had chosen it for their bridal camp what i did not know at all he said was the way a man can be pining for for this and never guess what is the matter with him when he had finished talking still he lay extended and serene and she looked down at him and the wonderful change that had come over him like a sunrise was this dreamy boy the man of two days ago it seemed a distance immeasurable yet it was two days only since that wedding eve when she had shrunk from him as he stood fierce and implacable she could look back at that dark hour now although she could not speak of it she had seen destruction like sharp steel glittering in his eyes were these the same eyes was this youth with his black head of hair in her lap the creature with whom men did not trifle whose hand knew how to deal death where had the man melted away to in this boy for as she looked at him he might have been no older than nineteen today not even at their first meeting that night when his freakish spirit was uppermost had he looked so young this change their hours upon the island had wrought filling his face with innocence by and by they made their nooning in the afternoon she would have explored the nearer woods with him or walked up the stream but since this was to be their camp during several days he made it more complete he fashioned a rough bench and a table around their tent he built a tall windbreak for better shelter in case of storm and for the fire he gathered and cut much wood and piled it up so they were provided for and so for six days and nights they stayed finding no day or night long enough once his hedge of boughs did them good service for they had an afternoon of furious storm the wind rocked the pines and ransacked the island the sun went out the black clouds rattled and white bolts of lightning fell close by the shower broke through the pine branches and poured upon the tent but he had removed everything inside from where it could touch the canvas and so lead the water through and the rain ran off into the ditch he had dug round the tent while they sat within looking out upon the bounding floods and the white lightning she saw him glance at her apprehensively and at once she answered his glance i am not afraid she said if a flame should consume us together now what would it matter and so they sat watching the storm till it was over he with his face changed by her to a boys and she leavened with him when at last they were compelled to leave the island or see no more of the mountains it was not a final parting they would come back for the last night before their journey ended furthermore they promised each other like two children to come here every year upon their wedding day and like two children they believed that this would be possible but in after years they did come more than once to keep their wedding day upon the island and upon each new visit were able to say to each other better than our dreams for thirty days by the light of the sun and the campfire light they saw no faces except their own and when they were silent it was all stillness unless the wind passed among the pines or some flowing water was near them sometimes at evening they came upon elk or blacktailed deer feeding out in the high parks of the mountains and once from the edge of some concealing timber he showed her a bear sitting with an old log lifted in its paws she forbade him to kill the bear or any creature that they did not require he took her upward by trail and canyon through the unfooted woods and along dwindling streams to their headwaters lakes lying near the summit of the range full of trout with meadows of long grass and a thousand flowers and above these the pinnacles of rock and snow they made their camps in many places delaying several days here and one night there exploring the high solitudes together and sinking deep in their romance sometimes when he was at work with their horses or intent on casting his brown hackle for a fish she would watch him with eyes that were fuller of love than of understanding perhaps she never came wholly to understand him but in her complete love for him she found enough he loved her with his whole mans power she had listened to him tell her in words of transport i could enjoy dying yet she loved him more than that he had come to her from a smoking pistol able to bid her farewell and she could not let him go at the last whitehot edge of ordeal it was she who renounced and he who had his way nevertheless she found much more than enough in spite of the sigh that now and again breathed through her happiness when she would watch him with eyes fuller of love than of understanding they could not speak of that grim wedding eve for a long while after but the mountains brought them together upon all else in the world and their own lives at the end they loved each other doubly more than at the beginning because of these added confidences which they exchanged and shared it was a new bliss to her to know a mans talk and thoughts to be given so much of him and to him it was a bliss still greater to melt from that reserve his lonely life had bred in him he never would have guessed so much had been stored away in him unexpressed till now they did not want to go to vermont and leave these mountains but the day came when they had to turn their backs upon their dream so they came out into the plains once more well established in their familiarity with only the journey still lying between themselves and bennington if you could she said laughing if only you could ride home like this with monte and my sixshooter he asked to your mother i dont think mother could resist the way you look on a horse but he said it this way shes fearing i will come i have made one discovery she said you are fonder of good clothes than i am he grinned i certnly like em but dont tell my friends they would say it was marriage when you see what i have got for benningtons special benefit you why youll just trust your husband more than ever she undoubtedly did after he had put on one particular suit she arose and kissed him where he stood in it bennington will be sorrowful he said no wildwest show after all and no readymade guy either and he looked at himself in the glass with unbidden pleasure how did you choose that she asked how did you know that homespun was exactly the thing for you why i have been noticing i used to despise an eastern man because his clothes were not western i was very young then or maybe not so very young as very as what you saw i was when you first came to bear creek a western man is a good thing and he generally knows that but he has a heap to learn and he generally dont know that so i took to watching the judges eastern visitors there was that mr ogden especially from new yawk the gentleman that was there the time when i had to sit up all night with the missionary yu know his clothes pleased me best of all fit him so well and nothing flash i got my ideas and when i knew i was going to marry you i sent my measure east and i and the tailor are old enemies now bennington probably was disappointed to see get out of the train merely a tall man with a usual straw hat and scotch homespun suit of a rather better cut than most in bennington this was dull and his conversation when he indulged in any seemed fit to come inside the house mrs flynt took her revenge by sowing broadcast her thankfulness that poor sam bannett had been mollys rejected suitor he had done so much better for himself sam had married a rich miss van scootzer of the second families of troy and with their combined riches this happy couple still inhabit the most expensive residence in hoosic falls but most of bennington soon began to say that molly s cowboy could be invited anywhere and hold his own the time came when they ceased to speak of him as a cowboy and declared that she had shown remarkable sense but this was not quite yet did this bride and groom enjoy their visit to her family well well they did their best everybody did their best even sarah bell she said that she found nothing to object to in the virginian she told molly so her husband sam did better than that he told molly he considered that she was in luck and poor mrs wood sitting on the sofa conversed scrupulously and timidly with her novel soninlaw and said to molly that she was astonished to find him so gentle and he was undoubtedly finelooking yes very handsome she believed that she would grow to like the southern accent oh yes everybody did their best and dear reader if ever it has been your earthly portion to live with a number of people who were all doing their best you do not need me to tell you what a heavenly atmosphere this creates and then the bride and groom went to see the old greataunt over at dunbarton their first arrival the one at bennington had been thus sam bell had met them at the train and mrs wood waiting in her parlor had embraced her daughter and received her soninlaw among them they had managed to make the occasion as completely mournful as any family party can be with the window blinds up and with you present my dear said sam bell to sarah the absence of a coffin was not felt but at dunbarton the affair went off differently the heart of the ancient lady had taught her better things from bennington to dunbarton is the good part of a days journey and they drove up to the gate in the afternoon the greataunt was in her garden picking some august flowers and she called as the carriage stopped bring my nephew here my dear before you go into the house at this molly stepping out of the carriage squeezed her husbands hand i knew that she would be lovely she whispered to him and then she ran to her aunts arms and let him follow he came slowly hat in hand the old lady advanced to meet him trembling a little and holding out her hand to him welcome nephew she said what a tall fellow you are to be sure stand off sir and let me look at you the virginian obeyed blushing from his black hair to his collar then his new relative turned to her niece and gave her a flower put this in his coat my dear she said and i think i understand why you wanted to marry him after this the maid came and showed them to their rooms left alone in her garden the greataunt sank on a bench and sat there for some time for emotion had made her very weak upstairs molly sitting on the virginians knee put the flower in his coat and then laid her head upon his shoulder i didnt know old ladies could be that way he said d yu reckon there are many oh i dont know said the girl im so happy now at tea and during the evening the greataunt carried out her plans still further at first she did the chief part of the talking herself nor did she ask questions about wyoming too soon she reached that in her own way and found out the one thing that she desired to know it was through general stark that she led up to it there he is she said showing the family portrait and a rough time he must have had of it now and then new hampshire was full of fine young men in those days but nowadays most of them have gone away to seek their fortunes in the west do they find them i wonder yes maam all the good ones do but you cannot all be what is the name cattle kings thats having its day maam right now and we are getting ready for the change some of us are and what may be the change and when is it to come when the natural pasture is eaten off he explained i have seen that coming a long while and if the thieves are going to make us drive our stock away well drive it if they dont well have big pastures fenced and hay and shelter ready for winter what well spend in improvements well more than save in wages i am well fixed for the new conditions and then when i took up my land i chose a place where there is coal it will not be long before the new railroad needs that thus the old lady learned more of her nieces husband in one evening than the bennington family had ascertained during his whole sojourn with them for by touching upon wyoming and its future she roused him to talk he found her mind alive to western questions irrigation the indians the forests and so he expanded revealing to her his wide observation and his shrewd intelligence he forgot entirely to be shy she sent molly to bed and kept him talking for an hour then she showed him old things that she was proud of because she said we too had something to do with making our country and now go to molly or youll both think me a tiresome old lady i think he began but was not quite equal to expressing what he thought and suddenly his shyness flooded him again in that case nephew said she im afraid youll have to kiss me good night and so she dismissed him to his wife and to happiness greater than either of them had known since they had left the mountains and come to the east hell do she said to herself nodding their visit to dunbarton was all happiness and reparation for the doleful days at bennington the old lady gave much comfort and advice to her niece in private and when they came to leave she stood at the front door holding both their hands a moment god bless you my dears she told them and when you come next time ill have the nursery ready and so it happened that before she left this world the greataunt was able to hold in her arms the first of their many children judge henry at sunk creek had his wedding present ready his growing affairs in wyoming needed his presence in many places distant from his ranch and he made the virginian his partner when the thieves prevailed at length as they did forcing cattle owners to leave the country or be ruined the virginian had forestalled this crash the herds were driven away to montana then in came the cattle war when after putting their men in office and coming to own some of the newspapers the thieves brought ruin on themselves as well for in a broken country there is nothing left to steal but the railroad came and built a branch to that land of the virginians where the coal was by that time he was an important man with a strong grip on many various enterprises and able to give his wife all and more than she asked or desired sometimes she missed the bear creek days when she and he had ridden together and sometimes she declared that his work would kill him but it does not seem to have done so their eldest boy rides the horse monte and strictly between ourselves i think his father is going to live a long while
