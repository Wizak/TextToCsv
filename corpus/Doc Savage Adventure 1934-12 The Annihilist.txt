 chapter i the popeyed dead john henry cowlton was the first popeyed dead one cowlton was a young man who had inherited money and the newspaper reporters writing his obituary the next morning called him a park avenue playboy cowlton was found in his penthouse gymnasium and because the gym windows were open and it had been a cold night his body was frozen only slightly less hard than a rock there was no mark on john henry cowltons athletic body but there was a very peculiar thing wrong with his eyes john henry cowltons eyes were protruding completely from their sockets and for no good reason that the coroner could find they were quite horrible those eyes everett buckett was the second popeyed dead one they found him in his limousine which he drove himself buckett was a wall street operator whose machinations had sometimes moved others to call him old bucket of blood he was worth upward of forty millions of dollars there was no mark on his body but every one who saw his corpse noted the way the eyes stuck out not only was this horrible to look at but it gave the undertaker considerable trouble of course everett bucketts death was connected with that of john henry cowlton on account of the eyes but the catch was that there was no other connection between the two men as far as any one knew they had not even been acquaintances and certainly no one could connect nutty olsen with everett buckett wall street wolf and john henry cowlton park avenue socialite nutty olsen was the next victim and they found him in his cheap filthy room with his eyes all apop nutty had been in numerous jails and he had a long police record he was known as an utterly bad character it was even suspected that he had murdered his mother because the old lady had once turned him over to the police this had never been proved all of these deaths were in manhattan the next one was in the bronx by this time newspapers had started putting the popeyed deaths on the front page and people who had nothing else to do were wondering if some new and mysterious disease might not have sprung up the bronx victim was a lawyer noted as a very honest man he had a large family they heard him screaming in his room when they reached him he was spread out on the floor with his eyes sticking out the tabloid newspapers began to turn handsprings they ran big headlines and the more timid citizens of new york began to look into mirrors frequently to see if anything was wrong with their eyes the thing was not a joke a fifth and sixth man were found dead one a comfortably fixed insurance man the other a downandout hangeron in a pool hall and their eyes were not pleasant things to look at the seventh was a professor in the citys largest university there was no conceivable connection between any of these men but they all died with their eyes sticking out the police department urged by the mayor sent to chicago for a specialist in strange diseases for none of the victims showed the slightest mark on their bodies the conservative new york papers became as wild as the tabloids they did their best to worry every one certain unnaturally timid persons began to go south to florida earlier than they had intended others went to europe those who had country homes paid them a visit so far it was only the timid who were worried but before long every one was to feel the terror of it they thought it was some new disease they were wrong just how hideously wrong no one had yet realized the secret of the whole thing started coming out after what happened at the association of physical health in the association of physical health there was a frosted glass inneroffice door which bore the legend dr j sultman president behind the door a man yelled hoarsely i wont do it no there were scuffling sounds and a thump as if a chair had been upset rattling of the doorknob indicated some one was trying to get out in the big outer office stenographers stopped typing the flashy blonde on the phone switchboard ceased chewing gum and opened her lips the small man sitting in one of the leather chairs reserved for customers lowered his newspaper against his chest and looked over it then shifted the paper so that his hands were concealed between it and his chest the small man had long oily hair and bleak blue eyes his clothing was extremely conservative let me out of here you damned fiend roared the voice back of the door then the frosted glass panel broke with a jangling explosion the man on the other side was beating it out with his fists and when he had a large opening he threw a lightbrown topcoat over the jagged edges and vaulted through he did not bother to recover his coat but plunged toward the elevators breathing heavily horror on his face the man did not look like one accustomed to violent physical action he was portly with ruddy cheeks and his head was almost bald he had longfingered capable hands which were also unusually smoothskinned the small man with the newspaper stood erect hastily let the paper fall and showed an automatic pistol which it had hidden wait brother he said the portly man looked at the gun veered sharply to the left and slammed himself down in the shelter of a long leather divan help he roared at the top of his voice police help the small mans mouth twisted giving his face a cast of extreme evil he aimed at the divan and began shooting the gun convulsing and jumping with each earshattering report stenographers screamed nurses began running and the blonde telephone girl swallowed her gum and tried to crawl under her switchboard when the small mans automatic was empty he snapped a fresh cartridge clip into the magazine with the skill of an expert gunman then he ran around behind the divan the portly man was a limp heap leaking crimson in several places for the bullets had driven through the leather and upholstery of the divan the small man shot once more deliberately and his victims head jarred as a small blue hole appeared a little above the eyes then the killer ran for the stairway beside the elevators he reached the first stair landing there he stopped began to writhe about and shriek between yells the killer guashed his own lips so that scarlet ran down over his chin and stained his necktie and shirt front he doubled over as best he could stamping his feet slowly then threw back his head when his head was back the strange thing happening to his eyes first became apparent it looked as if something behind the orbs was slowly forcing them out of their sockets the small man fell down on the landing and his gargling noises weakened until before many seconds had passed he was silent he ceased to breathe but his body still retained its grotesquely stiff posture his eyes were all but hanging out of their sockets there was only one flight of stairs to the street and heavy feet pounded these mounting two policemen appeared hands on hip holsters and saw the body of the man on the landing ill be damned gasped one officer impressed by the dead mans popping eyes whatcha know about that the eighth one they went on up the stairs and entered the big reception room of the association of physical health there was much excitement one of the stenographers having fainted the two policemen shouted down every one gave orders that nobody was to leave and one took up a position at the elevators after ascertaining there was no back door the other cop made a brief inspection of the portly man who had been shot to death behind the divan one of the dead mans arms was outfiung and the wrist was encircled by a shiny metal band which the policeman at first mistook for a wrist watch only to learn on closer inspection that it held in place a round metal disk which bore an inscription that read should anything happen to this man notify doc savage hells bells gulped the officer and ran for a telephone the blonde operator was too nervous to put up a connection so the policeman did it himself fumbling clumsily with the board doc savage speaking came over the wire the voice which had answered was one so unusual that the officer was startled into momentary silence there was a remarkable depth and power to the voice a quality of capability which even the shortcomings of telephonic reproduction did not mask theres a man dead here said the policeman on his wrist is an identification tag asking that you be called if anything should happen to him what is the number on the back of the tag doc savage asked the officer went over and examined the tag finding a number he had overlooked the first time then he came back twentythree he said the policeman waited for some comment then a bewildered expression overspread his flushed features he absently put a finger up and rubbed an ear as if that organ were playing him tricks he was hearing one of the strangest sounds ever to come to his attention it was a weird trilling this note having a fantastic rising and falling cadence yet adhering to no definite tune it might have been the product of a faint wind through the cold spiles of an ice field or it might have been the sound of an exotic tropical bird the note ebbed away as mysteriously as it had arisen i shall be there shortly doc savage said and there was no trace of emotion in his unusual voice the policeman hung up and breathed whew something about that guy gets you even over the telephone the other cop who had come over and heard the last of the conversation demanded who is this guy doc savage the first officer looked dumfounded you aint kiddin me oh ive heard gossip about him said the other but nothing first hand whats the dope on him hes probably the most unusual bird alive said the first officer hes the biggest and strongest man you ever saw and hes a whiz he can do anything electricity chemistry engineering he knows all about em all whats his business demanded the other the first policeman shrugged high adventure i guess he likes excitement and he goes around getting people out of trouble but what i mean he tackles things on a big scale he saves thrones for kings and stops wars thats his calibre the cop who was asking questions said he has five birds who help him hasnt he yeah scientists electricians and so on each one of the five is a topnotch specialist in some line the other policeman nodded at the body then at the telephone how come you called him that identification disk i know but thats business for inspector hardboiled humbolt he wont like it your calling this doc savage i dont give a damn said the other officer this doc savage has done more good for the world than any other ten living men you can name yeah any fifty you can name hardboiled humbolt is gonna lay an egg because you called savage grunted the first cop you could call the president and the governor and the marines and hardboiled would still kick he likes to run things let him lay the egg snorted the other policeman they went out to stand guard down in the street the caterwauling of a police siren was becoming louder the roadster had a long wheelbase but it was not flashy and there was nothing particularly outstanding about its appearance only close inspection would have shown that the body was moulded of armor plate and the tires were filled with sponge rubber which would not be affected greatly by bullets the glasswork was also of bulletproof construction and the machine was fitted with apparatus for laying either smoke or gas screens under the hood a siren whined softly it was hard to say whether it was the whining of the siren or the appearance of the remarkable bronze man at the wheel which caused traffic to be parted with alacrity the siren was the type reserved for police squad cars furthermore the license plate consisted simply of three letters and a number doc more than a few persons on the streets recognized the bronze man his picture was often in the newspapers his name was mentioned even more frequently in the prints doc savage some one said and there was a small stampede for the curb to get a glimpse of the bronze man the roadster was a large one a car in which an ordinary large man would have seemed small but the bronze man had the build of a giant even in the open machine tremendous muscular strength was apparent in his cabled hands and in the vertical muscles in his neck which were like hawsers coated with a veneer of bronze this bronze hue was the giants motif throughout his unusually finetextured skin having a metallic hue imparted by long exposure to intense sunlight his hair straight and fitting like a metal skullcap was of a bronze only slightly darker the quiet brown of his business suit added to the symphony in metal perhaps the eyes of the bronze man were the most impressive thing about him they were weird almost fantastic eyes like nothing so much as pools of fine golden flakes continuously stirred by tiny winds in them was a hypnotic compelling quality the bronze man wore no head covering and his eyes roved ceaselessly seeming never to devote attention to the driving but rather to the streets through which the roadster passed in spite of the seeming inattention there was an expert ease about the way he drove he reached the building which housed the association of physical health drew to the curb and switched off the engine little more than the sudden death of the ammeter needle indicated the motor had stopped so silently had it operated the bronze man drifted a metallic musclecabled hand under the dash and touched a switch soft static crackle began coming from a radio loudspeaker he brought a hand microphone to view monk ham he said into the mike a voice that might have belonged to a small child came from the radio speaker were only a few blocks away doc said this small tone ham with you doc questioned the shyster sure hes along watch the outside of the building doc savage directed quietly sure said the childvoiced monk what do you know about this association of physical health it is a concern which makes a business of giving physical examinations the bronze man replied a physician named janko sultman is the president and principal owner monk asked any idea what this means doc none whatever said the bronze giant and switched off the radio transmitterreceiver equipment he could hear the murmur of puzzled voices as soon as he entered the building a police medical examiner was inspecting the body of the man who had died popeyed on the stair landing he bowed with marked deference when he saw doc savage what killed him doc savage queried i havent the slightest idea the medical examiner said promptly it has me stumped but hes like the other seven the bronze man said nothing but knelt beside the dead man his intention obviously being to make an examination there was a pounding of feet on the stairs coming down from the second floor above doc savage did not look around the newcomer was a burly man almost as large as doc savage he had very large feet which were encased in canvas sneakers and he walked as if his feet hurt him his face gave the impression of being composed mostly of jaw he slammed a hand down on doc savages shoulder the hand was red and bony with a skin that looked as tough as rhinoceros hide what the hell you doing he growled get away from that body the beefy man kept his hand on doc savages shoulder as the bronze man stood erect then he shifted his grip to doc savages arm a slightly blank look overspread his bulldog face as he felt the hardness of the arm beneath the next instant blankness became amazement as the bronze man plucked the hand off his arm accomplishing the feat with apparent ease the burly man peered foolishly at his wrist which bore pale grooves where the bronze mans fingers had reposed momentarily he wriggled the fingers and seemed surprised that they functioned then he rumbled angrily shook his arm up and down and a shotfilled leather blackjack dropped into his hand evidently it had hung on a hook or rested in a shallow pocket in his sleeve tough guy huh he growled dont be a fool hardboiled the medical examiner gulped this is doc savage i know who he is hardboiled rumbled hes the guy who goes around mixing in other peoples business and guys who try to buck him have a funny way of disappearin the medical examiner said doc savage has an honorary commission as inspector on the police yeah i know hardboiled growled then he leaned forward and tapped docs chest lightly with the end of his blackjack listen he said i been intending to get around to you only ive been too busy ive beard a lot about you and we know each other by sight you may know im a tough cop thats what the papers call me damn em i know youre the man of mystery and i know people try to kill you and you do things to em and the law never hears about it i dont like it from now on when anybody takes a shot at you you call a cop and hell handle it do it like anybody else does in other words have the police fight my battles doc asked call it what you want hardboiled scowled there laws to take care of crooks and another thing behave yourself and you wont have any battles to fight doc asked dryly you have a faint suspicion i am a crook is that it hardboiled glared when i have suspicions theyre not faint he yelled i come out with em doc said suppose you come out with them now the beefy inspectors leather sap swung for emphasis i think you do things outside the law hardboiled roared that makes you subject to arrest there are laws to punish criminals and dont feed me that hokum about them not being punished in this day because they are let the law take its course doc said no one is disputing that hardboiled put out his jaw ive heard that you set yourself up as judge jury and penitentiary all in one he rapped now that stuff dont go you make one slip and ill clap your pants in the holdover so quick your headll swim if theres any one needs arresting in this town thats my job i do it and i dont stand for anyhody meddling with my job doc murmured without expression very clear hardboiled got his jaw out farther now i want civil answers to plain questions out of you there has been two murders here one of them the eighth in a damned mysterious chain of deaths thats beginning to get everybody all bothered i see doc said go upstairs and take a look at that other body hardboiled directed maybe you can identify it the medical examiner managed to work close to doc savages side as the bronze man mounted the stairs this hardboiled is a character he said he would insult the president hes a leatherskinned cop of the old school and hes been doing wonders at cleaning up manhattan since they put him in charge hes got a phobia for sticking to the letter of the law where police duties are concerned i have been following hardboileds record doc savage said quietly the man is just what manhattan needed the examiner chuckled hardboiled was canned by a previous administration for knocking the mayor down when they got in a quarrel over one of the mayors friends breaking the speed limit hes some character his feet always hurt him maybe thats what makes him so grouchy hardboiled humbolt strode over to the body of the portly bald man who had been shot to death and demanded of doc savage who is he his name the bronze man said was leander court what was his business hardboiled asked he was a scientist and surgeon howd he hook up with you the bronze mans flakegold eyes seemed to acquire strange lights what do you mean how come he was wearing an identification tag asking that you be called if anything happened to him boomed hardboiled that i shall not answer doc savage said hardboiled glared say didnt that lecture i just gave you take effect you cooperate with me or else you get in some trouble he shook his sap down out of his sleeve the medical examiner yelled youre making an unmitigated fool out of yourself hardboiled hardboiled scowled and growled i dont like the methods of doc savage and i dont give a damn who knows it and hes gonna answer my questions theres some motive behind this killing and i want to know what it is i want to know why the other seven were killed i can assure you doc savage told him that i have not the slightest idea why leander court was killed or the other seven either all right snapped hardboiled now why was he wearing that identification disk doc savage ignored the question just exactly what happened here the medical examiner who was embarrassed by the attitude which hardboiled humbolt had taken said the dead man leander court arrived about an hour ago according to the reception girl he said he had an appointment with janko sultman the president of the association of physical health and she directed him to sultmans office he was in there some time then he began yelling stuff about not doing something and demanding to be let out he broke the glass out of the door and climbed through then the man dead on the staircase downstairs shot him when did the man downstairs appear doc savage interjected shortly after leander court arrived said the examiner it looks as if the man followed court here the bronze man nodded then what after he shot court the man fled explained the examiner he ran down the stairs got to the first landing and had some kind of a fit and died thats as near as we can reconstruct it doc savage waved at the office who was leander court yelling at before he broke out of the office that said the medical examiner is a mystery what do you mean there was nobody in the office doc savage swung over to the door and glanced through the jagged aperture where the frosted glass panel had been broken out the office beyond was plainly furnished the opposite wall being perforated with one window and there was certainly no one inside he tried the door it resisted his efforts the lock is peculiar said the examiner it is a spring affair that has to be unlocked from either side with a key doc savage questioned you are sure no one left the office during the excitement they would have had to climb out said the examiner some one would certainly have noticed the bronze man glanced through the door again the window was fitted with a substantial lock and this was fastened no one could have left by that route very mysterious doc savage said not any more mysterious than your not wantin to tell us why leander court wore that identification tag hardboiled humbolt interjected sourly vot tings is happen here a strange voice demanded loudly chapter ii the mystery quest the man who had spoken was a bulky fellow with upstanding frizzled hair and a ludicrously small mustache he wore an exceptionally loud checked suit which however seemed entirely in keeping with his unruly hair you poleezmans vot you do here he demanded then he glimpsed the body of leander court and gulped dot man who shot him hardboiled humbolt shouldered forward and demanded who the heck are you the officer at the elevator called he said he was janko sultman the president of the association of physical health i thought id better let him in doc savage asked abruptly sultman why did leander court come to see you janko sultman looked puzzled he made a tripod of the thumb and two forefingers of one hand then reached up and absently massaged the top of his head leander court he murmured i am sorry genteelmans but dod name i not hear before never ever see him before the bronze man asked and indicated dead leander court sultman shook an emphatic never hardboiled humbolt scowling at doc savage monopolizing the questioning strode forward so that he was between the bronze man and janko sultman the telephone girl says leander court came in and said he had an appointment with you and was to wait in your private office hardboiled rumbled dot mystifies me said sultman der man i have never seen before believe you me hardboiled shifted his sneakerclad feet as if they hurt him and said loudly nobody seems to know a thing around here except you he glared at doc savage the bronze man nodded at the door from which the frosted glass was broken mind if i try something some of this snappy scientific detective stuff i hear youre so good at hardboiled growled something like that doc admitted all right hardboiled told him but before you start lets get one thing straight what youre under technical arrest on a charge of concealing evidence said hardboiled every one except doc savage looked extremely surprised and the bronze man asked quietly just what sort of evidence am i hiding hardboiled jabbed a hand at plump leander courts bulletriddled body why is this guy wearing that identification disk doc savage seeming not to hear the question said lets look over the office where leander court waited hardboiled swore growled youre gonna find im not a healthy guy to kid along big fellow and led the way into the office from which leander court had smashed his way from a pocket doc savage drew a small metal canister which had a perforated top he twisted the lid so that the perforations were open pepperbox fashion next he pulled the shades over the locked window causing gloom to descend upon the room outside it was late afternoon of the first chilly day of fall tilting the container doc savage shook it liquid flame seemed to pour out and settle to the floor rile stuff was a powder which glowed like phosphorus settling upon the floor the stuff ceased to glow except for certain spots which bore the shape of footprints the tracks showed where a man they were unmistakably a mans footprints had come into the office and occupied a chair from the chair they led to a stand which held a telephone and from the telephone back to the door from telephone stand to door they were farther apart as if the man who made them had been running wildly doc savage lifted the telephone receiver listened a moment and replaced it on the hook an outside line which does not go through the switchboard he said that explains it leander court was waiting here when he got a call he became excited cried out and burst open the door in order to get out of the office nuts said hardboiled humbolt no man could be started off yelling by a telephone call doc savage replaced the metal canister in a pocket hardboiled pointed and demanded what is that stuff anyhow a powder which fluoresces or glows when exposed to the air doc savage explained rile slightest disturbance by shifting the particles which compose the powder causes them to expose new surfaces to the air which in turn glow but what made the tracks appear persisted the tough sleuth the weight of leander court as he walked over the rug compressed the fibres doc elaborated those fibres are still straightening although by only microscopic degrees but the movement is enough to disturb the powder causing it to glow and mark the footprints well damn me hardboiled growled i thought they had you overrated there was a spanking sound from the window glass particles geysered like tiny jewels janko sultman president of the association of physical health bawled out loudly and hideously and fell to the floor a wriggling red stream came out of his frizzled hair puddling on the carpet hardboiled humbolt jumped fully a foot in the air roared somebody shot im and ran for the window he banged the panel up leaned out a hand fishing under his coat the gun he brought out was not the regulation service revolver but a leansnoutedcalibre target pistol he balanced this in a hand as his eyes roved the street car going down the street he growled but the shot wasnt fired from the street and the gunman hasnt had time to get to a car what kind of a car is it doc savage questioned gray coupe snapped hardboiled he hauled back out of the window bolstering his unusual weapon and bounded for the door you stay here savage he yelled youre still under arrest hardboiled plunged out through the door taking ungainly leaps as if he were traveling on a hot surface his gait and the canvas sneakers which he wore indicated he must have a bad case of corns doc savage was at the window and he watched steadily for some moments then he backed away stood over janko sultman and looked at the small round hole which the bullet had made in the window it was on a line with the top of the building across the street strange there was no sound of a shot said the medical examiner the bronze giant did not reply but bent over and parted janko sultmans frizzled hair then he slapped sultmans face with sharp stinging force sultman groaned stirred and shortly afterward was sitting up his hands malting aimless gestures his eyes were cloudy boke he mumbled thickly who is boke doc savage asked the cloud went out of janko sultmans eyes and he held his head with both hands joke he groaned i say dot bullet no joke i guess you not understand right why should anybody try to shoot you doc savage asked sharply sultman held his head and wailed i do not know and dot is the truth sure enough doc savage went out into the reception room without saying anything and found fresh excitement had arisen with two of the stenographers screaming hysterically and the blonde telephone girl telling every one loudly that she was through no telling who will get shot next she wailed im through with this place im quitting doc savage went to the elevator and a policeman stopped him saying im sorry hardboiled ordered you kept here the bronze man nodded and roamed with apparent aimlessness over the offices he peered into numerous small rooms where patients were examined passed nurses and physicians without a word down in the street police sirens were wailing doc savage entered a washroom closed the door and opened the tiny window it gave into an air shaft there was no door at the bottom of this and no fire escape the bronze man slid outside negotiating the small aperture with a startling ease had there been a hundred observers fully ninetynine of them would have sworn that not even a cat could climb the sheer wall but the metallic giant went up in uncanny fashion supported by the corded strength of his fingers and the shallow grooves between the bricks reaching the top he traveled over rooftops until he found a skylight below which an artist painted the artist surprised made a long smear on his painting as a giant man of metal smashed the skylight and dropped lightly at his side while the artist stared openmouthed the bronze man walked out coming to life the artist yelled hey ill give you a hundred dollars to pose for me there was no answer and the artist racing out found no one he returned grumbling disgustedly to stare at his picture which was a partially completed study of a herculean male figure supporting a certain wellknown automobile it was an advertising poster what a model that fellow would have made the painter groaned a uniformed patrolman loitered beside doc savages roadster where it was parked in the street his manner showed plainly that he had been posted there to watch the car he twirled his club and walked around and around the machine scrutinizing it closely it had dawned on him that the car was no ordinary stock vehicle from behind him from a door somewhere it seemed a harsh voice called never mind the car go down and help the boys look for that gunman the officer saluted briskly and departed he thought he had recognized the tone as belonging to hardboiled humbolt he rounded a corner took a few paces and came face to face with hardboiled humbolt in person dang it exploded the patrolman howd you get here whatcha mean growled hardboiled the patrolman waved his club you just told me to leave the roadster you were back there somewhere when you called the hell i was hardboiled yelled and ran for the corner sloping around it he drew up and began to swear the roadster was gone you lunk hardboiled accused the policeman i told you to watch that machine but you told me to leave it too declared the cop i did not hardboiled growled are you calling me a liar no said the patrolman prudently i must be crazy a few blocks distant doc savage tooled the roadster through the late afternoon traffic he was a man of a myriad accomplishments this bronze giant among other things he was a skilled voice mimic and ventriloquist it had been a simple matter to imitate hardboileds gruff tone and get the patrolman away from the roadster from time to time the bronze man leaned over and spoke into the radio microphone calling monk ham but getting no answer the apparatus operated on a short wavelength and compact though it was it had power enough to communicate over a number of miles even through the highly unfavorable conditions set up by the towering buildings of the city doc called again monk ham the childlike voice of monk said on deck doc from the loudspeaker did you manage to trail the sniper doc savage asked sure monk answered weve got him spotted hes in a taxicab going down broadway dont lose him doc savage requested the bronze man now wheeled the roadster to the right and shortly afterward was traversing the rich canyon of park avenue passing towering apartment houses which housed more wealthy persons per block than perhaps any other thoroughfare in the world shortly afterward the roadster pulled up before an elaborately modernistic structure situated in the most exclusive section of the avenue two doormen in resplendent uniforms bowed doc savage inside and the bronze man entered a reception room where he was met by an exquisitely gowned redheaded young woman who politely inquired his business i want to speak to pat doc said the titian receptionist was a beauty but she was completely overshadowed by the young woman who soon put in an appearance this young woman was tall had an exquisite form and wore a stunning gown the striking point about her appearance was her wealth of bronze hair it was almost the same hue as doc savages hair she looked very regal in the long trailing gown several males of varying ages waiting in the large sumptuously furnished reception room sighed as they saw the bronzehaired vision hello pat doc savage said pat asked well whos trying to kill you now pat was patricia savage cousin to the man of bronze doc savage pat liked excitement and had long ago sought to join the unusual group of five assistants with which doc savage had surrounded himself doc considering association with himself too dangerous had refused to consider it but the bronze man frequently employed pats aid between adventures pat devoted herself to running this combination beauty parlor and gymnasium which catered to the very rich financially she was very successful want to help me doc asked her that laughed pat is equivalent to an invitation to be shot at stabbed drowned beaten up and no telling what else sure ill help you who are we fighting so far the whole affair is strange doc told her a gunman killed leander court then the gunman had a fit and fell over dead with his eyes protruding the way he died was very mysterious do you know what caused the popeyed death pat asked no doc told her promptly then it must be mysterious pat murmured what am i to do doc savage gave a brief synopsis of all that had occurred janko sultmans business is running the association of physical health he finished i want you to scout around there and see what you can turn up any suggestion about how i am to do it pat asked use your own excellent judgment doc told her but watch out for a tough cop called hardboiled humbolt ive been reading about him in the newspapers pat smiled the new mayor put him in charge of manhattan to clean up they say that this alone was enough to scare half the crooks out of town he must be a ripsnorter he is all of that doc agreed he has already placed me under arrest goodness exploded pat what for he endeavored to bulldoze information out of me doc said dryly unluckily he wanted to know something that could not be divulged what he tried to learn what connection leander court had with myself doc savage said pats features suddenly became grim listen doc do you think some one could be trying its too early to tell the bronze man said and ive got to be moving the armored roadster carried the bronze man south quietly and swiftly he switched on the twoway radio apparatus and monks small voice began coming from the speaker making explanations me and ham were in the street when we heard the noise of a silenced rifle and heard the bullet hit the window monk stated we decided the shot must have come from the roof and we reasoned the gunman would come out in the next block so we barged around there and sure enough a lad pops out hes a thinlooking egg with a face like one of them old salem witches he dived into a cab its him all right hes got his guns in the trombone case where are you now the bronze man inquired monk replied with an address far downtown doc savage angled over to the west side of manhattan island took the elevated express highway which led southward and eventually came out on canal street where there were numberless trucks taxicabs and a few horsedrawn drays an excited squeak monks small voice jumped out of the radio the sniper is gettin out of his hack keep a line on him doc requested ok said monk the bird has gone into a department store across the street sure you can watch all entrances to the store doc asked you bet monks small voice was confident weve got our heap parked close to the corner the guy must have gone into the store to buy something the next few seconds produced no more direct communication although doc savage caught a number of sarcastic exchanges between the smallvoiced monk and his companion ham who had a welldeveloped orators voice the two seemed to be on the verge of a fight doc savage ignored the verbal hostilities monk and ham always seemed on the verge of a fight no one acquainted with the pair could recall one of them having addressed a civil word to the other they squabbled continuously about anything and everything and they were actually friends who would sacrifice everything for each other the bronze man devoted his attention to working through a fleet of drygoods trucks which were evidently bound for retail centers adjacent to new york city unexpected explosive monks small voice croaked out of the radio speaker here you whats the idea a very brittle and totally strange voice said you two mugs have been shaggin the wrong guy doc savage listened intently to the radio speaker but almost at once a loud snap of a sound came from it and after that a shrill oscillating whine a mournful hairraising wall which indicated something had happened to the transmitter in the car occupied by monk and ham chapter iii the boke meeting the gunman was very lean with dreamy blue eyes and an extraordinarily long chin which swung down and out to attain the contour which artists like to give to the features of witch drawings he had used his trombone case to smash in the front of the box which held the transmittingandreceiving apparatus his other hand the left juggled an automatic pistol which seemed composed mostly of barrel monk tolled one eye at the department store across the street and growled howd you get out of there and come up behind us the witchfaced man held his weapon below the level of the door where it was out of sight which was fortunate because many of the pedestrians who passed turned to stare at the coupe and its occupants monk was undoubtedly the magnet which drew their attention monks physical appearance was startling perhaps three out of four citizens who passed were taller than monk but monk weighed in excess of two hundred and fifty pounds was nearly as tall as he was broad and had arms some inches longer than his legs he had a leathery skin furred with hair that looked like coarse rusted steel wool his face was almost incredibly homely the mouth being far too large sap said the gunman that department store has a branch on this side of the street a tunnel under the street connects the two buildings monk blinking his small eyes looked unutterably stupid which showed how deceptive appearances can be for monk under his full name of lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair was known as an industrial chemist whose ability was that of a wizard the man with the automatic looked at the other occupant of the car ham major general theodore marley brooks it was with this name that ham was formally designated looked like a gentleman who might qualify as a perfume salesman or a male clerk in an exclusive feminine shop he was a waspwaisted man with the large mobile mouth of an orator and a pair of brightly intent eyes his garments were sartorial perfection from creased afternoon trousers to gray derby he held a thin plain black cane across his knees ham was also a gentleman who belied his appearance being one of the most astute lawyers ever to acquire an accent and a degree from harvard the witchfaced gunman looking puzzled shook his head slowly but did not divert the menace of his automatic i dont get this he growled are you two guys laws ham said in an aggravating drawling accent really old fellow you do misuse the english language dreadfully horse collar said the man with the gun whyd you two tail me ham began my dear chap then he stopped and watched the other the gunman was wearing a topcoat of some furry gray material and he stepped back burying his gun in a pocket of the coat it was chilly on the street and perfectly natural that a man should keep a hand in a pocket ill let boke talk to you he said lets stagger along huh the homely monk blinked small eyes get a move on advised the other whos boke monk demanded were going for a walk the man said the witchfaced fellow now opened the car door stepping back with it as if performing a polite service but he kept his eyes high watching the faces of monk and ham and their hands when they got out of the coupe he fell in behind them and murmured up the street bokes joint is close they walked several paces the chill fail air pulling breath steam out of their nostrils a few chill particles of snow more like hail than flakes crunched out whitely on the sidewalk monk chin down in his collar as if cold said three loud words in an absolutely unintelligible dialect the gun wielder growled cut it out whatever youre tryin to do then the man gave a mad leap and squawled out in agony and monk moved with a speed which indicated he had expected the happening and had set himself he lunged both big hairy hands cupping down on the pocket which held the witchfaced mans hand and gun reaching their objective monks paws closed wrenched the whole side came out of the mans gray coat they began to fight over the wad of cloth hand and gun the trombone case dropped ham had tucked his black cane under an arm he snatched at it now gave the handle a twist and it pulled apart disclosed that it was a sword cane at the tip and for a few inches back it was coated with a substance which seemed to have a mucilaginous quality ham manipulating the sword cane with an expert ease inserted the daubed tip perhaps a hall inch under the shoulder skin of their foe the results were remarkable the witchfaced man stared turned to see what had pricked him then began to look dazed his endeavors to use the gun in spite of monks restraining clutch became feeble eventually he seemed to go completely asleep and it was only the support of monk and ham which kept him erect at that point there was a series of satisfied grunting sounds at their feet and for the first time the two men looked at the animal which had made the conquest possible this was a pig not bad habeas the pleasantly ugly monk grinned habeas corpus the pig was monks pet habeas was as freakish an example of the porker species as monk was of the human race habeas had the legs of a dog a thin gaunt body and a pair of ears which might have doubled for wings monk expended most of his spare time in training habeas with the result that the pig had some unique capabilities doc savage and his five men when wishing to consult each other in a tongue which eavesdroppers could not understand used the speech of the ancient mayans the civilization which once flourished in central america probably not half a dozen men in the civilized world outside of themselves could speak and understand the language monk had taught habeas to obey commands given in mayan the shoat on the floorboards of the coupe had escaped the witchfaced mans notice and his attack directed by monk in mayan had been a surprise we cant stay here ham said briskly and glared at habeas ham treated the pig with no more civility than he did monk the scuffle brief as it had been had attracted notice causing pedestrians to stop and stare undecided as to what they should do move on ham commanded sharply tills did not secure very pronounced results no policemen were in sight as yet lets get this guy to the coupe monk grunted doc will want to know about this and hell want to look up boke whoever he is when he gets here the two men started for the coupe still supporting their unconscious captive they did not go far there was a flurry on the outskirts of the crowd and a man came plunging through wielding his elbows he was a scrawny man unshaven somewhat shabbily garbed and he peered at monk and ham as if he were very delighted indeed to see them youre cops he gulped excitedly i know youre cops sure you made a swell pinch when you got this guy monk squinted small eyes at him ham opened his orators mouth to say something but the newcomer spouted on without pause come on he snapped this mug has been up to some funny business i want to show you what i accidentally saw in his room he wheeled off and monk and ham vastly surprised tramped along after him the cold snow making gritting noises underfoot and the heels of their unconscious captive dragging along with a series of raspings the stranger had picked up the trombone case they came to a doorway and the guide muttered its in here i was waitin for im to come back when i saw you put the hand on monk stopped suddenly you were waiting here he pointed at the door yes said the unkempt man monk pointed at the snow particles which did not lie on the sidewalk in sufficient depth to hold footsteps but which had drifted into the doorway in a shallow cold bank that was unbroken by tracks or other marks which certainly would have been made by the door opening youre a liar monk said a poor one too the shabby stranger coughed as if he were cold and under cover of the convulsion his hands made a bewilderingly swift gesture and were suddenly holding a pistol im good enough to get by he said the crowd as curious persons will had followed the little cavalcade wondering what it was all about and possessed of a morbid desire to see what would happen they had not followed quite fast enough however for any one to be near enough to catch exactly what passed between monk ham and the stranger three men burly fellows swathed in mufflers now detached themselves from the crowd and turned upon it hardfaced and belligerent of manner here beat it one of them said and his words threw small puffs of steam into the frosty air gwan you dont live here were cops the crowd melted sheeplike as city crowds will do in the face of authority monk said something in the strange not unmusical mayan dialect and the pig habeas corpus spun and raced down the street feet making clickings and scratchings the man with the gun growled you say another word i cant understand and itll be just too damn bad the men who had turned the crowd back now joined the fellow with the gun and they themselves produced weapons inside one said you know by now that we saw you playing games with our pal here and come down to invite you in where its warm he picked up the trombone case some one laughed and snow rasped as monk and ham mounted still carrying the man who had been made unconscious by hams sword cane in the door they looked at each other then let their burden fall heavily pick im up they were ordered they complied with the command and marched into a passage which seemed colder than the street outside while guns menaced them hands searched them the casual thoroughness of the search showed that these men knew the spots where weapons were carried monk and ham each wore in an expertly padded holster a firearm which resembled an oversized automatic pistol these had curled magazines intricate mechanisms fine workmanship damn me one man said softly first rods i ever saw like these another man looked at the guns hells bells his face blanched his hands shook a little the others eyed him and one demanded why the chalk and shiver the excited man tapped one weapon doc savage he said listen some one rapped whats this ive read about these only doc savages men carry them theyre supermachine pistols the bronze guy himself invented them there was nothing more said for some seconds one man took out a cigarette put it between his lips then took it away from his mouth and mashed it up between slowmoving fingers another man breathing heavily went back to the door and looked out lets go talk to boke some one rapped i dont like the way this damned thing is shaping up the witchfaced man reviving from the stupefying effects of the chemical on the end of hams sword cane began to squirm and moan ham and monk stood him on his feet but his legs refused to support him and bowed letting him down facefirst to the floor saliva came from his mouth and puddled on the grimy cold carpet monk kicked him the impact rolled the man half over cut it snarled one of the others the witchfaced man reached back and rubbed the spot where he had been kicked then rolled over and jacked himself up by the strength of his arms slowly he raised himself erect the kick was what be needed monk said gloomily one of the men scowled at monk then at ham and said walk ahead of us and be sure you got a will all made out before you squawk or make a jump the man with the face of a harridan weaved toward the back door saying ive got plenty to tell boke the hallway gave into a cementfloored courtyard which smelled of cold garbage a cat the sole living thing in sight hackled its back and slunk among garbage cans crossing the court the cavalcade entered a hallway where the air was too hot and mounted stairs and opened a door warm tobaccoladen air gushed out a fireplace made fitful red light in the room beyond the place was windowless it whitened up blindingly when some one thumbed an electric switch monk and ham were forced to stand with their faces jammed in comers not unlike schoolboys receiving punishment they were warned not to turn around and monk disobeying was knocked rubberkneed with a slender stick of stovewood from the fuel rack beside the fireplace some one said i wonder what happened to that hog hell with the hog another snorted hey boke things have been happening one of the most pleasant voices monk and ham had ever heard said that is to be regretted monk and ham both turned their heads the speaker was not in the room just where the voice was coming from they could not tell for the menace of a clubbing forced them to face into the corners again the spokesman began we were all watching the back way just in case something might turn up and we saw let frightful tell it directed the mysterious amiable voice monk snorted loudly suddenly realizing that frightful was the nickname of the witchfaced man frightful listlessness in his voice showing the effects of the drug on the sword cane said i followed your orders boke bokes voice asked pleasantly what do you mean i plugged janko sultman in the head said frightful you coldblooded devil exploded the pleasantvoiced boke dont be so definite about such a hideous thing it gets on my nerves the witchfaced frightful seemed accustomed to this squeamishness on the part of his chief for he went on rapidly i wanta tell you about a strange thing i saw when i posted myself on the roof he said i could see into janko sultmans office but sultman wasnt there the office was empty but after while a guy come in who dyou think it was instead of answering as expected bokes remarkably suave voice said hollowly i would give my right arm if it had not been necessary to eliminate sultman a murder horrible frightful said leander coust came into suitmans office while i was watching bokes voice yelling suddenly demanded who leander court frightful repeated patiently he sat around in the office by himself until the telephone rang and he answered it what he heard must have made him excited he threw the phone down and broke the glass out of the office door and crawled through the door must have had a trick lock it has said pleasantvoiced boke then what happened some guy in the reception room up and fills leander court full of bullets i could see that then the guy ran for the stairs after that something mustve happened to the guy because i heard some bellowing and a lot of cops came and i heard one of em say something about the guy being dead with his eyes sticking out with what demanded boke his eyes sticking out like youve been reading about in the papers it is all very clear to me except that last said boke puzzlement in his amiable tone janko sultman had doublecrossed us as we already knew and had an appointment with leander court he must have put his proposition up to court over the telephone or perhaps he had already advanced his proposal and court had come to give his answer court refused and tried to flee and the gunman was one who had been posted by janko sultman to kill court in case the latter was stubborn or threatened to go to doc savage yes all is very clear but what happened to the gunman are you sure that his eyes popped out im only tellin you what i overheard frightful grumbled baffling said boke i cannot understand it monk turned his head in another effort to learn where the voice of boke was coming from and one of the guards slugged the homely chemist knocking him against the wall monk lashed back with an astounding speed and the assailant staggered away his jaw possessed of a slightly different shape than it had had a moment before pistol muzzles forced monk back into his corner and made him face the wall where did these two men come from asked bokes mysterious voice they got on my trail somehow snarled frightful theyre two of doc savages men theyre who boke sounded as if he had swallowed something painful doc savages men frightful repeated then looked very uneasy and the others registered concern also when bokes unique tone sounded again worry had gone from it and he laughed it was only a matter of days anyway he said or perhaps of hours we would have had to fight doc savage eventually over this affair you all know that frightful made a wry face i havent been looking forward to it hold these two prisoners boke ordered then get hold of leander courts partner you know who i mean yeah frightful nodded robert lerrey exactly said boke arrange an appointment for me with robert lorrey we must whip things up before doc savage gets a line on what it is all about and do not make the mistake of underrating this man savage he is assuredly clever a man began dont worry chief i dont think any of this crowd underrates that bronze he did not finish and his eyes flew roundly open and his jaw sagged enough to pull his lips apart so that his teeth showed they were not nice teeth being veined up and down and stained so that they resembled chips from an old bone which had lain a long time in the weather the man reached up and felt of his ears as if he suspected them of tricks for there was a strange trilling loose in the room chapter iv more popeyed the trilling sound low and fantastic was quite musical yet it was so without adhering to any definite tune nor could the exact nature of the sound the sonic embodiment of the thing itself be described it was something that defied nomenclature something infinitely etheric yet also very real for it was at times quite loud and again it sank into virtual inaudibility monk and ham turned slowly in the corners eyes alert muscles tensing they knew this weird trilling it was the sound of doc savage a small and unconscious thing which the giant of bronze did in moments of stress hey monk howled suddenly and pointed at the ceiling look for cryin out loud almost all eyes went to the ceiling monk was an actor when he wanted to be but two or three were not misled by the ruse and it was they who saw the door snap open to let in a herculean metal figure who in passing through all but filled the aperture talk about the devil a man roared and raced a hand for his gun pocket doc savage came toward him with the speed of light spurted from a bronzetinted lens and stopped he stood frozen then he began to back away monk and ham stared puzzled not comprehending why the bronze man had hesitated nor able to remember a time when he had done so in the past the man got his gun out weaved a bit on his feet as if his leg muscles were unsteady and took aim only then did doc savage flash in but it seemed too late the gun was a revolver and the trigger finger was already tightening the way doc savage giant of metal reached the gunman and seized the weapon was something monk and ham always remembered they had seen the bronze giant move swiftly before but never with quite this unearthly speed and when the man of bronze stepped back they saw why he had at first hesitated to attack the wouldbe killer the mans eyes were popping when he had lost his gun the man staggered a pace after doc savage then brought up and swung a hand foolishly against his own face he felt of his own eyes almost out of their sockets in a manner that was hideous to watch for it was apparent that the fellow could no longer see then he began to shriek and bend and unbend himself in convulsions of frightful agony he fell upon the floor spread himself out and his clenched fists beat the rough carpet until the skin was barked off then another man began to shriek to paw at his face to flail his arms as if fighting an unseen hideous harpy a third joined the unearthly chorus and a fourth then others until the room was a bedlam with bodies threshing about and shrieks that split the ears a man fell headlong into the fireplace and the flames consumed his hair with a malodorous swoosh and his flesh began to sizzle while he screeched as if trying to empty himself of all that nature had put within him monk ran over seized upon the mans heels and dragged him out still howling the only cooling agent at hand seemed to be a bottle of pale amber wine and monk poured that upon the victim but the fellow continued to thresh dying within a few moments monk backed away horror on his homely face monk was hard men had tried to kill him and he had seen hideous things happen to human bodies but now his nerves became as old strings cold water seemed to wash through his veins and his big mouth felt tongueless he realized almost suddenly that it was quiet in the room of fantastic death with bodies twisted horrors on the floor and with only doc savage ham and himself erect monk tried three times before he could speak what in blazes happened he mumbled when monk got no answer he looked at doc savage after which his own feeling of amazement increased a bit if such were possible for there was stark bewilderment on doc savages regular metallic features and doc savage rarely showed emotion you dont know what it was monk asked haltingly the bronze man shook a slow negative i only know that it was one of the most hideous mysterious things i have ever seen happen every one of them died but us every one in the room but us ham said and looked steadily at the ceiling as if to avoid the bodies on the floor how do you explain that monk stepping high over corpses announced im gettin out of here the damn thing that killed em may have another try at us doc savage shook his head again half in negations half in puzzlement if it had been gas it would have killed us he said there was no sound no firing of hidden darts and if they had been poisoned impossible no poison would have affected them all at once a death ray of some kind maybe ham muttered you dope monk told him unkindly a death ray would have gotten us too doc savage rapped just before i came another man was talking a man they addressed as boke where was he monk waved his arms danged if i know that was queer too his voice was plain but he wasnt in here this boke he was their chief doc asked ham answered that righto and the beggar seemed to think he had been doublecrossed by janko sultman he ordered sultman shot ham eyed the contorted body of frightful the witchfaced one who reposed at his feet quite dead i heard most of it doc savage said the pig habeas corpus was down in the street when i got there and it was easy to tell from the tracks what had happened i came in right behind you it would seem wheres habeas now monk demanded downstairs doc advised ham waved his sword cane which he had retrieved from where one of their late unfortunate captors had placed it but what killed these men he demanded doc savage hazarded slowly the same thing which killed the murderer of leander court i think we can be assured of that but what was it ham persisted believe me i was never before so much at a loss for an explanation of a happening doc savage said quietly which makes it a real mystery monk grumbled we will look around doc savage said we may find something that will help they began to search ham as if he had thought of something interjected you beard this mysterious boke say he was going to talk to robert lorrey yes doc agreed we will look into that also monk growled do you reckon this has got something to do with our upstate some one might be listening doc said sharply monk fell silent for there was one subject which doc savage and his men did not discuss publicly that was the matter of their unique college in the remote wooded mountains of upstate new york as far as they knew none beyond those immediately concerned knew of that college those concerned being doc savage his five aides pat savage and the attendants in the institution itself the students who enrolled in that college and later were graduated did not even know its whereabouts for the students entered unwillingly usually under the affects of a stuporinducing drug when they left after graduation they were also drugged the students were criminals and the college was a fantastic place which turned them into honest men whether they wished it or not the world did not know about the place the world would probably have been shocked in charge of the criminalcuring institution was a man named robert lorrey a scientific surgeon of fabulous skill whom doc savage himself had trained what robert lorrey did to the criminals that made them honest men was known only to himself and to his chief assistant at the institution or rather the man who had been his chief assistant leander court the man shot down in cold blood in the reception room of the association of physical health what he did had to do with intricate surgery chemical rehabilitation and there was also a long course of training doc savage of course knew when criminals emerged from doc savages unique university they did not remember their pasts for some strange reason they hated crime in any form and they had been taught a trade wherewith to make an honest living had the existence of this place become known it would have been a newspaper story unparalleled doc savage also knew it would excite many misguided reformers who would stir up government investigations for the criminals had no choice about taking the treatment doc savage in the final analysis was a private individual and such are not supposed to mete out their own brand of justice the courts are for that and doc savage had never sent a crook before an american court if news of his college got out there would be all kinds of trouble he well knew and for that reason he had refused to tell the twofisted tough guy cop hardboiled humbolt of murdered leander courts connection with himself and it was to keep news of the institution from leaking out that the bronze man now requested monk not to speak of it what monk was wondering was perfectly plain anyway was the college in some way connected with this fantastic affair monk growled what i want to know is where that guy boke was he wasnt in this room ill swear to that i dang near got my head caved in lookin for im ham said unkindly no such luck and added what do you say we try some of the other rooms they tried some of the other rooms all of them in fact and found them an unsavory collection of dungeons unfurnished for the most part with those that were equipped fitted up with shoddy stuff looks kinda like a temporary hangout monk decided they had found no one no sign of the nebulous boke the man with the voice that was so utterly pleasant the rendezvous had they discovered a galaxy of entrances several buildings on both sides of the cheap block had been rented it seemed and connecting doors cut through them they went through the whole maze the process requiring the better part of an hour but found no sign of boke doc savage himself searched the roof which was cold and bare being without a coping so that the chill wind whooped across it without interruption doc savage stood for a time on the roof apparently unaffected by the cold close to where the smoke poured from a chimney that led to the fireplace in the death room below then he went down to the macabre chamber itself the bronze man began sounding the walls the room it was plain had once been much longer but had been shut off by two partitions these were thin and constructed of a wallboard with a paper exterior a moment later his fist in pumping against the panels went through blazes monk snorted there is where the guy was speaking from he was in the next room and that paper was what made his voice sound a little queer i did notice that his voice was muffled ham admitted but it was such a pleasant voice that the muffled quality almost escaped my attention that monk said explains part of the mystery doc savage moved toward the door we had better go talk to robert lorrey he declared he is at the where he works and we can get him by shortwave radio telephone as for boke he must have been unaffected by whatever killed those men he made his getaway during the excitement have you any idea what caused the deaths monk asked bluntly doc savage seemed to become inexplicably deaf and not to hear a fact which caused monk to grin widely because he knew from past events that it was a good sign when doc began keeping his own counsel doc rarely expressed a theory which he could not prove absolutely but if he had no theory and was completely mystified he would say so hence docs assumed deafness conveyed to monk that the bronze man did have an idea about the strange boke going downstairs they found habeas corpus there shivering it was near dusk with the streets almost deserted the uproar in the house as the men died so weirdly and so awfully apparently had not carried to the street thanks in part to the first gale of fall which had whipped itself up to quite a frenzy driving the hard snow with the force of cold bullets the bronze man drove his open roadster seeming not to feel the cold monk and ham followed in their coupe the windows up the heater on to its fullest they had resumed their interminable quarrel the present point of dissent being monks driving they headed directly for the middle of central park the most open space that the metropolis offered where conditions were best for radio transmission and reception doc savage tuned in and called over the shortwave set and monk and ham tuned in on their apparatus listening eventually doc got the upstate college robert lorrey he requested who the distant voice that of an attendant at the institution seemed surprised two days ago you telegraphed robert lorrey to take his vacation i telegraphed him doc savage asked slowly why yes at least the message had your name signed to it said the distant voice robert lorrey left this morning did he say where he was going to spend his vacation the bronze man demanded no said the attendant your message told him not to communicate with you so that he would have a completely uninterrupted rest doc savages lips did not move but there was not silence in the roadster for the bronze mans fantastic trilling sound came into being persisted a moment then ebbed away and what about leander court doc asked why a telegram from you gave him his vacation four days earlier advised the attendant i trust there is nothing wrong doc savage countered with another question is everything all right around there yes of course double the guards the bronze man directed go over the electrical alarm system and the sonic amplifier listening posts to see that they have not been tampered with yes sir agreed the attendant then something is wrong i am afraid so doc told him what is it that is impossible to say as yet this terminated the radiotelephonic hookup monk and ham got out of their coupe shivered in the chill air and came over you beard it doc asked them ham nodded soberly and ran his sword cane through gloved fingers did you telegraph a vacation to either leander court or robert lorrey he asked no doc savage said as doc savage drove out of the park and downtown he and his companions could not help but note the attitude with which the stories of the popeyed deaths were being received by the public newsboys ran along the streets screaming headlines concerning the passing of leander court and they did a surprising business housewives ran out to purchase papers groups of persons stood in front of cigar stores and under street lamps in spite of the cold in pausing for a traffic light they could hear a man speaking in a nearby car its something like the influenza epidemic only worse he was saying i tell you im right mark my words in a few days therell be thousands dying women kids and men theyll all die i know what im talking about ive already sent my family out of town said another man in the car im taking a train tonight said the other its the only thing to do i know what im talking about i tell you these poor devils who stay behind may catch that damned disease that kills you with your eyes sticking out its a risk too much of a risk for me i can see whats coming driving onward doc savage stopped at his headquarters on the eightysixth floor of a skyscraper which was one of the most impressive in the city the bronze mans establishment there consisted of an outer office plainly and expensively furnished a library containing one of the most complete assortments of scientific volumes in existence and a laboratory fitted with every modern device as well as a great amount of apparatus which was the bronze mans own invention what next monk wanted to know he and ham having followed doc renny doc replied he is in town and will want in on this he was consulting on an engineering job this afternoon and i failed to locate him when the call came about leander court monk nodded comprehending renny colonel john renwick was another member of doc savages group of five unusual aides renny was noted for two things his tremendous fists and his ability as an engineer he had a face peculiar for the expression it wore renny always looked as if he were going to the funeral of a very close friend renny also had two loves he liked excitement and it was his boast that he could smash the panel out of the strongest wooden door built with a single blow of his incredible fists doc savage made several telephone calls but was unable to locate the bigfisted renny the bronze man then went to the large office window and with a bit of peculiar looking substance wrote rapidly on the glass nothing appeared after he had written the unusual chalk he had employed left a mark which could not be seen except with the aid of an ultraviolet lantern under these invisible rays the stuff would fluoresce or glow appearing in an eerie electric blue renny when he reached the headquarters would use an ultraviolet projector a small one which reposed in the desk to examine the window it was docs custom to leave messages thus two other members of doc savages group of five were not at present in new york long tom roberts the electrical wizard was in chicago attending an exposition of electrical inventions in which he had exhibits johnny william harper littlejohn archaeologist and geologist was filling the chair of natural science research at a famous university during the illness of a professor who regularly occupied that position now what persisted monk then he suddenly slapped a hand on his knee a feat which he could accomplish without bending in the slightest say i just thought of a way that we can maybe locate robert lorrey through his brother sidney doc queried monk looked crestfallen so you thought of that yes said doc well try sidney lorrey now chapter v the hand of sultman robert and sidney lorrey were twin brothers and twinlike had the same interests and dislikes and it was not strange that they should both have become scientists robert had long ago associated himself with doc savage in a position which paid him more money perhaps than he could have made at any other profession the other twin sidney had a laboratory in new york city and spent his time there experimenting and inventing both brothers were graduate surgeons and doctors robert practiced what he knew sidney on the other hand was the creative member of the pair his prize invention was an apparatus which produced the same emanations as radium without radiums terrific expense aithough he did not yet have this device refined where it could be used as a commercial proposition he believed his device would be an inestimable boon in treating cancer and other diseases sidney lorreys laboratory was on a barge which was moored to a longdisused pier in the east river doc savages party approaching the barge inspected it closely for lights the craft was long shabbylooking blunt at the ends and in the middle where the cargo pit would ordinarily have been there was a long neat white deck house nowhere did a light show they could hear the low whine of electrical apparatus the three men paused to study the craft and because it was cold habeas corpus the pig planted himself against hams neatly pressed trousers to get the benefit of whatever warmth there was in the dapper lawyers ankles ham struck fiercely at the shoat with his sword cane the pig accustomed to such moves got clear one of these days i shall make breakfast bacon out of that hog ham promised grimly you try it and therell just be a grease spot where you stood monk told him with equal grimness they advanced and observed that the tide was going out noisily causing a grinding of fenders and a creaking of hawsers upstream as the tide ran now a low log of a boat was anchored the smell coming from it indicating it to be a gasoline barge doc savage led the way aboard sidney lorreys barge glanced about and rapped on the door the panel was of steel and his knuckles drummed hollowly against it there was no answer they went to the windows found them barred heavily and threw flashlights inside the whine was louder probably has to keep things fastened up on account of sneak thieves monk hazarded that whine must be one of his devices the probing flashlight beams picked up chemical paraphernalia inside the barge laboratory together with the coils and tubes of electrical devices as well as tools and workbenches bally lot of equipment he has ham remarked no one home obviously doc savage said we will leave a note on the door and try to telephone him later the bronze man wrote briefly on a bit of paper and was wedging it in a crack of the barge door with a match stick when monk barked hey lookit upstream a man had appeared he seemed to be in an intoxicated condition for he weaved along the bulkhead stumbling and staggering reaching the edge he leaned over groggily and peered at the water below get back you numbskull monk bellowed small voice suddenly tremendous youll fall in the man looked up at the sound of monks voice the effort seemed to overbalance him his arms cartwheeled and he toppled into the cold black race below blast it monk gritted of all nights to have to jump into the river after some lug he started for the water wrenching long arms out of his coat then doc savages flashlight beam dived past him roved the water briefly and the bronze mans forceful clutch fell on his shoulder dont dive in doc warned monk gulped but that fool will drown take a look at the water doc advised monk peered down for the love of mud he muttered the water where the flashlight beam fell upon gave back all the colors of the rainbow in a convulsing eerie fashion it was as if pigment of many colors had been spread on the boiling surface of the tide rip gasoline doc savage said shortly that fellow must have opened a dump valve in the gas boat over there monk yelled a trap and ham echoed he thought some of us would jump in and swim toward him then somebody would set fire to the gasoline on top of the water doc savage whipped for the heavy gangplank that led from the barge to the shore down in the water the splashing man suddenly shed his clumsiness he stroked furiously reached the bulkhead and grabbed a rope which was almost indistinguishable in the darkness but which he must have lowered previously he climbed with frenzied haste nearing the top the fellow snaked a hand into his coat for a gun then kept one finger hooked through the trigger guard as he continued to climb he kept his face upturned a head its bronze color discernible even in the gloom appeared above the man on the rope reversed his gun swiftly and fired he saw the bronze head plainly the instant before the lash of flame from the gun muzzle blotted it out afterward the head was gone confident he had killed the bronze man the fellow on the rope jerked himself up to the bulkhead edge elbowed over and looked for his victim he swore there was no one distinguishable amazement held the wouldbe killer for a moment he was positive his bullet had not missed he did not believe any one could have gotten out of the path of the slug so swiftly grunting with the effort he hauled himself up on the bulkhead took a tentative pace away from the river his gun ready off to the left there was a single firecracker pop of a noise the man with the gun cursed bopped on one leg then tried to run but negotiated only a few paces before he floundered down his legs still beat the ground after he lay prone as if he were trying to continue running monk got up from behind an old timber waving his supermachine pistol which he had taken from his former captives in the strange room of death downtown you got an antidote for the chemical in the mercy bullets these guns shoot he demanded of doc savage in the car the bronze man said and glided for his roadster doc savage came back shortly with a hypodermic needle the contents of which he administered to the victim monk stood expectantly in the background the supermachine pistols were charged not with regulation bullets but with shells which bore a chemical that produced a harmless unconsciousness and the stuff doc was giving the victim was a stimulant which would revive him quickly the manner of the wouldbe killers reviving was a bit queer his legs had gradually ceased to make their running movements but now they resumed and the churning became more violent until the fellow grunted loudly opened his eyes and tried to get up monk turned him over and sat on the pit of his stomach youre in a spot sonny monk advised him the sonny was sarcasm for the man was past middle age he had however a face of consummate evil his mouth was warped from a perpetual snarl and his eyes were narrow furtive the man growled thickly aw i just fell in you cannot lie out of it doc savage told him but you can help your own position by talking the evilfaced man scowled at the bronze giant then looked away and his face convulsed as he wet his lips i dunno nothin he disclaimed monk saying nothing reached out a hairy arm to a pile of rusted scrap iron which lay on the bulkhead he selected a heavy gear wheel pulled it to hurt wrenched off the victims belt and began strapping the weight to the fellows ankle cut it out gritted the other you cant do that you know who we are monk asked him the other wet his lips once more sure doc savage and two of his gang ever hear what happens to crooks who get in our way monk demanded fiercely the old man snarled you aint runnin no shandy on me listen monk said patiently i asked you if you ever heard what happens to crooks who tangle up with us no the captive tried to kick the heavy gear off his ankle they disappear monk leered they aint never heard from again thats what happens to guys who mix with us youve heard that story aint you the terrified roll of the prisoners eyes showed that he had heard of the legend that those who opposed doc savage met some fantastic fate and were never seen again by their former associates this was the story the underworld bandied for none knew of doc savages strange college for curing criminals youre another one thats not gonna be heard from said monk the homely chemist was bluffing but nothing on his simian features revealed that the captive broke suddenly listen he exploded i hadda do it i needed the money im an old man and things are tough for me i got a bad record and nobodyll give me work who hired you doc savage asked sharply monk began untying the heavy flywheel to encourage their source of information a guy named sultman janko sultman gulped the elderly thug blazes said monk are you sure it wasnt a bird with a nice voice named boke sultman was his name the other insisted he told me to watch this barge here and if you birds showed up to pull that fallingintotheriver gag i was gonna he hesitated and then stopped speaking i know monk told him sourly you was gonna set the gasoline afire after one of us jumped in what is sultmans game i dont know insisted the old man he didnt spill that part he come here lookin for robert lorrey but there wasnt nobody on the barge and he left me here to tell im if robert lorrey came back an to well if you guys showed up you know no more than that doc savage asked thats all monk said fiercely cough up the truth mug or ill bust you wide open the old crook began cursing a harsh voice said all right you clever boys will all put your hands up ham drifted a hand for the armpit where reposed his supermachine pistol laden with mercy bullets careful doc warned its our friend hardboiled humbolt hardboiled came out of the shadows a belligerent tower of gristle who walked gingerly favoring his sore feet his hands were empty behind him strode uniformed policemen who carried submachine guns riot shotguns and tear gas paraphernalia hardboiled leveled an arm at doc savage i put you under arrest once today whats the idea think i was kidding you monk said mildly tough guys are my meat and got off the aged criminal he went toward hardboiled humbolt and when he was very close to the giant officer things happened monk lashed out a fist that landed with a sound akin to a woodsmans axe sinking into a tree monk looked confident that hardboiled would go down but nothing of the sort happened hardboiled did tremble and weave on his feet then his arm shook and the blackjack came down out of his sleeve there was a swishing sound monk ducked but not in time the homely chemist sat down heavily wearing a dazed expression and feeling of the top of his head where the sap had landed ham laughed unkindly habeas corpus made a staccato grunting outburst and ran at hardboiled humbolt the policeman kicked at the shoat but he must have been halfunconscious from the effects of monks blow because he lost his balance and fell heavily the pig rushed him again showing long yellow tusks monk said hoarsely cut it out habeas that guy is really hard and the pig backed away again the elderly crook got up and tried to run a policeman tripped him and put a foot on the back of his neck not at all gently i know this old punk said the cop hes a rat from way back hardboiled humbolt still sitting on the cold ground waved his blackjack at doc savage at monk at ham run em in he directed i warned this bronze guy ham the lawyer drew himself up and snapped my roughmannered friend men are not arrested in these good united states unless there is a charge against em hardboiled finished for him and you can bet your pretty striped pants that there is a charge against all three of you it is suspicion of murder ham said ridiculous as if it were a swear word hardboiled humbolt reciting as if he were in school said over half a dozen men were found a short time ago dead in a downtown house their eyes were all protruding witnesses were found who saw you three men leave the house a scowl wrinkled high on hams forehead better not start anything you cant finish mister tough policeman we got a call hardboiled elaborated it said to go to this house and we would find a crowd of men you had murdered doc savage put into the conversation for the first time with the demand who was the informant didnt give his name said hardboiled but it was a damned pleasant voice to listen to boke monk growled what demanded hardboiled fooey on you monk told him the elderly thug on the ground with the cops foot on his neck abruptly seized the policemans other foot with his hands and yanked spilling the officer the lawman swore and the submachine gun he was carrying bounced out of his hands the aged criminal seized it startled policemen tried to get their weapons into action but they were too late and they stared aghast as the machine gun fanned them menacingly the ancient crook started to back away escape his main thought then another idea seemed to seize him and he paused stepped sidewise and was sheltered behind a rusting lump of abandoned machinery damn you all he gritted ive always wanted to slough me a bunch of cops he braced the submachine gun more firmly i told you he was a rat choked one of the policemen hes a crazy killer they all expected the rapidfirer to blare out but instead it was the old mans voice which tore a guttural shriek and he came staggering and moaning from the shelter he had dropped his gun his eyes were popping in a fashion ghastly to observe to doc savage monk and ham who had seen what happened in the death room downtown what occurred now was not new but to the policeman it was a sight they were to carry always the old criminal was a victim of the popeyed death and he shrieked and bit his lips until they ran scarlet then he fell down with convulsions and finally kicked his life away hardboiled humbolt squirmed his feet in his oversize sneakers and wet his lips his hands made the small aimless gestures of a man who does not know what to do and he breathed heavily he was the picture of a phlegmatic soul startled out of his wits the homely monk getting slowly to his feet a hand still up where hardboileds blackjack had landed moved close to doc we gonna let this cop throw us into the can he demanded in a whisper hardboiled humbolt snapped off his lethargy came over and clipped no talking between you three monk glared at him and demanded you mean were really pinched and how the burly officer said with gusto for once some of you privileged boys in this town are going to take whats coming to you ham asked did you stop to think think what hardboiled looked puzzled that doc savage here may not be in the same class with the rest of these people you call privileged ham elaborated the persons you are down on are those with socalled pull politicians and playboys and so on now doc here is going to jail hardboiled finished i dont give a damn if hes the governor of the state in disguise and you you fashionplate lawyer are going along its an outrage said ham its murder hardboiled waved at the dead man damned mysterious murder and i think you birds know more than youre telling doc savage said half a dozen words in the guttural mayan language here ripped hardboiled speak english monk and ham drew air into their lungs then ceased to breathe doc savage did likewise then the bronze man without the gesture seeming to mean anything pressed an elbow tightly to his side hardboiled frowned his suspicions half aroused and the frown was still on his leathery forehead when he drew in a great sobbing breath of air bent over and peered at the ground as if searching for a suitable resting spot then laid himself down heavily he began to snore a cop exploded say what the then he too dropped other policemen around him toppled over none of them moved after they fell and all breathed noisily regularly in the mysterious stupor which had seized upon them only a few snored monk asked any danger of em freezing doc savage said no theyll wake up in half an hour doc savage monk and ham departed the spot monk and ham made no comment about what had happened it was old stuff to them long ago doc savage had perfected a gas odorless and colorless which produced a quick temporary unconsciousness and left no harmful aftereffects the unique thing about this gas was that it became ineffective after somewhat less than a minute given a warning one could evade the gas by holding his breath the substance extremely powerful was carried in small glass bulbs and the bronze man had broken one of these with elbow pressure the three men approached their cars the pig habeas corpus had not been close enough to be affected by the anaesthetic and he now galloped up monk muttered i cant stop thinkin how those men died with their eyes popping ham who still clung to his sword cane said what about that janko sultman we know he is mixed up in it why dont we get on his neck and make him talk pat is working on that doc told him something may turn up at the association of physical health chapter vi pat hits a snag something had turned up at the association of physical health at least the elevator boy after his passenger had alighted twisted his lip distastefully and said over his shoulder now aint that something the something was a lissome young man in evening clothes he had remarkably fragile features and a rose petal skin there was a gardenia in his lapel the aroma of mimosa about him the newcomer went directly to the receptionisttelephone girls desk the blonde was no longer there a rather dowdy looking girl who wore glasses had taken her place i wish to see seco nandez he advised who is calling asked the standardized receptionist tell nandez it is a gentleman sent by j s he directed the information was apparently effective because the young man was directed toward a door which bore the legend senor seco nandez md chief of medical staff entering the effeminate young man shut the door carefully at his back took out a handkerchief and wiped his finger prints off the knob as if it were a habit he had opened the door by a shove without touching the knob on the other side hyah nannie he smiled seco nandez scowled at the flippancy he was a tall reedy dark man who wore a rather light suit for so late in the fall the pallor of the suit emphasized the darkness of seco nandez and his large eyes and thick lips lent a suspicion that some of his ancestors had come from africa why do you come here lizzie he demanded eso es muy mall whats that last demanded the young man addressed as lizzie it is dangerous snapped seco nandez putting his spanish into english sultman sent me said lizzie nandez spread his hands but why he not come himself senor trouble with his feet said lizzie nandez scowled his puzzlement you mean the fallen arches like that so very tough cop hardboiled humbolt i did not know sultman had such trouble its the cold grinned lizzie not his arches a hot bath is good for that nandez said seriously lizzie laughed sarcastically its right over your head isnt it nannie you no savvy well a hot bath wont help this kid of cold feet what do you mean senor nandez questioned sharply sultmans feet began to cool off when doc savage barged in here this afternoon lizzie explained the temperature took another big drop when that bullet bounced off sultmans fuzzy head boke was responsible for that shooting and sultman knows it nandez nodded slowly si si this thing she is getting very dangerous you knew it would get dangerous when you started it lizzie snorted nandez groaned it would not had we but done what boke hired us to do and let it go at that but no when sultman learned what boke planned he decided to get in ahead of boke and put the plan through himself lizzie laughed again his face his body were both fragile looking but there was a hard recklessness in his manner dont let it get to your feet he advised hell theres more money than any of us ever saw in this thing boke expected to clean up a billion i think he was a piker nandez frowned at his manicured dark fingers do not worry about what you call my feet swell said lizzie now i came to tell you to meet sultman were taking cover from now on see nandez waved an arm hut what about the association of physical health sultman is just walking off and leaving it lizzie grinned the damned place aint making money anyhow where is sultman asked nandez the usual place advised the other lizzie went to the door took out his handkerchief and dropped it over the doorknob before he turned it he waved his free hand airily keep your chin up nannie nandez snapped stop calling me that name i do not like it theres a lot of things youd like less lizzie grinned and went out lizzie smiled widely and winked at the little receptionist as he went out he swung girlishly into the elevator and the cage sank the receptionist at the telephone switchboard came to life open before her lay a stenographic notebook its pages covered with expert shorthand pen strokes translated these shorthand notes would give an exact record of what had been said between lizzie and nandez the unimpressive young woman removed the telephone headset instead of having a single receiver as was customary this headset was double and the extra receiver was connected to a circuit of concealed microphones which had been planted in the offices early in the evening during the time the others were dining the association of physical health which gained its revenue from the mere giving of physical examinations remained open regularly in the evenings to accommodate office workers and those who could not come during daylight hours the plainlooking receptionist smiled widely and put the notebook in a hand bag which also held a weapon which resembled an oversized automatic two extra curled magazines for the gun a fountain pen teargas gun and a compact then the young woman busied herself at the switchboard at that point seco nandez came out of his office he had donned his hat and overcoat and seemed bound on a definite errand as he took the elevator the receptionist motioned to a nurse said take my place please and hurried away before the nurse could open her mouth the young woman ran down the stairs past where the gunman had been seized with the weird popeyed death earlier in the day and into the lobby she ran behind the cigar counter and exchanged her colorless and rather threadbare coat for an exquisite affair of fur she kicked off her fiatheeled conservative shoes and donned a pair with high heels then added a small metallic hat to the outfit she used lipstick and rouge expertly she peeled off a wig of duncolored hair which she was wearing and replaced it with one of metallic blondness the young womans own hair it could be observedwas a remarkable bronze hue the result of her changes was something of a miracle the young woman who walked out of the building on the trail of seco nandez was a ravishing beauty even her carriage was different the high heels making her look inches taller if seco nandez or lizzie had met her face to face it was doubtful if they would have recognized her a close acquaintance however might have recognized the young woman as patricia savage seco nandez moving along the gloomy streets bending over against the pluck of the cold fall wind looked back numerous times but thanks to pats skill noticed nothing unusual or if he did observe anything he gave no sign his route took him to the east where the streets became narrow and dark and full of smells and the small drifts of hard white snow snuggled in bunches behind obstructions seemed strangely out of place amid the grime and squalor there were few persons abroad which made pats job of trailing much simpler she did not follow abreast of nandez but paralleled his course on the next street watching for him at intersections there finally came a time when he did not appear at a corner pat hurried down the side street her coat collar was upturned her head down apparently in defense against the chill wind but actually to watch the sidewalk the hard snow almost like ice pellets had not covered the walk but it had eddied into doorways and stoops seco nandez had turned into a shabby building which was reached by half a dozen stone steps deeply pitted pat went up the steps boldly found the door unlocked and eased inside listening she detected voices muttering from above one of the speakers was seco nandez listen chief nandez was saying youve got to give me time this fellow sultman is too slice we cant hang the goods on him all at once pat heard the words distinctly but the reply was a monotonous mutter which she could neither understand nor identify the first thing weve got to do seco nandez continued is to find where sultman is hiding i think i know ill go there then make a report this information gave pat savage a surprise was it possible that she had uncovered a minor doublecross among the ranks of the schemers was nandez on the side of sultman or aiding the mysterious boke the unintelligible mutter was replying to nandez lets not talk so loud senor said nandez after that the voice dropped to complete inaudibility and pat disgusted mounted the stairs cautiously in order to get nearer and hear better at the top she found a long corridor which ended it seemed in another stairway leading downward to a back door it was very dark the passage being unlighted and pat felt along with her hands she located a door she could hear no speaking beyond the door she leaned an ear against the ancient planks as if that were a signal motion exploded in the darkness beside her hands seized her throat and her hair yanked forcibly and unbalanced her before she could do a thing about it she was slammed heavily on the floor seco nandez gripping her fiercely said you fall for the trick like the ton of bricks senorita pat knew the man with whom she fought was her master in physical strength so instead of wrestling with him she kicked his shins with the sharp toes of her slippers hit him on the windpipe which happens to be a particularly vulnerable pant of the human anatomy and gave one of his ears a terrific twist finally she managed to execute an ancient and effective bit of roughandtumble strategy she inserted her little finger in seco nandezs left nostril and lifted nandez moaned his moan became a howl and he floundered in his haste to get erect and away from the torturing finger he jumped back slapping his aching proboscis hissing expletives in spanish pat did not try to get erect but rolled over grabbed her purse and tore it open the supermachine pistol fell out nandez leaped forward and kicked at the gun he missed pat tried to thumb the safety off nandez kicked again and missed a second time then pat did get the safety off and the gun began to moan like a big buiffiddle and spew empties but the slugs going past nandez tore plaster off the walls pat corrected her aim once more nandez kicked he was in time the heavy weapon caromed from wall to floor and pat groaned and snapped her bruised fingers as nandez fell upon her she dived her left hand into the purse and got the teargas gun nandez must have made the mistake of thinking there would be no other weapon in the bag pat jammed the gun into his face shut her eyes held her breath and pulled the trigger the fountainpenlike barrel made considerable noise and kicked heavily for the muzzle was against nandezs skin nandez began to cry out and roll on the floor and pat gaining her feet with her eyes still closed ran for the door she missed the aperture smacked a wall fell over a chair keeping her eyes shut all of the time and not breathing then found the door and went through she narrowly missed falling head over heels down the stairs and not until she was near the bottom did she open her eyes she popped outside only to have a hand clamp her arm not so fast sister said the voice of the feminine mannered lizzie pat stood perfectly still for there was a flat automatic in lizzies other hand and the hard bravado of a killer in his strange limpid eyes good thing i shagged along behind nannie lizzie said dryly whatd you do to him let me go pat snapped sure said lizzie and released her arm then so suddenly that pat had no time to dodge lizzie struck her with the automatic he hit with blinding speed and accurately with the manner of a man who had done the thing before pats head filled with a roaring scarlet curtains fell and rolled before her eyes and black masses came up and danced on the curtains after that there was a singing sound as of millions of grasshoppers traveling which resolved into pulsations that in turn became the banging of her pulse ml the time she was conscious of being handled and when she opened her eyes she was upstairs and on the floor bound and gagged seco nandez was erect before her speaking his feelings slowly and painfully not using particularly vile spanish words but putting a great deal of emphasis upon them the left side of his face was not pleasant to look at for the teargas gun had blown a rather nasty pit it was still running a little red and his eyes were streaming tears that mixed and thinned the scarlet fluid it was obvious that nandez could not yet see perhaps ten minutes passed lizzie spending the interim in going over the contents of pats hand bag and in inspecting the supermachine pistol nandez mopped at his face and finally began to see a little he snarled when he saw pat and grabbed the supermachine pistol from lizzie here hell lizzie barked and they struggled over the gun nandez grating i shall kill her for what she do to me senor use your head lizzie snapped nandez continued struggling managed to get the gun tried to shoot pat and the safety baffled him he cursed and hurled the weapon with great violence at her head his aim was very bad the gun hit the wall bounced and came to rest so close that pat instantly rolled in a furious effort to reach it lizzie ran over put his foot on her and held her stationary what a doll he grinned at pat where do you hook into this so that she could answer he removed the gag pat said i dont know what this is all about i came into this building to see a friend and as i was walking down the corridor that man she jerked her head at nandez that man seized me beautiful said lizzie an excellent lie a gorgeous lie youre doc savages cousin and you bribed that dizzy blonde at the association of physical health to let you take her place ive read of you sister youre supposed to be good and i guess you really are nandez had sobered this senorita she is connected with doc savage be demanded she is said lizzie and that makes it bad howd you come to pull in here this isnt sutlmans hangout i saw her trailing me said nandez lizzie put weight on the foot which bore on pats back how much have you learned goodlooking nothing said pat thats probably a lie but its swell lizzie grinned he looked at nandez you want the job nannie yes said nandez and i do not like that nickname senor lizzie laughed and went out pat knew they must have agreed on her fate during the black period when she had been stunned from the blow on the head nandez drew out a pocketknife not a large knife but one with a blade which looked razor sharp lizzie appearing in the door suddenly said better wait until that face stops bleeding youd make a hell of a spectacle on the street now si growled nandez lizzie turning said watch the finger prints nannie and departed once more nandez scowled at the door for a time then noting that his features no longer oozed scarlet got to his feet holding the knife lightly between his fingers he advanced with the quick purpose of a man who intended to get it over with pat suddenly frozen with horror tried to scream but the effort was pitifully inadequate a small whining no one can hear that said nandez and bent down chapter vii surprise shadow nandez was wrong in surmising no one would hear the screams lizzie heard them but lizzie was across the street and he was listening for them the shrill piping cries that came from the old building might have been the product of the icy fall wind but not so the cries which suddenly followed screams broke out awful penetrating bleats full of the grisly qualityof death the damned girl should have been gagged lizzie gritted he started to cross the street then he shrank back a policeman had appeared a big burly cop bundled to his red ears in his winter overcoat he had heard the shrieks and was running he popped into the building the shrieks had ceased lizzie swore savagely and dragged out his gun damn all cops he snarled and whipped across the street he did not enter but paused outside listening there was a chance that nandez had fled by the back route lizzie heard the policeman swear in a loud startled voice then feet banged on the stairs lizzie retreated hurriedly and was concealed in a nearby doorway before the officer appeared the cop did not look around which surprised lizzie as well as relieved him no little the officer ran for a corner and lizzie craning his neck saw the man using a call box frantically nandez got away lizzie grinned and used his ears again once he thought he heard movement from the rear of the building a squeaking sound as of rubber pressing hard against iron or concrete or it might have been a foot on a board nandez lizzie breathed and himself eased away from the vicinity lizzie walked hurriedly eastward until he came to a street where despite the cold of the fall night a few persons were abroad and an occasional taxi prowled even then he did not take a cab because drivers have memories he mingled with the crowd and drifted to the nearest subway as far as he could tell he was not followed back in the street the policeman had deserted his call box he strode to the building and went inside only to reappear shortly mopping his forehead a strange expression on his features he waited consulting his watch a faint squealing noise arose in the distance loudened and became the wail of a siren the car a big phaeton careened into the street and screamed its tires on the pavement as it came to a stop in the rear of the phaeton hardboiled humbolt kicked a robe from around his big stockinged feet grimaced as he drew on his canvas sneakers and got out muttering its gettin damned cold for these canvas shoes the patrolman ran up he jerked a thumb over his shoulder shouted its in there hardboiled put a jaw out against the cold gale dead dead as can be said the patrolman its awful so is about half of this police business hardboiled growled and went inside and up the creaking stairs he said nothing more but took a flashlight from his pocket and went into the room he ranged the flash beam for some seconds over the chamber but giving most of the time to the corpse on the floor the cadaver was a gruesome sight stepping back hardboiled picked up a hand bag he looked inside there were cards in a pocket they bore the name of patricia savage the name of her beauty parlor and gymnasium on park avenue and the address pat savage hardboiled muttered shes doc savages cousin helps him out sometimes on his jobs said the patrolman or so ive beard she was a lot of help here hardboiled said grimly the burly police inspector took another turn of the room using his flashlight then shook his head and walked out and down the stairs it gets me he said slowly i cant make heads or tails of this whole mess send for the medical examiner he walked to the phaeton paused and added and spread the net for doc savage put every radio car in the city to looking for him that bronze guy knows something hes not telling the patrolman took up a position in the corridor he had found the lights and he turned them on now the light seemed to relieve his mind once he thought he heard a sound from within the room where the body lay and he opened the door but saw no one after that he closed the door as if to keep the grisly presence from within out of his thoughts the door had not been closed for long when the window lifted slightly it was the first rise of the window which had attracted the officers attention a great shadowy figure eased into the room a flashlight beam no larger than a pencil came into being and raced about resting finally on the body and roaming over it slowly the body was twisted as if it had fallen in the throes of awful agony the face was pocked deeply on one side by a bum and the lips were bitten and redstained the eyes were barely in their sockets having squeezed out as if propelled by some inner force the muscles attached to them were gray and horrible the giant prowler bent over the form and a hand roved exploring pockets once the hand got in the way of the thin light beam and it could be seen that the skin was an unusual bronze color and the hands had tremendous tendons letters yielded seco nandezs name next the bronze man examined the purse of patricia savage where it had been replaced on the floor there was no sound audible as the metallic giant went to the window eased through and put his weight on the fire escape outside he went down to the landing grasped a silken cord which was attached to a collapsible grappling book and slid down into the alley below a flip of the cord brought the grapple down and the bronze man stowed it within his clothing he joined two figures waiting silently in the darkness monk with the pig habeas corpus silent under an arm asked what did you find doc a popeyed dead man named seco nandez doc savage said and pats purse was near by strange murmured the dapper ham something has happened here from the nearby darkness pats voice stated you said it monk started all but dropping habeas and ham instinctively whipped up his sword cane doc savage showed no perceptible surprise patricia savage came from the gloom i have been hanging around she said i had an idea you would show up here were in bad with the police monk told her but we had our radio tuned on the police radio station and heard the call which brought hardboiled humbolt here we dropped in to see what it was all about doc savage asked what happened pat pat was a young woman of crisp explanations there was no tremble no excitement in her voice as she summarized what had happened from the time she had overheard the conversation of seco nandez and lizzie at the association of physical health she brought the narrative down to its gory climax this nandez was just leaning over to use his knife she said he was a killer who enjoyed it i could see that in his eyes he held my nose to stop what little noise i was able to make and bent my head back then something happened the popeyed death doc asked he began to scream pat said her voice suddenly thin and his eyes they it was awful we seen it happen to a whole roomful of men at once monk muttered ham clicked his sword cane nervously doc this thing is incredible he snapped it is as if some supernatural power were striking down these men in the act of doing murder what do you think the popeyed death is monk added and what makes it get em only when theyre about to kill somebody or right after theyve killed there was a long pause while they waited for doc savage to make an answer and when he did not and gave no sign of intending to do so pat broke the tension i used nandezs knife and cut myself loose after he died she said i got to the rear stairway and ran down it not knowing but that nandezs partner lizzie might come back and you waited here ham finished hold on said pat i want to tell you about something queer that happened down here in the alley what doc questioned some one came out maybe it was the policeman looking around doc offered pat shook a vehement negative no it was a giant figure of a man a fellow i will swear was almost as large as you doc and he moved like a ghost he came down the fire escape down the fire escape monk grunted exactly said pat it looked as if he had been outside of the window all of the time you did not see him clearly doc questioned too dark said pat and be traveled like a black ghost monk snorted suddenly did you hear his feet on the fire escape i mean did they make squeaking sounds why now that you mention it i think they did pat murmured ham growled what are you getting at you homely monkey doc savage answered that monk was thinking of canvassoled rubber shoes the bronze man said rubber squeaks sometimes when it is rubbed over iron ham began but what then fell silent he had thought of hardboiled humbolt and his rubbersoled canvas shoes some moments later doc savage monk ham and pat were in a sedan traveling a nearby street we dropped in at headquarters and exchanged the roadster and the coupe for this bus monk explained the cops were looking for the other two cars and saw a flock of policemen watching the place for us ham added pat watched the darkened houses slip by and shivered the police are against us she said softly one of our men has been murdered and we cant find robert lorrey and some infernal death is striking this is more than i bargained for want to lay off doc asked youd better dont be silly said pat what do we do next since our headquarters are watched we will make use of rennys apartment doc said colonel john renwick the engineer of docs group was a gentleman who had made some millions in his profession prior to his affiliation with high adventure in the person of the bronze man he still commanded staggering fees when he worked renny occupied a penthouse overlooking central park the building one of the most flamboyant in the city was one renny had designed and the erection of which he had supervised and his apartment was an incredible array of modernistic metals and glass mechanical gadgets were everywhere and the wide glasscovered terrace was a greenhouse of tropical shrubs renny they found on arrival was not present doc had a key and they entered wonder whats become of renny monk pondered reckon the bigfisted lummox got that message you left on the office window doc savage neglected to answer for he was picking up a telephone he got in communication with each of the citys large broadcasting stations in succession and spoke rapidly hanging up after communicating with the first one he went over and switched on a large modernistic radio a dance orchestra was playing and the tone of rennys radio speaker was an acoustic engineers dream come to life but almost at once the strains were interrupted an announcement of importance said the announcer will no get in touch with his chief and will no guard his own life carefully and communicate with no one but his chief for no s benefit leander court was murdered today the orchestra strains resumed and doc savage tuned in on another station and shortly got almost the identical announcement no was robert lorrey the number he bore on doc savages pay roll the fact that the bronze man had been able to prevail upon every broadcasting station to insert such an unusual announcement in the regular evening routine was an indication of his influence i hope monk said that robert lorrey turns up before long chapter viii the crime gland at the precise instant but quite a few blocks distant from rennys sumptuous penthouse the lissome and femininemannered lizzie was listening to a worried voice come from an adjacent room i hope robert lorrey shows up soon it said lizzie shrugged he had changed his evening garb for full dress perfect in its every detail and he had even less the appearance of a coldblooded criminal who not long before had left a companion to cut the throat of a young woman janko sultman was walking circles in the next room he still wore his loudchecked suit and there was a bandage stuck in the midst of his upstanding frizzled hair with adhesive tape from time to time he fingered this bandage dot boke he growled if der bullet had come another inch lower it would have meant finish for me lizzie carefully adjusted the hang of the bright chain which spanned the front of his waistcoat give me a line on this boke and ill soon stop him he said lazily janko sultman waved plump hands its a swell idea only its no good why not i do not know dot boke by sight or where to find him the hell you dont lizzie snorted then how did you contact him in the first place through a witchfaced feller dot was called frightful explained sultman they had figured dot because i was a doctor i should be able to get a line on doc savages place where he fixed up der crooks but this frightful did all der talking not once did i see boke i hear him over der telephone though and he have the sweetest voice you ever listen to hes got sweet ways too grinned lizzie casting a glance at sultmans bandaged head and the gay frightful was found dead in that roomful of men who had their eyes popping the newspapers are full of it dots another thing sultman wailed the eyepopping business what is it she gets my goat a man appeared at the door and said robert and sidney lorrey calling janko sultman looked very pained and swore dot fool brought his brother lizzie asked well theyve been going around together since you kindly gave robert his vacation then lizzie laughed i wonder if doc savage has found out about those faked telegrams yet sultman waved his arms damn it weve got to get rid of sidney i cannot buy them both lizzie grinned leave it to me and started for the door sultman gulped listen what give me five minutes lizzie requested ill fix it then he went out janko sultman hastily summoned three men into the room they were smoothlooking gentlemen who might have been bank clerks reporting for a days work except that each had a submachine gun tucked under an arm robert lorrey will be here soon janko sultman said he cannot afford to take any chances one of the smoothlooking men nodded you think he may jump you he asked not so much dot said sultman but when he learns why he has been summoned here he may fly off der handle as did leander court and threaten to go to doc savage he must be prevented from doing dot sure said one of the men only i hope we dont get the same dose as the guy you posted to get leander court if he went up in the air that bird died with his eyes sticking out dont be silly sultman snapped there is no one around here who can touch you the gunman dot shot court merely had some kind of a spasm how about the whole roomful of popeyed dead the papers are playing up then countered the other let it go sultman groaned hurry i will hide you the room was paneled with wood there were many pictures all of excellent taste sultman crossed the deep carpet a grotesque figure with his frizzled hair and opened a wall panel there was a recess behind large enough to hold a man and a lookout standing within could peer into the room through an ingenious colored screen which was a part of a picture fastened on the outside one of the men with machine guns was posted inside there proved to be two more niches and additional guards were posted in these dot is good sultman decided the three gunmen looking through loopholes had only to move their heads to get a full view of the room the picture was fairly distinct although colors were distorted by the pigment of the screen through which they had to peer a few seconds later janko sultman was shaking hands with a lean stoopshouldered man and the latter was admitting yes i am robert lorrey robert lorrey was an extremely plain man as far as outward appearances went he had mousecolored hair and eyes which were pale but which were also made slightly grotesque by the powerful lenses of the spectacles which he wore pressing would have helped his gray suit and he was bundled to the ears in a fuzzy woolen muffler this is my brother sidney said robert lorrey ah yes said sultman lying smoothly some one told me you had a brother twins arent you this last was a rank guess on the frizzledhaired mans part for sidney was a smaller carbon copy of his brother although he did have an unnaturally high forehead in addition it was possible that sidney looked a bit more the idealist the dreamer we are twins robert agreed i hope you do not mind my bringing sidney along we are very fond of each other and we frequently cooperate in conducting experiments as a matter of fact my brother has financed most of my experiments said sidney you are welcome of course janko sultman lied the telephone rang sultman looked surprised went over to the instrument and answered he was not a very good actor for he failed to keep pleasure off his features for sidney lorrey he said sidney lorrey spoke for a few minutes over the line and there was a puzzled expression on his features as he put the instrument down i shall have to go he said some one wants to speak to me he says it is very important sidney lorrey took his departure janko sultman now became the perfect host offering robert lorrey fine cigars and excellent liquor both of which the stoopshouldered mouselike man turned down explaining that he did not imbibe the result of doc savages training eh murmured sultman dryly the bronze man is quite a puritan ive heard robert lorrey became very quiet in his chair he plucked at the ends of his burry muffler you have evidently made a mistake he said shortly i scarcely know this doc savage if i am to presume that when you say doc savage you mean the remarkable bronze man who has become noted as a man who gets others out of trouble janko sultman laughed dere is no use of pretending between friends i scarcely know you robert lorrey pointed out sultman pretended not to hear the last reminder i know many things he smiled i know for instance dot doc savage is a man who does peculiar things one of the most peculiar of these things perhaps is his habit of sending criminals whom he catches to a weird institution which he maintains in upstate new york robert lorrey said sharply if you assume i know all of this you are wrong the criminals undergo a treatment which causes them to lose their memories and to become honest men continued sultman strange as it sounds dot is what happens i do not care to bear more about this snapped robert lorrey the whole thing sounds ridiculous janko sultman carefully adjusted the bandage on top of his head then lighted himself a cigar at the same time never taking his eyes from his visitor doc savage has seized many criminals during his career sultman went on this savage is a remarkable individual more remarkable than most persons can realize he is almost a mental freak his knowledge in der fields of electricity chemistry and engineering and so on is profound but greatest of all is his skill as a surgeon lorrey moistened his lips why are you telling me this janko sultman seemed not to hear doc savage has discovered dot crime is in a sense a disease he went on in other words we will take for der purpose of illustration de effect of ordinary inflammation on tonsils if a man has infected tonsils a toxic poison gradually filters from them through his system and his nerves are affected so dot he becomes irritable he gets der jitters he is hard to get along with you do not need to be so elementary snapped robert lorrey sure sultman smiled there are many glands in the human body they secrete everything from perspiration to digestive juices many of them are in the human brain and it is these last that are the least known what has this to do with crime as a disease lorrey interrupted there is a small gland which governs operation of a certain section of der brain which controls a human beings behavior said sultman if dot gland is out of order der patient loses his sense of right and wrong in other words he gets so he does not give a damn what happens or what he does doc savage has discovered this i would not call that one of doc savages discoveries robert lorrey put in many criminologists have arrived at that conclusion sultman shrugged anyway doc savage straightens up dot gland at his place in upstate new york and dot is what makes honest men of the crooks of course he severs certain nerves in their brains too which makes them forget their past this is quite amazing said robert lorrey no it isnt grinned sultman you know all about it because you are one of der men who do der operating on crooks the three gunmen watching from their concealed niches saw from robert lorreys sudden tensing that he was shocked by the disclosure that another man knew of his profession they heard lorrey bark how did you learn this no one is supposed to know they saw janko sultman puff at his cigar then draw his chair closer to that of robert lorrey ignoring lorreys tendency to shrink away from him there was a smug look on sultmans face and one gunman reflected that he looked like a fuzzyhaired cannibal about to indulge in a meal janko sultman now began speaking rapidly but his words did not reach the guards for they were pitched low the watchers could only observe the play of emotions on the features of robert lorrey lorrey at first registered surprise then that became a shocked blank look and as sultman went on speaking amazement wonder and horror followed each other successively then rage blazed in the meeklooking scientists eyes you go to hell he yelled and sprang to his feet sultman dropped his cigar and scrambled erect yelling dont be a fool ill raise the ante ill make it a hundred thousand dollars no snapped lorrey a quarter of a million sultman offered desperately no fifty per cent of all we can take in i told you to go to hell robert lorrey shouted then he backed toward the door sultman stepped hastily aside and snapped dont let him out men he wont leave lizzie said unexpectedly from the door lizzie had come back silently and it was evident that he did not know janko sultman had posted gunmen behind the wall panels robert lorrey turned around and saw the flat automatic which lizzie was holding in one girlishly small hand he put his own hands up sultman asked lizzie you got rid of sidney lorrey lizzie laughed i didnt have to i just told him over the telephone when i called here that i had some important information for him i made an appointment in a drug store far enough away so that he wont get back in time to bother us robert lorrey swallowed rapidly what are you going to do with me i was forced to have your superior leander court killed sultman smiled i will not make that mistake again we will use other means on you what do you mean lorrey snapped you are going to be persuaded to do as i wish advised sultman i have thought it all out very carefully including what doc savage will do to you if you harm me asked lorrey janko sultman looked as if some one had jabbed him unexpectedly with a pin but the expression was fleeting i am not afraid of doc savage he growled you might as well make up your mind that you are going to do the thing i wish robert lorreys answer was to dive suddenly at lizzies gun the wielder of the weapon was taken by surprise and permitted the stoopshouldered man to get a grip on it lorrey kicked lizzies shins from under him the man falling released his weapon janko sultman forgetting he had the gunmen posted back of the wall panels ran and leaped upon robert lorrey stunned lorrey lost his weapon lizzie got up snarling and snatched a long stiletto from inside his immaculate full dress garb he started for robert lorrey and stopped lizzie put a hand up to his eyes they were protruding a little he dropped his knife my head he wailed horribly my eyes something is wrong lizzie had shut the door when he came inside but now there was a loud crash and an explosion of splinters a second crash followed a fist an incredible fist that looked like the business end of a circus stakedrivers maul smashing through the panel the door collapsed the man who came through was a tower of bone and gristle robert lorrey looked at the newcomer wideeyed and startled renny he shouted delightedly chapter ix bokes touch renny looked over the room and the expression on his long puritanical face was one of absolute gloom an indication that he was enjoying himself for adversely the sadder renny looked the more interest he was taking in proceedings he was a giant this renny weighing near two hundred and sixty pounds most of it bone a little gristle and not much else yet huge as he was the proportions of his fists were such as to make the rest of him seem inadequately small each was composed of near a half gallon of bone and tendon lizzie was still swaying pawing at his face his eyes he had not fallen and he seemed to be recovering a little from the effects of the strange spell which had seized upon him the popeyed death sultman choked eying his aide robert lorrey also fell to studying lizzie there was a professional curiosity in his scrutiny where did you first feel pain he asked and was there any sensation prior to the pain lizzie was too occupied with his own difficulties to answer renny moving across the floor with an ease unusual for so big a man scooped up all of the weapons in sight this caused sultman to retreat and furtively eye the panels behind which his machine gunners were concealed catching a moment when renny and lorrey were not looking sultman shook his head violently admonishing the gunners not to fire robert lorrey asked renny how on earth did you get here the bigfisted engineer looked very gloomy there was a message at docs office he offered in a whooping roaring voice it outlined what had happened i couldnt locate doc so i thought id keep an eye on pat the message told where she was lizzie stopped feeling of his eyes which were almost normal again and glared at renny the bigfisted engineer jingled the weapons in his enormous digits pat didnt know i was looking out for her he went on i kept in the background and when she followed seco nandez and the sissy here he paused to nod at the effeminate uzzi i trailed along well they grabbed pat and the pretty boy here left his partner nandez to cut her throat i was about to interfere when nandez stuck his eyes out had a fit and died i saw pat was safe so i left on sissys trail ive been hanging around since trying to get an earful lizzie became slackjawed janko sultman looked slightly ill it was the first they had heard of the popeyed death of their coconspirator seco nandez and the news was surprising not at all pleasant sultman looked at lizzie and snarled you careless drummer a hell of a mess you have got us into lizzie said nuts to you but he looked worried he was trying to think how renny could have followed him so expertly and so unnoticeably and the upshot of his thinking was that he should have used a great deal more caution renny waved his fistful of weapons and his great voice jumped and thumped in the room get a move on boys he directed were all going to have a talk with doc savage that made sultman start and think of his machine gunners behind the wall panels so he backed slowly to one side until he stood in the clear then stiffened himself and yelled desperately in command just the big man he howled save lorrey renny realized then that there must be some one else concealed around the room he flopped down to make himself as small a target as possible and bulleted toward the door his idea being to fight back from the opening but his precautions were hardly necessary as it developed one of the wall panels snapped open a necessary move before the men behind could use their guns for when the panels were closed there was not room the man who came through did not even hold his submachine gun the weapon lay on the floor of the niche the man was bent over and he bent even more seeming to contort himself in a titanic effort his face becoming purple with the strain as they watched his eyes came slowly out like seeds from a purple grape and it seemed certain they would fall to the floor but they did not then he began to yell in pain the other two gunners were crying out too threshing about and making awful garglings one got out of his niche and died on the floor the other only got the door of his concealment the wall panel ajar and was unable to get out he convulsed his mortal existence away while curled up in the cramped confines strange things were happening to lizzie and janko sultman too lizzie was having trouble with his eyes again grasping his head and moaning and janko sultinan for the first time was standing slightly popeyed suddenly sultman emitted a wail of terror and stampeded for the door but renny who was affected not at all by the popeyed spell mysteriously enough tripped sultinan and calmly stood on the middle of the mans back renny frowned at the three machine gunners so amazing was their affliction so preposterous was the whole thing that renny plainly doubted the evidence of his own eyes or suspected some trick finally it dawned on him that this was no trick hut death in some grisly inexplicable form and the bigfisted engineer voiced a pet exclamation of wonder which he saved for all special occasions holy cow he boomed hoarsely robert lorrey passed a hand over his forehead and blinked vacantly the most incredible thing i ever saw he muttered what on earth is it renny did not answer for there seemed no reply to give he swallowed several times then bethought himself of the business at hand and again gathered up guns he nudged lizzie and the dazed sultman both of whom were still mildly affected by the weird trouble they stood meekly while he went over their persons searching for weapons he even relieved them of their penknives well go see doc savage now he advised lizzie and sultman obeyed like punished children as the bigfisted engineer urged them toward the stairway they went down slowly fear making them very silent their eyes sultman moaned and gave a great shake of a shudder which all hut threw him down the steps renny collared the fuzzyhaired man suddenly how many more men have you working for you sultman opened his mouth and it was plain that he was on the point of giving some number but he reconsidered looked sly and said no more renny slapped him the slap was not gentle it knocked sultman down the remaining six stairs of the flight ill knock you out from under that frizzled hair if you start lying to me the bigfisted engineer promised sultman lying on the floor moaned and did not try to get up lizzie snarled keep your hands off sully renny turned around and took lizzies slim throat in both huge hands then lifted lizzie from the floor without apparent difficulty and squeezed a little tentatively lizzie flailed his arms and made froglike noises i havent forgotten that you walked off callously and left your pal to cut pats throat renny boomed he squeezed again slowly not relaxing the pressure even when lizzie squirmed his wildest lizzies face became splotchy then purple and his tongue stuck small and pink and straight through his teeth robert lorrey said nervously it is doc savages policy never to take a human life sure renny said but mistakes will happen renny looked very sober with lines about his mouth and a gloomy almost tearful droop to his eyes janko sultman got up from the floor as if he wanted to run but renny lashed a foot out and tripped him down again sultman was terrified he looked at the unlucky lizzie and had difficulty getting his breath you were going to take us to doc savage he wailed sure renny said but maybe i changed my mind and decided to make you two talk right here who is this boke the man with the mysterious voice i do not know sultman moaned dot is the truth what proposition did boke put up to you through this man frightful renny continued sultman looked away and wailed you have got me all wrong and dot is a fact robert lorrey who had moved toward the door to look out into the darkened street gave a sudden start and yelled renny who had been putting on a tough performance merely in hopes of impressing sultman and lizzie to the point where they would break down and unburden their souls of the truth whirled he half expected to see robert lorrey in the grip of the fantastic popeyed death what he did see was robert lorrey in the grip of a burly brownskinned man who had sleek black hair and a remarkably stupidlooking face this man had succeeded in grabbing a gun which robert lorrey chanced to be carrying and he was endeavoring to drag his captive outside renny emitted a whooping roar and slammed for the door two more men appeared beside the brownskinned fellow popping in out of the night they grabbed lorrey then other men came in behind them these with guns renny was upon the group now there was light inside the door and those who had come in from the night were a little blind so that the bigfisted engineers recklessness was justified he smashed one gunman in the face the fellow flew back his features flattened as by the blow of a great maul the other man dodged and rennys slugging fist only banged the top of his head which to an ordinary fist would have been more damaging than to the head but rennys was no ordinary set of knuckles and the victim fell as if he had been hit with an iron bar the trio seeking to hold robert lorrey were brushed aside easily and before they could help themselves were hurled out into the street in shoving them outside renny got a look at the street distinguishing other shadowy figures there too many outside he rapped well try the back way they ran down the corridor but long before the rear door was in sight they heard feet pounding men grunting and knew enemies had flanked them coming in through the rear renny busy cuffing sultman and lizzie along with him snapped at robert lorrey get back we can get out through a side window whined janko sultman renny scowled darkly at sultman then his scowl turned to brisk interest there was a great fear on the fuzzyhaired mans features who are these guys jumping us renny demanded sultman wrung his hands bokes men he groaned they must be down the passage coming from the rear door a single pencilsized tongue of red flame pumped in the murk renny got down fast the flame spiked again gun sound quaked each time renny had turned his shoulder to see if robert lorrey who had retreated a little was safe it was a little more luminous where robert lorrey stood and renny distinctly saw lorreys head kick back and a small blue spot appear in the center of his forehead lorreys knees caved queerly so that he turned as he fell and a much larger pit was visible in the back of his cranium where the bullet had come out his fall was noisy and only his fingers moved afterward their quivering rapidly stilled men with guns now seemed to flow from all sides into the house they were tall fellows short men thin men and broad men there was some shooting but that ceased when a low order was passed around renny carried one of the supermachine pistols and he got a chance to use it blasting two men down with streams of mercy bullets then some one threw a chair at him which he ducked but the chair bounced back from the wall and got in his way as he tried to run across the room he fell men piled on him in a flood with guns they clubbed his head until it rang the clubbing made his linger tips tingle and his arms difficult to move they tied his ankles and his arms with wire torn from floor lamps then distended his mouth with the biggest part of a pillow case renny lay there on the floor looking at his captors and decided they were a thoroughly hard crew his inspection made him conscious of the cold which had come in with the opened doors and he shivered a little the men dragged sultman and lizzie into the room both these two had also been bound and gagged and they got rough treatment the bandage had been torn out of sultmans frizzled hair and the bullet wound was flowing red a man appropriated lizzies watch chain from the front of his dress waistcoat then calmly tore the pockets out of his garments looking for money finding little he kicked lizzie in the sides until the pain brought tears to lizzies eyes listeners had evidently gone outside for they now came in to report that the shooting had not attracted attention renny hearing this was not surprised for the house was an isolated one and the night itself was noisy robert lorrey was carried inside and the men bent over him anxiously they cursed when they found the bullet hole through the brain the violence of their profanity showed they had shot lorrey by accident a thorough mess said a voice yes a very thorough mess renny was struck and held by that voice for it was a tone that was unnaturally pleasant it had a fascination one wanted to hear it again he stared about the room trying to ascertain who had spoken things may come out all right after all however said the utterly enthralling voice renny shuddered he could not help it for that amazing voice seemed to be coming from thin air it was as if the speaker were invisible chapter x torture sidney lorrey twin brother of the unfortunate robert had a small habit of tearing matches to pieces with his fingers when he was not mentally at ease the tiled floor about the chair on which he sat was strewn with flakes of mutilated matchwood sidney lorrey finished dissecting the last match of the book which had been in the smoking tray on the drugstore table then stood slowly erect the store was a small one with two large telephone booths in the back sidney lorrey went over to the fountain clerk who was pouring steaming water into a coffee percolator a gentleman called me from one of the telephone booths here and asked me to meet him lorrey told the clerk i dont find any sign of him did he leave any message the clerk stopped pouring whend he call you sidney lorrey calculated the time since he had left his brother robert in the company of janko suitman half an hour he said yeshalf an hour ago the clerk grinned lopsidedly somebodys been kidding you brother sidney lorrey who did not like to be addressed familiarly frowned what do you mean those booths aint connected said the clerk theyre out of order or something go back there and youll see theres a sign on them that says they wont work and nobody has called from here tonight sidney lorrey absently lifted a toothpick off the counter and broke it to pieces it had just struck him that there was something strange about the call which had come to janko sultmans place he had realized earlier that the voice of the man who had telephoned him had belonged to an entire stranger and the fact that the fellow had been secretive saying it was vitally important to see sidney but neglecting to convey details was queer but the startling fact which had just dawned on sidney lorrey was that he had told no one he was going to accompany his brother robert to sultmans rendezvous sidney lorrey and his brother had been eating at a small restaurant which they favored habitually when janko sultman had gotten in touch with robert and made the appointment sidney lorrey swung out of the drug store baffled wrinkles ridging his unnaturally high forehead popped himself into a taxicab and a few minutes later was alighting in front of janko sultmans place he dismissed the cab for he presumed his brother was still inside he glanced up at the windows of the house they were curtained but he thought he saw movement he drew his coat closer against the chill of this unnatural fall evening and stepped toward the doorway being swallowed by the shadows in the upstairs room the man who had looked through the window and seen sidney lorrey wheeled on his fellows the brother he snapped from the adjacent room came the pleasant voice of the mysterious boke a bit of profound luck gentlemen it said the other scowled luck and with his brother lying dead here boke did not appear but his voice came plainly get sidney he said it may be that he will serve our purpose as well as his brother the men in the room moved with swift efficiency the light was not on in the hallway nor did they turn any on but positioned themselves one on either side of the front door just inside they held guns ready in their hands a full minute ticked away the sinister men stirred uneasily realizing that sidney lorrey should have reached the door by now they allowed more seconds to pass then pulled the curtain back from the door and peered out into the coldswept street after that they wrenched the door wide and craned their necks up and down the street sidney lorrey was nowhere in sight upstairs the strangely attractive voice of boke was giving quiet orders and men were scampering about making rapid preparations in the main room there was still no sign of boke his voice came from an adjacent chamber one man seemed to be the lieutenant in charge he came out of the room from which boke had spoken his movements were brusque and an onlooker might have mistaken him for the mysterious boke until he spoke he had a coarse squeaky voice the mans face held satisfaction as they finished their preparations he backed away quietly tamping aromatic tobacco into a pipe what do you think of it leo bokes voice asked from the adjacent room leo applied tiny flame from a platinum lighter and let the pipe light itself he did not draw in swell he said then leos hair all but stood on end his pipe lost out of his teeth hit the floor and showered sparks like a small vesuvius do not turn around advised an utterly cold voice at leos back the man called leo did not turn the others in the room froze and became very careful of what gestures they made with their hands sidney lorrey had appeared in the door and he held in one hand a small doubleaction revolver from which the barrel had been sawed the calibre of the gun was great its barrel diameter was such as to almost admit a finger i came in the back way sidney lorrey said dryly i do not know who you gentlemen are or why you were acting so mysteriously i want my brother leo bowed slightly he had long black hair and a lock of it fell down over his forehead when he bowed your brother left here some time ago he said sidney lorrey smiled thinly over his revolver there is something very queer going on here he said i can see it in your manner on your faces leo absently replaced the stray lock of black hair when a man walks in on us with a gun as you have do you expect us to look blase about it sidney lorrey backed toward the door these men were dangerous and there were more of them in the house he beckoned at leo with his sawedoff gun i am leaving be advised you will walk downstairs and a short distance from the house with me if any one menaces me in any way i shall do my best to blow your spine in two pieces leos hair seemed to become blacker his eyes darker his brows and lashes more smoky all because his face had turned extremely pale but he did not resist or say anything but stepped out into the hallway leo stumbled on the stairs having difficulty with his feet and only sidney lorreys hand entangled grimly in the collar of his coat kept him from falling they passed through the door which gave into an alley full of cold hard snow particles and darkness some one leaning from a window directly above the alley door held a heavy typewriter with both hands there was enough light that the figures below showed as vague blurs against the snow and the man let his typewriter drop carefully the typewriter carriage slid hack with a zizzz of a noise as it started to fall and this caused sidney lorrey to look up he jumped but not soon enough the heavy office appliance struck his head the typewriter bell rang loudly then rang again as the machine hit the alley pavement sidney lorrey fell atop the typewriter blackhaired leo leaned against the house wall and pounded his chest slowly as if his heart had almost stopped sidney lorrey was awakened by the raucous sound of some one telling leo well hell it was all we could do we figured he wouldnt plug you after the typewriter hit him opening his eyes lorrey saw leo and the other men around him leo had recovered his pipe and was puffing it filling the room with aromatic tobacco fumes no one seemed to be in a hurry no one showed particular excitement a groan came from a long boxshaped modernistic divan which stood on the opposite side of the room sidney tried to sit up only to discover he was bound securely hands and feet held together in one knot of stout cords he managed to lift his head bob he exploded the form of robert lorrey reposed on the divan there was a bandage over his head a gag in his mouth even as sidney stared robert lorreys form stirred slightly to the accompaniment of a second groan bob sidney gasped are you hurt badly are you conscious the head of robert lorrey rolled so that sidney could not see the lips but he heard a mumble the words not quite distinguishable then sidney lorrey started violently for the utterly pleasant voice of the fantastic boke was in the room your brother has a chance said bokes honeyed tones sidney lorrey wrenching at the ropes which held him gritted get a doctor for him damn you let me treat him im a doctor medical attention will not save him boke stated pleasantly but information will k an effort to see just which one of the men was boke sidney lorrey peered about intently he could detect no betraying lip movements he decided boke must be in an adjoining room there was an unnatural quality in the voice doc savage has a remarkable institution in upstate new york for curing criminals boke said amiably the bronze man has discovered a treatment for the particular gland which is responsible for criminal behavior your brother here was in charge of the institution how did you learn all of this sidney lorrey demanded it is supposed to be known only to doc savage and his five men and to those immediately connected with the institution i had heard that criminals who went against this doc savage disappeared mysteriously and were never heard from again in their former haunts said bokes pleasant voice i became curious this doc savage it is a well known fact does not take human life what then did he do with his prisoners that was the puzzle so i hired many investigators and spent much money and eventually i learned what do you want with me sidney lorrey asked one of the investigators whom i hired a gentleman named janko sultman doublecrossed me said boke ignoring the question but we will not go into that sultman is being taken care of what do you want with me demanded sidney lorrey i want the names of the men at doc savages criminalcuring college in upstate new york said boke i mean the names of the surgeons who do the work there i do not have that information snapped sidney lorrey bokes pleasant voice made bubbling laughter a lie of course you have visited the college frequently you have even conducted experiments there using the facilities of the college laboratory i will tell you nothing sidney lorrey said grimly the blackhaired leo straightened sighed and looked around as if irked by the waiting go to work on him leo said bokes voice leo swung over easily and kicked sidney lorreys face lightly and rapidly until scarlet began to ooze lorrey moaned tried to scream but they stuffed old cloth into his mouth bokes voice now filled with a ring of genuine horror said i cannot bear violence gentlemen you will excuse me until you have secured the names of the surgeons in doc savages establishment sidney lorrey his interest in the mysterious boke greater than his own agony listened intently for some sound of a man leaving the other room but there was no such noise leo grinned lopsidedly and stroked his black hair back funny guy boke he said hes the biggest crook in the world but if be had to do the dirty work himself he couldnt pick a pocket i cant make him out some one said he aint a coward he claims his inner nature rebels at the thought of actually committing a crime what a laugh i guess his crime gland aint just right leo chuckled leo now stripped off his coat his evil face grim he gave a low order and some one went out evidently to an automobile parked somewhere near for the fellow came back bearing a pair of pliers of the inexpensive type ordinarily included in tool kits leo leaned over sidney lorrey but jerked a hand at the divan near by on which lay the form of robert lorrey one of the men went over and nudged the form the figure shifted slightly and there was a groan your brother leo reminded sidney lorrey he will die if you do not tell us what we want to know why do you want the names of these surgeons sidney lorrey demanded leo ignored that are you going to give the information sidney lorrey gritted i am not leo began plucking sidney lorreys finger nails off with the pliers the human mentality is almost an incorporeity it is a thing productive of so many contradictions so many mysteries that it is not even fully understood by the psychologists who make the study of the mind their specialty students of the mind dispute each other when they try to explain for instance why one small boy may twist a cats tail to hear it squawl while another lad may be horrified by the cruelty of such an act but the fact remains that some mentalities gloat over torture and to some of these the sight of physical pain the joy of inflicting it themselves acts as a wine making them drunk with a sort of infernal ecstasy leos eyes became brighter he breathed more rapidly a grease of perspiration stood out on his forehead and he ceased to brush back the loose lock of black hair at first he demanded of sidney lorrey the name of the physicians at doc savages college putting the demands after each act of torture but before long he ceased doing that and went ahead in silence that was broken only by the awful sounds of the tortured man and the harsh grating of leos own breathing when the floor became slippery with crimson leo ordered bed coverings brought from another room and sidney lorrey was rolled upon these lorrey was barely conscious now frightful things had been done to him things that would mutilate him for life and the other onlookers hardened criminals were becoming nauseated and turning away he aint gonna talk one muttered why not put him out of his misery leo purplefaced hoteyed and intent seemed not to hear for he was engaged in the process of whittling lorreys fingers down to the bone one at a time and showing lorrey with fiendish chuckles the naked gray of the exposed bones it was then that something began to happen to leo that his eyes started protruding he dropped his knife clasped his face and began to moan then to shriek his cries were hideous guttering bleats of pain and agony his head tilted far back then came forward and he bent almost double he was gnashing his lips to shreds he fell over convulsing on the floor beside sidney lorrey his eyes now all but out of their sockets and after one final twitch he relaxed completely and stopped breathing sidney lorrey it suddenly developed was far less gone than it had appeared he must have been working slyly with his bonds for now he jerked and got one hand free he dived that hand into the clothing of the man who had just fallen a victim to the fantastic popeyed death the hand reappeared with leos gun sidney lorrey held the weapon in the palsied clutch of both hands and croaked stand still none of the men moved they marveled that lorrey still lived and they watched fascinated at the gruesome efforts of the man to free himself of the rest of the cords and get to his feet he was too weak to stand erect he did not moan or otherwise voice pain as he crawled toward the divan on which lay the form of his brother the men in the room shivered and turned pale as sidney lorrey neared the divan their eyes sought the door but none dared flee they were scared terrified beyond reason by the fantastic fate which had overtaken leo and by the grim animation in the broken manthing on the floor sidney lorrey took hold of the form on the divan he shook it he clutched blindly at the bandage on the forehead so that it was pulled aside showing the bullet hole in dead robert lorreys head sidney lorrey screamed once horribly then he reared up and looked behind the divan there was a man lying prone back there too scared to move it was he who had moved the body and groaned so as to make sidney lorrey think his brother still lived that they might use the brothers safety as a club to make sidney talk hoarse uncanny sounds came from sidney lorreys lips as he sagged back to the floor and his eyes were wide and glazed red fluid from a cut on his forehead seeped down and pooled in one eye but the orb did not blink it glared horrible and bloody it seemed that he was going to empty the gun which he held he crawled toward the men leaving crimson smears on the floor his course brought him close to leos grotesquely sprawled body and he peered vacantly at the protruding eyes suddenly the vacancy went from sidney lorreys stare the madness still remained and with it was a frenzied triumph a mad unreasoning mirth which caused him to cackle grotesque laughter look at him he screamed and pointed at leo none of the men looked they had looked too much already and it had put ice in their vitals look at your friend sidney lorrey shrieked madly look at the eyes i look and see how you are all going to die somebody croaked hes nuts that was what they all thought for sidney lorrey had been tortured enough to kill an ordinary man and the hideous trick played with the body of his dead brother was enough to upset a more than ordinarily stable mind sidney lorrey was crawling toward the door covering his retreat with the menace of his gun the door he was making for was the one which led into the room from which boke the mysterious man with the voice of joy had spoken you want to know what is making their eyes stick out he gibbered hollowly no one answered but that did not mean they did not want to know it is the work of the crime annihilist lorrey snarled yes call it the crime annihilist he paused in the door said you and jabbed a hand at the nearest man and you and you and you he jabbed at the others then covered them all with an inclusive sweep all of you are destined to die all of the criminals in the world will die hes nuts muttered one of the listeners nuts sidney lorrey shrilled insanity madness it is a pleasure compared to what is to befall you lorrey drew himself up dramatically and pointed at the popeyed body of leo yelling look at him closely no one looked the work of the crime annihilist lorrey shrieked then sidney lorrey backed through the door into a room he looked around vacantly for the weird boke but saw only three men with protruding eyes dead on the floor janko sultmans men but sidney lorrey did not know that nor did he seem greatly interested for he went down the rear stairway and out of the house he moved with an infinite slowness leaving splotches of crimson and should have been an easy victim but the men he left behind did not follow him for they were too horrified by what had happened a taxi driver whom sidney lorrey hailed thought his passenger was crazy possibly with reason and tried to take him to bellevue hospital but lorrey made threats and finally got out of the machine and the hack driver fled glad to get away with his life after that the snowstreaked cold of the fall night swallowed sidney lorrey chapter xi terror over the city monk the homely chemist beat his chest with hairy fists and bellowed theyre the curse of humanity theyre parasites theyve caused half the wars of the world and they should all be shot pat very trim and bronzehaired came in from the outer corridor with a newspaper under her arm and asked who ham the dapper lawyer was carefully dipping the tip of his sword cane in a sticky paste which reposed in the back of his watch in a special compartment which he had unscrewed he glanced up lawyers in general he smiled monk is expressing an opinion one lawyer in particular monk scowled and glared at the sartorially perfect ham what set this off pat demanded that shyster monk indicated ham done my hog a dirty trick he put itching powder on habeas ham stood up suddenly and yelled im getting tired of having that accident in the pig race pull my topcoat down on the floor and make a bed out of it every chance he gets so you put itching powder on the coat monk glared and you got the stuff on you when you tried to find out what was wrong ham smirked monk grimaced and scratched his furry wrist where is habeas now pat asked in rennys bathtub soaking the stuff off monk admitted pat snapped open the newspaper which she had brought the press has gone wild she said look black headlines were a foot deep across the front page the mysterious popeyed malady was rampant said the sheets with more than a dozen persons dead during the night half a dozen men had been found dead in a shabby rooming house all of them known criminals and a known murderer had dropped dead at the association of physical health nor were these all in other parts of the city men had been found dead with their eyes protuberant new york was scared said the headlines the trains out of the city were crowded workers were applying for winter vacations and two or three persons according to information amassed during the night were thinking of closing up shop until the malady was past or until some one found out what was causing the deaths a tabloid predicted that this would be general the journalists pointed out again that while some of the men who had died during the night undoubtedly knew each other and one group was probably a member of a criminal gang the majority of the victims had no possible connection with each other this the scribes seemed to think could mean nothing but the presence of some fabulous epidemic that the hideous disease might strike anywhere and in fact was doing so was played up certain southern health resorts had taken advantage of the scare to run advertisements suggesting that a visit to their establishments would be an excellent way to avoid the whole thing monk scowled those papers are making it worse he said they should play it down theyre getting the whole town excited theyre scaring people if this keeps up its liable to shut the whole place down and poor people who cant afford it are going to get worried and spend their money and lose their jobs leaving town maybe they had best leave ham said grimly we dont know but that every life in the city may be in danger it begins to look like this thing strikes everywhere pat ran slim fingers through her hair and murmured doc do you think all of these popeyed deaths have a connection with sultman and boke and their schemes whatever they are instead of answering the bronze man said slowly i wonder what has become of renny and the two lorreys doc savages question remained unanswered during the next half hour they waited in comparative idleness the bronze man had put out every possible line in an effort to get in touch with the lorreys so there was nothing to do but kill time until something happened renny too should he have a chance would be certain to call the apartment in an effort to locate doc savage pat went out again when newsboys were heard yelling on the streets far below she came back wildly excited look she screamed and flourished a paper the headlines were as big as the page could hold and the story which followed was in type which made it stand out in shrieking prominence doc savage wanted police net out for bronze mystery man police inspector clarence hardboiled humbolt tonight announced that he had twice received tips that clark savage jr who has become famous as doc savage the man of bronze is responsible for the fantastic and horrible popeyed deaths each tip led to the discovery of a group of men who had perished from the mysterious popeyed death each tip was given by a pleasant voice over the telephone doc savage inspector humbolt stated to reporters was at one time under arrest but escaped by employing one of the scientific devices for which he is famous a general alarm has been spread for the bronze man the second telephone tip led to a house in upper manhattan where several men were found dead among them was a body identified as that of robert lorrey he had been shot through the brain the story continued giving details of the yarn as well as the address of the house where robert lorrey and the other dead had been discovered doc savage and his party read it through a pleasant voice over the telephone gave the tips ham said grimly that means boke monk eyed doc what about this we will go up there and look around doc said quietly the police will have an eye open for us monk reminded doc nodded for that reason you three will stay here for the time being monk did not look as if he thought much of the idea whats the use he countered the cops will learn that renny lives here and theyll come around to investigate the bronze man answered that by moving to the bathroom the tub was full of steaming water and in this stood the pig habeas corpus doc lifted the shoat out of the water then pulled the plug and let the tub drain after which he reached up and turned the shower head so that it pointed straight up the tub promptly lifted on some mechanical support and swiveled exposing an expanse of masonry which was perforated with a slit large enough to permit the passage of a man metal ladder rungs led downward renny prepared this for a getaway doc explained it leads to a secret elevator in what is apparently a solid column of masonry no one else in the building knows of it where does it come out monk demanded nearly a block distant in a private garage rented by renny under an assumed name the bronze man explained if the police come you simply leave by this route and they will never know you have been here swell monk grinned and got down on his hands and knees to see how the mechanism operated satisfied he straightened looked around as if to say something then blinked his small eyes doc savage was gone from the apartment some moments later a taxicab driver huddled at the wheel of his machine got the start of his life when a voice addressed him from the supposedly empty rear compartment drive north until i tell you to turn the voice directed the hackman screwed his head around but the light in the rear of his car had been turned out and he could make out only a shadowy bulk where his passenger sat the driver rubbed his ears as he let out the clutch wondering why he had not heard the door open or close he drove rapidly slowing only when there was danger of skidding in the sheets of icy snow particles and traversed nearly fifty blocks left here advised the voice in the rear and after they had gone two blocks now north the driver turned again to try to examine his fare but once more the darkness thwarted him and a moment later he was too interested in something happening down the street ahead of him to think about his passenger the street was a long gloomy one lined by only a few houses at the next block a group of policemen stood in the street stopping all cars opening the doors and peering inside with a prickling sensation along the back of his neck the driver of the cab pushed ahead he halted when one of the officers flagged him with a hand got a fare the policeman demanded sure said the driver an officer opened the cab door looked inside then pulled back and snarled whatre you tryin to do wise guy kid us the driver wheeled and his eyes flew wide for the rear seat was empty uhhuh he stuttered get the beck outa here snapped a cop and take a tip and lay off the funny stuff the hackman went on willingly within the next four blocks he noted a piece of paper blowing about in the seat beside him and he picked it up he grinned widely and pocketed the fragment of paper it was a tendollar bill police inspector clarence hardboiled humbolt was bothered angry and taking no chances he had made an examination of the house where robert lorrey had been found shot to death and the other men lay lifeless from the strange affliction of the protruding eyes the medical examiner had come and gone fingerprint men had done their work the police photographers had taken pictures hardboiled himself was in the lower hallway talking to newspaper men he had taken off his canvas shoes and was rubbing his feet gently grimacing as if the rubbing pained him rather pleasantly the house was flattopped and flanked on either side by vacant lots which were surrounded by high board fences there was a policeman in each vacant lot and two in the alley hardboiled humbolt held a small metal disk up for the newspaper reporters to examine the disk was affixed to a linkage of small chain robert lorrey wore this around his ankle hardboiled growled it is an identification disk with a number and an inscription requesting that doc savage be called did you call doc savage a reporter asked hardboiled stopped rubbing his foot and swore if i knew where that bronze guy was id call on him what does the disk mean asked another journalist it means that the dead man was connected with doc savage snapped hardboiled he is the second fellow wearing one of those to be killed in the last few hours do you accuse doc savage of the killings questioned a cub i dont accuse anybody said hardboiled who knew what a clever lawyer could do with a libel suit i have evidence enough to warrant the bronze mans arrest another reporter the dean of the lot said i do not think my paper will print any of these innuendoes cast in the direction of doc savage for one thing savage has the reputation of being straight as a string and of fighting criminals and of helping those who are in trouble furthermore he is a man who has made incalculable contributions to surgical knowledge and i personally know of charities and hospitals which he keeps in operation all of which may be a buildup by savage to make himself a big shot while hes actually a master criminal of some kind growled hardboiled rats said the reporter hardboiled humbolt scowled and got up he mounted the stairs and because he did not put his tennis shoes on and walked lightly so as to favor his bunions he made almost no noise reaching one of the upstairs rooms which was dark he glanced inside for once he forgot his sore feet the chamber was a bedroom and there was a mirror door on the closet on this mirror words were glowing in an eerie electric blue the big wellrounded letters were perfectly decipherable from where hardboiled stood they read sidney lorrey knows crime annihilist secret hardboiled humbolt was so shocked that he made several inarticulate croaking noises he had gone over the room personally a bit earlier and had found no such writing as this thinking he caught a slight sound he cocked an ear then he stepped in the room wrenching out his gun stand still you he grated there was no answer cold air brushed his face and hard snow tinkled on window glass hardboiled felt for the light switch and got the bulbs white the room was empty the one window was wide open and the writing had vanished hardboileds angry howl brought policemen and newspaper reporters slamming up the stairs they found the tenderfooted inspector leaning out of the window who left this open be roared no one seemed to know to the reporters hardboiled told what had happened this writing will come on when i turn the lights off he said confidently its phosphorous or something he stepped back and clicked the light bulb black then he looked at the mirror he swore no writing had appeared hardboiled tried it twice again without causing writing to appear on the mirror then he went over and with the lights on used a pocket magnifier borrowed from a fingerprint man he found nothing much to his amazement they tried fingerprint powder and that brought out nothing i cant understand it the burly officer rumbled the real original handwriting on the wall snorted a journalist chapter xii death on the river it was well past midnight the air was colder the wind had become stronger the gale howled around the cornices outside rennys apartment like a lonesome dog ham the dapper lawyer waved his sword cane and shrieked you awful mistake of nature you missing link you furry ape ill chop you down to the shape of a human being monk homely and simian sprawled in a chair across the office his eyes practically closed his big mouth barely open the pig habeas corpus sat in the middle of the room and to all appearances said the human race is made up of very funny animals even funnier than some others are certain small sissifled fellows who doll themselves up in flashy clothes and carry canes now you take ham suddenly seized a book and hurled it at the pig habeas dodged with a skill that had come from much practice moved to the other side of the room and began again now you take ham roared im in no mood to listen to one of those funny hog lectures and glared at monk monk pretended to be asleep pat savage occupying a chair in the background tried to keep a sober expression on her attractive features monk and ham quarreled during all their time together each going to extreme and sometimes childish measures to aggravate the other monks present performance was one be could depend upon to throw ham into a rage monk had gone to great pains to learn ventriloquism for the specific purpose of throwing his voice to habeas and having the shoat express choice opinions of ham who was touchy on the subject of pork in general anyway monk throwing his voice made habeas seem to say this funny human race is marked by the presence of parasites a parasite is a fellow everybody else could get along very well without an example of a parasite is a lawyer monk stooped and sat up suddenly as doc savage came in find renny monk demanded the bronze man said i managed to get into the house where robert lorrey was killed use of the ultraviolet lantern showed a message in rennys handwriting on a mirror door mien renny had been there ham said grimly what did the message say pat put in sidney lorrey knows crime annihilist secret doc savage stated what was the message monk scratched in the rusty bristles which stood out straight on the back of his neck crime annihilist he pondered aloud whos he ham flourished his sword cane suddenly jove i believe an annihilist would be one who destroys and hasnt it occurred to you that the victims of this popeyed death have been criminals not all of them shyster monk reminded that last newspaper we read said two had died who were not crooks one was a park avenue sport and the other a banker ham frowned changed the subject completely and asked doc did you see our friend hardboiled humbolt the gentleman walked in on me while rennys message was fluorescing under the ultraviolet lantern said the bronze man dryly a convenient window allowed me to get away before he realized just what it was all about pat put in sharply if sidney lorrey knows the secret of what is behind all these hideous killings suppose we find him an excellent idea doc agreed we will try sidney lorreys laboratory on the barge because the night was unnaturally cold for the season and the waters of the east river proportionately warmer there was a thick gray suds of fog over the water the gale swept this upon the shore where it froze and deposited thick white frost giving the terrain a ghostly arctic aspect sidney lorreys barge was like a great white box with another and smaller white box placed in its middle and the whole set in a steaming cauldron but because it was very dark the boxes did not look so intensely white there was a great silence broken only by the gale and the sound of tug whistles audible at long intervals close to the river the noise of the waves could be heard for a long time there bad been no sign of life but now the macabre aspect of the cold scene was broken a figure moved shifting from the shelter of a piling head to the lee of a great unused timber there was great furtiveness in the marauders manner the skulker was bundled in a black overcoat the velvet collar upturned there was a muffler of black silk thinly marked with white wrapped around the lower face the hat was light gray blending with the snow and concealing the remainder of the wearers features this strange individual who obviously did not wish to be seen seemed to be watching sidney lorreys barge from time to time his head lifted over the timber while eyes examined the barge the steam off the river and the windborne snow combined to mask the barge and from where the mysterious figure lay not overly much could be seen the skulker evidently concluded to crawl closer he wormed along for a few yards then shifted over and got behind another timber and crawled along that but he did not crawl far a handa great corded hand of bronze abruptly drifted over from the opposite side of the timber and clamped down on the crawling ones neck the marauder emitted one stifled bleat of surprise and pain then he was wrenched bodily over the timber he struggled a bit but could accomplish but little against the metallic giant who held him there was a stir in the nearby murk and monk ham and pat scuttled forward they joined doc savage and his captive who is be doc monk breathed sidney lorrey ham said softly its lucky you spotted this fellow doc otherwise wed have walked right onto the barge without ever knowing he was around doc savage saying nothing pulled the silk muffler down and shoved the prisoners hat back disclosing his features the man was middleaged he had fine features ruddied a bit by the cold and a cropped blond mustache blue eyes and very even white teeth monk leaned close and held a big fist under the mans nose the man recoiled nervously monk demanded who are you oh my he gasped i knew i was making a mistake in acting on my own initiative his voice was mild his words rather too prim for the circumstances who are you monk repeated doctor mortimer basenstein the other admitted monk looked as if he did not believe it what are you doing here the other squirmed moistened his lips looked as if be would rather not answer monk held his fist up like a bludgeon spill it i am a practicing physician said doctor mortimer basenstein about two hours ago a man came to me for treatment he was horribly beaten cut and mutilated i think he was slightly insane he raved about being the crime annihilist who was going to kill a million criminals he was quite mad he said the crime annihilist was going to kill all of the crooks in the world what name did this man who said be was the crime annihilist give you doc savage asked sharply sidney lorrey muttered basenstein monk grunted something explosive for he had not expected tills word that sidney lorrey was the mysterious crime annihilist who caused men to drop over with their eyes protruding ham leaned forward with his sword cane and tapped the point of their captives chest you have not explained just what you are doing here he pointed out basenstein shuddered i am a kindhearted man and i have a respect for my profession be said this sidney lorrey proved to me that be himself is a licensed physician true said doc savage then you know him basenstein looked up the bronze man nodded monk his manner still hard said what are you doing here i followed sidney lorrey basenstein explained the man is temporarily demented i tell you and i wanted to help him if i turned him over to the police no telling what would happen i tell you this lorrey claims he has killed scores of criminals already monk gave a terse opinion of the story pretty thin basenstein snapped i tell you i am a physician with an office several blocks from here on seventieth street doc savage glanced at ham and spoke a few words in the ancient mayan dialect ham nodded and moved away the darkness swallowing him it was fully five minutes before ham came back and stated there is a doctor mortimer basenstein who has an office on seventieth i told you declared basenstein doc savage asked where is sidney lorrey now basenstein pointed at the barge on that we will find him the bronze man stated and moved forward some distance away a man lay prone on a pile of timbers with a pair of binoculars clamped to his eyes the glasses had an extraordinarily wide field which made them effective as night glasses the man had a handkerchief tied over his lower face perhaps to keep his breath from fogging the glasses and again perhaps to hide his features he eased backward using every caution to keep from making a noise or displaying his person too prominently a moment later he joined several other men they like himself all wore dark overcoats which kept them from standing out too prominently in the murk they were careful to keep away from snow backgrounds it worked said the man who had been using the binoculars hes goin with doc savage asked another sure said the first that seemed to be what they had awaited for they all crept back away from the vicinity of the river front as if not wanting to take chances of being discovered doc savage nearing the gangplank which led to the old barge that sidney lorrey had converted into a laboratory held up an arm and the others stopped permitting him to go on ahead basenstein asked softly who is that man doc savage monk advised oh said basenstein the man of mystery doc savage advanced toward the gangplank started across it halted suddenly and his strange flakegold eyes roved he brought out the flashlight which operated from a spring generator rather than a battery and raced the thin beam back and forth then he removed his coat balled it and flung it bard there was a mound of snow at the end of the gangplank between its end and the side of the barge deck house the coat knocked the snow aside a bit disclosing the body of a man doc savage advanced carefully spraying the flashlight on the snow before him reaching the body he turned it over the dead man was stocky clad in evening clothes and his round full face was oily even in death his eyes were gruesomely protuberant doc savage straightened and the snow swept along the barge deck by the terrific force of the wind covered the form again almost as if a sheet were being drawn over it the bronze man went to the deckhouse door but did not open it he listened there was no sound he stood aside as a matter of habitual precaution and knocked there was a loud concussion inside the deck house a tuft of splinters jumped out of the door the rifle bullet which had made the hole moaned toward monk and the others but passed slightly over their heads mortimer basenstein terrified by the proximity of the bullet emitted a screech of terror monk snorted angrily and clapped a hand over his mouth they struggled basenstein seemed gripped with a mortal terror a drumming from the shore drew all eyes monk released basenstein and snatched under his arm for his supermachine pistol figures became distinguishable in the room cops monk growled questioningly no said ham red sparks jumped from the approaching forms and gun sound slammed noisily pat savage was carrying a larger hand bag and she wrenched it open and drew out an enormous singleaction sixshooter it had been her fathers gun and she had practiced with the weapon until she had the proficiency of an oldtime western gun fighter she shot from the hip not pulling the trigger for there was no trigger on the gun it being stripped down for fanning she simply rocked the hammer back with a thumb and let it fall the concussion as the antique went off was terrific one of the attackers started dancing around crazily fell down on the snowcovered ground and threshed and kicked and finally became still tsk tsk monk clucked such bloodthirstiness he took a careful aim with his supermachine pistol mercy bullet said pat doc made some up special for this cannon monks superfirer emitted its bullfiddle moan three of the approaching men folded down magically startled the rest flopped flat and were lost in the nodular masses of timbers old machinery piles of hawser and other appurtenances common to wharves one of the assailants threw a grenade no one but doc saw it coming and the bronze man knocked the others flat so that the grenade exploding near by did nothing but deafen them back on the barge advised the bronze man they retreated using all the caution possible keeping down monk fired his supermachine pistol once more ham used his twice so far as they could tell they fit no one but they kept their foes down the high rail around the barge furnished shelter against anything but a highpowered rifle bullet monk turning over to stare at the windows in the barge deck house growled didnt somebody shoot at you from inside doc a bullet came through the door the bronze man admitted then wed better get out of sight of those windows monk pointed out who dyou reckon fired it ham answered that sidney lorrey of course bullets striking the barge rail had the sound of heavy hammer blows and where they topped the rail they dug out splinters and split the planks of the deck house basenstein was moaning over and over i hate violence i cannot stand it they are trying to kill us shut up monk advised another grenade made a great uproar and threw pieces of metal from some rusted machinery alongside which it exploded a young war monk growled trying to find a target for his supermachine pistol the cops will hear this and come running doc savage worked back and the others followed him they rounded a corner of the deck house where they were more perfectly sheltered beside a dark window ham stood erect hesitated then peered inside he could make out nothing he tried the sashand to his surprise it opened he shoved it up a voice inside the barge said wildly stay out of here stay out of here sidney lorreys voice rapped ham ive heard the man speak he was visiting his brother at our upstate place once stay out shrilled the voice in the barge it was made hollow by the acoustic tricks of the barge interior but the words were clearly distinguishable damn you shrieked sidney lorreys voice i wont let you get hold of me again ham yelled dont be a sap lorrey this is ham doc savage is here his answer was as phenomenal as if a firecracker had exploded in his face the roof came off the deck house and rode upward on a sheet of flame disintegrating as it arose some of the deck house wall folded outward the sides of the barge split the whole craft heeled and gory red flame jumped from every door window and crevice ham knocked backward by the concussion would have gone overboard had it not been for doc who seized his leg and kept him on deck the others lying prone at the moment were merely bounced about by the explosion upstream as the tide now flowed there was a flash and a great blaze of light there must have been an explosion too but their eardrums already punished by the blast on the barge failed to register it as more than a p of a noise the gasoline barge had been split apart and set afire gasoline was spreading over the water carried down by the slow ebb tide and moving toward sidney lorreys barge wed better vamoose monk gulped theres gonna be a real bonfire here in a minute the attackers on shore seemed as stunned as any one by the sudden pyrotechnics they were on their feet some staring some retreating perhaps the sound of police sirens in the distance had something to do with their withdrawal ham fired his supermachine pistol at the men but the dapper lawyer was still dizzy from the shock of explosion and he missed some one shot back with an automatic until the gun was empty then the attackers began to flee in a body monk waved an arm at the burning barge what about sidney lorrey he asked go on doc told him ill look around monk nodded with ham and pat he moved off the barge then all stopped and waited for doc savage they could see the bronze man working through the wreckage endeavoring to inspect the barge interior but the explosion had started a great fire in addition the burning gasoline was piling up around the barge the flames mounting setting the planking afire the heat was terrific already melting snow a score of yards back from the river doc savage moved swiftly venturing into what seemed like solid sheets of flames and basenstein moaned he will be burned there was another lesser explosion forward in the barge fire bad gotten to a fuel tank throwing sheets of flaming petroleum smoke mounting from the pyre was streaked with green and yellow and white undoubtedly coming from burning chemicals these chemical fires are bad monk yelled better get out of there doc the bronze man was already moving away from the blaze a great leap took him to the shore and he joined the others they ran away from the spot using caution half expecting their late assailants to rush them they were out of sight before police cars whined up followed by ambulances then a hook and ladder hose carts and a general emergency wagon doc savage watching noted that the police failed to discover the gunmen who had driven doc and his party aboard the barge i wonder what outfit them cookies belonged to monk pondered aloud referring to the gunmen dyou reckon they drove us onto the barge knowing it would blow up unlikely doc savage told him how dyou figure doc the bronze man did not answer he seemed not to have heard the inquiry basenstein pale and trembling asked did you find sidney lorrey the fire doc told him spread too quickly then sidney lorrey is dead ham said slowly and that means the finish of the crime annihilist monk echoed chapter xiii ultimatum monk was wrong in spite of what had happened to the unfortunate sidney lorrey the uncanny menace of the crime annihilist still existed they learned that when they reached rennys apartment doctor mortimer basenstein went to the apartment with them while they were still leaving the vicinity of the burning barge laboratory he had said i am sure those gunmen saw my face i am worried suppose they should try to take my life why should they ham countered i shall feel safer with you gentlemen said the other and doc savage agreed to that with a nod somewhat to the surprise of monk ham and pat the telephone was ringing when they entered rennys apartment after crossing the city furtively so as not to be sighted by the police doc savage answered the instrument monk crowded to his side hoping it was renny calling but the voice was one so utterly pleasant to hear that it caused monk to clench his fists and show his teeth in a snarl that would have done credit to a congo ape boke he gritted this i trust is the estimable doc savage boke inquired pleasantly what do you want doc asked emotionlessly to explain the affair at the barge a few moments ago boke replied over the wire in case you may be in doubt it was my men who attacked you they had made a previous attempt to board the barge and one of them ah met a misfortune i found his body doc admitted no doubt boke agreed i sent more of my men to get lorrey and they seem to have had the bad luck to arrive when you and your patty were there why doc questioned did you want sidney lorrey he is the crime annihilist said boke doc asked what do you want with me we want you to find sidney lorrey and commit him to a madhouse where he belongs said boke sidney lorreys voice spoke to us an instant before the explosion on the barge doc savage stated quietly after the blast i attempted to get his body out but the fire was too furious to get near the spot from which his voice had come boke screamed what that single wild exclamation of astonishment told doc savage and the others more about the mysterious boke than all they had learned prior to that moment for the ejaculation was in a different tone and the alteration showed that boke had been speaking in a disguised voice the deliciously pleasant tone was not his normal manner of speech what boke repeated you mean that sidney lorrey is dead doc savage half turned monk was on another telephone endeavoring frantically to have the call traced is that all you wanted with me the bronze man inquired wait boke gasped hurriedly you have got to find the crime annihilist he just killed another o my men why doc made his voice disinterested in some respects this crime annihilist is doing a service to humanity boke said wait i wish you to hear some one and there was a brief pause and a scuffle a thump as if a chair had been upset along with a few labored curses over the wire came rennys great booming tone dont do a damn thing these guys want you to doc renny rumbled as soon as they get this crime annihilist out of the way theyre going ahead with their original plan to seize one of the specialists from your upstate there were blows more grunts a squeal of some one in pain then boke resumed speaking your man seems never to get enough fighting he said dryly but you heard him you know we have him his safety is the price for your services find this crime annihilist get him in an insane asylum or in a jail and we will release this man renny on the other hand the crime annihilist who seems to have mastered a mysterious method of killing criminals will get you if i leave him alone doc said then renny will be free to walk out renny will not walk out from where we are putting him boke promised he will die without ever being found if anything happens to us doc savage began just what connection does my upstate institution have with boke said think my proposal over and hung up monk slammed his own telephone down waved his long arms and yelled that dumb telephone operator she kept insisting the wire you were talking on was out of order doc picked up the telephone over which bokes call had come listened and got only emptiness it is out of order he said briskly sounds as if it had been cut tapped ham yelled somewhere between here and the telephone exchange well make an examination doc rapped and swung out of the apartment at the door he told pat you stay here with basenstein monk and ham followed doc the telephone circuit they knew entered a master conduit which extended down through the tall apartment house to the basement where it connected with the regular conduits basenstein seemed nervous after doc and the other two had gone he kneaded his fingers together picked at splinters which his clothing had acquired during the action on the barge do you think there is any danger he asked pat sure pat said unkindly we all have an excellent chance of being killed basenstein put a wry twist on his lips that was meant for a smile you are quite a remarkable young woman fooey said pat i wonder if renny keeps anything to eat in this place she wandered off in the direction of the modernistic kitchen but it was significant that she kept her enormous singleaction sixshooter in hand instead of replacing it in the bag a peculiar change jerked over basenstein the instant pat was out of sight he whipped a pencil and a notebook from his pocket and wrote rapidly then he searched for something with which to weight the missive a silver half dollar served the purpose and he snapped a rubber band around this as silently as possible he made his way to the window thanks to the efficiency of modern construction it opened with a minimum of noise basenstein leaned out the street was a cold bleak expanse far below warmed but little by street lights and the lenses of parked taxicabs basenstein threw his message wrapped in the silver half dollar then followed it with his eyes and looked relieved when he saw it was going to land near the middle of the street a man detached himself from the shadows of a building across the street scuttled hurriedly and picked up the message he faded back into the murk basenstein put the window down quietly behind him pat said you after fresh air or something basenstein proved himself a consummate actor he pretended that he had just reached the window and he raised it high i am wondering if i can see doc savage below he said and thrust his head out making a show of glancing about then he closed the window and said no sign of him i put the percolator on pat advised this thing may go on for days and days before anybody gets any sleep there is stuff for sandwiches in the kitchen doc savage monk and ham came in from the outer corridor catching pats eye made an emptyhanded gesture wire was tapped in the basement he advised bird had flown nobody see nobody hear out of luck pat eyed doc what are we going to do the bronze man addressing them all advised you will stay here until i return or communicate with you monk asked pessimistically and if we dont hear from you where do we start looking for you at headquarters doc advised monk exploded but the police are watching doc savage said it is essential to use the headquarters laboratory for certain experiments then he went out down on the street it was not as dark but the wind was stronger and there was more snow in the air it was not snow falling from the thin clouds but hard flakes scooped up by the gale and whirled about with great violence doc savage selected a taxicab parked in a dark spot and entered it as he had done in another case earlier that night before the driver saw his face he reached up and switched off the dome light then directed the driver downtown the hackman was too cold to show interest in his fare but he did say id turn on the radio boss but the static is a fright tonight got worse the last couple of hours guess its this blizzard never mind doc told him at a street intersection where a traffic light went red they pulled up alongside a police car doc rolled down the cab window and heard the police shortwave set spewing noisy volumes of static one of the two officers in the car was working with the radio dial and cursing the cop looked up hastily then scowled at the radio for he was bearing a sudden weird trilling sound of fantastic unreal notes it was an exotic thing this trilling something that might have been a product of the cold night gale or a caprice of the radio the trilling died and the officer did not associate it with the presence of the taxicab which had now gone on three uniformed officers were on duty in the lobby of the skyscraper which housed doc savages headquarters the bronze man saw them as the taxicab drifted past in a whirl of snow he got out of the machine two blocks beyond walked a block to the right then two blocks north and swung into a side street which ran along the rear of the skyscraper it was doubtful if the police had learned of the basement garage which the bronze man maintained in the big building not even the building employees themselves for the most part knew of its existence doc savage let himself into the garage with its array of motor vehicles which ranged from a large innocentlooking moving van which was armored like a tank to a shabby ramshackle coupe which might possibly make a hundred and fifty miles an hour on a straightaway but which looked like a twentydollar job off a secondhand lot a narrow concrete corridor led the bronze man to a special highspeed elevator which in turn let him out on the eightysixth floor the corridor was empty the door of his headquarters was unprepossessing bearing in small bronze letters the inscription clark savage jr two of the three rooms inside were enormous with the smaller reception room and office they took in the entire floor of the titanic structure reception room and library doc savage ignored he entered the laboratory the bronze man went to work in the labyrinth of apparatus setting up electrical coils tubes connecting an audio amplifier of tremendous sensitivity and power most of the devices with which he tinkered would have been understood by an electrical engineer but there were a few so complex so unusual of design that even an expert on such things would have been baffled this laboratory held many things to be found nowhere else or perhaps at only one other spot a strange remote retreat to which this strange bronze man retired periodically to study and experiment shut off from the world so completely that none knew where to find him or how to get a message to him only doc savage himself knew of this other spot of its location rather monk ham and the rest of his aides knew of its existence knew he called it his fortress of solitude but that was all they knew the bronze man would simply disappear for days weeks maybe months and none would know his whereabouts then he would come back as mysteriously as he had gone and usually with him came some new discovery in the field of electricity chemistry surgery or another of the sciences at which he was skilled one thing monk and the others did agree upon these protracted periods of concentration away from every outside influence were responsible for the bronze mans fabulous knowledge outside the skyscraper laboratory the wind whooped and howled inside there was frequent noise always these noises possessed a sameness coming from loudspeakers which doc savage had hooked to his apparatus the sounds were akin to the crackle mutter and crash of ordinary radio static the minute hand on the chronometer crawled around and around the bronze mans wrist watch kept with it almost to the second where it lay after he had removed it and placed it aside to get it out of the magnetic fields of the apparatus with which he was working outside the wind suddenly stopped dead clouds went out of the sky the sun came up with what seemed like suddenness the telephone rang bokes utterly pleasant voice said this i trust is the estimable doc savage the bronze man reached swiftly to a button pressed it the bell which that button rang was an imperative order to the telephone operator to trace the call but boke was canny he spoke with great speed call rennys apartment he rapped then he hung up a moment later the operator was reporting i am very sorry but there was no time to trace that call doc savage said nothing but dialed the number of rennys apartment he got no answer the door of rennys apartment was closed but a loud voice penetrated through it the speaker was in a howling rage of all the lowdown infernal tricks the voice squawled ill tear your legs off ill feed you that sword cane quit bellowing you missing link snapped hams milder voice try to get loose ill haunt you monk bawled ill get in your hair and take it all out by the roots ham yelled its too damn bad they didnt take you instead of the hog basensteins voice said nervously gentlemen gentlemen please stop it doc savage his appearance showing no signs of the terrific rapidity with which he had come from his downtown headquarters to the apartment came in from the corridor and stood looking at the tableau in rennys modernistic living room monk ham and basenstein were arrayed on the floor tied with stout manila rope not only were their wrists and ankles bound securely but they were roped together in a chain so that the more they struggled the tighter their bonds became it was an expert job of tying doc savage went to work swiftly asking no questions his fingers showed their incredible strength in the speed with which the knots opened ham freed ahead of monk retreated uneasily from the glaring chemist you shyster monk bawled youd better take a running start or theyll be scraping you off the walls ham for once looking a bit concerned in front of monks rage began listen monk when i told them how much you thought of habeas corpus i didnt think monks roar drowned him out what happened doc demanded that fashion plate monk glared in hams direction half a dozen lugs came charging in they took us by surprise ham told em i thought more of habeas than i did of my right eye so they took the hog the instant monks ropes were loosened he tore them off and heaved erect his rusty hair bristled he showed all of his teeth and he charged ham purposefully basenstein moaned and covered his eyes in the manner of a man who expects to see murder done but monk never touched ham the gorillalike chemist came to a stop he rocked back on his heels foolishly then he grabbed at his head ouch he squawled my head a hideous thing was happening to monks eyes they were slowly protruding he groaned in agony sank down on the floor and held his head with both hands doc savage seized monk spread him out on the floor he got smelling salts from a medicine cabinet and hot black coffee which bubbled on the kitchen stove and administered both to monk the homely chemist sat up after a time his eyes normal again he looked about foolishly that popeyed business he exploded it got hold of me hell i aint no crook ham suddenly threw back his head and screamed he sank down on the floor rolled over and over hands clamped over his chest after a moment the others who had been startled realized he was gripped with paroxysms of laughter i always knew he gulped that the missing link was a crook at heart monk got up suddenly glaring fists clenched then he looked extremely pained his eyes seemed about to pop and he sat down and held his head damn the luck he groaned whenever i think of giving that shyster what hes got conning i get that goofy feeling ham went off into fresh mirth wheres pat doc savage asked ham stopped laughing as if he had been slapped he seemed to think deeply to realize how he had been laughing and he looked slightly sick they took her he said and his voice was hoarse low who did doc demanded those men who came in here with guns and tied us up ham elaborated they were bokes men basenstein pointed at the table and said they left a note for you mr savage doc went to the table the note was not in an envelope he held it up a plain white typewritten sheet folded once its rennys paper and they used rennys typewriter ham said grimly they wrote it out while they were here and the typist wore gloves doc savage read his own name then went on through the body of the typewritten missive we are entertaining your attractive cousin pat savage she will be kept with your other friend renny the two of them will be released when you have disposed of this mysterious crime annihilist we could of course have taken monk and ham but you will need assistance in finding this crime annihilist so we left them to help you ps the pig goes in the bargain boke basenstein said they were quite coldblooded and efficient on the contrary ham said they were scared stiff they were worried they fear this crime annihilist basenstein murmured i thought that you havent seen as many crooks as i have ham told him these babies were worried monk tapped his own chest i maintain this crime annihilist business is a phony it affects guys who aint crooks ham snorted unkindly if youre trying to prove that by your own case the evidence is not convincing doc savage said we are leaving new york city immediately basenstein jumped violently but why the bronze man went over and switched on a radio masked in a modernistic cabinet he did not tune in a station but set the dials on an empty frequency the set began to spew and crackle blazes muttered monk such static growing worse by the hour doc said quietly ham comprehending nearly dropped his sword cane you mean that this this static has something to do with the crime annihilist the bronze man nodded exactly the experiments in the laboratory proved it conclusively you say we are leaving the city basenstein murmured where are we going that doc told him will have to remain unknown to you we will go by plane and you will be blindfolded basenstein simply spread his hands in baffled agreement we will eat now doc said it may be some time before we get another chance chapter xiv boke decides doc savage monk and ham moved into the kitchenette where renny who was a skilled cook as well as a great engineer kept a store of food which he prepared himself on occasion i am not hungry basenstein said miserably and sat down in a chair you will be when you smell the grub monk told him basenstein remained in the front room looking very down cast but the moment the other three men were out of sight he produced his pencil and paper furtively and began to write he scribbled briefly and in great haste his efforts to find more silver coins to weight this missive were futile so with an animated grimace of regret he contributed his watch to the purpose as before he got the window up silently took a careful aim and hurled his message then he carefully shut the window the wind had died completely in the chill morning calm the note fell with scarcely a flutter landing in the street basenstein winced as it hit for the watch had been an expensive one a man bundled to the eyes in topcoat and muffler ran out into the street scooped up the note and the wreck that bad been the watch and retreated he did not glance upward or otherwise behave suspiciously the man had been waiting inside an apartment house doorway but he did not return to that spot instead he walked down the street not too rapidly and turned the first corner he seemed to be searching for a taxicab there was only one machine parked near by and he entered it drive north he directed the hackman put his vehicle into motion and as he did so he reached down to a secluded spot under the seat and grasped a small wire which had a ring in the end he pulled this out and held it several moments in the rear of the hack the passenger was reading the message which basenstein had thrown from the window of rennys apartment he made a clucking sound of surprise as he noted the contents savage has crime annihilist secret and is leaving the city for mysterious purpose the reader absently put a hand over his mouth and coughed he coughed again more violently then seemed to strangle slightly suddenly his eyes flew wide and he wrenched at the door handle ўlemme out of this damned thing he yelled the driver grinned wolfishly but the faintness of the passenger words showed that the cab body was as nearly soundproof as it could be made the fare was still wrenching at the door handle but the door mysteriously locked would not open the passengers struggles became weaker he still gagged and coughed and beat his chest in a few moments he sagged down on the floorboards and his spasmodic kicking subsided the cab driver turned into a side street reached around and opened the cab door easily from the outside he drove for a few moments to let the gas which had overcome the fare be swept out by the inrush of fresh air then the chauffeur felt under the seat to make certain the gas container trip valve operated by pulling the concealed wire was closed stopping the machine the driver got out he felt the wrist of the man in the rear there was a strong pulse the driver appropriated the message then he hauled the unconscious passenger out dumped him on the sidewalk got back behind the wheel and drove off rapidly the taxi driver turned west ignored two shivering citizens who tried to flag him down and crossed central park on one of the express lanes which were sunken below the sidewalks bridle paths and boulevards he pulled to the curb before a brownstone house in the fifties got out and entered a door which was dropped three steps below the sidewalk level the door was barred heavily on the inside and a thickshouldered man stood behind it something for the boss said the driver the man at the door lifted one thick shoulder toward the upper regions but said nothing the driver mounted a narrow stairway it was dark in the house the air was warm and smelled of mimosa the message carrier came to a door shoved through and grinned sourly at the muzzles of several pistols which were trained in his direction whats the idea of not knockin somebody snarled nuts to you said the driver and went to a door opened it and admitted himself into the kitchen there was a dumbwaiter shaft and he opened the door of this boke he called into the shaft it was a brief moment before the utterly pleasant voice of boke demanded well what is it this phony basenstein threw a note out of doc savages window said the driver i glommed onto it send it up boke requested complying with the order the driver reached into the shaft grasped the ropes and ran the dumbwaiter down he weighted the note in place using a heavy pistol cartridge for the purpose and ran the platform back up then he listened a moment later he grinned up above wherever he lurked the mysterious boke was cursing heartily and there was little laughter in his voice what fools we are boke swore expressively the whole thing is perfectly clear you mean you know who the crime annihilist is the driver demanded of course said boke who is he this note you just delivered gave it away said boke see if you cannot figure it out in the meantime wait down there tell the doorman that we shall have callers shortly he is to admit them when they give the password desperate measures what are these guys gonna be do not worry about that said boke you will be able to recognize most of them that terminated the conversation and the driver left the dumbwaiter shaft at the top of the shaft the room from which boke had spoken was dark the curtains being drawn tightly and additional heavy draperies spread out to shut off every vestige of outside light the figure of boke himself was completely lost in the black void the door of the room was opened and boke stepped out he crossed a hallway and entered a room in which patricia savage renny and janko sultman were bound and gagged the pig habeas corpus was tethered in a corner by a chain renny eyed boke intently the bigfisted engineer was seeking to pick out details about the mans appearance which would later serve to identify him he was seeing as much of boke as he had ever seen for boke wore a long topcoat a grotesquely long topcoat which was like a robe and covered even his shoes above that a muffler was tied colored glasses and a hat so huge that it sat down over bokes cars topped off the disguise boke presented a ridiculous figure he was a laughable apparition but the disguise was effective he stood over janko sultman and looked at the latters upstanding frizzled hair sultmans small mustache was pulled out of shape by the gag which distended his jaws you are a clever rascal boke stated reluctantly and laughter and pleasantness was once more in his voice even if you did try to doublecross me janko sultman made inarticulate sounds around his gag i hired you to investigate this college which doc savage maintains in upstate new york boke continued the way you did it shows you are clever i need clever men now therefore i think i shall give you another chance sultman croaked more vehemently at this boke bent down untied sultman and removed the gag then straightened swiftly and stepped back hands buried in the topcoat pockets where bulges indicated the presence of guns come boke directed we will have a conference downstairs pat and renny glared as boke and sultman left the room sultman stumbled as he moved for he was stiff from being tied it was some moments before he spoke what about lizzie he demanded lizzie boke laughed dryly hollowly during the night lizzie passed away with his eyes protruding you mean hes dead sultman gulped exactly boke agreed he was a victim of the crime annihilist sultman was introduced into the presence of the men in the room downstairs these looked him over so viciously that sultman frightened slunk into a corner seated himself and said absolutely nothing boke now retired to another room taking up a telephone he proceeded to make numerous calls at all times he used a disguised voice the name of boke did not seem unknown to the individuals he called and when the pleasant voice requested their presence at a conference aimed at their own good most of them agreed a few though did refuse suspiciously but boke seemed to think his average was very good outside the city streets were beginning to fill although the hour was unnaturally early it was especially notable that many of the pedestrians carried traveling bags and were headed in the direction of railway stations fear was on almost every face women were nervous and here and there one was hysterical the people bought newspapers read them and became grim and pale more than one individual started for his office got as far as the nearest newsstand bought a paper then read it and went back and packed his baggage the headlines were unbelievable the story was the most fantastic within the memory of many almost fifty persons had died in new york city during the previous night the eyes of all had protruded baffled physicians were now advocating that the city be evacuated for nowhere else in america was any one dying with his eyes popping boards of health in nearby cities it was reported were holding hasty sessions to decide if it would not be best to quarantine new yorkers in order that the popeyed malady might not spread a specialist had arrived from chicago and was as mystified as anybody as to the cause of the deaths an astronomer who was something of a publicity hound had declared he believed mysterious atomic streams were being shot to the earth from outer space and were causing the strange deaths his statements were given quite a play and his picture was prominent he based his declaration on the unusual amount of static every one was hearing on their radios indeed the static was now so bad that the police radio cars were helpless to receive calls radio engineers were investigating the phenomenon and most of them attributed it to the storm and to spots on the sun the only fault with this theory was that the astronomical observers insisted there had been no unusual number of sun spots at midmorning came the supreme surprise extra editions brought the report all of the popeyed death victims were criminals john henry cowlton the park avenue playboy who had been the first victim had been discovered to be a clever society jewel thief with many robberies and at least one murder on his record everett buckett the wall street wolf who was the second victim was a leader in an enormous stockswindling gang and at least two persons they bad swindled had been murdered to shut their mouths and so it went down the list the police were now madly at work investigating records of the dead and in most cases they were finding plenty to show that the corpse in life had been far from honest individuals who had been supposedly possessors of lilywhite characters were being found to have been crooks there were exceptions but the police freely intimated they expected to find these were crooks too strangely enough this did not quiet the citizens of new york if anything the horror increased not all of the dead crooks were persons who had committed heinous crimes one man had been beating his wife when he fell dead with his eyes sticking out the newspapers became wilder if possible they freely predicted that something had happened to the world starting in new york city and that every dishonest man was going to die no matter how small his offense against society it was surprising how many people began to remember little slips it was surprising the frantic efforts they took to remedy them too the mission down on the bowery reported an increase in converts unusual numbers of persons were observed entering churches police stations began to receive nervous visitors who wished to confess crimes thinking that might help these first comers were usually petty offenders then some great brain down at police headquarters got an idea he promptly gave out an interview saying he was sure that these crooks who confessed their crimes were safe from the popeyed death the newspapers printed that and the cops sat back to reap a heavy harvest of scared crooks long before noon however the first of a series of sinister visitors arrived at the house now occupied by the mysterious boke and his gang this individual arrived in a large car driven by a chauffeur and his machine was preceded and followed by two other cars in each of which rode four grimlooking bodyguards the escort cars parked up the street while the man in the limousine alighted and entered the house the doorman goggled at the visitor recognizing him as one of the most famous barons of the alky racket during prohibition days the big shot was now the king of the policy racket and considered to be many times a millionaire the czar of crime looked scared shortly afterward more visitors arrived without exception they were gang leaders they were not only crooks and killers these men they were gentry who had attained a point where they hired lesser thugs to do their dirty work they were the overlords of crime it was a choice collection which finally gathered in the upstairs room fully threefourths of the organized crime in new york city and environs was represented boke appeared he still wore his comedy character disguise of long overcoat and muffler and colored spectacles some one growled at boke that he was among friends and hed better get out of his disguise if he knew what was good for him but boke told the speaker to go to hell then began making a speech so pleasant was bokes voice that every one was held spellbound boke recited the names of some of the victims of the past nights holocaust names which were very well known to most of those present mention of the bankers however brought forth scowls for these professional crooks considered their operations amateur competition you will notice gentlemen that all of the unfortunate victims are men outside the law said boke nix said a fat crook the law aint got a thing on me but i had one of them spells anyhow i damn near croaked boke said patiently what i meant was that every one who has died was to put it bluntly a criminal if you want to use nicer words call them unsocial individuals somethings poppin off the damn crooks said one fellow bluntly so what i think it is time we did something about it boke announced otherwise we are all likely to die just how many of you men have had queer feelings in your heads during the night considering that some of the crooks out of pride and maybe from force of habit lied about it it was evident that a large number of them had experienced seizures or had men in their gangs who had had the spells boke stated i want you to work with me and take my orders an individual known as the crime annihilist is causing these deaths he is out to rid the world of criminals i am probably the only living man who knows who the crime annihilist is boke said all of that very rapidly so no one could get in an objection before it was all out then he gave them time to think it over some of these big shots had gained their positions by shooting all competitors and had brains which worked very slowly so boke gave them plenty of time then boke passed the note around savage has crime annihilist secret and is leaving the city for mysterious purpose that came from a very reliable source said boke the filched message came back to boke he then read it aloud slowly and distinctly every one present had pretended to read the missive but boke knew that some of the big shots could not read a word and he did not want to embarrass anybody doc savage a poultry racketeer chief snarled ive been afraid of that guy for years thinkin he might get on my trail but i never thought hed pull anything like this its savage another snapped emphatically the bronze guy is a mental wizard he can do anything hes thought up some way of wipin out criminals wholesale another man groaned boys lets all catch a steamer for europe until this blows over and give up my sweet pickins jeered the man beside him not much but supposing the crime annihilist is not doc savage said another man everything points to savage as the crime annihilist boke told them at first i suspected a man named sidney lorrey but he ah went insane and killed himself by blowing up his laboratory on a barge i read about that fire in the paper said a voice i have captured two of doc savages very close friends boke said pleasantly one is his cousin patricia savage the other is the engineer renny i have told doc savage to produce the crime annihilist or the two prisoners will be killed the assembled masterminds of crime looked at boke with a new interest for the love of little dogs one muttered you went up against that bronze guy and got away with it i did boke stated with some pride furthermore i have kept several jumps ahead of him what do you advise doing a voice queried keep close track of doc savage boke announced then lead the bronze man into a trap using my two prisoners as bait an evilfaced man in the back of the room yelled and then let me have im ill take care of im he drew a big automatic waved it dramatically the gun arm gesticulated more and more violently then the bloodthirsty mans other arm joined in waving and he began to stagger around and make gargling noises this persisted for some moments while the others stared in horror the victim fell down on the floor kicked violently rolled over on his back and became quiet his eyes were almost out of their sockets chapter xv upstate doctor mortimer basenstein at the precise instant that the gang leader died in bokes presence was feeling desperately in his coat pocket for the book of blank papers on which he had been writing his notes basenstein was worried he had laid his coat aside for a moment while he shaved and the book of blanks had disappeared basenstein walked nervously around the living room looking behind modernistic divans and under chairs but without locating his vanished property he went to a door and peered through then stood there for a moment fascinated doc savage was taking his exercises rather he was just completing them monk sat on a bed and after a casual glance at basenstein when he first appeared continued to watch doc and perspire monk always perspired when he watched doc work out such was the power of suggestion provoked by the bronze mans strenuous routine for nearly two hours the bronze man had been working out going through a ritual to which he had adhered with daily regularity since childhood he had already finished the musclebuilding part of the exercises which were similar to the ordinary physical culture movements although more strenuous a portable case contained other and more unusual appurtenances to the exercise routine these consisted of a device which emitted sound waves above and below the audible range careful use of which had in the course of years given the bronze man an almost supersensitive hearing there was a collection of phials holding various odors and the bronze man identified these repeatedly to make more delicate his sense of smell he read pages of braille printing the system of upraised dots designed for the blind to sharpen his sense of touch and there were other devices more complex which he had designed himself the bronze mans giant frame showed little evidence of fatigue although he had not slept during the night basenstein went back and continued his hunt for his note book but with no greater luck than before a few moments later doc savage entered the room and strolled casually toward the window he bent suddenly moved a corner of a small rug then straightened he held the missing book of blank sheets this yours he asked basenstein basenstein made a pretense of feeling of his pocket then smiled why yes i believe it is it must have dropped out of my pocket basenstein took the pad of blanks and masked a relieved sigh as he pocketed them there had been nothing written on them so no harm was done but he needed those blanks for future secret messages a bit later doc savage joined monk in the bedroom ham was not present in the apartment he smell a rat monk asked softly no doc replied i believe he thought he actually had dropped the book of blanks monk now slipped from a pocket the uppermost sheet which had lately adhered to basensteins pad of blank paper the sheet had been treated in a manner familiar to police experts by the use of chemicals as a result the tracings of messages which had been written atop it were discernible as faint lines fortunately they had not been written one exactly atop the other so it was not difficult to read them the first stated doc savage got orders to find crime annihilist on pain of having renny killed the second was the missive which had eventually found its way under the eyes of the mysterious boke this basenstein is a phony monk growled hes a spy obviously doc agreed monk got up im gonna bump im around a little and start him talking wait doc said we will let him play along with us the homely monk squinted at the bronze man you dont very often have an idea that sounds as nutty as that unperturbed doc said we may find use for this basenstein the telephone rang it was ham all set he advised two hours later doc savage was maneuvering a trimotored speed plane through the bumpy air over the mountainous upstate section of new york the clouds were low and thick and the air surprisingly warm for a sudden thaw warm winds out of the south had followed the storm snow still remained on the hilltops but it was melting rapidly and sheets of water covered the bottoms of draws the small meadows streams were writhing torrents of muddy water ham occupied the cockpit with the bronze man ham looked very unlike his usual self his face being darker and his hair possessing a reddish color this was part of the disguise ham had donned in order to assemble equipment without being molested by the police the job had fallen on ham because he possessed a physical appearance less striking than that of doc savage or the gorillalike monk monk came forward leaned close and growled that mug basenstein is at it again what now doc asked hes writing notes monk advised whenever we pass over a town he drops one out i had noticed that doc admitted monk blinked his small eyes well aint we gonna do anything about it this guy will get to thinking hes good after while let him alone doc said he may prove very useful grumbling under his breath monk retreated to the rear of the cabin ham asked curiously when did you first get wise to this basenstein when he joined us at sidney lorreys barge laboratory doc replied good night ham exploded how remember that i looked around the vicinity of the barge when we came near it doc asked yes ham nodded and you found basenstein skulking i also found several men waiting in the background doc said they were wondering if basenstein would succeed in deceiving us ham exploded and you let boke think his agent this basenstein had taken us in from the first what was th monk yelled thar she blows the terrain below had become wilder more rugged a single road a trail barely discernible in the murky afternoon light progressed through the timber following creeks and tiny valleys for the most part the road ended at a massive metal gate from the gate a high stout wire fence ran in a circle which enclosed many acres this fence woven surmounted with barbed strands was fully fifteen feet high from the air it looked as if the fence enclosed only a small lake and a log building which might have been a hunting lodge on one side of the lake shoving its bald mass up to a considerable prominence was a hill which seemed to be of solid gray stone there was nothing else inside the fence just the lodge the lake and the bleak stone hill but back from the gate perhaps a mile surmounting a hill of its own was a small unpretentious cabin doc savage studied that cabin at great length through the binoculars then he sent the plane down over the fenced enclosure and circled the lodge near the gate a man came out of the lodge which was situated near the gate he wore rough woods garments and might have been a caretaker he looked up at the plane doc savage turned the controls over to monk leaned from the cabin window and made semaphore signals with his arms below the man on the ground laid himself fiat on his back so that his own semaphored reply might be more distinguishable his arms jerked to various angles ham going back in the plane cabin chose the moment of the signaling to stumble and fall headlong onto basenstein with the result that their passenger if he could read the semaphore signals missed out on them doc savage drew back and said everything is quiet then he resumed the controls and sent the plane away from the strange enclosure strange because there was no good reason why any one should want to fence off so thoroughly a piece of ground in this wilderness the plane was an amphibian and the bronze man cracked the landing wheels up so that the floats were clear for a descent on water blazes monk whispered arent we gonna land at the college and give the secret away to basenstein doc countered we could pitch him overboard monk suggested hopefully no doc replied basenstein is serving a very useful purpose he may save us a great deal of trouble monk sighed blasted if i get this the plane swept over another small lake doc tilted the craft down pinched the throttles and changed the propeller pitch wing flaps made automatic adjustment for their decreased speed they settled on the lake surface without undue commotion or shock the water was murky with mud and when doc cut the three motors they could hear the gurgle and roar of freshets emptying into the lake there was still snow under the larger trees but it was fast melting the ground was all but covered with a film of water even the air seemed saturated a swell time for camping out monk complained stay in the plane doc advised it will be more comfortable but monk and ham both spilled out in the shallow water and waded ashore with the bronze man leaving basenstein behind in the plane listen doc monk said hopefully how about giving us the lowdown yes ham put in just what is behind this seemingly pointless trip up here the crime annihilist and his work the bronze man said slowly unless my guess is wrong we will find the whole solution near here then the bronze man moved away seemingly without baste and stepped behind a clump of small evergreens monk and ham waited for him to reappear became suddenly suspicious and ran to the thicket the bronze man was gone dang it monk complained and endeavored to follow docs trail he lost it within a few yards you might as well give it up you hairy mistake ham advised doc suspects some one but has no proof so he will not express an opinion they stood there snapping at each other quarrelsomely it occurred to neither to glance back toward the plane which was at the moment shut off from their view by brush in the plane cabin basenstein was furtively busy the big aircraft was fitted with radio transmittingandreceiving apparatus and basenstein was crouched before the instrument panel the set was a strange one and he showed by the facility with which he got it in operation that he was not unfamiliar with radio apparatus he raised the wavelength adjustment slightly then cut the microphone into circuit and spoke rapidly basenstein reporting he repeated over and over basenstein reporting report directed a voice over the receiver doc savage landed plane on lake basenstein stated into the transmitter then gave a surprisingly accurate description of the lakes whereabouts excellent said the operator of the other radio any further information on who the crime annihilist is basenstein hesitated i have been thinking he said at last doc savage is acting very strangely about this affair i think his own men are puzzled it may be that doc savage is actually the crime annihilist i think that myself said the distant one basenstein declared it is dangerous for me to talk then he severed the radio connection he carefully returned the dials to the setting at which he had found them and lifted his head to see if he had been observed he could see no one he thrust his head out of the cabin and could hear ham and monk squabbling monk and ham as they inevitably did when together for long had gotten around to personalities and the matter of habeas corpus you hairy freak ham snapped that hog has been a pain to me from the beginning and i hereby state that what has happened to him does not worry me at all monk glared he opened and shut his hairy hands maybe it doesnt now he growled but its going to later because if anything has happened to that hog im gonna work out on that neck of yours any time youre ready ham invited and flourished his sword cane meaningly monk scowled and picked up a convenient limb the bough was as thick as his arm but the homely chemist handled it as a schoolmaster would a switch he started for ham purposefully then he pulled up dropped the limb looked dazed and grasped his head his eyes popped the merest trifle blazes he gulped and sat down heavily owww my head ham said i should cut your throat and put you out of your misery and smiled widely monk glowered tried to get up then relaxed grimacing as a fresh burst of pain seized him what ails you ham asked cheerfully that crime annihilist funny feeling in my head damn you monk grated you get it every time you try to jump me dont you ham asked hopefully yes blast you monk admitted hams large orators mouth stretched in a smile that threatened his ears he leaned on his sword cane and began to speak in a gentle unhurried tone there were many things which ham had long wanted to tell monk but had not dared monk with his apish strength could whip half a dozen like ham and the dapper lawyer knew it the knowledge had tied his tongue but now he unburdened himself he went far back in the niches of his memory and dug up choice expletives goading personalities and plain insults he heaped them on monk with an unholy joy he became flushed and started perspiring and his eyes turned bright and he stopped frequently for a good laugh monk sat and took it several times he got to his feet as if intent on slaughtering ham regardless of the consequences but the terror of the mysterious crime ann ihilists spell overtook him and forced him back he finally stuffed a little finger in each ear ham waxed more and more eloquent the memory of all the past insults monk had ladled out all of the irritations monk had wrought with the aid of his pet pig his ventriloquism came back to hams thoughts they were legion and ham got verbal revenge for all of them the moment was to stick in hams memory as the biggest of his lifetime he had long wanted to goad monk to the limit when the hirsute chemist was in a position where he could not talk back but hams enjoyment came to a rough ending a plane dropping down out of the sky with motors shut off so that it made little noise was almost overhead before it was noticed even then monk and ham did not discover it a wild yell from basenstein drew their attention to the yellow amphibian men leaned out of the plane overhead they held black lumpish objects in their hands while their craft was still some distance away they began hurling the objects overboard the things burst in the brush with plopping violence ham who had been addressing monk as if the homely chemist were his bitterest living enemy suddenly shed his animosity i got a lot more to tell you he snapped i want you alive to hear it then he seized monk helped him erect and tried to aid him in reaching cover but the plane was too fast for them passing overhead it left a rain of the black metal things which burst dully and monk and ham suddenly felt the painful bite of tear gas in their eyes they were almost instantly helpless monk hanging trees and brush in an effort to flee the vicinity yelled dang you ham if you hadnt been making so much noise we would have heard that sky wagon ham said shut up and run you hairy accident over toward the lake they could hear more of the big teargas bombs bursting basenstein was yelling something that they could not understand then the noise of the plane motor above decreased sharply they caught the whine of air in flying wires then the noisy rush of water as it landed on the little lake staccato bursts of the motor brought it closer monk and ham knowing fully just how helpless they were bent every effort to leaving the vicinity but they heard men running behind them men who came closer with a speed which proved that they were wearing protective masks some one struck monk heavily from behind then strangely enough the one who had struck the blow began to cry out in pain you fools said the utterly pleasant voice of boke keep calm dont get excited this crime annihilist thing only hits you when youre excited dot is true called janko sultmans slightly foreign accent hard things which could only be gun muzzles menaced monk and ham they were roughed about and being helpless blinded as they were had of necessity to surrender a triumphant gang of captors herded them back toward the planes after handcuffs were linked on their wrists monk reaching the lake and being ordered to wade out to the planes fell down purposefully so that the tear gas was washed from his eyes this and the fact that its effects were already wearing off enabled him to see a little staring at his captors he identified janko sultman at once several other faces familiar to him puzzled him briefly then he realized he had seen them in the newspapers they were the faces of bigshot criminals monk searched for boke and was disgusted when he discovered that the individual who must be boke was effectively disguised by a flying suit and a muffler tied across his features where is doc savage boke demanded monk ignored that and roved his eyes until he located basenstein the plump physician was standing to one side but two of the plane arrivals were positioned close to him you called this gang monk yelled angrily i did not basenstein snapped one of the men beside basenstein demanded of the physician where is doc savage i dont know you damned rascal said basenstein the questioner instantly launched a terrific blow with his fist basenstein staggered backward splashed flat in the water and his split lips oozing crimson reddened the cold lake about his face youll damned well talk yelled the man who had struck the blow he seemed about to say more but instead seized his own head with both hands and moaned the crime annihilist his eyes were protruding a little take the two planes boke directed calmly everybody aboard monk eyes still streaming peered wonderingly at basenstein as he was lifted and flung into one of the planes monk was very puzzled basenstein did not seem to be a member of bokes crew almost together the two planes took the air chapter xvi double trap doc savage was almost two miles away and traveling back toward the small lake with all the speed of which his trained sinews were capable when he heard the two planes take off he had heard the strange aircraft approach the lake and had turned back the bronze man halted stood listening long enough to realize that the two planes were headed in such a direction as to fly near where he stood then he moved swiftly to one side entering a clearing where he could signal the planes with some chance of being seen the trimotored ship which doc monk ham and basenstein had flown into the woods country appeared almost at once doc gestured the pilot apparently saw him immediately for the big ship heeled around in the sky and came sliding toward him the bronze man watched the quality of the flying intently it was a sloppy job either monk or ham would handle the controls far more expertly warned that something was wrong the bronze man retreated hastily instantly men popped heads and shoulders out of the plane cabin they pointed rifles revolvers submachine guns and sawedoff shotguns tufts of woodland loam began to jump up around doc then came the reports of the weapons distinguishable over the sound of the planes the second plane heeled in this pilot was more expert he kept his craft near the stalling point air speed at a minimum and some one in the ship had a regulation aircraft machine gun its ammo cans charged with tracers slugs ran down in a weaving gray string chattered in the mud splashed pools of melted snow snipped twigs off the trees doc savage whipped from one scanty shelter to another the trees here were not evergreens moreover the surroundings had been burned off a few years ago so that the trees which now grew were young thin things offering almost no safety below the clearing was a creek a roaring torrent almost full from bank to bank with snow water and doc headed for that there were overhangs which might furnish shelter visible along the rim of the stream again and again the planes dived raining lead the bronze man dipped a hand inside his clothing brought out a tiny chemical smoke bomb of his own concoction and tossed it down beside him so that the blooming cloud of black smoke enveloped and hid him he had used these smoke bombs to escape on other occasions but it did not work this time bokes men in the planes simply swooped low and emptied out nearly half a bushel of teargas bombs doc was driven on toward the creek bokes plane dived again every cabin window crowded with gunners they were experts with weapons these men they had lived by them for years a delighted yell went up as doc savage caved down suddenly the pilot banked hastily they could see the bronze giant squirming on the ground could make out a flood of crimson spreading over his shirt front hes hit bad boke shrilled then they saw doc drag out smoke bombs one two three of them he flung them to the right left and ahead so that a great cloud of black spread over where he lay the planes continued to dive and pour lead into the smoke the roar of motors and the stutter and bang of guns mingling in a holocaust of sound a slight breeze stirring through the soaked woods pummeled the smoke shoved it aside pushed it out over the stream boke cursed shrilly through the muffler that he wore over his face for he had sighted a twisted form below reposing under the scanty shelter of a tree he crawled away in the smoke boke yelled there he is get him the plane moaned down jerked its nose up and screwed a tight bank guns clamored branches fell off the tree under which the form lay bark showered mud splashed water geysered the form itself jerked about as bullets pummeled it flying mud covered it until it was hardly distinguishable again and again the planes dived and the attackers emptied gun magazines then triumphant as chicken hawks which had made a kill the two craft spiraled in search of a landing place the clearing where they had first sighted doc savage was too small to permit either ship to be set down and there was no other opening of consequence near no need of landing anyway boke shouted pleasantly hes dead janko sultman plump and excited scrambled to bokes side and gripped the masterminds arm der crime annihilist he bellowed it is not harm us it is no more boke settled back in his seat there was wild relief in his laugh right be yelled amiably over the motor roar every time we became excited or tried to kill that infernal spell of the crime annihilist would strike but this time it did not how you explain dot sultman pondered in a shout boke waved an arm back at the creek bank where a bullettorn mudsplattered form lay under a ripped tree the crime annihilist is dead he said it may be that we will never know how he did it sultman shook his head slowly dot was a strange thing dot crime annihilist thing boke now went forward spoke to his pilot and the aviator began looking around for a clearing in the woods finding one he set his plane down expertly enough cut the motor then turned in his seat to watch the other ship alight and taxi up alongside every one got out excepting an armed guard watching over monk ham and basenstein the big shots disported themselves like small boys at the dismissal hour on the last day of school their evil minds had been relieved of a burden and they showed it the future looked rosy they gathered around boke lets get back to the big burg one grinned ill throw a party to celebrate said another itll be a party to end all parties boy ill spend ten grand on it wheres the guy who wanted to go to europe shouted a third delightedly lets ride im on a rail i move we make up a kitty for boke yelled some one ill put in ten grand to start the ball and i move this guy boke peel that muffler off his face so we can see who he is bawled a voice boke held up an arm motioning for silence keep your money he said you owe me plenty for showing you how to get rid of this crime annihilist i want you to pay off by doing me a favor now what the hell somebody growled unmask him suggested a tough voice ive heard of this baby boke and thats why i strung along with him but now i want to see his map boke took a small automatic from his clothing i have a very good reason for keeping my face hidden he said if you could see my face you would understand why they looked at the automatic not knowing just how to take its threat some one asked just what do you want us to do want you to raid doc savages criminal curing college and force some of the surgeons there to divulge certain information said boke college a beefy racketeer muttered whatre you talkin about buddy boke began speaking he told of the fact that criminals who became entangled with doc savage had in the past disappeared and now this had made him suspicious he had hired janko sultman he explained to investigate and sultman had by months of painstaking investigation learned that doc savage maintained a strange institution in upstate new york where he made honest men of these crooks we got hold of a minor attendant about the place and bribed him boke explained from him we learned that doc savage had discovered that crime is in a sense a disease in other words there is a small gland in the human body the secretions of which have a great deal to do with whether a man is a satisfied citizen or a coldblooded criminal with no sense of right and wrong whats this all leadin up to someone interrupted doc savage treats this gland making it function normally said boke or rather his surgeons at the institution do the treating boke paused in order that suspense might rivet the attention of his listeners upon his next words these surgeons know how to treat this crime gland so as to make a criminal as well as cure him he stated it is that secret i want the knowledge of how to make criminals nuts growled a voice whats the idea wherell that put anything in your pocket you lack imagination boke chuckled it is my plan to seize bankers industrial magnates politicians and administer them the drug which will make them criminals they will not know what is being done later myself or my agents will approach these men and enlist them in my unlawful enterprises they will accept having access to thousands even millions of dollars they will as criminals appropriate those funds i will make it my business to see that a share of the money gets into my hands this commented one of the big shots is the goofiest thing i ever heard of boke said patiently i have thought it all out with great care it will work the men i make into criminals will not know exactly how crimes are committed and they will be highly susceptible to the clever schemes which i put under their noses do i get this right asked a man who seemed more intelligent than the rest you want to raid this college to get hold of a drug which will destroy a mans sense of right and wrong exactly said boke im with you said the other arguments and discussions followed with some of the masterminds of crime holding out but their reluctance was not too strong and it was evident in a subtle way that boke would win their aid half an hour later they entered the planes and took to the air when doc savage monk ham and basenstein had flown over the area so strangely fenced off in the wilderness there had been no sign of human life excepting the one man who had appeared at the log lodge near the gate there were fully two hundred men in sight now they were all attired exactly alike in neat white uniforms except for an individual here and there who was dressed in blue the men in white were arrayed in neat squads and were going through marches and physicalculture exercises commanded by the men in blue a few of the white garbed figures strolled about obviously relaxing these men in white were former criminals although their present appearance gave no indication of that fact they were healthy cleareyed and each was developing an excellent set of muscles not one of these men could remember any of his past life each could recall opening his eyes in a white room in this strange enclosure in the wilderness that was all over by the log lodge which was not large enough to shelter a fraction of the men visible within the enclosure a man was seated before a switchboard and an array of amplifiers he wore an ordinary telephone headset and was reading a late magazine suddenly he straightened gave the amplifier knobs judicious turns and an intent expression came over his face he turned to another man who was clad in the blue regalia listening device has picked up the sound of plane motors he stated sounds like two ships the other man went to a button pressed it three times and three great donging noises came from a gong concealed somewhere the results were miraculous the men in white formed lines in doublequick time and marched for the hill of grayish rock doors opened in the apparently solid stone and the files of men streamed through and were lost to sight within a very few minutes no one was left in sight in the whole fencedin area the man at the listening post continued to wait it was not often that airplanes passed over this remote region but when they did the patients at the strange college were whisked from view due to the contour of the surrounding country it was only from an airplane that the whiteclad patients could be seen the planes appeared two of them the man at the listening post recognized docs big trimotored craft but the other ship was a stranger the man went outside and semaphored a question with his arms his answer was a stream of machinegun bullets which sent him racing wildly for shelter possibly boke considered the strange institution below one conceived only as a retreat where mens souls were remade and their lives altered and as such a place without armament he must not have known that doc savage in planning the place had foreseen the possible contingency of a gang of criminals trying to rescue one of their number from an unwelcome life of honesty there were many reasons why gangsters would want members of their tribe out of the place so as boke suddenly discovered thorough defense mechanism had been installed this was the first time it had ever been used at numerous points what looked like ordinary stretches of damp woodland loam slid back uncovering neatly whitewashed concrete gun pits the weapons these housed were not large nor were they toys either the gun muzzles lifted and began to follow the planes this was uncanny because there was no hand guiding the weapons in the pits aiming was done by a blueclad man at a concealed station he simply sighted at one of the planes through a telescope which was attached to slides and cogs and when he had crossed hairs on the craft he pressed a lever the guns began firing the man in the remote firecontrol station turned a lever and the white puffs of bursting shells they opened too high at first crawled down toward the plane not aiming at it but ahead the aircraft pummeled and rent by the metallic storm banked away but something had gone wrong with its power plant and it labored along the pilot tried to climb and discovered his control wires were damaged he barely made it over the hill and into a feathery clump of evergreens where he stalled away what speed he had and consigned himself to whatever goddess of luck that looks out for airmen good or bad and the goddess came through the plane lost its wings undercarriage part of the empennage the cabin went flat small boughs pierced it the noise was heard for two miles the pilot crawled out picking glass parts of the instrument panel from his features looked around and heaved a great sigh men were getting out of the wreckage some more banged up than others but it was evident they were all going to be able to walk away from it overhead the other plane circled boke was riding in that one and it was evident that unexpected discovery that the college was a hornets nest had temporarily discouraged him chapter xvii hardboileds mistake doc savage did not hear the roar as the plane crashed but be did see the white fruit of bursting antiaircraft shells which preceded the crackup and be caught the distant pungs as the shells exploded although it was very faint the bronze man lay on the banks of the roaring stream but not at the point where bullets had been rained from the planes he was downstream there was a bullet hole through his herculean torso the slug fortunately had come from a rifle and it had left a clean trail entering his back at one side of the neck and angling down doing something agonizing to a few bones and coming out in the thick magnificently developed pectoralis major muscle on the right side the bronze man carefully thrust his right hand inside his shirt then got erect he was clad only in shirt and underclothing he went up the stream and came to the spot where the planes had fired upon him he examined the thing they had fired upon thinking it was his body a bundle composed of twigs and leaves and a few sticks for stiffening purposes thrust into his clothing he had left it there under cover of the smoke and as the wind swept the smoke toward the stream had moved along with it and entered the cold water the swim which followed was something he wished to forget looking over the clothing he found the coat so ripped as to he useless the shoes as well had been torn badly by the bullets but the trousers under the coating of mud were at least wearable he donned them then he headed for the college the bronze man did not go as the crow flies for only a crow or other aerial traveler could go that way this country was not wilderness for no reason at all it was because it was almost impenetrable the hills were sharp multitudinous and briars thorny bushes and low brush made a mat which would vie with a tropical jungle the most simple route was to head south to the road then follow that westward to the institution accordingly doc savage turned south he reached the road it was not graded except where it of necessity had to be leveled off a bit the bridges were of logs and the whole affair smacked of the pioneer days but it was passable by truck its whole length and served to bring in heavy supplies which could not be carried handily by plane the woods still dripped the breeze was making some noise and the running streams kept up a wet orchestration that possibly accounted for what happened next ordinarily the bronze man was not taken unawares ahead of him a man stepped into the road the fellow wore the uniform of a new york city policeman he held a riot gun we want to talk to you he advised loudly doc had stopped and now he swung around slowly more uniformed men had appeared on either side and at the rear they numbered six and a leader the leader was inspector clarence hardboiled humbolt he alone was not in uniform and he wore enormous overshoes and sheepskin pacs instead of his tennis shoes but he still hobbled along as if his feet were raw stubs despite the feet he looked as happy as a dog which had just caught a rabbit we were afraid there wouldnt be a landing place up here for a plane he rumbled so we left our ship at the last town and came on by car doc savage asked without emotion have you any authority in this part of the state hardboiled shook the leather sap down out of his sleeve and swatted the palm of a corded hand with it this is authority enough he advised but i had the governor issue myself and my men special commissions before we left the big town doc savage shrugged your man basenstein seems to have balled things up he said hardboiled jumped as if some one had stepped on his tender feel he peered owlishly at the bronze man whats that he growled those notes basenstein wrote you doc said they must have resulted in boke and his gang following us up here hardboiled swatted his palm with the sap scowled expectorated and shifted from one foot to another his features became dark with disgust so i didnt fool you with basenstein he muttered no doc told him but you might have if i had not overheard you talking near sidney lorreys barge laboratory basenstein told a good story just how much of it was the truth most of it hardboiled grumbled reluctantly sidney lorrey did come to him to be treated and he did talk a lot of stuff about the crime annihilist he was either trying to say he was the crime annihilist himself or as ive been thinking later he might have known who the crime annihilist was basenstein used to be a police medical examiner he called me i decided to put him on your trail so i thought doc said dryly hardboiled glared whyd you let im hang around if you knew who he was he was doc said an excellent alibi hardboiled swore wheres basenstein a policeman a short distance down the road yelled hey look out fellows there was a shot doc and the others whirled they were just in time to see the policeman running backward madly and waving his arms the officers heel hooked a bush and he went down so heavily that his heels flew up then smacked back again he coughed and a red spray went into the air from the dark woods a voice called be good coppers then other voices shouted from the sides and it was evident that they were surrounded hardboiled snarled reached for his hip and doc savage grasping his arm said youll get your men killed two of the policemen dropped flat in the road and for a moment it seemed there would be a fight then the attackers circled and came out in the roads their ready submachine guns discouraging the policemen i know some of these mugs hardboiled gritted theyre tough lads the gunmen advanced the officers were disarmed then a slender man with a seamy face who appeared to be in charge relaxed and said wont this tickle boke doc savage asked will you tell me something no said the man what brought you up here doc asked the man laughed just about every time that basenstein sent hardboiled here a message we either got it or got a look at it basenstein used the plane radio to tell hardboiled where he had landed with you fellows and we picked up the message hardboiled looked very disgusted and tried to stand so as to ease his feet the man with the wizened face yelled more gangsters came out of the woods dragging two prisoners the pig habeas was with them pat savage was one of the captives renny was the other we thought these might come in handy smirked the gang lieutenant come on well go see how boke is making out boke it was evident was not making out in a manner satisfactory to himself they could hear him swearing before they caught sight of him tsk tsk pat said that lad is no gentleman two or three of bokes men eyed pat admiringly they appreciated her nerve hardboiled scowled at her and demanded dont you realize theyre liable to kill all of us pat studied him as if trying to ascertain what made his temper bad then decided aloud it must be your feet boke came striding up and yelled shut up what is going on here i thought this bronze man was dead some one told him about the capture excellent shouted boke we will take them all rope them together and use them as a shield while we rush that gate complying with that order monk and ham were marched up and placed with pat renny doc and the policemen shortly afterward basenstein arrived under escort and was confined to the collection a fine spy you turned out to be hardboiled told him sarcastically well thats gratitude basenstein snorted i hope you get bunions on your hands as well as on your feet hardboiled grinned in a way that showed he hadnt meant his criticism boke confronted doc savage and announced you can save a lot of trouble by giving me the ingredients of the chemical which upsets this socalled crime gland thats what i want the bronze man made no answer seemed not to hear damn it boke yelled answer me doc savage looked straight over bokes head saying nothing from where he stood he could see up the hill on which stood the cabin that was outside the fenced enclosure of the criminal college perhaps a mile from the gate although only about half a mile from where doc now stood the cabin looked very forlorn and deserted answer me boke screeched doc savage said sharply you know your answer what are you going to do about it plenty boke rapped and turned away some seventy yards distant an evergreen shrub stirred slightly a bit later a stick broke and after that a bird flew up noisily from the side of the hill and sailed off in the direction of the cabin which stood alone monk speaking so that only doc heard asked say aint there somebody skulking over there yes doc said did you see who it was monk demanded the bronze man shook a negative must be one of his gang monk hazarded on the contrary doc said it is probably the crime annihilist monk looked as if he were about to be upset he scratched his jaw as best he could with his bound hands blazes he muttered you really think the guy is up here in person there is doc said not the slightest doubt of it renny who had shuffled over to hear the last peered around cautiously then eyed his big fists which were purple from the tightness of the cords which confined them how do you figure hes here doc he asked the crime annihilist stopped working shortly after our plane appeared said the bronze man it is logical to suppose that he saw our plane feared we could trace him down and shut off his device monk grunted so thats why the thing quit working up on the hill another bird flushed up this one was more distant nearer the cabin whoever was hangin around here is makin for that cabin monk said abruptly over toward the gate that led into the enclosure which held the fantastic college they could hear boke yelling he did not seem particularly anxious for a pitched battle not knowing just what armament the fenced area held he was demanding that the secret of the criminalmaking drug be given to him or he would start killing his prisoners is there such a drug doc ham asked the bronze man nodded there is the concoction was discovered in the course of experiments to learn how this socalled crime gland could best be caused to function normally their captors had tied all of them by now securing their wrists but leaving their ankles free an ominous prediction of what was to come if worst turned to worst cotton rope had been used the strands were thin and stout most of the men departed to a spot from which the gate could be seen anxious to learn how bokes negotiations would turn out only four remained close to doc savage and the other prisoners but they held submachine guns with the safeties latched off doc savage leaned against a tree as if weary and worked an arm against the coarse bark unnoticed a button came off his sleeve and fell to the ground a moment later he sat down as if his strength had given out his fingers picked up the button it was white as if constructed of ordinary pearl but close examination would have shown that it was of metal and the edge instead of being merely rounded was disked to a razor sharpness a thin metal band protected this edge and was easily broken off with the finger nails leaving the razor edge exposed two or three judicious slices cut almost through docs wrist bonds he caught monks eye and flipped the button monk picked it up when the guards were not looking kept a sober face as he discovered its purpose used it and passed it on to renny renny gave it to pat and pat passed it to ham down by the gate those inside the high fence had refused to have anything to do with bokes demands doc pretending to writhe as though the pain from his shoulder were unbearable dug his hands down into the ground and closed them over a stone which had been almost hidden in the mud all right he said suddenly and flung the stone simultaneously monk ham renny and pat came to their feet the flung rock taking a machine gunner by surprise dropped him trembling in his tracks the other three gunmen amazed squawled out an alarm and tried to get their weapons into play monk reaching one swung a fist as if he were driving a nail and the man went down two of the others got their rapidfirers chattering but had no time to aim before ham and renny were upon them renny clubbed his man down with slamming blows ham had a little trouble until pat running around behind rabbitpunched the gangster ham finished him off with an uppercut the pig habeas began squealing get their guns doc rapped and retreat up the hill monk yelled listen there aint nothing but that cabin at the top of the hill no place to hole up why not try to get over the fence up the hill doc repeated and began untying hardboiled humbolt and the other policemen hardboiled bellowed aint you gonna fight them mugs doc said get up that hill make for the cabin why not fight em hardboiled howled because some of them might he killed doc rapped get a move on the fugitives were stringing out up the hill and a few bullets were snapping through the timber in pursuit due to the thickness of the woods the slugs were poorly aimed hardboiled hopping along painfully with a disgruntled look drew up beside renny and demanded whats eatin that bronze guy why dont he fight them birds we could knock off about half of em with them tommy guns matter of principle renny rumbled doc never kills anybody hell said hardboiled killin is too good for boke and that crowd shut up and run renny advised i dont know why doc is makin for that cabin but he has some reason the bronze man was not leading the retreat but bringing up the rear from time to time he discharged a burst from one of the captured submachine guns but he shot high merely discouraging the rapidity of pursuit it became evident that they were going to reach the cabin before they were overhauled monk was carrying his pet pig hardboiled reaching the cabin finally ran around it and looked down the slope beyond hells bells he roared were stuck the hill sloped gently there was little underbrush which would furnish shelter and the tree trunks themselves were thin none being greater than six inches in diameter doc savage paid no attention he was studying the wet ground before the cabin it bore fresh tracks some of the prints were so recent that they were still filling with water and they had been made by the same pair of feet judging from their likeness m sue the bronze man mounted to a creaking porch and shoved inside the room was large roughly furnished the principal fixture being a large bench strewn with wires bits of metal and vacuum tubes of diverse design across the room was a closed door a voice came from behind it get away from me it shrilled monk diving into the cabin behind doc let his jaw sag down then snapped it up to demand wonderingly who in blazes is in that room the crime annihilist i believe doc said well well monk grunted and dived across the room he hit the door with his shoulder and his homely face showed that he fully expected it to collapse but he was too optimistic the stout wooden panel held get away shrieked the voice from the other side of the door then a roar of gunfire and a snapping and crashing of bullets drowned out the shrieks nearly all of the glass fell out of the rooms one window it jingled not unmusically on the floor ham pat hardboiled and all the policemen were inside get down doc directed the logs will turn lead monk seeming unaware of the danger outside jabbed a thumb at the inner room into which they had not yet had time to smash their way howd you know the crime annihilist was here he demanded direction finding apparatus doc said i used it from new york city you mean that this crime annihilists weapon is merely a machine emitting emanations similar to ultrashort radio waves doc said these emanations have an irritating effect on the socalled crime gland causing a sort of local poisoning which induces mental spasms and a peculiar muscular reaction which results in the protruding of the eyes youll have to make it clearer than that for me to get it monk grunted i used a sensitive directional finder of an ordinary radio type in the new york laboratory doc went on it pointed to this vicinity monk exploded now listen doc thats a bit thick no directional device would point to this cabin it pointed in this direction doc corrected the rest was guesswork this cabin was the logical spot monk began i dont see then fell silent he wet his lips flattened a little lower as a bullet ricocheted down from the ceiling blazes he exploded this cabin was built hardboiled humbolt interrupted bawling hey lookit lookit and the shooting stopped as if it had only been some recorded sound effect which had been switched off silence did not fall rather the shooting stopped and a banshee caterwauling of shouts took its place the shouts became screams and these turned to awful shrieks they were all conscious of a metallic drone which had started up and seemed to be coming from the adjacent room pat ran to the window broken glass crunching under her feet she looked out only briefly then withdrew hands lifting in a subconscious gesture of horror her face looked drained drawn the crime annihilist she said thickly theyre dying outside the thing seems to be stronger than ever before doc savage got erect and flung himself against the door of the room from which the drone came the panel rebuffed him as it had monk he hit it again using his unwounded shoulder he picked up a chair and battered it and the sound this produced told him why the door was so solid metal lined he said probably a storeroom the bronze man ran to the workbench dumped its litter and tore at one of the great thick planks which composed its top give us a hand he rapped weve got to get into this inside room to save those men out there monk who was usually prompt in carrying out the bronze mans suggestions for once seemed not to hear monk at times in the past had been suspected of possessing bloodthirsty inclinations he looked through the window grimaced but did not turn away the sight was not a pleasant one to watch bokes men had worked quite close to the cabin when the affliction seized them from the window monk had a box seat for the pageant of fantastic death the homely chemist located janko sultman he had already succumbed and was a contorted shape beneath a tree a strange thing had happened to his frizzled hair as death overtook him the hair was no longer upstanding but lay down as if it too had been devoid of life monk discovered boke the mastermind had been well behind out of danger of bullets a position masterminds not infrequently occupy but it had not preserved him from the vengeance of the crime annihilist boke was stumbling about shrieking beating at his own face he tore off the muffler which had masked his features then felt to the ground stretched himself out and did not move again monk craned his neck to get a closer look at bokes face monk snorted it was not a face of a leader it had fragile features and a rose petal skin no hardboiled crook would look upon such a face and feel like calling its owner his master it was no mystery why boke had kept his face covered for boke was the femininemannered lizzie probably janko sultman had never known that and it explained how sultman had been discovered in his doublecrossing for lizzie had ostensibly been one of sultmans gang several men clutched the long plank which doc had ripped from the workbench they drew back leveled it and ran for the door in a living ram the panel gave groaned a second smash caused it to give slightly more with a roar it went in on the third try doc savage pitched across the threshold the room beyond was dark for there were no windows but there was a furtive movement in a corner the bronze man squinted through the murk get back he rapped suddenly then he lunged forward in a remote corner a figure was huddled over a mound of objects on the floor the figure straightened gibbering shrilly as the bronze man approached doc swooped upon the objects over which the figure had been crouched there was dynamite nearly a cage of it with a battery and wires attached there was also a small phonograph one of the type newly placed on the market which can be plugged into a light circuit and by using a microphone attachment employed to make records which can then be played back numerous times doc hastily disconnected the wires from the explosive while the occupant of the room squeaked meaninglessly at him from across the chamber monk came lumbering in renny on big heels they looked at the pitiful figure which was the crime annihilist holy cow renny boomed and monk pointing at the explosive the phonograph said thats how he faked his death on the barge got away before we ever came and left a rifle attached to the door so that it would go off when the door was jarred then he had the phonograph yell out in his voice and then the explosion he was fixing to do the same thing here monk shook his head slowly then resumed but why ham who had come in said caustically you ape if you had been through what he has you would do queer things too then they looked at the crime annihilist at his racked body a frame mutilated by torture swathed in bandages and it was not difficult to understand why he had set out to rid the world of criminals they killed my brother mumbled the crime annihilist damn them they they ill get them all the crime annihilist was sidney lorrey chapter xviii monk takes his day the opposite wall of the room was spanned its full length by a table and on this was arrayed a tremendous quantity of electrical apparatus under the table a motorgenerator set made a metallic drone the thing that produced the popeyed death ham murmured and eyed the array doc savage nodded sidney lorrey was is a scientist and surgeon interested in mental therapy as influenced by various infrarays and light beams the bronze man said i recall robert lorrey saying that sidney was trying to perfect a treatment for the socalled crime gland which would not require the use of drugs the bronze man indicated the intricate array of electrical apparatus possibly sidney lorrey did not realize at first that his apparatus was killing criminals it must have been set up in his barge laboratory and operating continuously on some piece of experimental tissue then when sidney saw the men die from its effects he realized what it was and realized what a weapon against crime he had ham added monk pointed at sidney lorrey what about him doc savage went over to sidney lorrey the latter recoiled at first but under the bronze mans soothing words submitted to an examination temporarily disarranged mentally by pain doc said he will be entirely normal after a short period of treatment and a rest monk muttered slowly im glad of that hardboiled humbolt was moving about as if he had something on his mind but was uncertain what to do about it he caught doc savages eye and beckoned they went out on the porch hardboiled waved an arm in the direction of the area of woodland enclosed by the high fence whats over there he demanded youve got somethin up here somethin big i aint quite been able to figure out what it is doc savage studied the big roughmannered cop for some moments that to put it plainly was a lie he said dryly from bokes talk you secured a very good idea of what is inside that fence hardboiled shook his head i didnt hear a thing doc savage extended a hand thanks if news of that place got out it would mean all kinds of trouble i got a few special friends hardboiled jerked his hand at the criminalcuring institution again would you put em in there when i catch em just as a favor the bronze man rarely smiled but he did so now with pleasure he agreed hardboiled asked what are you gonna do about that thing inside that mess of electrical business destroy it doc said why hardboiled looked pained think of what itd do to the crooks doc savage asked when a man has the smallpox do you kill him hell no hardboiled snorted you doctor him up exactly doc savage said and that explains why i am going to destroy the device inside the bronze man picked up a fragment of the chair with which he had first tried to batter down the door and entered the inner room he ran his eyes over the assembled apparatus of the crime annihilist until he had the circuit fixed in his memory it might become useful sometime in the future he shut off the motorgenerator then went to work with the piece of chair smashing tubes tearing apart intricate bundles of wires the vacuum tubes broke with loud explosions showering glass about delicate insulating sheets crunched and condensers torn apart spilled layers of foil and waxed paper doc did the job of destruction carefully expending fully five minutes in the task and when he was done and had stepped back monk thrust his homely features into the room he pointed at the apparatus or what was left of it is that jigger out of whack he demanded it is doc told him monk licked his lips a look of unholy anticipation came over his features and he retreated from the door it could not have been more than thirty seconds later when a terrific scream ripped out it was followed by growls minor howls and the thump and bang of a terrific fight ham his coat and most of his shirt missing the rest of his person looking as if it had been through a tornado dashed madly around a cabin corner monk popped out in pursuit still gripping parts of hams missing clothing help ham yelled turn that blasted machine on what theyre gonna have to turn on for you monk puffed grimly is slow music the end
