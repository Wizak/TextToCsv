boundaries of our country sir why sir on the north we are bounded by the aurora boreaus on the east we are bounded by the rising sun on the south we are bounded by the procession of the equinoxes and on the west by the day of judgment the american joe millers jest book shadow had done three years in prison he was big enough and looked dontfuckwithme enough that his biggest problem was killing time so he kept himself in shape and taught himself coin tricks and thought a lot about how much he loved his wife the best thingin shadows opinion perhaps the only good thingabout being in prison was a feeling of relief the feeling that hed plunged as low as he could plunge and hed hit bottom he didnt worry that the man was going to get him because the man had got him he was no longer scared of what tomorrow might bring because yesterday had brought it it did not matter shadow decided if you had done what you had been convicted of or not in his experience everyone he met in prison was aggrieved about something there was always something the authorities had got wrong something they said you did when you didntor you didnt do quite like they said you did what was important was that they had gotten you neil caiman he had noticed it in the first few days when everything from the slang to the bad food was new despite the misery and the utter skincrawling horror of incarceration he was breathing relief shadow tried not to talk oo much somewhere around the middle of year two he mentioned his theory to low key lyesmith his cellmate low key who was a grifter from minnesota smiled his scarred smile yeah he said thats true its even better when youve been sentenced to death thats when you remember the jokes about the guys who kicked their boots off as the noose flipped around their necks because their friends always told them theyd die with their boots on is that a joke asked shadow damn right gallows humor best kind there is when did they last hang a man in this state asked shadow how the hell should i know lyesmith kept his orangeblond hair pretty much shaved you could see the lines of his skull tell you what though this country started going to hell when they stopped hanging folks no gallows dirt no gallows deals shadow shrugged he could see nothing romantic in a death sentence if you didnt have a death sentence he decided then prison was at best only a temporary reprieve from life for two reasons first life creeps back into prison there are always places to go further down life goes on and second if you just hang in there someday theyre going to have to let you out in the beginning it was too far away for shadow to focus on then it became a distant beam of hope and he learned how to tell himself this too shall pass when the prison shit went down as prison shit always did one day the magic door would open and hed walk through it so he marked off the days on his songbirds of north america calendar american gods which was the only calendar they sold in the prison commissary and the sun went down and he didnt see it and the sun came up and he didnt see it he practiced coin tricks from a book he found in the wasteland of the prison library and he worked out and he made lists in his head of what hed do when he got out of prison shadows lists got shorter and shorter after two years he had it down to three things first he was going to take a bath a real long serious soak in a tub with bubbles maybe read the paper maybe not some days he thought one way some days the other second he was going to towel himself off put on a robe maybe slippers he liked the idea of slippers if he smoked he would be smoking a pipe about now but he didnt smoke he would pick up his wife in his arms he would carry her into the bedroom and close the door theyd call out for pizzas if they got hungry third after he and laura had come out of the bedroom maybe a couple of days later he was going to keep his head down and stay out of trouble for the rest of his life and then youll be happy asked low keylyesmith that day they were working in the prison shop assembling bird feeders which was barely more interesting man stamping out license plates call no man happy said shadow until he is dead herodotus said low key hey youre learning who the fucks herodotus asked the iceman slotting together the sides of a bird feeder and passing it to shadow who bolted and screwed it tight dead greek said shadow my last girlfriend was greek said the iceman the shit her family ate you would not believe like rice wrapped in leaves shit like that the iceman was the same size and shape as a coke machine with blue eyes and hair so blond it was almost white neil caiman he had beaten the crap out of some guy who had made the mistake of copping a feel off his girlfriend in the bar where she danced and the iceman bounced the guys friends had called the police who arrested the iceman and ran a check on him which revealed that the iceman had walked from a workrelease program eighteen months earlier so what was i supposed to do asked the iceman aggrieved when he had told shadow the whole sad tale id told him she was my girlfriend was i supposed to let him disrespect me like that was i i mean he had his hands all over her shadow had said you tell em and left it at that one thing he had learned early you do your own time in prison you dont do anyone elses time for them keep your head down do your own time lyesmith had loaned shadow a battered paperback copy of herodotuss histories several months earlier its not boring its cool he said when shadow protested that he didnt read books read it first then tell me its cool shadow had made a face but he had started to read and had found himself hooked against his will greeks said the iceman with disgust and it aint true what they say about them neither i tried giving it to my girlfriend in the ass she almost clawed my eyes out lyesmith was transferred one day without warning he left shadow his copy of herodotus there was a nickel hidden in the pages coins were contraband you can sharpen the edges against a stone slice open someones face in a fight shadow didnt want a weapon shadow just wanted something to do with his hands shadow was not superstitious he did not believe in anything he could not see still he could feel disaster hovering above the prison in those final weeks just as he had felt it in the days before the robbery there was a hollowness in the pit of his stomach that he told himself was simply a fear of going back to the world on the outside but he could not be american gods sure he was more paranoid than usual and in prison usual is very and is a survival skill shadow became more quiet more shadowy than ever he found himself watching the body language of the guards of the other inmates searching for a clue to the bad thing that was going to happen as he was certain that it would a month before he was due to be released shadow sat in a chilly office facing a short man with a portwine birthmark on his forehead they sat across a desk from each other the man had shadows file open in front of him and was holding a ballpoint pen the end of the pen was badly chewed you cold shadow yes said shadow a little the man shrugged thats the system he said furnaces dont go on until december the first then they go off march the first i dont make the rules he ran his forefinger down the sheet of paper stapled to the inside left of the folder youre thirtytwo years old yes sir you look younger clean living says here youve been a model inmate i learned my lesson sir did you really he looked at shadow intently the birthmark on his forehead lowering shadow thought about telling the man some of his theories about prison but he said nothing he nodded instead and concentrated on appearing properly remorseful says here youve got a wife shadow her names laura hows everything there pretty good shes come down to see me as much as she couldits a long way to travel we write and i call her when i can what does your wife do neil caiman shes a travel agent sends people all over the world howd you meet her shadow could not decide why the man was asking he considered telling him it was none of his business then said she was my best buddys wifes best friend they set us up on a blind date we hit it off and youve got a job waiting for you yessir my buddy robbie the one i just told you about he owns the muscle farm the place i used to train he says my old job is waiting for me an eyebrow raised really says he figures ill be a big draw bring back some oldtimers and pull in the tough crowd who want to be tougher the man seemed satisfied he chewed the end of his ballpoint pen then turned over the sheet of paper how do you feel about your offense shadow shrugged i was stupid he said and meant it the man with the birthmark sighed he ticked off a number of items on a checklist then he riffled through the papers in shadows file howre you getting home from here he asked greyhound flying home its good to have a wife whos a travel agent the man frowned and the birthmark creased she sent you a ticket didnt need to just sent me a confirmation number electronic ticket all i have to do is turn up at the airport in a month and show em my ed and im outta here the man nodded scribbled one final note then he closed the file and put down the ballpoint pen two pale hands rested on the gray desk like pink animals he brought his hands close together made a steeple of his forefingers and stared at shadow with watery hazel eyes youre lucky he said you have someone to go back american gods to you got a job waiting you can put all this behind you you got a second chance make the most of it the man did not offer to shake shadows hand as he rose to leave nor did shadow expect him to the last week was the worst in some ways it was worse than the whole three years put together shadow wondered if it was the weather oppressive still and cold it felt as if a storm was on the way but the storm never came he had the jitters and the heebiejeebies a feeling deep in his stomach that something was entirely wrong in the exercise yard the wind gusted shadow imagined that he could smell snow on the air he called his wife collect shadow knew that the phone companies whacked a threedollar surcharge on every call made from a prison phone that was why operators are always real polite to people calling from prisons shadow had decided they knew that he paid their wages something feels weird he told laura that wasnt the first thing he said to her the first thing was i love you because its a good thing to say if you can mean it and shadow did hello said laura i love you too what feels weird i dont know he said maybe the weather it feels like if we could only get a storm everything would be okay its nice here she said the last of the leaves havent quite fallen if we dont get a storm youll be able to see them when you get home five days said shadow a hundred and twenty hours and then you come home she said everything okay there nothing wrong everythings fine im seeing robbie tonight were planning your surprise welcomehome party surprise party of course you dont know anything about it do you neil caiman not a thing thats my husband she said shadow realized that he was smiling he had been inside for three years but she could still make him smile love you babes said shadow love you puppy said laura shadow put down the phone when they got married laura told shadow that she wanted a puppy but their landlord had pointed out they werent allowed pets under the terms of their lease hey shadow had said ill be your puppy what do you want me to do chew your slippers piss on the kitchen floor lick your nose sniff your crotch i bet theres nothing a puppy can do i cant do and he picked her up as if she weighed nothing at all and began to lick her nose while she giggled and shrieked and then he carried her to the bed in the food hall sam fetisher sidled over to shadow and smiled showing his old teeth he sat down beside shadow and began to eat his macaroni and cheese we got to talk said sam fetisher sam fetisher was one of the blackest men that shadow had ever seen he might have been sixty he might have been eighty then again shadow had met thirtyyearold crackheads who looked older man sam fetisher mm said shadow storms on the way said sam feels like it said shadow maybe itll snow soon not that kind of storm bigger storm than that coming i tell you boy youre better off in here than out on the street when the big storm comes done my time said shadow friday im gone sam fetisher stared at shadow where you from he asked eagle point indiana youre a lying fuck said sam fetisher i mean originally where are your folks from american gods chicago said shadow his mother had lived in chicago as a girl and she had died there half a lifetime ago like i said big storm coining keep your head down shadowboy its like what do they call those things continents ride around on some kind of plates tectonic plates shadow hazarded thats it tectonic plates its like when they go riding when north america goes skidding into south america you dont want to be in the middle you dig me not even a little one brown eye closed in a slow wink hell dont say i didnt warn you said sam fetisher and he spooned a trembling lump of orange jello into his mouth i wont shadow spent the night halfawake drifting in and out of sleep listening to his new cellmate grunt and snore in the bunk below him several cells away a man whined and howled and sobbed like an animal and from time to time someone would scream at him to shut the fuck up shadow tried not to hear he let the empty minutes wash over him lonely and slow two days to go fortyeight hours starting with oatmeal and prison coffee and a guard named wilson who tapped shadow harder than he had to on the shoulder and said shadow this way shadow checked his conscience it was quiet which did not he had observed in a prison mean that he was not in deep shit the two men walked more or less side by side feet echoing on metal and concrete shadow tasted fear in the back of his throat bitter as old coffee the bad thing was happening there was a voice in the back of his head whispering that they were going to slap another year onto his sentence drop him into solitary cut off his hands cut off his head he told himself he was being stupid but his heart was pounding fit to burst out of his chest neil caiman i dont get you shadow said wilson as they walked whats not to get sir you youre too fucking quiet too polite you wait like the old guys but youre what twentyfive twentyeight thirtytwo sir and what are you a spic a gypsy not that i know of sir maybe maybe you got nigger blood in you you got nigger blood in you shadow could be sir shadow stood tall and looked straight ahead and concentrated on not allowing himself to be riled by this man yeah well all i know is you fucking spook me wilson had sandy blond hair and a sandy blond face and a sandy blond smile you leaving us soon hope so sir they walked through a couple of checkpoints wilson showed his id each time up a set of stairs and they were standing outside the prison wardens office it had the prison wardens nameg pattersonon the door in black letters and beside the door a miniature traffic light the top light burned red wilson pressed a button below the traffic light they stood there in silence for a couple of minutes shadow tried to tell himself that everything was all right that on friday morning hed be on the plane up to eagle point but he did not believe it himself the red light went out and the green light went on and wilson opened the door they went inside shadow had seen the warden a handful of times in the last three years once he had been showing a politician around once during a lockdown the warden had spoken to them in groups of a hundred telling them that the prison was overcrowded and that since it would remain overcrowded they had better get used to it up close patterson looked worse his face was oblong americangods with gray hair cut into a military bristle cut he smelled of old spice behind him was a shelf of books each with the word prison in the title his desk was perfectly clean empty but for a telephone and a tearoffthepages far side calendar he had a hearing aid in his right ear please sit down shadow sat down wilson stood behind him the warden opened a desk drawer and took out a file placed it on his desk says here you were sentenced to six years for aggravated assault and battery youve served three years you were due to be released on friday were shadow felt his stomach lurch inside him he wondered how much longer he was going to have to serveanother year two years all three all he said was yes sir the warden licked his lips what did you say i said yes sir shadow were going to be releasing you later this afternoon youll be getting out a couple of days early shadow nodded and he waited for the other shoe to drop the warden looked down at the paper on his desk this came from the johnson memorial hospital in eagle point your wife she died in the early hours of this morning it was an automobile accident im sorry shadow nodded once more wilson walked him back to his cell not saying anything he unlocked the cell door and let shadow in then he said its like one of them good news bad news jokes isnt it good news were letting you out early bad news your wife is dead he laughed as if it were genuinely funny shadow said nothing at all numbly he packed up his possessions gave most of them away he left behind low keys herodotus and the book of coin tricks and with a momentary pang he abandoned the neil caiman blank metal disks be had smuggled out of the workshop which had served him for coins there would be coins real coins on the outside he shaved he dressed in civilian clothes he walked through door after door knowing that he would never walk back through them again feeling empty inside the rain had started to gust from the gray sky a freezing rain pellets of ice stung shadows face while the rain soaked the thin overcoat and they walked toward the yellow exschool bus that would take them to the nearest city by the time they got to the bus they were soaked eight of them were leaving fifteen hundred still inside shadow sat on the bus and shivered until the heaters started working wondering what he was doing where he would go now ghost images filled his head unbidden in his imagination he was leaving another prison long ago he had been imprisoned in a lightless room for far too long his beard was wild and his hair was a tangle the guards had walked him down a gray stone stairway and out into a plaza filled with brightly colored things with people and with objects it was a market day and he was dazzled by the noise and the color squinting at the sunlight that filled the square smelling the saltwet air and all the good things of the market and on his left the sun glittered from the water the bus shuddered to a halt at a red light the wind howled about the bus and the wipers slooshed heavily back and forth across the windshield smearing the city into a red and yellow neon wetness it was early afternoon but it looked like night through the glass shit said the man in the seat behind shadow rubbing the condensation from the window with his hand staring at a wet figure hurrying down the sidewalk theres pussy out there shadow swallowed it occurred to him that he had not american gods cried yethad in fact felt nothing at all no tears no sorrow nothing he found himself thinking about a guy named johnnie larch hed shared a cell with when hed first been put inside who told shadow how hed once got out after five years behind bars with one hundred dollars and a ticket to seattle where his sister lived johnnie larch had got to the airport and he handed his ticket to the woman on the counter and she asked to see his drivers license he showed it to her it had expired a couple of years earlier she told him it was not valid as id he told her it might not be valid as a drivers license but it sure as hell was fine identification and damn it who else did she think he was if he wasnt him she said shed thank him to keep his voice down he told her to give him a fucking boarding pass or she was going to regret it and that he wasnt going to be disrespected you dont let people disrespect you in prison then she pressed a button and a few moments later the airport security showed up and they tried to persuade johnnie larch to leave the airport quietly and he did not wish to leave and there was something of an altercation the upshot of it all was that johnnie larch never actually made it to seattle and he spent the next couple of days in town in bars and when his one hundred dollars was gone he held up a gas station with a toy gun for money to keep drinking and the police finally picked him up for pissing in the street pretty soon he was back inside serving the rest of his sentence and a little extra for the gas station job and the moral of this story according to johnnie larch was this dont piss off people who work in airports are you sure its not something like the kind of behavior that works in a specialized environment such as prison can fail to work and in fact become harmful when used out neil caiman side such an environment said shadow when johnnie larch told him the story no listen to me im telling you man said johnnie larch dont piss off those bitches in airports shadow half smiled at the memory his own drivers license had several months still to go before it expired bus station everybody out the building stank of piss and sour beer shadow climbed into a taxi and told the driver to take him to the airport he told him that there was an extra five dollars if he could do it in silence they made it in twenty minutes and the driver never said a word then shadow was stumbling through the brightly lit airport terminal shadow worried about the whole eticket business he knew he had a ticket for a flight on friday but he didnt know if it would work today anything electronic seemed fundamentally magical to shadow and liable to evaporate at any moment still he had his wallet back in his possession for the first time in three years containing several expired credit cards and one visa card which he was pleasantly surprised to discover didnt expire until the end of january he had a reservation number and he realized he had the certainty that once he got home everything would somehow be okay laura would be fine again maybe it was some kind of scam to spring him a few days early or perhaps it was a simple mixup some other laura moons body had been dragged from the highway wreckage lightning flickered outside the airport through the windowswalls shadow realized he was holding his breath waiting for something a distant boom of thunder he exhaled a tired white woman stared at him from behind the counter hello said shadow youre the first strange woman ive spoken to in the flesh in three years ive got an american gods eticket number i was supposed to be traveling on friday but i have to go today there was a death in my family mm im sorry to hear that she tapped at the keyboard stared at the screen tapped again no problem ive put you on the threethirty it may be delayed because of the storm so keep an eye on the screens checking any baggage he held up a shoulder bag i dont need to check this do it no she said its fine do you have any picture id shadow showed her his drivers license it was not a big airport but the number of people wandering just wandering amazed him he watched people put down bags casually observed wallets stuffed into back pockets saw purses put down unwatched under chairs that was when he realized he was no longer in prison thirty minutes to wait until boarding shadow bought a slice of pizza and burned his lip on the hot cheese he took his change and went to the phones called robbie at the muscle farm but the machine picked up hey robbie said shadow they tell me that lauras dead they let me out early im coming home then because people do make mistakes hed seen it happen he called home and listened to lauras voice hi she said im not here or i cant come to the phone leave a message and ill get back to you and have a good day shadow couldnt bring himself to leave a message he sat in a plastic chair by the gate and held his bag so tight he hurt his hand he was thinking about the first time he had ever seen laura he hadnt even known her name then she was audrey burtons friend he had been sitting with robbie in a booth at chichis when laura had walked in a pace or so behind audrey and shadow had found himself staring she neil caiman had long chestnut hair and eyes so blue shadow mistakenly thought she was wearing tinted contact lenses she had ordered a strawberry daiquiri and insisted that shadow taste it and laughed delightedly when he did laura loved people to taste what she tasted he had kissed her good night that night and she had tasted like strawberry daiquiris and he had never wanted to kiss anyone else again a woman announced that his plane was boarding and shadows row was the first to be called he was in the very back an empty seat beside him the rain pattered continually against the side of the plane he imagined small children tossing down dried peas by the handful from the skies as the plane took off he fell asleep shadow was in a dark place and the thing staring at him wore a buffalos head rank and furry with huge wet eyes its body was a mans body oiled and slick changes are coming said the buffalo without moving its lips there are certain decisions that will have to be made firelight flickered from wet cave walls where am i shadow asked in the earth and under the earth said the buffalo man you are where the forgotten wait his eyes were liquid black marbles and his voice was a rumble from beneath the world he smelled like wet cow believe said the rumbling voice if you are to survive you must believe believe what asked shadow what should i believer he stared at shadow the buffalo man and he drew himself up huge and his eyes filled with fire he opened bis spitflecked buffalo mouth and it was red inside with the flames that burned inside him under the earth everything roared the buffalo man the world tipped and spun and shadow was on the plane once more but the tipping continued in the front of the plane a woman screamed halfheartedly american gods lightning burst in blinding flashes around the plane the captain came on the intercom to tell them that he was going to try and gain some altitude to get away from the storm the plane shook and shuddered and shadow wondered coldly and idly if he was going to die it seemed possible he decided but unlikely he stared out of the window and watched the lightning illuminate the horizon then he dozed once more and dreamed he was back in prison and that low key had whispered to him in the food line that someone had put out a contract on his life but that shadow could not find out who or why and when he woke up they were coming in for a landing he stumbled off the plane blinking into wakefulness all airports he thought look very much the same it doesnt actually matter where you are you are in an airport tiles and walkways and restrooms gates and newsstands and fluorescent lights this airport looked like an airport the trouble is this wasnt the airport he was going to this was a big airport with way too many people and way too many gates excuse me maam the woman looked at him over the clipboard yes what airport is this she looked at him puzzled trying to decide whether or not he was joking then she said st louis i thought this was the plane to eagle point it was they redirected it here because of the storms didnt they make an announcement probably i fell asleep youll need to talk to that man over there in the red coat the man was almost as tall as shadow he looked like the father from a seventies sitcom and he tapped something into a computer and told shadow to runrunto a gate on the far side of the terminal shadow ran through the airport but the doors were al neil caiman re dy closed when he got to the gate he watched the plane pull away from the gate through the plate glass the woman at the passenger assistance desk consulted with another woman and made a phone call then she printed out another boarding card this will get you there she told him well call ahead to the gate and tell them youre coming shadow felt like a pea being flicked between three cups or a card being shuffled through a deck again he ran through the airport ending up near where he had gotten off originally a small man at the gate took his boarding pass weve been waiting for you he confided tearing off the stub of the boarding pass with shadows seat assignmentd on it shadow hurried onto the plane and they closed the door behind him he walked through first classthere were only four firstclass seats three of which were occupied the bearded man in a pale suit seated next to the unoccupied seat at the very front grinned at shadow as he got onto the plane then raised his wrist and tapped his watch as shadow walked past yeah yeah im making you late thought shadow let that be the worst of your worries the plane seemed pretty full as he made his way down toward the back actually shadow found it was completely full and there was a middleaged woman sitting in seat d shadow showed her his boarding card stub and she showed him hers they matched can you take your seat please asked the flight attendant no he said im afraid i cant she clicked her tongue and checked their boarding cards then she led him back up to the front of the plane and pointed him to the empty seat in first class looks like its american gods your lucky day she told him can i bring you something to drink well just have time before we take off and im sure you need one after that id like a beer please said shadow whatever youve got the flight attendant went away the man in the pale suit in the seat beside shadow tapped his watch with his fingernail it was a black rolex youre late said the man and he grinned a huge grin with no warmth in it at all sorry i said youre late the flight attendant handed shadow a glass of beer for one moment he wondered if the man was crazy and then he decided he must have been referring to the plane waiting for one last passenger sorry if i held you up he said politely you in a hurry the plane backed away from the gate the flight attendant came back and took away shadows beer the man in the pale suit grinned at her and said dont worry ill hold onto this tightly and she let him keep his glass of jack daniels while protesting weakly that it violated airline regulations time is certainly of the essence said the man but no i was merely concerned that you would not make the plane that was kind of you the plane sat restlessly on the ground engines throbbing aching to be off kind my ass said the man in the pale suit ive got a job for you shadow a roar of engines the little plane jerked forward pushing shadow back into his seat then they were airborne and the airport lights were falling away below them shadow looked at the man in the seat next to him his hair was a reddish gray his beard little more than neil caiman stubble was grayish red a craggy square face with pale gray eyes the suit looked expensive and was the color of melted vanilla ice cream his tie was dark gray silk and the tie pin was a tree worked in silver trunk branches and deep roots he held his glass of jack daniels as they took off and did not spill a drop arent you going to ask me what kind of job he asked how do you know who i am the man chuckled oh its the easiest thing in the world to know what people call themselves a little thought a little luck a little memory ask me what kind of job no said shadow the attendant brought him another glass of beer and he sipped at it why not im going home ive got a job waiting for me there i dont want any other job the mans craggy smile did not change outwardly but now he seemed actually amused you dont have a job waiting for you at home he said you have nothing waiting for you there meanwhile i am offering you a perfectly legal jobgood money limited security remarkable fringe benefits hell if you live that long i could throw in a pension plan you think maybe youd like one of them shadow said you must have seen my name on the side of my bag the man said nothing whoever you are said shadow you couldnt have known i was going to be on this plane i didnt know i was going to be on this plane and if my plane hadnt been diverted to st louis i wouldnt have been my guess is youre a practical joker maybe youre hustling something but i think maybe well have a better time if we end this conversation here the man shrugged shadow picked up the inflight magazine the little plane american gods jerked and bumped through the sky making it harder to concentrate the words floated through his mind like soap bubbles there as he read them gone completely a moment later the man sat quietly in the seat beside him sipping his jack daniels his eyes were closed shadow read the list of inflight music channels available on transatlantic flights and then he was looking at the map of the world with red lines on it that showed where the airline flew then he had finished reading the magazine and reluctantly he closed the cover and slipped it into the pocket the man opened his eyes there was something strange about his eyes shadow thought one of them was a darker gray than the other he looked at shadow by the way he said i was sorry to hear about your wife shadow a great loss shadow nearly hit the man then instead he took a deep breath he counted to five so was i he said the man shook his head if it could but have been any other way he said and sighed she died in a car crash said shadow there are worse ways to die the man shook his head slowly for a moment it seemed to shadow as if the man was insubstantial as if the plane had suddenly become more real while his neighbor had become less so shadow he said its not a joke its not a trick i can pay you better than any other job you find will pay you youre an excon there wont be a long line of people elbowing each other out of the way to hire you mister whoeverthefuck you are said shadow just neil caiman loud enough to be heard over the din of the engines there isnt enough money in the world the grin got bigger shadow found himself remembering a pbs show about chimpanzees the show claimed that when apes and chimps smile its only to bare their teeth in a grimace of hate or aggression or terror when a chimp grins its a threat work for me there may be a little risk of course but if you survive you can have whatever your heart desires you could be the next king of america now said the man who else is going to pay you that well hmm who are you asked shadow ah yes the age of informationyoung lady could you pour me another glass of jack daniels easy on the icenot of course that there has ever been any other kind of age information and knowledge two currencies that have never gone out of style i said who are you lets see well seeing that today certainly is my daywhy dont you call me wednesday mister wednesday although given the weather it might as well be thursday eh whats your real name work for me long enough and well enough said the man in the pale suit and i may even tell you that there job offer think about it no one expects you to say yes immediately not knowing whether youre leaping into a piranha tank or a pit of bears take your time he closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat i dont think so said shadow i dont like you i dont want to work with you like i say said the man without opening his eyes dont rush into it take your time the plane landed with a bump and a few passengers got off shadow looked out of the window it was a little airport american gods in the middle of nowhere and there were still two little airports to go before eagle point shadow transferred his glance to the man in the pale suitmr wednesday he seemed to be asleep impulsively shadow stood up grabbed his bag and stepped off the plane down the steps onto the slick wet tarmac walking at an even pace toward the lights of the terminal a light rain spattered his face before he went inside the airport building he stopped and turned and watched no one else got off the plane the ground crew rolled the steps away the door was closed and it took off shadow walked inside and he rented what turned out when he got to the parking lot to be a small red toyota shadow unfolded the map theyd given him he spread it out on the passengers seat eagle point was about miles away the storms had passed if they had come this far it was cold and clear clouds scudded in front of the moon and for a moment shadow could not be certain whether it was the clouds or the moon that were moving he drove north for an hour and a half it was getting late he was hungry and when he realized how hungry he really was he pulled off at the next exit and drove into the town of nottamun he filled the gas tank at the amoco and asked the bored woman at the cash register where he could get something to eat jacks crocodile bar she told him its west on county road n crocodile bar yeah jack says they add character she drew him a map on the back of a mauve flyer which advertised a chicken roast for the benefit of a young girl who needed a new kidney hes got a couple of crocodiles a snake one a them big lizard things neil caiman an iguana thats him through the town over a bridge on for a couple of miles and he stopped at a low rectangular building with an illuminated pabst sign the parking lot was half empty inside the air was thick with smoke and walking after midnight was playing on the jukebox shadow looked around for the crocodiles but could not see them he wondered if the woman in the gas station had been pulling his leg whatll it be asked the bartender house beer and a hamburger with all the trimmings fries bowl of chili to start best chili in the state sounds good said shadow wheres the rest room the man pointed to a door in the corner of the bar there was a stuffed alligator head mounted on the door shadow went through the door it was a clean welllit rest room shadow looked around the room first force of habit he took the urinal stall on the left then he unzipped his fly and pissed for an age feeling relief he read the yellowing press clipping framed at eye level with a photo of jack and two alligators there was a polite grunt from the urinal immediately to his right although he had heard nobody come in the man in the pale suit was bigger standing than he had seemed sitting on the plane beside shadow he was almost shadows height and shadow was a big man he was staring ahead of him he finished pissing shook off the last few drops and zipped himself up then he grinned like a fox eating shit from a barbed americangods wire fence so said mr wednesday youve had time to think shadow do you want a job somewhere in america los angeles pm in a dark red roomthe color of the walls is close to that of raw liveris a tall woman dressed cartoonishly in tootight silk shorts her breasts pulled up and pushed forward by the yellow blouse tied beneath them her black hair is piled high and knotted on top of her head standing beside her is a short man wearing an olive tshirt and expensive blue jeans he is holding in his right hand a wallet and a nokia mobile phone with a redwhiteandblue faceplate the red room contains a bed upon which are white satinstyle sheets and an oxblood bedspread at the foot of the bed is a small wooden table upon which is a small stone statue of a woman with enormous hips and a candleholder the woman hands the man a small red candle here she says light it me yes she says if you want to have me i shoulda just got you to suck me off in the jar perhaps she says dont you want me her hand runs up her body from thigh to breast a gesture of presentation as if she were demonstrating a new product red silk scarves over the lamp in the corner of the room make the light red the man looks at her hungrily then he takes the candle from her and pushes it into the candleholder you got a light she passes him a book of matches he tears off a match lights the wick it flickers and then burns with a steady neil caiman flame which gives the illusion of motion to the faceless statue beside it all hips and breasts put the money beneath the statue fifty bucks yes she says now come love me he unbuttons his blue jeans and removes his lolive tshirt she massages his white shoulders with her brown fingers then she turns him over and begins to make love to him with her hands and her fingers and her tongue it seems to him that the lights in the red room have been dimmed and the sole illumination comes from the candle which burns with a bright flame whats your name he asks her bilquis she tells him raising her head with a q a what never mind he is gasping now let me fuck you he says i have to fuck you okay hon she says well do it but will you do something for me while youre doing it hey he says suddenly tetchy im paying you you know she straddles him in one smooth movement whispering i know honey i know youre paying me and i mean look at you i should be paying you im so lucky he purses his lips trying to show that her hooker talk is having no effect on him he cant be taken that shes a street whore for chrissakes while hes practically a producer and he knows all about lastminute ripoffs but she doesnt ask for money instead she says honey while youre giving it to me while youre pushing that big hard thing inside of me will you worship me will i what she is rocking back and forth on him the engorged head of his penis is being rubbed against the wet lips of her vulva american gods will you call me goddess will you pray to me will you worship me with your body he smiles is that all she wants weve all got our kinks at the end of the day sure he says she reaches her hand between her legs and slips him inside her is that good is it goddess he asks gasping worship me honey says bilquis the hooker yes he says i worship your breasts and your hair and your cunt i worship your thighs and your eyes and your cherryred lips yes she croons riding him i worship your nipples from which the milk of life flows your kiss is honey and your touch scorches like fire and i worship it his words are becoming more rhythmic now keeping pace with the thrust and roll of their bodies bring me your lust in the morning and bring me relief and your blessing in the evening let me walk in dark places unharmed and let me come to you once more and sleep beside you and make love with you again i worship you with everything that is within me and everything inside my mind with everywhere ive been and my dreams and my he breaks off panting for breath what are you doing that feels amazing so amazing and he looks down at his hips at the place where the two of them conjoin but her forefinger touches his chin and pushes his head back so he is looking only at her face and at the ceiling once again keep talking honey she says dont stop doesnt it feel good it feels better than anything has ever felt he tells her meaning it as he says it your eyes are stars burning in the shit the firmament and your lips are gentle waves that lick the sand and i worship them and now hes thrusting deeper and deeper inside her he feels electric as if his whole lower body has become sexually charged priapic engorged blissful neil caiman bring me your gift he mutters no longer knowing what he is saying your one true gift and make me always this always so i pray i and then the pleasure crests into orgasm blasting his mind into void his head and self and entire being a perfect blank as he thrusts deeper into her and deeper still eyes closed spasming he luxuriates in the moment and then he feels a lurch and it seems to him that he is hanging head down although the pleasure continues he opens his eyes he thinks grasping for thought and reason again of birth and wonders without fear in a moment of perfect postcoital clarity whether what he sees is some kind of illusion this is what he sees he is inside her to the chest and as he stares at this in disbelief and wonder she rests both hands upon his shoulders and puts gentle pressure on his body he slipslides further inside her how are you doing this to me he asks or he thinks he asks but perhaps it is only in his head youre doing it honey she whispers he feels the lips of her vulva tight around his upper chest and back constricting and enveloping him he wonders what this would look like to somebody watching them he wonders why he is not scared and then he knows i worship you with my body he whispers as she pushes him inside her her labia pull slickly across bis face and his eyes slip into darkness she stretches on the bed like a huge cat and then she yawns yes she says you do the nokia phone plays a high electrical transposition of the ode to joy she picks it up and thumbs a key and puts the telephone to her ear her belly is flat her labia small and closed a sheen of sweat glistens on her forehead and on her upper up american gods she turns the telephone off before she flops out on the bed m the dark red room then she stretches once more and she closes her eyes and she sleeps chapter two they took her to the cemetry in a big ol cadillac they took her to the cemetry but they did not bring her back old song i have taken the liberty said mr wednesday washing his hands in the mens room of jacks crocodile bar of ordering food for myself to be delivered to your table we have much to discuss after all i dont think so said shadow he dried his own hands on a paper towel and crumpled it and dropped it into the bin you need a job said wednesday people dont hire excons you folk make them uncomfortable i have a job waiting a good job would that be the job at the muscle farm maybe said shadow nope you dont robbie burtons dead without him the muscle farms dead too youre a liar of course and a good one the best you will ever meet but im afraid im not lying to you about this he reached into his pocket produced a folded newspaper and handed it to shadow page seven he said come on back to the bar you can read it at the table shadow pushed open the door back into the bar the air american gods was blue with smoke and the dixie cups were on the jukebox singing dco iko shadow smiled slightly in recognition of the old childrens song the barman pointed to a table in the corner there was a bowl of chili and a burger at one side of the table a rare steak and a bowl of fries laid in the place across from it look at my king all dressed in red iko iko all day i bet you five dollars he ii kill you dead jockamofeenanay shadow took his seat at the table he put the newspaper down this is my first meal as a free man ill wait until after ive eaten to read your page seven shadow ate his hamburger it was better than prison hamburgers the chili was good but he decided after a couple of mouthfuls not the best in the state laura made a great chili she used lean meat dark kidney beans carrots cut small a bottle or so of dark beer and freshly sliced hot peppers she would let the chik cook for a while then add red wine lemon juice and a piiich of fresh dill and finally measure out and add her chili powders on more than one occasion shadow had tried to get her to show him how she made it he would watch everything she did from slicing the onions and dropping them into the olive oil at the bottom of the pot he had even written down the recipe ingredient by ingredient and he had once made lauras chili for himself on a weekend when she had been out of town it had tasted okayit was certainly edible but it had not been lauras chili the news item on page seven was the first account of his wifes death that shadow had read laura moon whose age was given in the article as twentyseven and robbie burton thirtynine were in robbies car on the interstate when they swerved into the path of a thirtytwowheeler the neil caiman truck brushed robbies car and sent it spinning off the side of the road rescue crews pulled robbie and laura from the wreckage they were both dead by the time they arrived at the hospital shadow folded the newspaper up once more and slid it back across the table toward wednesday who was gorging himself on a steak so bloody and so blue it might never have been introduced to a kitchen flame here take it back said shadow robbie had been driving he must have been drunk although the newspaper account said nothing about this shadow found himself imagining lauras face when she realized that robbie was too drunk to drive the scenario unfolded in shadows mind and there was nothing he could do to stop it laura shouting at robbieshouting at him to pull off the road then the thud of car against truck and the steering wheel wrenching over the car on the side of the road broken glass glittering like ice and diamonds in die headlights blood pooling in rubies on the road beside them two bodies being carried from the wreck or laid neatly by the side of the road well asked mr wednesday he had finished his steak devoured it like a starving man now he was munching the french fries spearing them with his fork youre right said shadow i dont have a job shadow took a quarter from his pocket tails up he flicked it up in the air knocking it against his finger as it left his hand giving it a wobble as if it were turning caught it slapped it down on the back of his hand call he said whyr asked wednesday i dont want to work for anyone with worse luck than me call heads said mr wednesday american gods sorry said shadow without even bothering to glance at the quarter it was tails i rigged the toss rigged games are the easiest ones to beat said wednesday wagging a square finger at shadow take another look at it shadow glanced down at it the head was faceup i must have fumbled the toss he said puzzled you do yourself a disservice said wednesday and he grinned im just a lucky lucky guy then he looked up well i never mad sweeney will you have a drink with us southern comfort and coke straight up said a voice from behind shadow ill go and talk to the barman said wednesday he stood up and began to make his way toward the bar arent you going to ask what im drinking called shadow i already know what youre drinking said wednesday and then he was standing by the bar patsy cline started to sing walking after midnight on the jukebox again the southern comfort and coke sat down beside shadow he had a short ginger beard he wore a denim jacket covered with bright sewon patches and under the jacket a stained white tshirt on the tshirt was printed if you cant eat it drink it smoke it or snort it then f ck it he wore a baseball cap on which was printed the only woman i have ever loved was another mans wife my mother he opened a soft pack of lucky strikes with a dirty thumbnail took a cigarette offered one to shadow shadow was about to take one automaticallyhe did not smoke neil caiman but a cigarette makes good barter materialwhen he realized that he was no longer inside he shook his head you working for our man then asked the bearded man he was not sober although he was not yet drunk it looks that way said shadow what do you do the bearded man lit his cigarette im a leprechaun he said with a grin shadow did not smile really he said shouldnt you be drinking guinness stereotypes you have to learn to think outside the box said the bearded man theres a lot more to ireland than guinness you dont have an irish accent ive been over here too fucken long so you are originally from ireland i told you im a leprechaun we dont come from fucken moscow i guess not wednesday returned to the table three drinks held easily in his pawlike hands southern comfort and coke for you mad sweeney mman and a jack daniels for me and this is for you shadow what is it taste it the drink was a tawny golden color shadow took a sip tasting an odd blend of sour and sweet on his tongue he could taste the alcohol underneath and a strange blend of flavors it reminded him a little of prison hooch brewed in a garbage bag from rotten fruit and bread and sugar and water but it was sweeter and far stranger okay said shadow i tasted it what was it mead said wednesday honey wine the drink of heroes the drink of the gods shadow took another tentative sip yes he could taste the honey he decided that was one of the tastes tastes kinda like pickle juice he said sweet picklejuice wine american gods tastes like a drunken diabetics piss agreed wednesday i hate the stuff then why did you bring it for me asked shadow reasonably wednesday stared at shadow with his mismatched eyes one of them shadow decided was a glass eye but he could not decide which one i brought you mead to drink because its traditional and right now we need all the tradition we can get it seals our bargain we havent made a bargain sure we have you work for me now you protect me you transport me from place to place you run errands in an emergency but only in an emergency you hurt people who need to be hurt in the unlikely event of my death you will hold my vigil and in return i shall make sure that your needs are adequately taken care of hes hustling you said mad sweeney rubbing his bristly ginger beard hes a hustler damn straight im a hustler said wednesday thats why i need someone to look out for my best interests the song on the jukebox ended and for a momentthe bar fell quiet every conversation at a lull someone once told me mat you only get those everybodyshutsupatonce moments at twenty past or twenty to the hour said shadow sweeney pointed to the clock above the bar held in the massive and indifferent jaws of a stuffed alligator head the time was there said shadow damned if i know why that happens i know why said wednesday drink your mead shadow knocked the rest of the mead back in one long gulp it might be better over ice he said or it might not said wednesday its terrible stuff that it is agreed mad sweeney youll excuse me for a moment gentlemen but i find myself in deep and urgent need neil caiman of a lengthy piss he stood up and walked away an impossibly tall man he had to be almost seven feet tall decided shadow a waitress wiped a cloth across the table and took their empty plates wednesday told her to bring the same again for everyone although this time shadows mead was to be on the rocks anyway said wednesday thats what i need of you would you like to know what i want asked shadow nothing could make me happier the waitress brought the drink shadow sipped his mead on the rocks the ice did not helpif anything it sharpened the sourness and made the taste linger in the mouth after the mead was swallowed however shadow consoled himself it did not taste particularly alcoholic he was not ready to be drunk not yet he took a deep breath okay said shadow my life which for three years has been a long way from being the greatest life there has ever been just took a distinct and sudden turn for the worse now there are a few things i need to do i want to go to lauras funeral i want to say goodbye i should wind up her stuff if you still need me i want to start at five hundred dollars a week the figure was a stab in the dark wednesdays eyes revealed nothing if were happy working together in six months time you raise it to a thousand a week he paused it was the longest speech hed made in years you say you may need people to be hurt well ill hurt people if theyre trying to hurt you but i dont hurt people for fun or for profit i wont go back to prison once was enough you wont have to said wednesday no said shadow i wont he finished the last of the mead he wondered suddenly somewhere in the back of his head whether the mead was responsible for loosening american gods his tongue but the words were coming out of him like the water spraying from a broken fire hydrant in summer and he could not have stopped them if he had tried i dont like you mister wednesday or whatever your real name may be we are not friends i dont know how you got off that plane without me seeing you or how you trailed me here but im at a loose end right now when were done ill be gone and if you piss me off ill be gone too until then ill work for you very good said wednesday then we have a compact and we are agreed what the hell said shadow across the room mad sweeney was feeding quarters into the jukebox wednesday spat in his hand and extended it shadow shrugged he spat in his own palm they clasped hands wednesday began to squeeze shadow squeezed back after a few seconds his hand began to hurt wednesday held the grip a little longer and then he let go good he said good very good so one last glass of evil vile fucking mead to seal our deal and then we are done itll be a southern comfort and coke fr me said sweeney lurching back from the jukebox the jukebox began to play the velvet undergrounds who loves the sun shadow thought it a strange song to find on a jukebox it seemed very unlikely but then this whole evening had become increasingly unlikely shadow took the quarter he had used for the coin toss from the table enjoying the sensation of a freshly milled coin against his fingers producing it in his right hand between forefinger and thumb he appeared to take it into his left hand in one smooth movement while casually fingerpalming it he closed his left hand on the imaginary quarter then he took a second quarter in his right hand between finger and thumb and as he pretended to drop that coin into the left hand he let the palmed quarter fall into his neil caiman right hand striking the quarter he held there on the way the chink confirmed the illusion that both coins were in his left hand while they were now both held safely in his right coin tricks is it asked sweeney his chin raising his scruffy beard bristling why if its coin tricks were doing watch this he took an empty glass from the table then he reached out and took a large coin golden and shining from the air he dropped it into the glass he took another gold coin from the air and tossed it into the glass where it clinked against the first he took a coin from the candle flame of a candle on the wall another from his beard a third from shadows empty left hand and dropped them one by one into the glass then he curled his fingers over the glass and blew hard and several more golden coins dropped into the glass from his hand he tipped the glass of sticky coins into his jacket pocket and then tapped the pocket to show unmistakably that it was empty there he said thats a coin trick for you shadow who had been watching closely put his head on one side i need to know how you did it i did it said sweeney with the air of one confiding a huge secret with panache and style thats how i did it he laughed silently rocking on his heels his gappy teeth bared yes said shadow that is how you did it youve got to teach me all the ways of doing the misers dream that ive read youd be hiding the coins in the hand that holds the glass and dropping them in while you produce and vanish the coin in your right hand sounds like a hell of a lot of work to me said mad sweeney its easier just to pick them out of the air wednesday said mead for you shadow ill stick with mister jack daniels and for the freeloading irishman a bottled beer something dark for preference said sweeney freeloader is it he picked up what was left of american gods his drink and raised it to wednesday in a toast may the storm pass over us and leave us hale and unharmed he said and knocked the drink back a fine toast said wednesday but it wont another mead was placed in front of shadow do i have to drink this im afraid you do it seals our deal third times the charm eh shit said shadow he swallowed the mead in two large gulps the pickledhoney taste filled his mouth there said mr wednesday youre my man now so said sweeney you want to know the trick of how its done yes said shadow were you loading them in your sleeve they were never in my sleeve said sweeney he chortled to himself rocking and bouncing as if he were a lanky bearded volcano preparing to erupt with delight at his own brilliance its the simplest trick in the world ill fight you for it shadow shook his head ill pass now theres a fine thing said sweeney to the room old wednesday gets himself a bodyguard and the fellers too scared to put up his fists even i wont fight you agreed shadow sweeney swayed and sweated he fiddled with the peak of his baseball cap then he pulled one of his coins out of the air and placed it on the table real gold if you were wondering said sweeney win or loseand youll lose its yours if you fight me a big fellow like youwhoda thought youd be a fucken coward hes already said he wont fight you said wednesday go away mad sweeney take your beer and leave us in peace sweeney took a step closer to wednesday call me a neil caiman freeloader will you you doomed old creature you coldblooded heartless old treehanger his face was turning a deep angry red wednesday put out his hands palms up pacific foolishness sweeney watch where you put your words sweeney glared at him then he said with the gravity of the very drunk youve hired a coward what would he do if i hurt you do you think wednesday turned to shadow ive had enough of this he said deal with it shadow got to his feet and looked up into mad sweeneys face how tall was the man he wondered youre bothering us he said youre drunk i think you ought to leave now a slow smile spread over sweeneys face there now he said he swung a huge fist at shadow shadow jerked back sweeneys hand caught him beneath the right eye he saw blotches of light and felt pain and with that the fight began sweeney fought without style without science with nothing but enthusiasm for the fight itself huge barreling roundhouse blows that missed as often as they connected shadow fought defensively carefully blocking sweeneys blows or avoiding them he became very aware of the audience around them tables were pulled out of the way with protesting groans making a space for the men to spar shadow was aware at all times of wednesdays eyes upon him of wednesdays humorless grin it was a test that was obvious but what kind of a test in prison shadow had learned there were two kinds of fights dont fuck with me fights where you made it as showy and impressive as you could and private fights real fights which were fast and hard and nasty and always over in seconds hey sweeney said shadow breathless why are we fighting american gods for the joy of it said sweeney sober now or at least no longer visibly drunk for the sheer unholy fucken delight of it cant you feel the joy in your own veins rising like the sap in the springtime his lip was bleeding so was shadows knuckle so howd you do the coin production asked shadow he swayed back and twisted took a blow on his shoulder intended for his face i told you how i did it when first we spoke grunted sweeney but theres none so blindow good oneas those who will not listen shadow jabbed at sweeney forcing him back into a table empty glasses and ashtrays crashed to the floor shadow could have finished him off then shadow glanced at wednesday who nodded shadow looked down at mad sweeney are we done he asked mad sweeney hesitated then nodded shadow let go of him and took several steps backward sweeney panting pushed himself back up to a standing position not on yer ass he shouted it aint over till i say it is then he grinned and threw himself forward swinging at shadow he stepped onto a fallen ice cube and his grin turned to openmouthed dismay as his feet went out from under him and he fell backward the back of his head hit the barroom floor with a definite thud shadow put his knee into mad sweeneys chest for the second time are we done fighting he asked we may as well be at that said sweeney raising his head from the floor for the joys gone out of me now like the pee from a small boy in a swimming pool on a hot day and he spat the blood from his mouth and closed his eyes and began to snore in deep and magnificent snores somebody clapped shadow on the back wednesday put a bottle of beer into his hand it tasted better than mead neil caiman shadow woke up stretched out in the back of a sedan the morning sun was dazzling and his head hurt he sat up awkwardly rubbing his eyes wednesday was driving he was humming tunelessly as he drove he had a paper cup of coffee in the cup holder they were heading along an interstate highway the passenger seat was empty how are you feeling this fine morning asked wednesday without turning around what happened to my car asked shadow it was a rental mad sweeney took it back for you it was part of the deal the two of you cut last night after the fight conversations from the night before began to jostle uncomfortably in shadows head you got anymore of that coffee the big man reached beneath the passenger seat and passed back an unopened bottle of water here youll be dehydrated this will help more than coffee for the moment well stop at the next gas station and get you some breakfast youll need to clean yourself up too you look like something the goat dragged in cat dragged in said shadow goat said wednesday huge rank stinking goat with big teeth shadow unscrewed the top of the water and drank something clinked heavily in his jacket pocket he put his hand into the pocket and pulled out a coin the size of a halfdollar it was heavy and a deep yellow in color in the gas station shadow bought a cleanuup kit which contained a razor a packet of shaving cream a comb and a disposable toothbrush packed with a tiny tube of toothpaste then he walked into the mens rest room and looked at himself in the mirror he had a bruise under one eyewhen he prodded it ex americangods perimentally with one finger he found it hurt deeplyand a swollen lower lip shadow washed his face with the rest rooms liquid soap then he lathered his face and shaved he cleaned his teeth he wet his hair and combed it back he still looked rough he wondered what laura would say when she saw him and then he remembered that laura wouldnt say anything ever again and he saw his face in the mirror tremble but only for a moment he went out i look like shit said shadow of course you do agreed wednesday wednesday took an assortment of snack food up to the cash register and paid for that and their gas changing his mind twice about whether he was doing it with plastic or with cash to the irritation of the gumchewing young lady behind the till shadow watched as wednesday became increasingly flustered and apologetic he seemed very old suddenly the girl gave him his cash back and put the purchase on the card and then gave him the card receipt and took his cash then returned the cash and took a different card wednesday was obviously on the verge of tears an old man made helpless by the implacable plastic march of the modern world they walked out of the warm gas station and their breath steamed in the air on the road once more browning grass meadows slipped past on each side of them the trees were leafless and dead two black birds stared at them from a telegraph wire hey wednesday what the way i saw it in there you never paid for the gas oh the way i saw it she wound up paying you for the privilege of having you in her gas station you think shes figured it out yet she never will neilgaiman so what are you a twobit con artist wednesday nodded yes he said i suppose i am among other things he swung out into the left lane to pass a truck the sky was a bleak and uniform gray its going to snow said shadow yes sweeney did he actually show me how he did that trick with the gold coins oh yes i cant remember itll come back it was a long night several small snowflakes brushed the windshield melting in seconds your wifes body is on display at wendells funeral parlor at present said wednesday then after lunch they will take her from there to the graveyard for the interment how do you know i called ahead while you were in the john you know where wendells funeral parlor is shadow nodded the snowflakes whirled and dizzied in front of them this is our exit said shadow the car stole off the interstate and past the cluster of motels to the north of eagle point three years had passed yes there were more stoplights unfamiliar storefronts shadow asked wednesday to slow as they drove past the muscle farm closed indefinitely said the handlettered sign on the door due to bereavement left on main street past a new tattoo parlor and the armed forces recruitment center then the burger king and familiar and unchanged olsens drug store finally the yellowbrick facade of wendells funeral parlor a neon sign in the front window said house of rest blank tomb americangods stones stood unchristened and uncarved in the window beneath the sign wednesday pulled up in the parking lot do you want me to come in he asked not particularly good the grin flashed without humor theres business i can be getting on with while you say your goodbyes ill get rooms for us at the motel america meet me there when youre done shadow got out of the car and watched it pull away then he walked in the dimly lit corridor smelled of flowers and of furniture polish with just the slightest tang of formaldehyde at the far end was the chapel of rest shadow realized that he was palming the gold coin moving it compulsively from a back palm to a front palm to a downs palm over and over the weight was reassuring in his hand his wifes name was on a sheet of paper beside the door at the far end of the corridor he walked into the chapel of rest shadow knew most of the people in the room lauras workmates several of her friends they all recognized him he could see it in their faces there were no smiles though no hellos at the end of the room was a small dais and on it a creamcolored casket with several displayspf flowers arranged about it scarlets and yellows and whites and deep bloody purples he took a step forward he could see lauras body from where he was standing he did not want to walk forward he did not dare to walk away a man in a dark suitshadow guessed he worked at the funeral homesaid sir would you like to sign the condolence and remembrance book and pointed him to a leatherbound book open on a small lectern he wrote shadow and the date in his precise handwriting then slowly he wrote beside it putting off neil caiman walking toward the end of the room where the people were and the casket and the thing in the cream casket that was no longer laura a small woman walked in through the door and hesitated her hair was a coppery red and her clothes were expensive and very black widows weeds thought shadow who knew her well audrey burton robbies wife audrey was holding a sprig of violets wrapped at the base with silver foil it was the kind of thing a child would make in june thought shadow but violets were out of season she walked across the room to lauras casket shadow followed her laura lay with her eyes closed and her arms folded across her chest she wore a conservative blue suit he did not recognize her long brown hair was out of her eyes it was his laura and it was not her repose he realized was what was unnatural laura was always such a restless sleeper audrey placed her sprig of summer violets on lauras chest then she worked her mouth for a moment and spat hard onto lauras dead face the spit caught laura on the cheek and began to drip down toward her ear audrey was already walking toward the door shadow hurried after her audrey he said shadow did you escape or did they let you out he wondered if she were taking tranquilizers her voice was distant and detached let me out yesterday im a free man said shadow what the hell was that all about she stopped in the dark corridor the violets they were always her favorite flower when we were girls we used to pick them together not the violets american gods oh that she said she wiped a speck of something invisible from the corner of her mouth well i would have thought that was obvious not to me audrey they didnt tell you her voice was calm emotionless your wife died with my husbands cock in her mouth shadow he went back in to the funeral home someone had already wiped away the spit after lunchshadow ate at the burger kingwas the burial lauras creamcolored coffin was interred in the small nondenominational cemetery on the edge of town unfenced a hilly woodland meadow filled with black granite and white marble headstones he rode to the cemetery in the wendeus hearse with lauras mother mrs mccabe seemed to feel that lauras death was shadows fault if youd been here she said this would never have happened i dont know why she married you i told her time and again i told her but they dont listen to their mothers do they she stopped looked more closely at shadows face have you been fighting yes he said barbarian she said then she set her mouth raised her head so her chins quivered and stared straight ahead of her to shadows surprise audrey burton was also at the funeral standing toward the back the short service ended the casket was lowered into the cold ground the people went away shadow did not leave he stood there with his hands in his pockets shivering staring at the hole in the ground above him the sky was iron gray featureless and flat as a mirror it continued to snow erratically in ghostlike tumbling flakes there was something he wanted to say to laura and he was prepared to wait until he knew what it was the world neil caiman slowly began to lose light and color shadows feet were going numb while his hands and face hurt from the cold he burrowed his hands into his pockets for warmth and his fingers closed about the gold coin he walked over to the grave this is for you he said several shovels of earth had been emptied onto the casket but the hole was far from full he threw the gold coin into the grave with laura then he pushed more earth into the hole to hide the coin from acquisitive grave diggers he brushed the earth from his hands and said good night laura then he said im sorry he turned his face toward the lights of the town and began to walk back into eagle point his motel was a good two miles away but after spending three years in prison he was relishing the idea that he could simply walk and walk forever if need be he could keep walking north and wind up in alaska or head south to mexico and beyond he could walk to patagonia or to tierra del fuego a car drew up beside him the window hummed down you want a lift shadow asked audrey burton no he said and not from you he continued to walk audrey drove beside him at three miles an hour snowflakes danced in the beams of her headlights i thought she was my best friend said audrey wed talk every day when robbie and i had a fight shed be the first one to knowwed go down to chichis for margaritas and to talk about what scumpots men can be and all the time she was fucking him behind my back please go away audrey i just want you to know i had good reason for what i did he said nothing hey she shouted hey im talking to you american gods shadow turned do you want me to tell you that you were right when you spit hi lauras face do you want me to say it didnt hurt or that what you told me made me hate her more than i miss her its not going to happen audrey she drove beside him for another minute not saying anything then she said so how was prison shadow it was fine said shadow you would have felt right at home she put her foot down on the gas then making the engine roar and drove on and away with the headlights gone the world was dark twilight faded into night shadow kept expecting the act of walking to warm nun to spread warmth through his icy hands and feet it didnt happen back in prison low key lyesmith had once referred to the little prison cemetery out behind the infirmary as the bone orchard and the image had taken root in shadows mind that night he had dreamed of an orchard under the moonlight of skeletal whitetrees their branches ending in bony hands their roots going deep down into the graves there was fruit that grew upon the trees in the bone orchard in his dream and there was something very disturbing about the fruit in the dream but on waking he could no longer remember what strange fruit grew oh the trees nor why he found it so repellent y cars passed him shadow wished that there was a sidewalk he tripped on something that he could not see in the dark and sprawled into the ditch on the side of the road his right hand sinking into several inches of cold mud he climbed to his feet and wiped his hands on the leg of his pants he stood there awkwardly he had only enough time to observe that there was someone beside him before something wet was forced over his nose and mouth and he tasted harsh chemical fumes this time the ditch seemed warm and comforting neil caiman shadows temples felt as if they had been reattached to the rest of his skull with roofing nails his hands were bound behind his back with what felt like some kind of straps he was in a car sitting on leather upholstery for a moment he wondered if there was something wrong with his depth perception and then he understood that no the other seat really was that far away there were people sitting beside him but he could not turn to look at them the fat young man at the other end of the stretch limo took a can of diet coke from the cocktail bar and popped it open he wore a long black coat made of some silky material and he appeared barely out of his teens a spattering of acne glistened on one cheek he smiled when he saw that shadow was awake hello shadow he said dont fuck with me okay said shadow i wont can you drop me off at the motel america up by the interstate hit him said the young man to the person on shadows left a punch was delivered to shadows solar plexus knocking the breath from him doubling him over he straightened up slowly i said dont fuck with me that was fucking with me keep your answers short and to the point or ill fucking kill you or maybe i wont kill you maybe ill have the children break every bone in your fucking body there are two hundred and six of them so dont fuck with me got it said shadow the ceiling lights in the limo changed color from violet to blue then to green and to yellow youre working for wednesday said the young man yes said shadow what the fuck is he after i mean whats he doing here he must have a plan whats the game plan i started working for mister wednesday this morning said shadow im an errand boy american gods youre saying you dont know im saying i dont know the boy opened his jacket and took out a silver cigarette case from an inside pocket he opened it and offered a cigarette to shadow smoke shadow thought about asking for his hands to be untied out decided against it no thank you he said the cigarette appeared to have been handrolled and when the boy lit it with a matte black zippo lighter it smelled a little like burning electrical parts the boy inhaled deeply then held his breath he let the smoke trickle out from his mouth pulled it back into his nostrils shadow suspected that he had practiced that in front of a mirror for a while before doing it in public if youve lied to me said the boy as if from a long way away ill fucking kill you you know that so you said the boy took another long drag on his cigarette you say youre staying at the motel america he tapped on the drivers window behind him the glass window lowered hey motel america up by the interstate we need to drop off our guest the driver nodded and the glass rose up again the glinting fiberoptic lights inside the limo continued to change cycling through their set of dim colors it seemed to shadow that the boys eyes were glinting too the green of an antique computer monitor you tell wednesday this man you tell him hes history hes forgotten hes old tell him that we are the future and we dont give a fuck about him or anyone like him he has been consigned to the dumpster of history while people like me ride our limos down the superhighway of tomorrow ill tell him said shadow he was beginning to feel lightheaded he hoped that he was not going to be sick tell him that we have fucking reprogrammed reality tell him that language is a virus and that religion is an op neil caiman crating system and that prayers are just so much fucking spam tell him that or ill fucking kill you said the young man mildly from the smoke got it said shadow you can let me out here i can walk the rest of the way the young man nodded good talking to you he said the smoke had mellowed him you should know that if we do fucking kill you then well just delete you you got that one click and youre overwritten with random ones and zeros undelete is not an option he tapped on the window behind him hes getting off here he said then he turned back to shadow pointed to his cigarette synthetic toad skins he said you know they can synthesize bufotenin now the car stopped and the door was opened shadow climbed out awkwardly his bonds were cut shadow turned around the inside of the car had become one writhing cloud of smoke in which two lights glinted now coppercolored like the beautiful eyes of a toad its all about the dominant fucking paradigm shadow nothing else is important and hey sorry to hear about your old lady the door closed and the stretch limo drove off quietly shadow was a couple of hundred yards away from his motel and he walked there breathing the cold air past red and yellow and blue lights advertising every kind of fast food a man could imagine as long as it was a hamburger and he reached the motel america without incident chapter three every hour wounds the last one kills old saying there was a thin young woman behind the counter at the motel america she told shadow he had already been checked in by his friend and gave him his rectangular plastic room key she had pale blonde hair and a rodentlike quality to her face that was most apparent when she looked suspicious and eased when she smiled she refused to tell him wednesdays room number and insisted on telephoning wednesday on the house phone to let him know his guest was here wednesday came out of a room down the hall and beckoned to shadow how was the funeral he asked its over said shadow you want to talk about it no said shadow good wednesday grinned too much talking these days talk talk talk this country would get along much better if people learned how to suffer in silence wednesday led the way back to his room which was across the hall from shadows there were maps all over the room unfolded spread out on the bed taped to the walls wednesday had drawn all over the maps in bright neil caiman marking pens fluorescent greens and painful pinks and vivid oranges i got hijacked by a fat kid said shadow he says to tell you that you have been consigned to the dungheap of history while people like him ride in their limos down the superhighways of life something like that little snot said wednesday you know him wednesday shrugged i know who he is he sat down heavily on the rooms only chair they dont have a clue he said they dont have a fucking clue how much longer do you need to stay in town i dont know maybe another week i guess i need to wrap up lauras affairs take care of the apartment get rid of her clothes all that itll drive her mother nuts but the woman deserves it wednesday nodded his huge head well the sooner youre done the sooner we can move out of eagle point goodnight shadow walked across the hall his room was a duplicate of wednesdays room down to the print of a bloody sunset on the wall above the bed he ordered a cheese and meatball pizza then he ran a bath pouring all the motels little plastic bottles of shampoo into the water making it foam he was too big to lie down in the bathtub but he sat in it and luxuriated as best he could shadow had promised himself a bath when he got out of prison and shadow kept his promises the pizza arrived shortly after he got out of the bath and shadow ate it washing it down with a can of root beer shadow lay in bed thinking this is my first bed as a free man and the thought gave him less pleasure than he had imagined that it would he left the drapes open watched the lights of the cars and of the fast food joints through the window glass comforted to know there was another world out there one he could walk to anytime he wanted american gods shadow could have been in his bed at home he thought in the apartment that he had shared with laurain the bed that he had shared with laura but the thought of being there without her surrounded by her things her scent her life was simply too painful dont go there thought shadow he decided to think about something else he thought about coin tricks shadow knew that he did not have the personality to be a magician he could not weave the stories that were so necessary for belief nor did he wish to do card tricks nor produce paper flowers but he just wanted to manipulate coins he liked the craft of it he started to list the coin vanishes he had mastered which reminded him of the coin he had tossed into lauras grave and then in his head audrey was telling him that laura had died with robbies cock in her mouth and once again he felt a small hurt in his heart every hour wounds the last one kills where had he heard that he thought of wednesdays comment and smiled despite himself shadow had heard too many people telling each other not to repress their feelings to let their emotions out let the pain go shadow thought there was a tot to be said for bottling up emotions if you did it long enough and deep enough he suspected pretty soon you wouldnt feel anything at all sleep took him then without shadow noticing he was walking he was walking through a room bigger than a city and everywhere he looked there were statues and carvings and roughhewn images he was standing beside a statue of a womanlike thing her naked breasts hung flat and pendulous on her chest around her waist was a chain of severed hands both of her own hands held sharp knives and instead of a head rising from her neck there were twin serpents their bodies arched facing each other ready to attack there was something profoundly disturbing about neil caiman the statue a deep and violent wrongness shadow backed away from it he began to walk through the hall the carved eyes of those statues that had eyes seemed to follow his every step in his dream he realized that each statue had a name burning on the floor in front of it the man with the white hair with a necklace of teeth about his neck holding a drum was leucotios the broadhipped woman with monsters dropping from the vast gash between her legs was hubur the ramheaded man holding the golden ball was hershef a precise voice fussy and exact was speaking to him in his dream but he could see no one these are gods who have been forgotten and now might as well be dead they can be found only in dry histories they are gone all gone but their names and their images remain with us shadow turned a corner and knew himself to be in another room even vaster than the first it went on farther than the eye could see close to him was the skull of a mammoth polished and brown and a hairy ocher cloak being worn by a small woman with a deformed left hand next to that were three women each carved from the same granite boulder joined at the waist their faces had an unfinished hasty look to them although their breasts and genitalia had been carved with elaborate care and there was a flightless bird which shadow did not recognize twice his height with a beak like a vultures but with human arms and on and on the voice spoke once more as if it were addressing a class saying these are the gods who have passed out of memory even their names are lost the people who worshiped them are as forgotten as their gods their totems are long since broken and cast down their last priests died without passing on their secrets gods die and when they truly die they are unmourned american gods and unremembered ideas are more difficult to kill than people but they can be killed in the end there was a whispering noise that began then to run through the hall a low susurrus that caused shadow in his dream to experience a chilling and inexplicable fear an allengulfing panic took him there in the halls of the gods whose very existence had been forgottenoctopusfaced gods and gods who were only mummified hands or falling rocks or forest fires shadow woke with his heart jackhammering in his chest his forehead clammy entirely awake the red numerals on the bedside clock told him the time was am the light of the motel america sign outside shone through his bedroom window disoriented shadow got up and walked into the tiny motel bathroom he pissed without turning on the lights and returned to the bedroom the dream was still fresh and vivid in his minds eye but he could not explain to himself why it had scared him so the light that came into the room from outside was not bright but shadows eyes had become used to the dark there was a woman sitting on the side of hisbed he knew her he would have known her in a crowd of a thousand or of a hundred thousand she was still wearing the navy blue suit they had buried her in her voice was a whisper but a familiar line i guess said laura youre going to ask what im doing here shadow said nothing he sat down on the rooms only chair and finally asked is that you yes she said im cold puppy youre dead babe yes she said yes i am she patted the bed next to her come and sit by me she said no said shadow i think ill stay right here for now we have some unresolved issues to address like me being dead neil caiman possibly but i was thinking more of how you died you and robbie oh she said that shadow could smellor perhaps he thought he simply imagined that he smelledan odor of rot of flowers and preservatives his wifehis exwife no he aorrected himself his late wifesat on the bed and stared at him unblinking puppy she said could youdo you think you could possibly get mea cigarette i thought you gave them up i did she said but im no longer concerned about the health risks and i think it would calm my nerves theres a machine in the lobby shadow pulled on his jeans and a tshirt and went barefoot into the lobby the night clerk was a middleaged man reading a book by john grisham shadow bought a pack of virginia slims from the machine he asked the night clerk for a book of matches youre in a nonsmoking room said the clerk you make sure you open the window now he passed shadow a book of matches and a plastic ashtray with the motel america logo on it got it said shadow he went back into his bedroom she had stretched out now on top of his rumpled covers shadow opened the window and then passed her the cigarettes and the matches her fingers were cold she lit a match and he saw that her nails usually pristine were battered and chewed and there was mud under them laura lit the cigarette inhaled blew out the match she took another puff i cant taste it she said i dont think this is doing anything im sorry he said me too said laura american gods when she inhaled the cigarette tip glowed and he was able to see her face so she said they let you out yes the tip of the cigarette glowed orange im still grateful i should never have got you mixed up in it well he said i agreed to do it i could have said no he wondered why he wasnt scared of her why a dream of a museum could leave him terrified while he seemed to be coping with a walking corpse without fear yes she said you could have you big galoot smoke wreathed her face she was very beautiful in the dim light you want to know about me and robbie i guess she stubbed out the cigarette in the ashtray you were in prison she said and i needed someone to talk to i needed a shoulder to cry on you werent there i was upset im sorry shadow realized something was different about her voice and he tried to figure out what it was i know so wed meet for coffee talk about what wed do when you got out of prison how good it would be to see you again he really liked you you know he was looking forward to giving you back your old job yes and then audrey went to visit her sister for a week this was oh a year thirteen months after youd gone away her voice lacked expression each word was flat and dull like pebbles dropped one by one into a deep well robbie came over we got drunk together we did it on the floor of the bedroom it was good it was really good i didnt need to hear that no im sorry its harder to pick and choose when youre dead its like a photograph you know it doesnt matter as much it matters to me neil caiman laura lit another cigarette her movements were fluid and competent not stiff shadow wondered for a moment if she was dead at all perhaps this was some kind of elaborate trick yes she said i see that well we carried on our affairalthough we didnt call it that we did not call it anythingfor most of the last two years t were you going to leave me for him why would i do that youre my big bear youre my puppy you did what you did for me i waited three years for you to come back to me i love you he stopped himself from saying love you too he wasnt going to say that not anymore so what happened the other night the night i was killed yes well robbie and i went out to talk about your welcomeback surprise party it would have been so good and i told him that we were done finished that now that you were back that was the way it had to be mm thank you babe youre welcome darling the ghost of a smile crossed her face we got maudlin it was sweet we got stupid i got very drunk he didnt he had to drive we were driving home and i announced that i was going to give him a goodbye blowjob one last time with feeling and i unzipped his pants and i did big mistake tell me about it i knocked the gearshift with my shoulder and then robbie was trying to push me out of the way to put the car back in gear and we were swerving and there was a loud crunch and i remember the world started to roll and to spin and i thought tm going to die it was very dispassionate i remember that i wasnt scared and then i dont remember anything more there was a smell like burning plastic it was the ciga americangods rette shadow realized it had burned down to the filter laura did not seem to have noticed what are you doing here laura cant a wife come and see her husband youre dead i went to your funeral this afternoon yes she stopped talking stared into nothing shadow stood up and walked over to her he took the smoldering cigarette butt from her fingers and threw it out of the window well her eyes sought his i dont know much more than i did when i was alive most of the stuff i know now that i didnt know then i cant put into words normally people who die stay in their graves said shadow do they do they really puppy i used to think they did too now im not so sure perhaps she climbed off the bed and walked over to the window her face in the light of the motel sign was as beautiful as it had ever been the face of the woman he had gone to prison for his heart hurt in his chest as if someone had taken it in a fist and squeezed laura she did not look at him youve gotten yourself mixed up in some bad things shadow youre going to screw it up if someone isnt there to watch out for you im watching out for you and thank you for my present what present she reached into the pocket of her blouse and pulled out the gold coin he had thrown into the grave earlier that day there was still black dirt on it i may have it put on a chain it was very sweet of you youre welcome she turned then and looked at him with eyes that seemed both to see and not to see him i think there are several aspects of our marriage were going to have to work on babes he told her youre dead neil caiman thats one of those aspects obviously she paused okay she said im going now it will be better if i go and naturally and easily she turned and put her hands on shadows shoulders and went up on tiptoes to kiss him goodbye as she had always kissed him goodbye awkwardly he bent to kiss her on the cheek bjit she moved her mouth as he did so and pushed her lips against his her breath smelled faintly of mothballs lauras tongue flickered into shadows mouth it was cold and dry and it tasted of cigarettes and of bile if shadow had had any doubts as to whether his wife was dead or not they ended then he pulled back i love you she said simply ill be looking out for you she walked over to the motel room door there was a strange taste in his mouth get some sleep puppy she told him and stay out of trouble she opened the door to the hall the fluorescent light in the hallway was not kind beneath it laura looked dead but then it did that to everyone you could have asked me to stay the night she said in her coldstone voice i dont think i could said shadow you will hon she said before all this is over you will she turned away from him and walked down the corridor shadow looked out of the doorway the night clerk kept on reading his john grisham novel and barely looked up as she walked past him there was thick graveyard mud clinging to her shoes and then she was gone shadow breathed out a slow sigh his heart was pounding arrhythmically in his chest he walked across the hall and knocked on wednesdays door as he knocked he got the weirdest notion that he was being buffeted by black wings as if an enormous crow was flying through him out into the hall and the world beyond wednesday opened the door he had a white motel towel american gods wrapped around his waist but was otherwise naked what the hell do you want he asked something you should know said shadow maybe it was a dreambut it wasntor maybe i inhaled some of the fat kids synthetic toadskin smoke or probably im just going mad yeah yeah spit it out said wednesday im kind of in the middle of something here shadow glanced into the room he could see that there was someone in the bed watching him a sheet pulled up over small breasts pale blonde hair something rattish about the face he lowered his voice i just saw my wife he said she was in my room a ghost you mean you saw a ghost no not a ghost she was solid it was her shes dead all right but it wasnt any kind of a ghost i touched her she kissed me i see wednesday darted a look at the woman in the bed be right back mdear he said they crossed the hall to shadows room wednesday turned on the lamps he looked at the cigarette butt in the ashtray he scratched his chest his nipples were dark oldman nipples and his chest hair was grizzled there was a white scar down one side of his torso he sniffed the air then he shrugged okay he said so your dead wife showed up you scared a little very wise the dead always give me the screaming mimis anything else im ready to leave eagle point lauras mother can sort out the apartment all that she hates me anyway im ready to go when you are wednesday smiled good news my boy well leave in the morning now you should get some sleep i have some scotch in my room if you need help sleeping yes neil caiman no ill be fine then do not disturb me further i have a long night ahead of me good night said shadow exactly said wednesday and he closed the door as he went out shadow sat down on the bed the smell of cigarettes and preservatives lingered in the air he wished that he were mourning laura it seemed more appropriate than being troubled by her or he admitted it to himself now that she had gone just a little scared by her it was time to mourn he turned the lights out and lay on the bed and thought of laura as she was before he went to prison he remembered their marriage when they were young and happy and stupid and unable to keep their hands off each other it had been a very long time since shadow had cried so long he thought he had forgotten how he had not even wept when his mother died but he began to cry now in painful lurching sobs and for the first time since he was a small boy shadow cried himself to sleep coming to america ad they navigated the green sea by the stars and by the shore and when the shore was only a memory and the night sky was overcast and dark they navigated by faith and they called on the allfather to bring them safely to land once more a bad journey they had of it their fingers numb and with a shiver in their bones that not even wine could burn off they would wake in the morning to see that the hoarfrost american gods had touched their beards and until the sun wanned them they looked like old men whitebearded before their time teeth were loosening and eyes were deepsunken in their sockets when they made landfall on the green land to the west the men said we are far far from our homes and our hearths far from the seas we know and the lands we love here on the edge of the world we will be forgotten by our gods their leader clambered to the top of a great rock and he mocked them for their lack of faith the allfather made the world he shouted he built it with his hands from the shattered bones and the flesh of ymir his grandfather he placed ymirs brains in the sky as clouds and his salt blood became the seas we crossed if he made the world do you not realize that he created this land as well and if we die here as men shall we not be received into his hall and the men cheered and laughed they set to with a will to build a hall out of split trees and mud inside a small stockade of sharpened logs although as far as they knew they were the only men in the new land on the day that the hall was finished there was a storm the sky at midday became as dark as night and the sky was rent with forks of white flame and the thundercrashes were so loud that the men were almost deafened by them and the ships cat they had brought with them for good fortune hid beneath their beached longboat the storm was hard enough and vicious enough that the men laughed and clapped each other on the back and they said the thunderer is here with us in this distant land and they gave thanks and rejoiced and they drank until they were reeling in the smoky darkness of their hall that night the bard sang them the old songs he sang of odin the allfather who was sacrificed to himself as bravely and as nobly as others were sacrificed to him he sang of the nine days that the abfather hung from the worldtree his side pierced neil caiman and dripping from the spearpoints wound and he sang them all the things the allfather had learned in his agony nine names and nine runes and twicenine charms when he told them of the spear piercing odins side the bard shrieked in pain as the allfather himself had called out in his agony and all the men shivered imagining his pain they found the scraeling the following day which was the allfathers own day he was a small man his long hair black as a crows wing his skin the color of rich red clay he spoke in words none of them could understand not even their bard who had been on a ship that had sailed through the pillars of hercules and who could speak the traders pidgin men spoke all across the mediterranean the stranger was dressed in feathers and in furs and there were small bones braided into his long hair they led him into their encampment and they gave him roasted meat to eat and strong drink to quench his thirst they laughed riotously at the man as he stumbled and sang at the way his head rolled and lolled and this on less than a drinkinghorn of mead they gave him more drink and soon enough he lay beneath the table with his head curled under his arm then they picked him up a man at each shoulder a man at each leg carried him at shoulder height the four men making him an eightlegged horse and they carried him at the head of a procession to an ash tree on the hill overlooking the bay where they put a rope around his neck and hung him high in the wind their tribute to the allfather the gallows lord the scraelings body swung in the wind his face blackening his tongue protruding his eyes popping his penis hard enough to hang a leather helmet on while the men cheered and shouted and laughed proud to be sending their sacrifice to the heavens and the next day when two huge ravens landed upon the scraelings corpse one on each shoulder and com americangods menced to peck at its cheeks and eyes the men knew their sacrifice had been accepted it was a long winter and they were hungry but they were cheered by the thought that when spring came they would send the boat back to the northlands and it would bring settlers and bring women as the weather became colder and the days became shorter some of the men took to searching for the scraeling village hoping to find food and women they found nothing save for the places where fires had been where small encampments had been abandoned one midwinters day when the sun was as distant and cold as a dull silver coin they saw that the remains of the scraelings body had been removed from the ash tree that afternoon it began to snow in huge slow flakes the men from the northlands closed the gates of their encampment retreated behind their wooden wall the scraeling war party fell upon them that night five hundred men to thirty they climbed the wall and over the following seven days they killed each of the thirty men in thirty different ways and the sailors were forgotten by history and their people the wall they tore down the war party and the village they burned the longboat upside down and pulled high on the shingle they also burned hoping that the pale strangers had but one boat and that by burning it they were ensuring that no other northmen would come to their shores it was more than a hundred years

that was going to fall and shadow wondered if that rain had fallen yet or if it was something that was still going to happen the road ahead of them was empty and the ice crystals on the asphalt glittered like diamonds in the morning sun chicago happened slowly like a migraine first they were driving through countryside then imperceptibly the occa americangods sional town became a low suburban sprawl and the sprawl became the city they parked outside a squat black brownstone the sidewalk was clear of snow they walked to the lobby wednesday pressed the top button on the gouged metal

fortunetelling i dabble in it myself wednesday was panting as they went up the final flight of stairs im out of shape the landing at the top of the stairs ended in a single door painted red with a peephole in it wednesday knocked at the door there was no response he knocked again louder this time okay okay i heard you i heard you the sound of american gods locks being undone of bolts being pulled the rattle of a chain the red door opened a crack who is it a mans voice old and cigaretteroughened an old friend czernobog with an associate the door opened as far as the security chain would allow shadow could see a gray face in the shadows peering out at them what do you want votan initially simply the pleasure of your company and i have information to share whats that phrase oh yes you may learn something to your advantage the door opened all the way the man in the dusty bathrobe was short with irongray hair and craggy features he wore gray pinstripe pants shiny from age and slippers he held an unfiltered cigarette with squaretipped fingers sucking the tip while keeping it cupped in his fistlike a convict thought shadow or a soldier he extended his left hand to wednesday welcome then votan they call me wednesday these days he said shaking the old mans hand a narrow smile a flash of yellow teeth yes he said very funny and this is this is my associate shadow meet mr czernobog well met said czernobog he shook shadows left hand with his own his hands were rough and callused and the tips of his fingers were as yellow as if they had been dipped in iodine how do you do mr czernobog i do old my guts ache and my back hurts and i cough my chest apart every morning why you are standing at the door asked a womans voice shadow looked over czernobogs shoulder at the old woman standing behind him she was smaller and frailer than her sister but her hair was long and still golden i am zorya utrennyaya she said you must not stand there in the hall you must go in sit down i will bring you coffee neil caiman through the doorway into an apartment that smelted like overboiled cabbage and cat box and unaltered foreign cigarettes and they were ushered through a tiny hallway past several closed doors to the sitting room at the far end of the corridor and were seated on a huge old horsehair sofa disturbing an elderly gray cat in the process who stretched stood up and walked stiffly to a distant part of the sofa where he lay down warily stared at each of them in turn then closed one eye and went back to sleep czeriiobog sat in an armchair across from them zorya utrennyaya found an empty ashtray and placed it beside czernobog how you want your coffee she asked her guests here we take it black as night sweet as sin thatll be fine maam said shadow he looked out of the window at the buildings across the street zorya utrennyaya went out czernobog stared at her as she left thats a good woman he said not like her sisters one of them is a harpy the other all she does is sleep he put his slippered feet up on a long low coffee table a chess board inset in the middle cigarette burns and mug rings on its surface is she your wife asked shadow shes nobodys wife the old man sat in silence for a moment looking down at his rough hands no we are all relatives we come over here together long time ago from the pocket of his bathrobe czernobog produced a pack of unfiltered cigarettes wednesday pulled out a narrow gold lighter and lit the old mans cigarette first we come to new york said czernobog all our countrymen go to new york then we come out here to chicago everything got very bad even in the old country they had nearly forgotten me here i am just a bad memory you know what i did when i got to chicago no said shadow i get a job in the meat business on the kill floor when the steer comes up the ramp i was a knocker you know american gods why we are called knockers is because we take the sledgehammer and we knock the cow down with it bam it takes strength in the arms yes then the shackler chains the beef up hauls it up then they cut the throat they drain the blood first before they cut the head off we were the strongest the knockers he pushed up the sleeve of his bathrobe flexed his upper arm to display the muscles still visible under the old skin is not just strong though there was an art to it to the blow otherwise the cow is just stunned or angry then in the fifties they give us the bolt gun you put it to the forehead bam bam now you think anybody can kill not so he mimed putting a metal bolt through a cows head it still takes skill he smiled at the memory displaying an ironcolored tooth dont tell them cowkilling stories zorya utrennyaya carried in their coffee on a red wooden tray in small brightly enameled cups she gave them each a cup then sat beside czernobog zorya vechernyaya is doing shopping she said she will be soon back we met her downstairs said shadow she says she tells fortunes yes said her sister in the twilight that is the time for lies i do not tell good lies so i am a poor fortuneteller and our sister zorya polunochnaya she ca i tell no lies at all the coffee was even sweeter and stronger than shadow had expected shadow excused himself to use the bathrooma closetlike room hung with several brownspotted framed photographs of men and women in stiff victorian poses it was early afternoon but already the daylight was beginning to fade he heard voices raised from down the hall he washed his hands in icycold water with a sicklysmelling sliver of pink soap czernobog was standing in the hall as shadow came out neil caiman you bring trouble he was shouting nothing but trouble i will not listen you will get out of my house wednesday was still sitting on the sofa sipping his coffee stroking the gray cat zorya utrennyaya stood on the thin carpet one hand nervously twining in and out of her long yellow hair a is there a problem asked shadow he is the problem shouted czernobog he is you tell him that there is nothing will make me help him i want him to go i want him out of here both of you go please said zorya utrennyaya please be quiet you wake up zorya polunochnaya you are like him you want me to join his madness shouted czernobog he looked as if he was on the verge of tears a pillar of ash tumbled from his cigarette onto the threadbare hall carpet wednesday stood up walked over to czernobog he rested his hand on czernobogs shoulder listen he said peaceably firstly its not madness its the only way secondly everyone will be there you would not want to be left out would you you know who i am said czernobog you know what these hands have done you want my brother not me and hes gone a door in the hallway opened and a sleepy female voice said is something wrong nothing is wrong my sister said zorya utrennyaya go back to sleep then she turned to czernobog see see what you do with all your shouting you go back in there and sit down sit czernobog looked as if he were about to protest and then the fight went out of him he looked frail suddenly frail and lonely the three men went back into the shabby sitting room there was a brown nicotine ring around that room that ended about a foot from the ceiling like the tide line in an old bathtub american gods it doesnt have to be for you said wednesday to czernobog unfazed if it is for your brother its for you as well thats one place you dualistic types have it over the rest of us eh czernobog said nothing speaking of bielebog have you heard anything from him czernobog shook his head he looked up at shadow do you have a brother no said shadow not that i know of i have a brother they say you put us together we are like one person you know when we are young his hair it is very blond very light his eyes are blue and people say he is the good one and my hair it is very dark darker than yours even and people say i am the rogue you know i am the bad one and now time passes and my hair is gray his hair too i think is gray and you look at us you would not know who was light who was dark were you close asked shadow close asked czernobog no how could we be we cared about such different things there was a clatter from the end of the hall and zorya vechemyaya came in supper in one hour she said then she went out czernobog sighed she thinks she is a gpod cook he said she was brought up there were servants to cook now there are no servants there is nothing not nothing said wednesday never nothing you said czernobog i shall not listen to you he turned to shadow do you play checkers he asked yes said shadow good you shall play checkers with me he said taking a wooden box of pieces from the mantelpiece and shaking them out onto the table i shall play black wednesday touched shadows arm you dont have to do this you know he said neil caiman not a problem i want to said shadow wednesday shrugged and picked up an old copy of readers digest from a small pile of yellowing magazines on the windowsill czernobogs brown fingers finished arranging the pieces on the squares and the game began in the days that were to come shadow often found himself remembering that game some nights he dreamed of it his flat round pieces were the color of old dirty wood nominally white czernobogs were a dull faded black shadow was the first to move in his dreams there was no conversation as they played just the loud click as the pieces were put down or the hiss of wood against wood as they were slid from square to adjoining square for the first half dozen moves each of the men slipped pieces out onto the board into the center leaving the back rows untouched there were pauses between the moves long chesslike pauses while each man watched and thought shadow had played checkers in prison it passed the time he had played chess too but he was not temperamentally suited to planning ahead he preferred picking the perfect move for the moment you could win in checkers like that sometimes there was a click as czernobog picked up a black piece and jumped it over one of shadows white pieces the old man picked up shadows white piece and put it on the table at the side of the board first blood you have lost said czernobog the game is done no said shadow games got a long way to go yet then would you care for a wager a little side bet to make it more interesting no said wednesday without looking up from a humor in uniform column he wouldnt american gods i am not playing with you old man i play with him so you want to bet on the game mister shadow what were you two arguing about before asked shadow czernobog raised a craggy eyebrow your master wants me to come with him to help him with his nonsense i would rather die you want to bet okay if i win you come with us the old man pursed his lips perhaps he said but only if you take my forfeit when you lose and that would be there was no change in czernobogs expression if i win i get to knock your brains out with the sledgehammer first you go down on your knees then i hit you a blow with it so you dont get up again shadow looked at the mans old face trying to read him he was not joking shadow was certain of that there was a hunger there for something for pain or death or retribution wednesday closed the readers digest this is ridiculous he said i was wrong to come here shadow were leaving the gray cat disturbed got to its feet and stepped onto the table beside the checkers game if stared at the pieces then leapt down onto the floor and tail held high it stalked from the room no said shadow he was not scared of d ing after all it was not as if he had anything to live for its fine i accept if you win the game you get the chance to knock my brains out with one blow of your sledgehammer and he moved his next white piece to the adjoining square on the edge of the board nothing more was said but wednesday did not pick up his readers digest again he watched the game with his glass eye and his true eye with an expression that betrayed nothing czernobog took another of shadows pieces shadow neil caiman took two of czernobogs from the corridor came the smell of unfamiliar foods cooking while not all of the smells were appetizing shadow realized suddenly how hungry he was the two men moved their pieces black and white turn and turnabout a flurry of pieces taken a blossoming of twopiecehigh kings no longer forced to move only forward on the board a sideways slip at a time the kings could move forward or back which made them doubly dangerous they had reached the farthest row and could go where they wanted czernobog had three kings shadow had two czernobog moved one of his kings around the board eliminating shadows remaining pieces while using the other two kings to keep shadows kings pinned down and then czernobog made a fourth king and returned down the board to shadows two kings and unsmiling took them both and that was that so said czernobog i get to knock out your brains and you will go on your knees willingly is good he reached out an old hand and patted shadows arm with it weve still got time before dinners ready said shadow you want another game same terms czernobog lit another cigarette from a kitchen box of matches how can it be same terms you want i should kill you twice right now you have one blow thats all you told me yourself that its not just strength its skill too this way if you win this game you get two blows to my head czernobog glowered one blow is all it takes one blow that is the art he patted his upper right arm where the muscles were with his left scattering gray ash from the cigarette in his left hand its been a long time if youve lost your skill you might simply bruise me how long has it been since you swung a killing hammer in the stockyards thirty years forty czernobog said nothing his closed mouth was a gray american gods slash across his face he tapped his fingers on the wooden table drumming out a rhythm with them then he pushed the twentyfour checkers back to their home squares on the board play he said again you are light i am dark shadow pushed his first piece out czernobog pushed one of his own pieces forward and it occurred to shadow that czernobog was going to try to play the same game again the one that he had just won that this would be his limitation this time shadow played recklessly he snatched tiny opportunities moved without thinking without a pause to consider and this time as he played shadow smiled and whenever czernobog moved a piece shadow smiled wider soon czernobog was slamming his pieces down as he moved them banging them down on the wooden table so hard that the remaining pieces shivered on their black squares there said czernobog taking one of shadows men with a crash slamming the black piece dowi there what do you say to mat shadow said nothing he simply smiled antfjumped the piece that czernobog had put down and another and another and a fourth clearing the center of the board of black pieces he took a white piece from the pile beside the board and kinged his man after that it was just a moppingup exercise another handful of moves and the game was done shadow said best of three czernobog simply stared at him his gray eyes like points of steel and then he laughed clapped his hands on shadows shoulders i like you he exclaimed you have balls then zorya utrennyaya put her head around the door to tell them that dinner was ready and they should clear their game away and put the tablecloth down on the table neil caiman we have no dining room she said i am sorry we eat in here serving dishes were placed on the table each of the diners was given a small painted tray on which was some tarnished cutlery to hold on his or her lap zorya vechernyaya took five wooden bowls and placed an unpeeled boiled potato in each then ladled in a healthy serving of a ferociously crimson borscht she plopped a spoonful of white sour cream in and handed the bowls to each of them i thought there were six of us said shadow zorya polunochnaya is still asleep said zorya vechernyaya we keep her food in the refrigerator when she wakes she will eat the borscht was vinegary and tasted like pickled beets the boiled potato was mealy the next course was a leathery pot roast accompanied by greens of some descriptionalthough they had been boiled so long and so thoroughly that they were no longer by any stretch of the imagination greens and were well on their way to becoming browns then there were cabbage leaves stuffed with ground meat and rice cabbage leaves of such a toughness that they were almost impossible to cut without spattering ground meat and rice all over the carpet shadow pushed his around his plate we played checkers said czernobog hacking himself another lump of pot roast the young man and me he won a game i won a game because he won a game i have agreed to go with him and wednesday and help them in their madness and because i won a game when this is all done i get to kill the young man with a blow of a hammer the two zoryas nodded gravely such a pity zorya vechernyaya told shadow in my fortune for you i should have said you would have a long life and a happy one with many children american gods that is why you are a good fortuneteller said zorya utrennyaya she looked sleepy as if it were an effort for her to be up so late you tell the best lies at the end of the meal shadow was still hungry prison food had been pretty bad and prison food was better than this good food said wednesday who had cleaned his plate with every evidence of enjoyment i thank you ladies and now i am afraid that it is incumbent upon us to ask you to recommend to us a fine hotel in the neighborhood zorya vechernyaya looked offended at this why should you go to a hotel she said we are not your friends i couldnt put you to any trouble said wednesday is no trouble said zorya utrennyaya one hand playing with her incongruously golden hair and she yawned you can sleep in bielebogs room said zorya vechernyaya pointing to wednesday is empty and for you young man i make up a bed on sofa you will be more comfortable than in feather bed i swear that would be really kind of you said wednesday we accept and you pay me only no more than whatybu pay for hotel said zorya vechernyaya with a triumphant toss of her head a hundred dollars thirty said wednesday u fifty thirtyfive fortyfive forty is good fortyfive dollar zorya vechernyaya reached across the table and shook wednesdays hand then she began to clean the pots off the table zorya utrennyaya yawned so hugely shadow worried that she might dislocate her jaw and announced that she was going to bed before she fell asleep with her head in the pie and she said good night to them all neil caiman shadow helped zorya vechernyaya to take the plates and dishes into the little kitchen to his surprise there was an elderly dishwashing machine beneath the sink and he filled it zorya vechernyaya looked over his shoulder tutted and removed the wooden borscht bowls those in the sink she told him sorry is not to worry now back in there we have pie she said the pieit was an apple piehad been bought in a store and ovenwarmed and was very very good the four of them ate it with ice cream and then zorya vechernyaya made everyone go out of the sitting room and made up a very finelooking bed on the sofa for shadow wednesday spoke to shadow as they stood in the corridor what you did in there with the checkers game he said yes that was good very very stupid of you but good sleep safe shadow brushed his teeth and washed his face in the cold water of the little bathroom and then walked back down the hall to the sitting room turned out the light and was asleep before his head touched the pillow there were explosions in shadows dream he was driving a truck through a minefield and bombs were going off on each side of him the windshield shattered and he felt warm blood running down his face someone was shooting at him a bullet punctured his lung a bullet shattered his spine another hit his shoulder he felt each bullet strike he collapsed across the steering wheel the last explosion ended in darkness must be dreaming thought shadow alone in the darkness think i just died he remembered hearing and be americangods lieving as a child that if you died in your dreams you would die in real life he did not feel dead he opened his eyes experimentally there was a woman in the little sitting room standing against the window with her back to him his heart missed a halfbeat and he said laura she turned framed by the moonlight im sorry she said i did not mean to wake you she had a soft eastern european accent i will go no its okay said shadow you didnt wake me i had a dream yes she said you were crying out and moaning part of me wanted to wake you but i thought no i should leave him her hair was pale and colorless in the moons thin light she wore a white cotton nightgown with a high lace neck and a hem that swept the ground shadow sat up entirely awake you are zorya polu he hesitated the sister who was asleep i am zorya polunochnaya yes and you are called shadow yes that was what zorya vechernyaya told me when i woke yes what were you looking at out there she looked at him then she beckoned him to join her by the window she turned her back while he pulled on his jeans he walked over to her it seemed a long walk for such a small room he could not tell her age her skin was unlined her eyes were dark her lashes were long her hair was to her waist and white the moonlight drained colors into ghosts of themselves she was taller than either of her sisters she pointed up into the night sky i was looking at that she said pointing to the big dipper see ursa major he said the great bear that is one way of looking at it she said but it is not neil caiman the way from where i come from i am going to sit on the roof would you like to come with me she lifted the window and clambered barefoot out onto the fire escape a freezing wind blew through the window something was bothering shadow but he did not know what it was he hesitated then pulled on his sweater stocks and shoes and followed her out onto the rusting fire escape she was waiting for him his breath steamed in the chilly air he watched her bare feet pad up the icy metal steps and followed her up to the roof the wind gusted cold flattening her nightgown against her body and shadow became uncomfortably aware that zorya polunochnaya was wearing nothing at all underneath you dont mind the cold he said as they reached the top of the fire escape and the wind whipped his words away sorry she bent her face close to his her breath was sweet i said doesnt the cold bother you in reply she held up a finger wait she stepped lightly over the side of the building and onto the flat roof shadow stepped over a little more clumsily and followed her across the roof to the shadow of the water tower there was a wooden bench waiting for them there and she sat down on it and he sat down beside her the water tower acted as a windbreak for which shadow was grateful no she said the cold does not bother me this time is my time i could no more feel uncomfortable in the night than a fish could feel uncomfortable in the deep water you must like the night said shadow wishing that he had said something wiser more profound my sisters are of their times zorya utrennyaya is of the dawn in the old country she would wake to open the gates and let our father drive hisuhm i forget the word like a car but with horses chariot his chariot our father would ride it out and zorya american gods vechernyaya she would open the gates for him at dusk when he returned to us and you she paused her lips were full but very pale i never saw our father i was asleep is it a medical condition she did not answer the shrug if she shrugged was imperceptible so you wanted to know what i was looking at the big dipper she raised an arm to point to it and the wind flattened her nightgown against her body her nipples every goosebump on the areolae were visible momentarily dark against the white cotton shadow shivered odins wain they call it and the great bear where we come from we believe that is a a thing a not a god but like a god a bad thing chained up in those stars if it escapes it will eat the whole of everything and there are three sisters who must watch the sky all the day all the night if he escapes the thing in the stars the world is over pf like that and people believe that they did a long time ago and you were looking to see if you could see the monster in the stars something like that yes j he smiled if it were not for the cold he decided he would have thought he was dreaming everything felt so much like a dream can i ask how old you are your sisters seem so much older she nodded her head i am the youngest zorya utrennyaya was born in the morning and zorya vechernyaya was born in the evening and i was born at midnight i am the midnight sister zorya polunochnaya are you married my wife is dead she died last week in a car accident it was her funeral yesterday neil caiman im so sorry she came to see me last night it was not hard to say in the darkness and the moonlight it was not as unthinkable as it was by daylight did you ask her what she wanted no not really perhaps you should it is the wisest thing to ask the dead sometimes they will tell you zorya vechernyaya tells me that you played checkers with czernobog yes he won the right to knock in my skull with a sledge in the old days they would take people up to the top of the mountains to the high places they would smash the back of their skulls with a rock for czernobog shadow glanced about no they were alone on the roof zorya polunochnaya laughed silly he is not here and you won a game also he may not strike his blow until this is all over he said he would not and you will know like the cows he killed they always know first otherwise what is the point i feel shadow told her like im in a world with its own sense of logic its own rules like when youre in a dream and you know there are rules you mustnt break even if you dont know what they mean im just going along with it you know i know she said she held his hand with a hand that was icy cold you were given protection once you were given the sun itself but you lost it already you gave it away all i can give you is much weaker protection the daughter not the father but all helps yes her white hair blew about her face in the chilly wind do i have to fight you or play checkers he asked you do not even have to kiss me she told him just take the moon from me how american gods take the moon i dont understand watch said zorya polunochnaya she raised her left hand and held it in front of the moon so that her forefinger and thumb seemed to be grasping it then in one smooth movement she plucked at it for a moment it looked like she had taken the moon from the sky but then shadow saw that the moon shone still and zorya polunochnaya opened her hand to display a silver libertyhead dollar resting between finger and thumb that was beautifully done said shadow i didnt see you palm it and i dont know how you did that last bit i did not palm it she said i took it and now i give it to you to keep safe here dont give this one away she placed it in his right hand and closed his fingers around it the coin was cold in his hand zorya polunochnaya leaned forward and closed his eyes with her fingers and kissed him lightly once upon each eyelid shadow awoke on the sofa fully dressed a narrow shaft of sunlight streamed in through the window making the dust motes dance he got out of bed and walked over to the window the room seemed much smaller in the daylight the thing that had been troubling him since last night came into focus as he looked out and down and across the street there was no fire escape outside this window no balcony no rusting metal steps still held tight in the palm of his hand bright and shiny as the day it had been minted was a libertyhead silver dollar oh youre up said wednesday putting his head around the door thats good you want coffee were going to rob a bank neil caiman coming to america the important thing to understand about american history wrote mr ibis in his leatherbound journal is that it is fictional a charcoalsketched simplicity for the children or the easily bored for the most part it is uninspected unimagined unthought a representation of the thing and not the thing itself it is a fine fiction he continued pausing for a moment to dip his pen in the inkwell and collect his thoughts that america was founded by pilgrims seeking the freedom to believe as they wished that they came to the americas spread and bred and filled the empty land in truth the american colonies were as much a dumping ground as an escape a forgetting place in the days where you could be hanged in london from tyburns triplecrowned tree for the theft of twelve pennies the americas became a symbol of clemency of a second chance but the conditions of transportation were such that for some it was easier to take the leap from the leafless and dance on nothing until the dancing was done transportation it was called for five years for ten years for life that was the sentence you were sold to a captain and would ride in his ship crowded tight as a slavers to the colonies or to the west indies off the boat the captain would sell you on as an indentured servant to one who would take the cost of your skin out in your labor until the years of your indenture were done but at least you were not waiting to hang in an english prison and you were free to make the best of your new world you were also free to bribe a sea captain to return you to england before the terms of your transportation were over and done people did and if the authorities caught you returning from transportationif an old enemy or an old friend with a american gods score to settle saw you and peached on youthen you were hanged without a blink i am reminded he continued after a short pause during which he refilled the inkwell on his desk from the bottle of umber ink from the closet and dipped his pen once more of the life of essie tregowan who came from a chilly little clifftop village in cornwall in the southwest of england where her family had lived from time out of mind her father was a fisherman and it was rumored that he was one of the wreckersthose who would hang their lamps high on the dangerous cliffs when the storm winds raged luring ships onto the rocks for the goods on shipboard essies mother was in service as a cook at the squires house and at the age of twelve essie began to work there in the scullery she was a thin little thing with wide brown eyes and dark brown hair and she was not a hard worker but was forever slipping off and away to listen to stories and tales if there was anyone who would tell them tales of the piskies and the spriggans of the black dogs of the moors and the sealwomen of the channel and though the squire laughed at such things the kitchenfolk always put oyjt a china saucer of the creamiest milk at night put it outside the kitchen door for the piskies several years passed and essie was nolonger a thin little thing now she curved and billowed lu the swell of the green sea and her brown eyes laughed and her chestnut hair tossed and curled essies eyes lighted on bartholomew the squires eighteenyearold son home from rugby and she went at night to the standing stone on the edge of the woodland and she put some bread that bartholomew had been eating but had left unfinished on the stone wrapped in a cut strand of her own hair and on the very next day bartholomew came and talked to her and looked on her approvingly with his own eyes the dangerous blue of a sky when a storm is coming while she was cleaning out the grate in his bedroom neil caiman he had such dangerous eyes said essie tregowan soon enough bartholomew went up to oxford and when essies condition became apparent she was dismissed but the babe was stillborn and as a favor to essies mother who was a very fine cook the squires wife prevailed upon her husband to return the former maiden to her former position in the scullery but essies love for bartholomew had turned to hatred for his family and within the year she took for her new beau a man from a neighboring village with a bad reputation who went by the name of josiah horner and one night when the family slept essie arose in the night and unbolted the side door to let her lover in he rifled the house while the family slept on suspicion immediately fell upon someone in the house for it was apparent that someone must have opened the door and someone must have known where the squire kept his silver plate and the drawer in which he kept his coins and his promissory notes still essie by resolutely denying everything was convicted of nothing until master josiah horner was caught in a chandlers in exeter passing one of the squires notes the squire identified it as his and horner and essie went to trial horner was convicted at the local assizes and was as the slang of the time so cruelly and so casually had it turned off but the judge took pity on essie because of her age or her chestnut hair and he sentenced her to seven years transportation she was to be transported on a ship called the neptune under the command of one captain clarke so essie went to the carolinas and on the way she conceived an alliance with the selfsame captain and prevailedupon him to return her to england with him as his wife and to take her to his mothers house in london where no man knew her the journey back when the human cargo had american gods been exchanged for cotton and tobacco was a peaceful time and a happy one for the captain and his new bride who were as two lovebirds or courting butterflies unable to cease from touching each other or giving each other little gifts and endearments when they reached london captain clarke lodged essie with his mother who treated her in all ways as her sons new wife eight weeks later the neptune set sail again and the pretty young bride with the chestnut hair waved her husband goodbye from dockside then she returned to her motherinlaws house where the old woman being absent essie helped herself to a length of silk several gold coins and a silver pot in which the old woman kept her buttons and pocketing these things essie vanished into the stews of london over the following two years essie became an accomplished shoplifter her wide skirts capable of concealing a multitude of sins consisting chiefly of stolen bolts of silk and lace and she lived life to the full essie gave thanks for her escapes from her vicissitudes to all the creatures that she had been told of as a child to the piskies and she would put a wooden bowl of milk on a window ledge each night although her friends laughed at her but she had the last laugh as her friends got the pox onjthe clap and essie remained in the peak of health she was a year shy of her twentieth birthday when fate dealt her an ill blow she sat in the crossed forks inn off fleet street in bell yard when she saw a young man enter and seat himself near the fireplace fresh down from the university oho a pigeon ripe for the plucking thinks essie to herself and she sits next to him and tells him what a fine young man he is and with one hand she begins to stroke his knee while her other hand more carefully goes in search of his pocket watch and then he looked her full in neil caiman the face and her heart leapt and sank as eyes the dangerous blue of the summer sky before a storm gazed back into hers and master bartholomew said her name she was taken to newgate and charged with returning from transportation found guilty essie shocked no one by pleading her belly although the town matrons whot assessed such claims were surprised when they were forced to agree that essie was indeed with child although who the father was essie declined to say her sentence of death was once more commuted to transportation this time for life she rode out this time on the seamaiden there were two hundred transportees on that ship packed into the hold like so many fat hogs on their way to market fluxes and fevers ran rampant there was scarcely room to sit let alone to lie down a woman died in childbirth in the back of the hold and the people being pushed in too tightly to pass her body forward she and the infant were forced out of a small porthole in the back directly into the choppy gray sea essie was eight months gone and it was a wonder she kept the baby but keep it she did in her life ever after she would have nightmares of her time in that hold and she would wake up screaming with the taste and stench of the place in her throat the seamaiden landed at norfolk in virginia and essies indenture was bought by a small planter a tobacco farmer named john richardson for his wife had died of the childbirth fever a week after giving birth to his daughter and he had need of a wet nurse and a maid of all work upon his smallholding so essies baby boy whom she called anthony after she said her late husband his father sucked at essies breast alongside of phyllida richardson and her employers child always got first suck american gods so she grew into a healthy child tall and strong while essies son grew weak and rickety on what was left and along with the milk the children as they grew drank essies tales of the knockers and the bluecaps who live down the mines of the bucca the tricksiest spirit of the land much more dangerous than the redheaded snubnosed piskies for whom the first fish of the catch was always left upon the shingle and for whom a freshbaked loaf of bread was left in the field at reaping time to ensure a fine harvest she told them of the appletree menold apple trees who talked when they had a mind and who needed to be placated with the first cider of the crop which was poured onto their roots as the year turned if they were to give you a fine crop for the next year she told them in her mellifluous cornish drawl which trees they should be wary of in the old rhyme elm he do brood and oak he do hate but the willowman goes walking if you stays out late she told them all these things and they believed because she believed the farm prospered and essie tregow i placed a china saucer of milk outside the back door each night for the piskies and after eight months john richardson came aknocking quietly on essies bedroom door and asked her for favors of the kind a woman shows a man and essie told him how shocked and hurt she was a poor widow woman and an indentured servant no better than a slave to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had had so much respect forand an indentured servant could not marry so how he could even think to torment an indentured transportee girl so she could not bring herself to thinkand her nutbrown eyes filled with tears such that richardson j neil caiman found himself apologizing to her and the upshot of it was that john richardson wound up in that corridor of that hot summers night going down on one knee to essie tregowan and proposing an end to her indenture and offering his hand in marriage now although she accepted him she would not sleep a night with him until it was legal whereupon she moved from the little room in the attic to the master bedroom in the front of the house and if some of farmer richardsons friends and their wives cut him when next they saw him in town many more of them were of the opinion that the new mistress richardson was a damn finelooking woman and that johnnie richardson had done quite well for himself within a year she was delivered of another child another boy but as blond as his father and his half sister and they named him john after his father the three children went to the local church to hear the traveling preacher on sundays and they went to the little school to learn their letters and their numbers with the children of the other small fanners while essie also made sure they knew the mysteries of the piskies which were the most important mysteries there were redheaded men with eyes and clothes as green as a river and turnedup noses funny squinting men who would if they got a mind to turn you and twist you and lead you out of your way unless you had salt in your pocket or a little bread when the children went off to school they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket a little bread in the other the old symbols of life and the earth to make sure they came safely home once more and they always did the children grew in the lush virginia hills grew tall and strong and the richardsons were happy and essie loved her husband as best she could they had been married a decade when john richardson developed a toothache so bad it made him fall from his american gods horse they took him to the nearest town where his tooth was pulled but it was too late and the blood poisoning carried him off blackfaced and groaning and they buried him beneath his favorite willow tree the widow richardson was left the farm to manage until richardsons two children were of age she managed the indentured servants and the slaves and brought in the tobacco crop year in year out she poured cider on the roots of the apple trees on new years eve and placed a loaf of newbaked bread in the fields at harvest time and she always left a saucer of milk at the back door the farm flourished and the widow richardson gained a reputation as a hard bargainer but one whose crop was always good and who never sold shoddy for better merchandise so all went well for another ten years but after that was a bad year for anthony her son slew johnnie his half brother in a furious quarrel over the future of the farm and the disposition of phyllidas hand and some said he had not meant to kill his brother and that it was a foolish blow that struck too deep and some said otherwise anthony fled leaving essie to bury her youngest son besidehis father now some said anthony fled to boston and some said he went south and his mother was of the opinion that he had taken ship to england to enlist in georges army and fight the rebel scots but with both sons gone thfe farm was an empty place and a sad one and phyllida pined and plained as if her heart had been broken while nothing that her stepmother could say or do would put a smile back on her lips again but heartbroken or not they needed a man about the farm and so phyllida married harry soames a ships carpenter by profession who had tired of the sea and who dreamed of a life on land on a farm like the lincolnshire farm upon which he had grown up and although the richardsons farm was little enough like that harry soames found correspondences enough to make him happy neil caiman five children were born to phyllida and harry three of whom lived the widow richardson missed her sons and she missed her husband although he was now little more than a memory of a fair man who treated her kindly phyllidas children would come to essie for tales and she would tell them of the black dog of the moors and of rawhead and bloodybones or the apple tree man but they were not interested they only wanted tales of jackjack up the beanstalk or jack giantkiller or jack and his cat and the king she loved those children as if they were her own flesh and blood although sometimes she would call them by the names of those long dead it was may and she took her chair out into the kitchen garden to pick peas and to shuck them in the sunlight for even in the lush heat of virginia the cold had entered her bones as the frost had entered her hair and a little warmth was a fine thing as the widow richardson shucked the peas with her old hands she got to thinking about how fine it would be to walk once more on the moors and the salty cliffs of her native cornwall and she thought of sitting on the shingle as a little girl waiting for her fathers ship to return from the gray seas her hands blueknuckled and clumsy opened the pea pods forced the full peas into an earthenware bowl and dropped the empty pea pods onto her aproned lap and then she found herself remembering as she had not remembered for a long time a life well lost how she had twitched purses and filched silks with her clever fingers and now she remembers the warden of newgate telling her that it will be a good twelve weeks before her case would be heard and that she could escape the gallows if she could plead her belly and what a pretty thing she wasand how she had turned to the wall and bravely lifted her skirts hating herself and hating him but knowing he was right and the feel american gods of the life quickening inside her that meant that she could cheat death for a little longer essie tregowan said the stranger the widow richardson looked up shading her eyes in the may sunshine do i know you she asked she had not heard him approach the man was dressed all in green dusty green trews green jacket and a dark green coat his hair was a carroty red and he grinned at her all lopsided there was something about the man that made her happy to look at him and something else that whispered of danger you might say that you know me he said he squinted down at her and she squinted right back up at him searching his moonface for a clue to his identity he looked as young as one of her own grandchildren yet he had called her by her old name and there was a burr in his voice she knew from her childhood from the rocks and the moors of her home youre a cornishman she asked that i am a cousin jack said the redhaired man or rather that i was but now im here in this new world where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow or a loaf of bread come harvest time the old woman steadied the bowl of peas upon her lap if youre who i think you are she said then ive no quarrel with you in the house she could hear phyllida grumbling to the housekeeper nor i with you said the redhaired fellow a little sadly although it was you that brought me here you and a few like you into this land with no time for magic and no place for piskies and such folk youve done me many a good turn she said good and ill said the squinting stranger were like the wind we blows both ways essie nodded neil caiman will you take my hand essie tregowan and he reached out a hand to her freckled it was and although essies eyesight was going she could see each orange hair on the back of his hand glowing golden in the afternoon sunlight she bit her lip then hesitantly she placed her blueknotted hand in his she was still warm when they found her although the life had fled her body and only half the peas were shelled chapter five madam lifes apiece in bloom death goes dogging everywhere shes the tenant of the room hes the ruffian on the stair w e henley madam lifes a piece in bloom only zorya utrennyaya was awake to say goodbye to them that saturday morning she took wednesdays fortyfive dollars and insisted on

zorya polunochnaya thinks very highly of you she said i also thank you said shadow thanks for the dinner she raised an eyebrow at him you liked you must come again wednesday and shadow walked down the stairs shadow neil caiman put his hands in his jacket pocket the silver dollar was cold in his hand it was bigger and heavier than any coins hed used so far he classicpalmed it let his hand hang by his side naturally then straightened his hand as the coin slipped down to a frontpalm position it felt natural there held between his forefinger and his little finger by theslightest of pressure smoothly done said wednesday im just learning said shadow i can do a lot of the technical stuff the hardest part is making people look at the wrong hand is that so yes said shadow its called misdirection he slipped his middle fingers under the coin pushing it into a back palm and fumbled his grip on it ever so slightly the coin dropped from his hand to the stairwell with a clatter and bounced down half a flight of stairs wednesday reached down and picked it up you cannot afford to be careless with peoples gifts said wednesday something like this you need to hang onto it dont go throwing it about he examined the coin looking first at the eagle side then at the face of liberty on the obverse ah lady liberty beautiful is she not he tossed the coin to shadow who picked it from

the french covered up her magnificent bosom on that statue they presented to new york liberty he continued wrinkling his nose at the used condom that lay on the bottom flight of steps toeing it to the

cold jism dripping down your leg he unlocked the car and pointed shadow to the passenger seat i think shes beautiful said shadow holding the coin up close libertys silver face reminded him a little of zorya polunochnaya that said wednesday driving off is the eternal folly of man to be chasing after the sweet flesh without realizing that it is simply a pretty cover for the bones worm food at night youre rubbing yourself against worm food no offense meant shadow had never seen wednesday quite so expansive his new boss he decided went through phases of extroversion followed by periods of intense quiet so you arent american asked shadow nobodys american said wednesday not originally thats my point he checked his watch we still have several hours to kill before the banks close good job last night with czernobog by the way i would have closed him on coming eventually but you enlisted him more wholeheartedly than i could ever have only because he gets to kill me afterward not necessarily as you yourself so wisely pointed out hes old and the killing stroke might merely leave you well paralyzed for life say a hopeless invalid so you have much to lobk forward to should mister czernobog survive the coming difficulties neil caiman and there is some question about this said shadow echoing wednesdays manner then hating himself for it fuck yes said wednesday he pulled up in the parking lot of a bank this he said is the bank i shall be robbing they dont close for another few hours lets go in and say hello t he gestured to shadow reluctantly shadow got out of the car if the old man was going to do something stupid shadow could see no reason why his face should be on the camera but curiosity pulled him and he walked into the bank he looked down at the floor rubbed his nose with his hand doing his best to keep his face hidden deposit forms maam said wednesday to the lone teller over there very good and if i were to need to make a night deposit same forms she smiled at him you know where the night deposit slot is hon left out the main door its on the wall my thanks wednesday picked up several deposit forms he grinned a goodbye at the teller and he and shadow walked out wednesday stood there on the sidewalk for a moment scratching his beard meditatively then he walked over to the atm machine and to the night safe set in the side of the wall and inspected them he led shadow across the road to the supermarket where he bought a chocolate fudge popsicle for himself and a cup of hot chocolate for shadow there was a pay phone set in the wall of the entry way below a

touches your tongue with cold and winter that kisses your face with its hesitant touch before freezing you to death twelve cottoncandy inches of snow creating a fairytale world making everything unrecognizably beautiful wednesday was talking to him im sorry said shadow i said were here said wednesday youwere somewhere else i was thinking about snow said shadow in kinkos wednesday set about

blades he wondered if he had slept wrong if the headache was an awkward legacy of the night befores sofa wednesday sat at the computer terminal composing a letter and with the clerks help making several largesized signs snow thought shadow high in the atmosphere perfect tiny crystals that form about a minute piece of dust each a lacelike work of fractal art and the snow crystals clump together into flakes as they fall covering chicago in their white plenty inch upon inch neil caiman here said wednesday he handed shadow a cup of kinkos coffee a halfdissolved lump of nondairy creamer powder floating on the top i think thats enough dont you enough what enough snow dont want to immobilize the city do we the sky was a uniform battleship gray snow was coming yes i didnt really do that

skull with one blow his eyesights going said wednesday hell probably miss you entirely now we still have a little time to kill the bank closes at midday on saturdays after all would you like lunch yes said shadow im starving i know just the place said wednesday he hummed as he drove some cheerful song that shadow could not dentify snowflakes began to fall just as shadow had imagined them and he felt strangely proud he knew rationally that he had nothing to do with the snow just as he knew the silver dollar he carried in his pocket was not and never had been the moon but still they stopped outside a large shedlike building a sign said that the allucaneat lunch buffet was i love this place said wednesday good food asked shadow not particularly said wednesday but the ambience is unmissable the ambience that wednesday loved it turned out once lunch had been eatenshadow had the fried chicken and enjoyed itwas the business that took up the rear of the shed it was the hanging flag across the center of the room announced a bankrupt and liquidated stock clearance depot wednesday went out to the car and reappeared with a small suitcase which he took into the mens room shadow figured hed learn soon enough what wednesday was up to whether he wanted to or not and so he prowled the liquidation aisles staring at the things for sale boxes of coffee for use in airline filters only teenage mutant ninja turtle neil caiman toys and xena warrior princess harem dolls teddy bears that played patriotic tunes on the xylophone when plugged in cans of processed meat galoshes and sundry overshoes marshmallows bill clinton presidential wristwatches artificial miniature christmas trees salt and pepper shakers in the shapes of animals body parts fruit and nuns and shadows favorite a just add real carrot snowman kit with plastic coal eyes a corncob pipe and a plastic hat shadow thought about how one made the moon seem to come out of the sky and become a silver dollar and what made a woman get out of her grave and walk across town to talk to you isnt it a wonderful place asked wednesday when he came out of the mens room his hands were still wet and he was drying them off on a handkerchief theyre out of paper towels in there he said he had changed his clothes he was now wearing a dark blue jacket with matching trousers a blue knit tie a thick blue sweater a white shirt and black shoes he looked like a security guard and shadow said so what can i possibly say to that young man said wednesday picking up a box of floating plastic aquarium fish other than to congratulate you on your perspicacity how about arthur haddock arthurs a good name too mundane well youll think of something there let us return to town we should be in perfect time for our bank robbery and then i shall have a little spending money most people said shadow would simply take it from the atm which is oddly enough more or less exactly what i was planning to do wednesday parked the car in the supermarket lot across the street from the bank from the trunk of the car wednesday brought out the metal ease a clipboard and a pair of american gods handcuffs he handcuffed the case to his left wrist the snow continued to fall then he put a peaked blue cap on and velcroed a patch to the breast pocket of his jacket ai security was written on the cap and the patch he put the deposit slips on his clipboard then he slouched he looked like a retired beat cop and appeared somehow to have gained himself a paunch now he said you do a little shopping in the food store then hang out by the phone if anyone asks youre waiting for a call from your girlfriend whose car has broken down so whys she calling me there how the hell should you know wednesday put on a pair of faded pink earmuffs he closed the trunk snowflakes settled on his dark blue cap and on his earmuffs how do i look he asked ludicrous said shadow ludicrous or goofy maybe said shadow mm goofy and ludicrous thats good wednesday smiled the earmuffs made him appear at the same time reassuring amusing and ultimately lovable he strode across the street and walked along the block to the bank building while shadow walked into the supermarket hall and watched wednesday taped a large red outoforder notice to the atm he put a red ribbon across the night deposit slot and he taped a photocopied sign up above it shadow read it with amusement for your convenience it said we are working to make ongoing improvements we apologize for the temporary inconvenience then wednesday turned around and faced the street he looked cold and putupon a young woman came over to use the atm wednesday neilgaiman shook his head explained that it was out of order she cursed apologized for cursing and ran off a car drew up and a man got out holding a small gray sack and a key shadow watched as wednesday apologized to the man then made him sign the clipboard checked his deposit slip painstakingly wrote nun out a receipt and puzzled over which copy to keep and finally opened his big black metal case and put the mans sack inside the man shivered hi the snow stamping his feet waiting for the old security guard to be done with this administrative nonsense so he could leave his takings and get out of the cold and be on his way then he took his receipt and got back into his warm car and drove off wednesday walked across the street carrying the metal case and bought himself a coffee at the supermarket afternoon young man he said with an avuncular chuckle as he passed shadow cold enough for you he walked back across the street and took gray sacks and envelopes from people coming to deposit their earnings or their takings on this saturday afternoon a fine old security man in his funny pink earmuffs shadow bought some things to readturkey hunting people and because the cover picture of bigfoot was so endearing the weekly world newsand stared out of the window anything i can do to help asked a middleaged black man with a white mustache he seemed to be the manager thanks man but no im waiting for a phone call my girlfriends car broke down probably the battery said the man people forget those things only last three maybe four years its not like they cost a fortune tell me about it said shadow hang in there big guy said the manager and he went back into the supermarket american gods the snow had turned the street scene into the interior of a snow globe perfect in all its details shadow watched impressed unable to hear the conversations across the street he felt it was like watching a fine silent movie performance all pantomime and expression the old security guard was gruff earnesta little bumbling perhaps but enormously wellmeaning everyone who gave him their money walked away a little happier from having met him and then the cops drew up outside the bank and shadows heart sank wednesday tipped his cap to them and ambled over to the police car he said his hellos and shook hands through the open window and nodded then hunted through his pockets until he found a business card and a letter and passed them through the window of the car then he sipped his coffee the telephone rang shadow picked up the handpiece and did his best to sound bored al security services he said can i speak to a haddock asked the cop across the street this is andy haddock speaking said shadow yeah mister haddock this is the police said the cop in the car across the street youve got a man at the first illinois bank on the corner of market and second uh yeah thats right jimmy ogerman and what seems to be the problem officer jim behaving himself hes not been drinking no problem sir your man is just fine sir just wanted to make certain everything was in order you tell jim that if hes caught drinking again officer hes fired you got that out of a job out on his ass we have zero tolerance at al security i really dont think its my place to tell him that sir hes doing a fine job were just concerned because some neil caiman thing like this really ought to be done by two personnel its risky having one unarmed guard dealing with such large amounts of money tell me about it or more to the point you tell those cheapskates down at the first illinois about it these are my men im putting on the line officer good men men like you shadow found himself warming to this identity he could feel himself becoming andy haddock chewed cheap cigar in his ashtray a stack of paperwork to get to this saturday afternoon a home in schaumburg and a mistress in a little apartment on lake shore drive yknow you sound like a bright young man officer uh myerson officer myerson you need a little weekend work or you wind up leaving the force any reason you give us a call we always need good men you got my card yes sir you hang onto it said andy haddock you call me the police car drove off and wednesday shuffled back through the snow to deal with the small line of people who were waiting to give him their money she okay asked the manager putting his head around the door your girlfriend it was the battery said shadow now i just got to wait women said the manager i hope yours is worth waiting for winter darkness descended the afternoon slowly graying into night lights went on more people gave wednesday their money suddenly as if at some signal shadow could not see wednesday walked over to the wall removed the outoforder signs and trudged across the slushy road heading for the parking lot shadow waited a minute then followed him wednesday was sitting in the back of the car he had american gods opened the metal case and was methodically laying everything he had been given out on the backseat in neat piles drive he said were heading for the first illinois bank over on state street repeat performance asked shadow isnt that kind of pushing your luck not at all said wednesday were going to do a little banking while shadow drove wednesday sat in the backseat and removed the bills from the deposit bags in handfuls leaving the checks and the credit card slips and taking the cash from some although not all of the envelopes he dropped the cash back into the metal case shadow pulled up outside the bank stopping the car about fifty yards down the road well out of camera range wednesday got out of the car and pushed the envelopes through the night deposit slot then he opened the night safe and dropped in the gray bags he closed it again he climbed into the passenger seat youre heading for said wednesday follow the signs west for madison shadow began to drive wednesday looked back at the bank they were leaving there my boy he said cheerfully that will confuse everything now to get the really big money you need to do that at about fourthirty on a sunday moaning when the clubs and the bars drop off their saturday nights takings hit the right bank the right guy making the dropoffthey tend to pick them big and honest and sometimes have a couple of bouncers accompany them but they arent necessarily smartand you can walk away with a quarter of a million dollars for an evenings work if its that easy said shadow how come everybody doesnt do it its not an entirely riskfree occupation said wednesday especially not at fourthirty in the morning neil caiman you mean the cops are more suspicious at fourthirty in the morning not at all but the bouncers are and things can get awkward he flicked through a sheaf of fifties added a smaller stack of twenties weighed them in his hand then passed them over to shadow here he said your first weeks wages shadow pocketed the money without counting it so thats what you do he asked to make money rarely only when a great deal of cash is needed fast on the whole i make my money from people who never know theyve been taken and who never complain and who will frequently line up to be taken when i come back that way again that sweeney guy said you were a hustler he was right but that is the least of what i am and the least of what i need you for shadow snow spun through their headlights and into the windshield as they drove through the darkness the effect was almost hypnotic this is the only country in the world said wednesday into the stillness that worries about what it is what the rest of them know what they are no one ever needs to go searching for the heart of norway or looks for the soul of mozambique they know what they are and just thinking out loud so youve been to lots of other countries then wednesday said nothing shadow glanced at him no said wednesday with a sigh no i never have they stopped for gas and wednesday went into the rest room in his security guard jacket and his suitcase and came american gods out in a crisp pale suit brown shoes and a kneelength brown coat that looked like it might be italian so when we get to madison what then take highway fourteen west to spring green well be meeting everyone at a place called the house on the rock you been there no said shadow but ive seen the signs the signs for the house on the rock were all around that part of the world oblique ambiguous signs all across illinois and minnesota and wisconsin probably as far away as iowa shadow suspected signs alerting you to the existence of the house on the rock shadow had seen the signs and wondered about them did the house balance perilously upon the rock what was so interesting about the rock about the house he had given it a passing thought but then forgotten it shadow was not in the habit of visiting roadside attractions they left the interstate at madison and drove past the dome of the capitol building another perfect snowglobe scene in the falling snow and then they were off the interstate and driving down country roads after almost an hour of driving through towns with names like black earth they turned down a narrow driveway past several enormous snowdusted flower pots entwined with fizardlike dragons the treelined parking lot was almost emphr theyll be closing soon said wednesday so what is this place asked shadow as they walked through the parking lot toward a low unimpressive wooden building this is a roadside attraction said wednesday one of the finest which means it is a place of power come again its perfectly simple said wednesday in other countries over the years people recognized the places of power sometimes it would be a natural formation sometimes it neil caiman would just be a place that was somehow special they knew that something important was happening there that there was some focusing point some channel some window to the immanent and so they would build temples or cathedrals or erect stone circles or well you get the idea there are churches all across the states though said shadow in every town sometimes on every block and about as significant in this context as dentists offices no in the usa people still get the call or some of them and they feel themselves being called to from the transcendent void and they respond to it by building a model out of beer bottles of somewhere theyve never visited or by erecting a gigantic bat house in some part of the country that bats have traditionally declined to visit roadside attractions people feel themselves being pulled to places where in other parts of the world they would recognize that part of themselves that is truly transcendent and buy a hot dog and walk around feeling satisfied on a level they cannot truly describe and profoundly dissatisfied on a level beneath that you have some pretty whackedout theories said shadow nothing theoretical about it young man said wednesday you should have figured that out by now there was only one ticket window open we stop selling tickets in half an hour said the girl it takes at least two hours to walk around you see wednesday paid for their tickets in cash wheres the rock asked shadow under the house said wednesday wheres the house wednesday put his finger to his lips and they walked forward farther in a player piano was playing something that was intended to be ravels bolero the place seemed to be a geometrically reconfigured s bachelor pad with american gods open stone work pile carpeting and magnificently ugly mushroomshaped stainedglass lampshades up a winding staircase was another room filled with knickknacks they say this was built by frank lloyd wrights evil twin said wednesday frank lloyd wrong he chuckled at his joke i saw that on a tshirt said shadow up and down more stairs and now they were in a long long room made of glass mat protruded needlelike out over the leafless blackandwhite countryside hundreds of feet below them shadow stood and watched the snow tumble and spin this is the house on the rock he asked puzzled more or less this is the infinity room part of the actual house although a late addition but no my young friend we have not scratched the tiniest surface of what the house has to offer so according to your theory said shadow walt disney world would be the holiest place in america wednesday frowned and stroked his beard walt disney bought some orange groves in the middle of florida and built a tourist town on them no magicmftere of any kind i think there might be something real in the original disneyland there may be some power there although twisted and hard to access but some parts of florida are filled with real magic you just have to keep your eyes open ah for the mermaids of weeki wachee follow me this way everywhere was the sound of music jangling awkward music ever so slightly off the beat and out of time wednesday took a fivedollar bill and put it into a change machine receiving a handful of brasscolored metal coins in return he tossed one to shadow who caught it and realizing that a small boy was watching him held it up between forefinger and thumb and vanished it the small boy ran over to his mother who was inspecting one of the ubiquitous santa neil caiman clausesover six thousand on display the signs readand he tugged urgently at the hem of her coat shadow followed wednesday outside briefly and then followed the signs to the streets of yesterday forty years ago alex jordanhis face is on the token you have palmed in your right hand shadowh egan to build a house on a high jut of rock in a field he did not own and even he could not have told you why and people came to see him build itthe curious and the puzzled and those who were neither and who could not honestly have told you why they came so he did what any sensible american male of his generation would do he began to charge them moneynothing much a nickel each perhaps or a quarter and he continued building and the people kept coming so he took those quarters and nickels and made something even bigger and stranger he built these warehouses on the ground beneath the house and filled them with things for people to see and then the people came to see them millions of people come here every year why but wednesday simply smiled and they walked into the dimly lit treelined streets of yesterday primlipped victorian china dolls stared in profusion through dusty store windows like so many props from respectable horror films cobblestones under their feet the darkness of a roof above their heads jangling mechanical music in the background they passed a glass box of broken puppets and an overgrown golden music box in a glass case they passed the dentists and the drugstore at the end of the street was a large glass box with a female mannequin inside it dressed as a gypsy fortuneteller now boomed wednesday over the mechanical music at the start of any quest or enterprise it behooves us to consult the norns so let us designate this sybil our urd eh he dropped a brasscolored house on the rock coin into american gods the slot with jagged mechanical motions the gypsy lifted her arm and lowered it once more a slip of paper chunked out of the slot wednesday took it read it grunted folded it up and put it in his pocket arent you going to show it to me ill show you mine said shadow a mans fortune is his own affair said wednesday stiffly i would not ask to see yours shadow put his own coin in the slot he took his slip of paper he read it every ending is a new beginning your lucky number is none your lucky color is dead motto like father like son shadow made a face he folded the fortune up and put it in his inside pocket they went farther in down a red corridor past rooms filled with empty chairs upon which restedviolins and violas and cellos that played themselves or seemed to when fed a coin keys depressed cymbals crashed pipes blew compressed air into clarinets and obojss shadow observed with a wry amusement that the bows of the stringed instruments played by mechanical arms never actually touched the strings which were often loose or missing he wondered whether all the sounds he heard were made by wind and percussion or whether there were tapes as well they had walked for what felt like several miles when they came to a room called the mikado one wall of which was a nineteenthcentury pseudooriental nightmare in which beetlebrowed mechanical drummers banged cymbals and drums while staring out from their neil caiman dragonencrusted lair currently they were majestically torturing saintsaenss danse macabre czernobog sat on a bench in the wall facing the mikado machine tapping out the time with his fingers pipes fluted bells jangled wednesday sat next to him shadow decided to remain standing czernobog extended his left hand shook wednesdays shook shadows well met he said then he sat back apparently enjoying the music the danse macabre came to a tempestuous and discordant end that all the artificial instruments were ever so slightly out of tune added to the otherworldliness of the place a new piece began how was your bank robbery asked czernobog it went well he stood reluctant to leave the mikado and its thundering jangling music slick as a snake in a barrel of butter said wednesday i get a pension from the slaughterhouse said czernobog i do not ask for more it wont last forever said wednesday nothing does more corridors more musical machines shadow became aware that they were not following the path through the rooms intended for tourists but seemed to be following a different route of wednesdays own devising they were going down a slope and shadow confused wondered if they had already been that way czernobog grasped shadows arm quickly come here he said pulling him over to a large glass box by a wall it contained a diorama of a tramp asleep in a churchyard in front of a church door the drunkards dream said the label explaining that it was a nineteenthcentury pennyintheslot machine originally from an english railway station the coin slot had been modified to take the brass house on the rock coins put in the money said czernobog why asked shadow american gods you must see i show you shadow inserted his coin the drunk in the graveyard raised his bottle to his lips one of the gravestones flipped over revealing a grasping corpse a headstone turned around flowers replaced by a grinning skull a wraith appeared on the right of the church while on the left of the church something with a halfglimpsed pointed unsettlingly birdlike face a pale boschian nightmare glided smoothly from a headstone into the shadows and was gone then the church door opened a priest came out and the ghosts haunts and corpses vanished and only the priest and the drunk were left alone in the graveyard the priest looked down at the drunk disdainfully and backed through the open door which closed behind him leaving the drunk on his own the clockwork story was deeply unsettling much more unsettling thought shadow than clockwork has any right to be you know why i show that to you asked czernobog no that is the world as it is that is thejreal world it is there in that box they wandered through a bloodcolored room filled with old theatrical organs huge organ pipes and what appeared to be enormous copper brewing vats i liberated from a brewery where are we going asked shadow the carousel said czernobog but weve passed signs to the carousel a dozen times already he goes his way we travel a spiral the quickest way is sometimes the longest shadows feet were beginning to hurt and he found this sentiment to be extremely unlikely a mechanical machine played octopuss garden in a room that went up for many stories the center of which was neil caiman filled entirely with a replica of a great black whalelike beast with a lifesized replica of a boat in its vast fiberglass mouth they passed on from there to a travel hall where they saw the car covered with tiles and the functioning rube goldberg chicken device and the rusting burma shave ads on the wall life is hard its toil and trouble keep your jawline free from stubble burma shave read one and he undertook to overtake the road was on a bend from now on the undertaker is his only friend burma shave and they were at the bottom of a ramp now with an icecream shop in front of them it was nominally open but the girl washing down the surfaces had a closed look on her face so they walked past it into the pizzeriacafeteria empty but for an elderly black man wearing a bright checked suit and canaryyellow gloves he was a small man the kind of little old man who looked as if the passing of the years had shrunk him eating an enormous manyscooped icecream sundae drinking a supersized mug of coffee a black cigarillo was burning in the ashtray in front of him three coffees said wednesday to shadow he went to the rest room shadow bought the coffees and took them over to czernobog who was sitting with the old black man and was american gods smoking a cigarette surreptitiously as if he were scared of being caught the other man happily toying with his sundae mostly ignored his cigarillo but as shadow approached he picked it up inhaled deeply and blew two smoke ringsfirst one large one then another smaller one which passed neatly through the firstand he grinned as if he were astonishingly pleased with himself shadow this is mister nancy said czernobog the old man got to his feet and thrust out his yellowgloved right hand good to meet you he said with a dazzling smile i know who you must be youre workin for the old oneeye bastard arent you there was a faint twang in his voice a hint of a patois that might have been west indian i work for mister wednesday said shadow yes please sit down czernobog inhaled on his cigarette i think he pronounced gloomily that our kind we like the cigarettes so much because they remind us of the offerings that once they burned for us the smoke rising up as they sought our approval or our favor they never gave me nothin like that sam nancy best i could hope for was a pile of fruit to eat maybe curried goat something slow and cold and tall to drink and a big old hightitty woman to keep me compajiy he grinned white teeth and winked at shadow these days said czernobog his expression unchanged we have nothing well i dont get anywhere near as much fruit as i used to said mr nancy his eyes shining but there still aint nothin out there in the world for my money that can beat a big old hightitty woman some folk you talk to they say its the booty you got to inspect at first but im here to tell you that its the titties that still crank my engine on a cold mornin nancy began to laugh a wheezing rattling goodnatured laugh and shadow found himself liking the old man despite himself neil caiman wednesday returned from the rest room and shook hands with nancy shadow you want something to eat a slice of pizza or a sandwich im not hungry said shadow let me tell you somethin said mr nancy it can be a long time between meals someone offers you food you say yes im no longer young as i was but i can tell you this you never say no to the opportunity to piss to eat or to get half an hours shuteye you follow me yes but im really not hungry youre a big one said nancy staring into shadows light gray eyes with old eyes the color of mahogany a tall drink of water but i got to tell you you dont look too bright i got a son stupid as a man who bought his stupid at a twoforone sale and you remind me of him if you dont mind ill take that as a compliment said shadow being called dumb as a man who slept late the mornin they handed out brains being compared to a member of your family mr nancy stubbed out his cigarillo then he flicked an imaginary speck of ash off his yellow gloves you may not be the worst choice old oneeye could have made come to that he looked up at wednesday you got any idea how many of us theres goin to be here tonight i sent the message out to everyone i could find said wednesday obviously not everyone is going to be able to come and some of them with a pointed look at czernbbog might not want to but i think we can confidently expect several dozen of us and the word will travel they made their way past a display of suits of armor and then wednesday pushed through an exit door circled them around the outside of american gods the building along a covered walkway in through another exit door and they were in the carousel room calliope music played a strauss waltz stirring and occasionally discordant the wall as they entered was hung with antique carousel horses hundreds of them some in need of a lick of paint others in need of a good dusting above them hung dozens of winged angels constructed rather obviously from female storewindow mannequins some of them bared their sexless breasts some had lost their wigs and stared baldly and blindly down from the darkness and then there was the carousel a sign proclaimed it was the largest in the world said how much it weighed how many thousand lightbulbs were to be found in the chandeliers that hung from it in gothic profusion and forbade anyone from climbing on it or from riding on the animals and such animals shadow stared impressed in spite of himself at the hundreds of fullsized creatures who circled on the platform of the carousel real creatures imaginary creatures and transformations of the two each creature was different he saw mermaid and merman ijentaur and unicorn elephants bulldog frog and phoenix zebra tiger manticore and basilisk swans pulling a carriage a white ox a fox twin walruses even a sea serpent all of them brightly colored and more than real each rode the platform as the waltz came to an end and a new waltz began the carousel did not even slow down whats it for asked shadow i mean okay worlds biggest hundreds of animals thousands of lightbulbs and it goes around all the time and no one ever rides it its not there to be ridden not by people said wednesday its there to be admired its there to be j l neil caiman like a prayer wheel goin around and round said mr nancy accumulating power so where are we meeting everyone asked shadow i thought you said that we were meeting them here but the place is empty wednesday grinned his scary grin shadow he said youre asking too many questions you are not paid to ask questions sorry now stand over here and help us up said wednesday and he walked over to the platform on one side with a description of the carousel on it and a warning that the carousel was not to be ridden shadow thought of saying something but instead he helped them one by one up onto the ledge wednesday seemed profoundly heavy czernobog climbed up himself only using shadows shoulder to steady himself nancy seemed to weigh nothing at all each of the old men climbed out onto the ledge and then with a step and a hop they walked out onto the circling carousel platform well barked wednesday arent you coming shadow not without a certain amount of hesitation and a hasty look around for any house on the rock personnel who might be watching swung himself up onto the ledge beside the worlds largest carousel shadow was amused and a little puzzled to realize that he was far more concerned about breaking the rules by climbing onto the carousel than he had been aiding and abetting this afternoons bank robbery each of the old men selected a mount wednesday climbed onto a golden wolf czernobog climbed onto an armored centaur its face hidden by a metal helmet nancy chuckling slithered up onto the back of an enormous leaping lion captured by the sculptor midroar he patted the side of the lion the strauss waltz carried them around majestically american gods wednesday was smiling and nancy was laughing delightedly an old mans cackle and even the dour czernobog seemed to be enjoying himself shadow felt as if a weight were suddenly lifted from his back three old men were enjoying themselves riding the worlds largest carousel so what if they all did get thrown out of the place wasnt it worth it worth anything to say that you had ridden on the worlds largest carousel wasnt it worth it to have traveled on one of those glorious monsters shadow inspected a bulldog and a mercreature and an elephant with a golden howdah and then he climbed on the back of a creature with an eagles head and the body of a tiger and held on tight the rhythm of the blue danube waltz rippled and rang and sang in his head the lights of a thousand chandeliers glinted and prismed and for a heartbeat shadow was a child again and all it took to make him happy was to ride the carousel he stayed perfectly still riding his eagletiger at the center of everything and the world revolved around him shadow heard himself laugh over the soubd of the music he was happy it was as if the last thirtysix hours had never happened as if the last three years had not happened as if his life had evaporated into the daydream of a small child riding the carousel in golden gate park in san francisco on his first trip back to the states a marathon journey by ship and by car his mother standing there watching him proudly and himself sucking his melting popsicle holding on tightly hoping that the music would never stop the carousel would never slow the ride would never end he was going around and around and around again then the lights went out and shadow saw the gods chapter six wide open and unguarded stand our gates and through them passes a wild motley throng men from volga and tartar steppes featureless figures from the hoangho malayan scythian teuton kelt and slav flying the old worlds poverty and scorn these bringing with them unknown gods and rites those tiger passions here to stretch their claws in street and alley what strange tongues are these accents of menace in our ear voices that once the tower of babel knew thomas bailey aldrich the unguarded gates one moment shadow was riding the worlds largest carousel holding on to his eagleheaded tiger and then the red and white lights of the carousel stretched and shivered and went out and he was falling through an ocean of stars while the mechanical waltz was replaced by a pounding rhythmic roll and crash as of cymbals or the breakers on the shores of a far ocean the only light was starlight but it illuminated everything with a cold clarity beneath him his mount stretched and padded its warm fur under his left hand its feathers beneath his right american gods its a good ride isnt it the voice came from behind him in his ears and in his mind shadow turned slowly streaming images of himself as he moved frozen moments each him captured in a fraction of a second every tiny movement lasting for an infinite period the images that reached his mind made no sense it was like seeing the world through the multifaceted jeweled eyes of a dragonfly but each facet saw something completely different and he was unable to combine the things he was seeing or thought he was seeing into a whole that made any sense he was looking at mr nancy an old black man with a pencil mustache in his check sports jacket and his lemonyellow gloves riding a carousel lion as it rose and lowered high in the air and at the same time in the same place he saw a jeweled spider as high as a horse its eyes an emerald nebula strutting staring down at him and simultaneously he was looking at an extraordinarily tall man with teakcolored skin and three sets of arms wearing a flowing ostrichfeather headdress his face painted with red stripes riding an irritated golden lion two of his six hands holding on tightly to the beasts mane and he was alsoseeing a young black boy dressed in rags his left foot all swollen and crawling with blackflies and last of all and behind all these things shadow was looking at a tiny brojlvn spider hiding under a withered ocher leaf shadow saw all these things and he knew they were the same thing if you dont close your mouth said the many things that were mr nancy somethins goin to fly in there shadow closed his mouth and swallowed hard there was a wooden hall on a bill a mile or so from them they were trotting toward the hall their mounts hooves and feet padding noiselessly on the dry sand at the seas edge neil caiman czernobog trotted up on his centaur he tapped the human arm of his mount none of this is truly happening he said to shadow he sounded miserable is all in your head best not to think of it shadow saw a grayhaired old easterneuropean immigrant with a shabby raincoat and one ironcolored tooth true but he also saw a squat black thing darker than the darkness that surrounded them its eyes two burning coals and he saw a prince with long flowing black hair and a long black mustache blood on his hands and his face riding naked but for a bear skin over his shoulder on a creature halfman halfbeast his face and torso bluetattooed with swirls and spirals who are you asked shadow what are you their mounts padded along the shore waves broke and crashed implacably on the night beach wednesday guided his wolfnow a huge and charcoalgray beast with green eyesover to shadow shadows mount caracoled away from it and shadow stroked its neck and told it not to be afraid its tiger tail swished aggressively it occurred to shadow that there was another wolf a twin to the one that wednesday was riding keeping pace with them in the sand dunes just a moment out of sight do you know me shadow said wednesday he rode his wolf with his head high his right eye glittered and flashed his left eye was dull he wore a cloak with a deep monklike cowl and his face stared out from the shadows i told you i would tell you my names this is what they call me i am called gladofwar grim raider and third i am oneeyed i am called highest and trueguesser i am grimnir and i am the hooded one i am allfather and i am gondlir wandbearer i have as many names as there are winds as many titles as there are ways to die my ravens are huginn and muninn thought and memory my wolves are freki and geri my horse is the gallows two ghostlygray ravens like transparent skins of birds landed american gods on wednesdays shoulders pushed their beaks into the side of wednesdays head as if tasting his mind and flapped out into the world once more what should i believe thought shadow and the voice came back to him from somewhere deep beneath the world in a bass rumble believe everything odin said shadow and the wind whipped the word from his lips odin whispered wednesday and the crash of the breakers on the beach of skulls was not loud enough to drown that whisper odin said wednesday tasting the sound of the words in his mouth odin said wednesday his voice a triumphant shout that echoed from horizon to horizon his name swelled and grew and filled the world like the pounding of blood in shadows ears and then as in a dream they were no longer riding toward a distant hall they were already there and their mounts were tied in the shelter beside the hall the hall was huge but primitive the roof was thatched the walls were wooden there was a firetburning in the center of the hall and the smoke stung shadowseyes we should have done this in my mind not in his muttered mr nancy to shadow it would have been warmer there were in his mind y more or less this is valaskjalf its hi old hall shadow was relieved to see that nancy was now once more an old man wearing yellow gloves although his shadow shook and shivered and changed in the flames of the fire and what it changed into was not always entirely human there were wooden benches against the walls and sitting on them or standing beside them perhaps ten people they kept their distance from each other a mixed lot who included a darkskinned matronly woman in a red sari several shabbylooking businessmen and others too close to the fire for shadow to be able to make them out neil caiman where are they whispered wednesday fiercely to nancy well where are they there should be dozens of us here scores you did all the inviting said nancy i think its a wonder you got as many here as you did you think i should tell a story to start things off t wednesday shook his head out of the question they dont look very friendly said nancy a storys a good way of gettin someone on your side and you dont have a bard to sing to them no stories said wednesday not now later there will be time for stories not now no stories right ill just be the warmup man and mr nancy strode out into the firelight with an easy smile i know what you are all thinkin he said you are thinking what is compe anansi doin comin out to talk to you all when the allfather called you all here just like he called me here well you know sometimes people need remindin of things i look around when i come in and i thought wheres the rest of us but then i thought just because we are few and they are many we are weak and they are powerful it does not mean that we are lost you know one time i saw tiger down at the water hole he had the biggest testicles of any animal and the sharpest claws and two front teeth as long as knives and as sharp as blades and i said to him brother tiger you go for a swim ill look after your balls for you he was so proud of his balls so he got into the water hole for a swim and i put his balls on and left him my own little spider balls and then you know what i did i ran away fast as my legs would take me i didnt stop till i got to the next town and i saw old monkey there you lookin mighty fine anansi said old monkey i said to him you know what they all singin in the town over there what are they singin he asks me they americangods singin the runniest song i told him then i did a dance and i sings tigers balls yeah i ate tigers balls now ain t nobody gonna stop me ever at all nobody put me up against the big black wall cos i ate that tigers testimonials i ate tigers balls old monkey he laughs fit to bust holding his side and shakin and stampin then he starts singin tigers balls i ate tigers balls snappin his fingers spinnin around on his two feet thats a fine song he says im goin to sing it to all my friends you do that i tell him and i head back to the water hole theres tiger down by the water hole walkin up and down with his tail switchin and swishin and his ears and the fur on his neck up as far as they can go and hes snappin at every insect comes by with his huge old saber teeth and his eyes flashin orange fire he looks mean and scary and big but danglin between his legs thevthe littlest balls in the littlest blackest most wrinkledy ballsack you ever did see hey anansi he says when he sees meytou were supposed to be guarding my balls while i went swimming but when i got out of the swimming hole there was nothing on the side of the bank but these little black shriveledup goodfornothing spider balls im wearing i done my best i tells him but it was those monkeys they come by and eat your balls all up and when i tell them off then they pulled off my own little balls and i was so ashamed i ran away you a liar anansi says tiger im going to eat your liver but then he hears the monkeys coming from their town to neil caiman the water hole a dozen happy monkeys boppin down the path clickin their fingers and singin as loud as they could sing tigers balls yeah i ate tigers balls t now aint nobody gonna stop me ever at all nobody put me up against the big black wall cos i ate that tigers testimonials i ate tigers balls and tiger he growls and he roars and hes off into the forest after them and the monkeys screech and head for the highest trees and i scratch my nice new big balls and damn they felt good hangin between my skinny legs and i walk on home and even today tiger keeps chasin monkeys so you all remember just because youre small doesnt mean you got no power mr nancy smiled and bowed his head and spread his hands accepting the applause and laughter like a pro and then he turned and walked back to where shadow and czernobog were standing i thought i said no stories said wednesday you call that a story said nancy i barely cleared my throat just warmed them up for you go knock them dead wednesday walked out into the firelight a big old man with a glass eye in a brown suit and an old armani coat he stood there looking at the people on the wooden benches saying nothing for longer than shadow could believe someone could comfortably say nothing and finally he spoke you know me he said you all know me some of you have no cause to love me but love me or not you know me there was a rustling a stir among the people on the benches ive been here longer than most of you like the rest of american gods you i figured we could get by on what we got not enough to make us happy but enough to keep going that may not be the case anymore theres a storm coming and its not a storm of our making he paused now he stepped forward and folded his arms across his chest when the people came to america they brought us with them they brought me and loki and thor anansi and the liongod leprechauns and kobolds and banshees kubera and frau holle and ashtaroth and they brought you we rode here in their minds and we took root we traveled with the settlers to the new lands across the ocean the land is vast soon enough our people abandoned us remembered us only as creatures of the old land as things that had not come with them to the new our true believers passed on or stopped believing and we were left lost and scared and dispossessed only what little smidgens of worship or belief we could find and to get by as best we could so thats what weve done gotten byout on the edges of things where no one was watching us tooclosely we have let us face it and admit it iittfelhfluence we prey on them and we take from them and we get by we strip and we whore and we drink too much we pump gas and we steal and we cheat and we exist in he cracks at the edges of society old gods here in this new land without gods wednesday paused he looked from one to another of his listeners grave and statesmanlike they stared back at him impassively their faces masklike and unreadable wednesday cleared his throat and he spat hard into the fire it flared and flamed illuminating the inside of the hall now as all of you will have had reason aplenty to discover for yourselves there are new gods growing in america clinging to growing knots of belief gods of credit card neil caiman and freeway of internet and telephone of radio and hospital and television gods of plastic and of beeper and of neon proud gods fat and foolish creatures puffed up with their own newness and importance they are aware of us and they fear us and they hate us said odin you are fooling yourselves if you believe otherwise they will destroy us if they can it is time for us to band together it is time for us to act the old woman in the red sari stepped into the firelight on her forehead was a small dark blue jewel she said you called us here for this nonsense and then she snorted a snort of mingled amusement and irritation wednesdays brows lowered i called you here yes but this is sense mamaji not nonsense even a child could see that so i am a child am i she wagged a finger at him i was old in kalighat before you were dreamed of you foolish man i am a child then i am a child for there is nothing in your foolish talk to see again a moment of double vision shadow saw the old woman her dark face pinched with age and disapproval but behind her he saw something huge a naked woman with skin as black as a new leather jacket and lips and tongue the bright red of arterial blood around her neck were skulls and her many hands held knives and swords and severed heads i did not call you a child mamaji said wednesday peaceably but it seems selfevident the only thing that seems selfevident said the old woman pointing is your own desire for glory weve lived in peace in this country for a long time some of us do better than others i agree i do well back in india there is an incarnation of me who does much better but so be it i am not envious ive watched the new ones rise and ive watched them fall american gods again her hand fell to her side shadow saw that the others were looking at her a mixture of expressions respect amusement embarrassmentin their eyes they worshiped the railroads here only a blink of an eye ago and now the iron gods are as forgotten as the emerald hunters make your point mamaji said wednesday my point her nostrils flared the corners of her mouth turned down iand i am obviously only a child say that we wait we do nothing we dont know that they mean us harm and will you still counsel waiting when they come in the night and they kill you or they take you away her expression was disdainful and amused it was all in the lips and the eyebrows and the set of the nose if they try such a thing she said they will find me hard to catch and harder still to kill a squat young man sitting on the bench behind her hrrumphed for attention then said with a booming voice allfather my people are comfortable we make the best of what we have if this war of yours goes against us we could lose everything wednesday said you have already lost everything i am offering you the chance to take something back the fire blazed high as he spoke illuminating the faces of the audience i dont really believe shadow thought dont believe any of this maybe im still fifteen moms still alive and i havent even met laura yet everything thats happened so far has been some kind of especially vivid dream and yet he could not believe that either all we have to believe with is our senses the tools we use to perceive the world our sight our touch our memory if they lie to us then nothing can be trusted and even if we do not believe then still we cannot travel in any other way than the road our senses show us and we must walk that road to the end neil caiman then the fire burned out and there was darkness in valaskjalf odins hall now what whispered shadow now we go back to the carousel room muttered mr nancy and old oneeye buys us all dinner greases some palms kisses some babies and no one says the geeword anymore geeword gods what were you doin the day they handed out brains boy anyway someone was telling a story about stealing a tigers balls and i had to stop and find out how it ended mr nancy chuckled but nothing was resolved nobody agreed to anything hes workin them slowly hell land em one at a time youll see theyll come around in the end shadow could feel that a wind was coming up from somewhere stirring his hair touching his face pulling at him they were standing in the room of the biggest carousel in the world listening to the emperor waltz there was a group of people tourists by the look of them talking with wednesday over at the other side of the room as many people as there had been shadowy figures in wednesdays hall through here boomed wednesday and he led them through the only exit formed to look like the gaping mouth of a huge monster its sharp teeth ready to rend them all to slivers he moved among them like a politician cajoling encouraging smiling gently disagreeing pacifying did that happen asked shadow did what happen shitforbrains asked mr nancy the hall the fire tiger balls riding the carousel heck nobodys allowed to ride the carousel didnt you see the signs now hush the monsters mouth led to the organ room which puzzled shadowhadnt they already come through that way americangods it was no less strange the second time wednesday led them all up some stairs past lifesized models of the four horsemen of the apocalypse hanging from the ceiling and they followed the signs to an early exit shadow and nancy brought up the rear and then they were out of the house on the rock walking past the gift store and heading back into the parking lot pity we had to leave before the end said mr nancy i was kind of hoping to see the biggest artificial orchestra in the whole world ive seen it said czernobog its not so much the restaurant was ten minutes up the road wednesday had told each of his guests that tonights dinner was on him and had organized rides to the restaurant for any of them who didnt have their own transportation shadow wondered how they had gotten to the house on the rock in the first place without their own transportation and how they were going to get away again but he said nothing it seemed the smartest thing to say shadow had a earful of wednesdays guests to ferry to the restaurant the woman in the red sari sat in the front seat beside him there were two men in the backseat the squat peculiarlooking young man whose name shadow had not properly caught but which sounded like elvisj nd another man in a dark suit who shadow could not remember he had stood beside the man as he got into the car had opened and closed the door for him and was unable to remember anything about him he turned around in the drivers seat and looked at him carefully noting his face his hair his clothes making certain he would know him if he met him again and turned back to start the car to find that the man had slipped from his mind an impression of wealth was left behind but nothing more im tired thought shadow he glanced to his right and snuck a glance at the indian woman he noted the tiny sil neil caiman ver necklace of skulls that circled her neck her charm bracelet of heads and hands that jangled like tiny bells when she moved the dark blue jewel on her forehead she smelled of spices of cardamom and nutmeg and flowers her hair was pepperandsalt and she smiled when she saw him look at her you call me mamaji she said i am shadow mamaji said shadow and what do you think of your employers plans mister shadow he slowed as a large black truck sped past overtaking them with a spray of slush i dont ask he dont tell he said if you ask me he wants a last stand he wants us to go out in a blaze of glory thats what he wants and we are old enough or stupid enough that maybe some of us will say yes its not my job to ask questions mamaji said shadow the inside of the car filled with her tinkling laughter the man in the backseatnot the peculiarlooking young man the other onesaid something and shadow replied to him but a moment later he was damned if he could remember what had been said the peculiarlooking young man had said nothing but now he started to hum to himself a deep melodic bass humming that made the interior of the car vibrate and rattle and buzz the peculiarlooking man was of average height but of an odd shape shadow had heard of men who were barrelchested before but had no image to accompany the metaphor this man was barrelchested and he had legs like yes like tree trunks and hands like exactly ham hocks he wore a black parka with a hood several sweaters thick dungarees and incongruously in the winter and with those clothes a pair of white tennis shoes which were the same size and shape as shoeboxes american gods his fingers resembled sausages with flat squaredoff fingertips thats some hum you got said shadow from the drivers seat sorry said the peculiar young man in a deep deep voice embarrassed he stopped humming no i enjoyed it said shadow dont stop the peculiar young man hesitated then commenced to hum oncemore his voice as deep and reverberant as before this time there were words interspersed in the humming down down down he sang so deeply that the windows rattled down down down down down down down christmas lights were draped across the eaves of every house and building that they drove past they ranged from discreet golden lights that dripped twinkles to giant displays of snowmen and teddy bears and multicolored stars shadow pulled up at the restaurant a big barnlike structure and he let his passengers off by the front door he drove the car to the back of the parking lot he wanted to make the short walk back to the restaurant alone in the cold to clear his head he parked the car beside a black truck he wondered if it was the same one that had sped past him earlier he closed the car door and stood there in the parking lot his breath steaming inside the restaurant shadow could imagine wednesday already sitting all his guests down around a big table working the room shadow wondered whether he had really had kali in the front of his car wondered what he had been driving in the back hey bud you got a match said a voice that was half familiar and shadow turned to apologize and say no he didnt but the gun barrel hit him over the left eye and he started to fall he put out an arm to steady himself as he went down someone pushed something soft into his mouth to stop him neil caiman from crying out and taped it into position easy practiced moves like a butcher gutting a chicken shadow tried to shout to warn wednesday to warn them all but nothing came out of his mouth but a muffled noise the quarry are all inside said the halffamiliar voice everyone in position a crackle of a voice hal audible through a radio lets move in and round them all up what about the big guy said another voice package him up take him out said the first voice they put a baglike hood over shadows head and bound his wrists and ankles with tape and put him in the back of a truck and drove him away there were no windows in the tiny room in which they had locked shadow there was a plastic chair a lightweight folding table and a bucket with a cover on it which served shadow as a makeshift toilet there was also a sixfootlong strip of yellow foam on the floor and a thin blanket with a longsincecrusted brown stain in the center blood or shit or food shadow didnt know and didnt care to investigate there was a naked bulb behind a metal grille high in the room but no light switch that shadow had been able to find the light was always on there was no door handle on his side of the door he was hungry the first thing he had done when the spooks had pushed him into the room after theyd ripped off the tape from his ankles and wrists and mouth and left him alone was to walk around the room and inspect it carefully he tapped the walls they sounded dully metallic there was a small ventilation grid at the top of the room the door was soundly locked he was bleeding above the left eyebrow in a slow ooze his head ached the floor was uncarpeted he tapped it it was made of the same metal as the walls american gods he took the top off the bucket pissed in it and covered it once more according to his watch only four hours had passed since the raid on the restaurant his wallet was gone but they had left him his coins he sat on the chair at the card table the table was covered with a cigaretteburned green baize shadow practiced appearing to push coins through the table then he took two quarters and made up a pointless coin trick he concealed a quarter in his right palm and openly displayed the other quarter in his left hand between finger and thumb then he appeared to take the quarter from his left hand while actually letting it drop back into his left hand he opened his right hand to display the quarter that had been there all along the thing about coin manipulation was that it took all shadows head to do it or rather he could not do it if he was angry or upset so the action of practicing an illusion even one with on its own no possible usefor he had expended an enormous amount of effort and skill to make it appear that he had moved a quarter fronirpne hand to the other something that it takes no skill whatever to do for realcalmed him cleared his mind of tufmoiland fear he began a trick even more pointless a onehanded halfdollartopenny transformation but with his two quarters each of the coins was alternately concealed nd revealed as the trick progressed he began with one quafter visible the other hidden he raised his hand to his mouth and blew on the visible coin while slipping it into a classic palm as the first two fingers took the hidden quarter out and presented it the effect was that he displayed a quarter in his hand raised it to his mouth blew on it and lowered it again displaying the same quarter all the while he did it over and over and over again he wondered if they were going to kill him and his hand trembled just a little and one of the quarters dropped from his fingertip onto the stained green baize of the card table neil caiman and then because he just couldnt do it anymore he put the coins away and took out the libertyhead dollar that zorya polunochnaya had given him and held onto it tightly and waited at three in the morning by his watch the spooks returned to interrogate him two men in dark suits with ciark hair and shiny black shoes spooks one was squarejawed wideshouldered had great hair looked like he had played football in high school badly bitten fingernails the other had a receding hairline silverrimmed round glasses manicured nails while they looked nothing alike shadow found himself suspecting that on some level possibly cellular the two men were identical they stood on each side of the card table looking down at him how long have you been working for cargo sir asked one i dont know what that is said shadow he calls himself wednesday grimm olfather old guy youve been seen with him sir ive been working for him for a couple of days dont lie to us sir said the spook with the glasses okay said shadow i wont but its still a couple of days the squarejawed spook reached down and twisted shadows ear between finger and thumb he squeezed as he twisted the pain was intense we told you not to lie to us sir he said mildly then he let go each of the spooks had a gun bulge under his jacket shadow did not try to retaliate he pretended he was back in prison do your own time thought shadow dont tell them anything they dont know already dont ask questions these are dangerous people youre palling around with sir said the spook with glasses you will be doing your american gods country a service by turning states evidence he smiled sympathetically im the good cop said the smile i see said shadow and if you dont want to help us sir said the squarejawed spook you can see what were like when were not happy he hit shadow an openhanded blow across the stomach knocking the breath from him it wasnt torture shadow thought just punctuation im the bad cop he retched i would like to make you happy said shadow as soon as he could speak all we ask is your cooperation sir can i ask gasped shadow can i ask who ill be cooperating with you want us to tell you our names asked the squarejawed spook you have to be out of your mind no hes got a point said the spook with glasses it may make it easier for him to relate to us he looked at shadow and smiled like a man advertising toothpaste hi im mister stone sir my colleague is mister wood actually said shadow i meant whatagency are you with cia fbi stone shook his head gee its not as easy as that anymore sir things just arent that simple y the private sector said wood the public sector you know theres a lot of interplay these days but i can assure you said stone with another smiley smile we are the good guys are you hungry sir he reached into a pocket of his jacket pulled out a snickers bar here a gift thanks said shadow he unwrapped the snickers bar and ate it i guess youd like something to drink with that coffee beer neil caiman water please said shadow stone walked to the door knocked on it he said something to the guard on the other side of the door who nodded and returned a minute later with a polystyrene cup filled with cold water cia said wood he shook his head ruefully those bozos hey stone i heard a new cia joke okay how can we be sure the cia wasnt involved in the kennedy assassination i dont know said stone how can we be sure hes dead isnt he said wood they both laughed feeling better now sir asked stone i guess so why dont you tell us what happened this evening sir we did some tourist stuff went to the house on the rock went out for some food you know the rest stone sighed heavily wood shook his head as if disappointed and kicked shadow in the kneecap the pain was excruciating then wood pushed a fist slowly into shadows back just above the right kidney and knuckled it hard and the pain was worse than the pain in shadows knee im bigger than either of them he thought can take them but they were armed and even if hesomehow killed or subdued them both hed still be locked in the cell with them wood was keeping his hands away from shadows face no marks nothing permanent just fists and feet on his torso and knees it hurt and shadow clutched the liberty dollar tight in the palm of his hand and waited for it to be over and after far too long a time the beating ended well see you in a couple of hours sir said stone american gods you know woody really hated to have to do that were reasonable men like i said we are the good guys youre on the wrong side meantime why dont you try to get a little sleep you better start taking us seriously said wood woodys got a point there sir said stone think about it the door slammed closed behind them shadow wondered if they would turn out the light but they didnt and it blazed into the room like a cold eye shadow crawled across the floor to the yellow foamrubber pad and climbed onto it pulling the thin blanket over himself and he closed his eyes and he held onto nothing and he held onto dreams time passed he was fifteen again and his mother was dying and she was trying to tell him something very important and he couldnt understand her he moved in his sleep and a shaft of pain moved him from halfsleep to halfwaking and he winced shadow shivered under the thin blanket his right arm covered his eyes blocking out the hghrof the bulb he wondered whether wednesday and the others were still at liberty if they were even still alive he hoped that they were j the silver dollar remained cold in his left hand he could feel it there as it had been during the beating he wondered idly why it did not warm to his body temperature half asleep now and half delirious the coin and the idea of liberty and the moon and zorya polunochnaya somehow became intertwined in one woven beam of silver light that shone from the depths to the heavens and he rode the silver beam up and away from the pain and the heartache and the fear away from the pain and blessedly back into dreams from far away he could hear some kind of noise but it was too late to think about it he belonged to sleep now neil caiman a halfthought he hoped it was not people coining to wake him up to hit him or to shout at him and then he noticed with pleasure he was really asleep and no longer cold somebody somewhere was calling for help loudly in his dream or out of it shadow rolled over on the foam rubber in his sleep finding new places that hurt as he rolled someone was shaking his shoulder he wanted to ask them not to wake him to let him sleep and leave him be but it came out as a grunt puppy said laura you have to wake up please wake up hon and there was a moments gentle relief he had had such a strange dream of prisons and con men and downatheel gods and now laura was waking him to tell him it was time for work and perhaps there would be time enough before work to steal some coffee and a kiss or more than a kiss and he put out his hand to touch her her flesh was cold as ice and sticky shadow opened his eyes where did all the blood come from he asked other people she said its not mine im filled with formaldehyde mixed with glycerin and lanolin which other people he asked the guards she said its okay i killed them you better move i dont think i gave anyone a chance to raise the alarm take a coat from out there or youll freeze your butt off you killed them she shrugged and half smiled awkwardly her hands looked as if she had been fingerpainting composing a picture that had been executed solely in crimsons and there were splashes and spatters on her face and clothes that made shadow american gods think of jackson pollock because it was less problematic to think of jackson pollock than to accept the alternative its easier to kill people when youre dead yourself she told him i mean its not such a big deal youre not so prejudiced anymore its still a big deal to me said shadow you want to stay here until the morning crew comes she said you can if you like i thought youd like to get out of here theyll think i did it he said stupidly maybe she said put on a coat hon youll freeze he walked out into the corridor at the end of the corridor was a guardroom in the guardroom were four dead men three guards and the man who had called himself stone his friend was nowhere to be seen from the bloodcolored skid marks on the floor two of them had been dragged into the guardroom and dropped onto the floor his own coat was hanging from the coat rack his wallet was still in the inside pocket apparently untouched laura pulled open a couple of cardboard boxes filled with candy bars the guards now he could see theni properly were wearing dark camouflage uniforms but there were no official tags on them nothing to say who they were working for they might have been weekend duck hunters dressed for the shoot laura reached out her cold hand and squeezed shadows hand in hers she had the gold coin he had given her around her neck on a golden chain that looks nice he said thanks she smiled prettily what about the others he asked wednesday and the rest of them where are they laura passed him a handful of candy bars and he filled his pockets with them there wasnt anybody else here a lot of empty cells and one with you in it oh and one of the men had gone neil caiman into the cell down there to jack off with a magazine he got such a shock you killed him while he was jerking himself off she shrugged i guess she said uncomfortably i was worried they were hurting you someone has to watch out for you and i told you i would didnt i here take these they were chemical hand and foot warmers thin pads you broke the seal and they heated up and stayed that way for hours shadow pocketed them look out for me yes he said you did she reached out a finger stroked him above his left eyebrow youre hurt she said im okay he said he opened a metal door in the wall it swung open slowly there was a fourfoot drop to the ground and he swung himself down to what felt like gravel he picked up laura by the waist swung her down as he used to swing her easily without a second thought the moon came out from behind a thick cloud it was low on the horizon ready to set but the light it cast onto the snow was enough to see by they had emerged from what turned out to be the blackpainted metal car of a long freight train parked or abandoned in a woodland siding the series of wagon cars went on as far as he could see into the trees and away he had been on a train he should have known how the hell did you find me here he asked his dead wife she shook her head slowly amused you shine like a beacon in a dark world she told him it wasnt that hard now just go go as far and as fast as you can dont use your credit cards and you should be fine where should i go she pushed a hand through her matted hair flicking it back out of her eyes the roads that way she told him do whatever you can steal a car if you have to go south american gods laura he said and hesitated do you know whats going on do you know who these people are who you killed yeah she said i think i do know i owe you said shadow id still be in there if it wasnt for you i dont think they had anything good planned for me no she said i dont think they did they walked away from the empty train cars shadow wondered about the other trains hed seen blank windowless metal cars that went on for mile after mile hooting their lonely way through the night his fingers closed around the liberty dollar in his pocket and he remembered zorya polunochnaya and the way she had looked at him in the moonlight did you ask her what she wanted it is the wisest thing to ask the dead sometimes they will tell you laura what do you want he asked you really want to know yes please laura looked up at him with dead blue eyes i want to be alive again she said not in this halflife f want to be really alive i want to feel my heart pumpitigln my chest again i want to feel blood moving through mehot and salty and real its weird you dont think you can feel it the blood but believe me when it stops flowing youll know she rubbed her eyes smudging her face with red from the mess on her hands look its hard you know why dead people only go out at night puppy because its easier to pass for real in the dark and i dont want to have to pass i want to be alive i dont understand what you want me to do make it happen hon youll figure it out i know you will okay he said ill try and if i do figure it out how do i find you but she was gone and there was nothing left in the neil caiman woodland but a gentle gray in the sky to show him where east was and on the bitter december wind a lonely wail that might have been the cry of the last nightbird or the call of the first bird of dawn shadow set his face to the south and he began to walk chapter seven as the hindu gods are immortal only in a very particular sensefor they are born and they diethey experience most of the great human dilemmas and often seem to differ from mortals in a few trivial details and from demons even less yet they are regarded by the hindus as a class of beings by definition totally different from any other they are symbols in a way that no human being however archetypal his life story can ever be they are actors playing parts that are real only for us they are the masks behind which we see our own faces wendy doniger oflaherty introduction hindu myths shadow had been walking south or whathe hoped was more or less south for several hours heading along a narrow and unmarked road through the woods somewhere in he imagined southern wisconsin a couple of jeeps came down the road toward him at one point headlights blazing and he ducked into the trees until they had passed the early morning mist hung at waist level the cars were black when thirty minutes later he heard the noise of distant helicopters coming from the west he struck out away from the timber trail and into the woods there were two helicopters and he lay crouched in a hollow beneath a fallen neil caiman tree and listened to them pass over as they moved away he looked out and looked up for one hasty glance at the gray winter sky he was satisfied to observe that the helicopters were painted a matte black he waited beneath the tree until the noise of the helicopters was completely gone under the trees the snow was little more than a dusting which crunched underfoot he was deeply grateful for the chemical hand and feet warmers which kept his extremities from freezing beyond that he was numb heartnumb mindnumb soulnumb and the numbness he realized went a long way down and a long way back so what do i want he asked himself he couldnt answer so he just kept on walking a step at a time on and on through the woods trees looked familiar moments of landscape were perfectly dejavued could he be walking in circles maybe he would just walk and walk and walk until the warmers and the candy bars ran out and then sit down and never get up again he reached a large stream of the kind the locals called a creek and pronounced crick and decided to follow it streams led to rivers rivers all led to the mississippi and if he kept walking or stole a boat or built a raft eventually hed get to new orleans where it was warm an idea that seemed both comforting and unlikely there were no more helicopters he had the feeling that the ones that had passed overhead had been cleaning up the mess at the freight train siding not hunting for him otherwise they would have returned there would have been tracker dogs and sirens and the whole paraphernalia of pursuit instead there was nothing what did he want not to get caught not to get blamed for the deaths of the men on the train it wasnt me he heard himself saying it was my dead wife he could imagine the expressions on the faces of the law officers then people could argue about whether he was crazy or not while he went to the chair american gods he wondered whether wisconsin had the death penalty he wondered whether that would matter he wanted to understand what was going onand to find out how it was all going to end and finally producing a halfrueful grin he realized that most of all he wanted everything to be normal he wanted never to have gone to prison for laura still to be alive for none of this ever to have happened im afraid thats not exactly an option mboy he thought to himself in wednesdays gruff voice and he nodded agreement not an option you burned your bridges so keep walking do your own time a distant woodpecker drummed against a rotten tree shadow became aware of eyes on him a handful of red cardinals stared at him from a skeletal elder bush then returned to pecking at the clusters of black elderberries they looked like the illustrations in the songbirds of north america calendar he heard the birds videoarcade trills and zaps and whoops follow him along the side of the creek eventually they faded away the dead fawn lay in a glade in the shadojw of a hill and a black bird the size of a small dog was picking at its side with a large wicked beak rending and tearinggbbets of red meat from the corpse the animals eyes were gone but its head was untouched and white fawn spots were visible on its rump shadow wondered how it had diqil the black bird cocked its head onto one side and then said in a voice like stones being struck you shadow man im shadow said shadow the bird hopped up onto the fawns rump raised its head ruffled its crown and neck feathers it was enormous and its eyes were black beads there was something intimidating about a bird that size this close says he will see you in kayro tokked the raven shadow wondered which of odins ravens this was huginn or muninn memory or thought kayro he asked neil caiman in egypt how am i going to go to egypt follow mississippi go south find jackal look said shadow i dont want to seem like ir jesus look he paused regrouped he was cold standing in a wood talking to a big black bird who was currently branching on bambi okay what im trying to say is i dont want mysteries mysteries agreed the bird helpfully what i want is explanations jackal in kayro this does not help me its a line from a bad spy thriller jackal friend tok kayro so you said id like a little more information than that the bird half turned and pulled another strip of raw venison from the fawns ribs then it flew off into the trees the red strip dangling from its beak like a long bloody worm hey can you at least get me back to a real road called shadow the raven flew up and away shadow looked at the corpse of the baby deer he decided that if he were a real woodsman he would slice off a steak and grill it over a wood fire instead he sat on a fallen tree and ate a snickers bar and knew that he really wasnt a real woodsman the raven cawed from the edge of the clearing you want me to follow you asked shadow or has timmy fallen down another well the bird cawed again impatiently shadow started walking toward it it waited until he was close then flapped heavily into another tree heading somewhat to the left of the way shadow had originally been going hey said shadow huginn or muninn or whoever you are the bird turned head tipped suspiciously on one side and it stared at him with bright eyes say nevermore said shadow american gods fuck you said the raven it said nothing else as they went through the woodland together in half an hour they reached a blacktop road on the edge of a town and the raven flew back into the wood shadow observed a culvers frozen custard butterburgers sign and next to it a gas station he went into the culvers which was empty of customers there was a keen young man with a shaven head behind the cash register shadow ordered two butterburgers and french fries then he went into the rest room to clean up he looked a real mess he did an inventory of the contents of his pockets he had a few coins including the silver liberty dollar a disposable toothbrush and toothpaste three snickers bars five chemical heater pads a wallet and in the coats inside pocket a thousand dollars in fifties and twenties his take from yesterdays bank job he washed his face and hands in hot water slicked down his dark hair then went back into the restaurant and ate his burgers and fries and drank his coffee he went back to the counter you want frozencustard asked the keen young man no no thanks is there anywhere around here i could rent a car my car died back down the road a way the young man scratched his headstubblfj not around here mister if your car died you could call triplea or talk to the gas station next door about a tow a fine idea said shadow thanks he walked across the melting snow from the culvers parking lot to the gas station he bought candy bars and beef jerky sticks and more chemical hand and feet warmers anywhere hereabouts i could rent a car he asked the woman behind the cash register she was immensely plump and bespectacled and was delighted to have someone to talk to let me think she said were kind of out of the way neil caiman here they do that kind of thing over in madison where you going kayro he said wherever that is i know where that is she said hand me an illinois map from that rack over there shadow passed her a plasticcoated map she unfolded it then pointed in triumph to the bottommost corner of the state there it is cairo thats how they pronounce the one in egypt but the one in little egypt they call that one kayro they got a thebes down there all sorts my sisterinlaw comes from thebes i asked her about the one in egypt she looked at me as if i had a screw loose the woman chuckled like a drain any pyramids the city was five hundred miles away almost directly south not that they ever told me they call it little egypt because back oh mebbe a hundred hundred and fifty years back there was a famine all over crops failed but they didnt fail down there so everyone went there to buy food like in the bible joseph and the technicolor dreamcoat off we go to egypt badaboom so if you were me and you needed to get there how would you go asked shadow drive car died a few miles down the road it was a pieceashit if youll pardon my language said shadow peeohesses she said yup thats what my brotherinlaw calls em he buys and sells cars in a small way hell call me up say mattie i just sold another peeohess say maybe hed be interested in your old car for scrap or something it belongs to my boss said shadow surprising himself with the fluency and ease of his lies i need to call him so he can come pick it up a thought struck him your brotherinlaw is he around here american gods hes in muscoda ten minutes south of here just over the river why well does he have a peeohess hed like to sell me for mm five six hundred bucks she smiled sweetly mister he doesnt have a car on that back lot you couldnt buy with a full tank of gas for five hundred dollars but dont you tell him i said so would you call him asked shadow im way ahead of you she told him and she picked up the phone hon its mattie you get over here this minute i got a man here wants to buy a car the piece of shit he chose was a chevy nova which he bought with a full tank of gas for four hundred and fifty dollars it had almost a quarter of a million miles on the clock and smelled faintly of bourbon tobacco and more strongly of something that might well have been bananas he couldnt tell what color it was under the dirt and the snow still of all the vehicles in matties brotherinlaws back lot it was the only one that looked like it might take him five hundred miles the deal was done in cash and mattiestrbtherinlaw never asked for shadows name or social security number or for anything except the money shadow drove west then south with fijvehundred and fifty dollars in his pocket keeping off the interstate the piece of shit had a radio but nothing happened when he turned it on a sign said hed left wisconsin and was now in illinois he passed a stripmining works huge blue arc lights burning in the dim midwinter daylight he stopped and ate at a place called moms catching them just before they closed for the afternoon each town he passed through had an extra sign up beside the sign telling him that he was now entering our town the extra sign announced that the towns unders team was the third runnerup in the interstate basketball neil caiman tournament or that the town was the home of the illinois girls unders wrestling semifinalist he drove on head nodding feeling more drained with every minute that passed he ran a stoplight and was nearly sideswiped by a woman in a dodge as soon as he got out into open country he pulled off onto an empty tractor ptath on the side of the road and he parked by a snowspotted stubbly field in which a slow procession of fat black wild turkeys walked like a line of mourners he turned off the engine stretched out in the backseat and fell asleep darkness a sensation of fallingas if he were tumbling down a great hole like alice he fell for a hundred years into darkness faces passed him swimming out of the black then each face was ripped up and away before he could touch it abruptly and without transition he was not falling now he was in a cave and he was no longer alone shadow stared into familiar eyes huge liquid black eyes they blinked under the earth yes he remembered this place the stink of wet cow firelight flickered on the wet cave walls illuminating the buffalo head the mans body skin the color of brick clay cant you people leave me be asked shadow i just want to sleep the buffalo man nodded slowly his lips did not move but a voice in shadows head said where are you going shadow cairo why where else have i got to go its where wednesday wants me to go i drank his mead in shadows dream with the power of dream logic behind it the obligation seemed unarguable he drank wednesdays mead three times and sealed the pactwhat other choice of action did he have the buffaloheaded man reached a hand into the fire stir amesicangods ring the embers and the broken branches into a blaze the storm is coming he said now there was ash on his hands and he wiped it onto his hairless chest leaving sootblack streaks so you people keep telling me can i ask you a question there was a pause a fly settled on the furry forehead the buffalo man flicked it away ask is this true are these people really gods its all so he paused then he said impossible which was not exactly the word he had been going for but seemed to be the best he could do what are gods asked the buffalo man i dont know said shadow there was a tapping relentless and dull shadow waited for the buffalo man to say something more to explain what gods were to explain the whole tangled nightmare that his life seemed to have become he was cold tap tap tap shadow opened his eyes and groggily sat up he was freezing and the sky outside the car was the deep luminescent purple that divides the dusk from the night tap tap someone said hey mister aad shadow turned his head the someone was standing beside the car no more than a darker shape against the darkling sky shadow reached out a hand and cranked down the window a few inches he made some wakingup noises and then he said hi you all right you sick you been drinking the voice was higha womans or a boys im fine said shadow hold on he opened the door and got out stretching his aching limbs and neck as he did so then he rubbed his hands together to get the blood circulating and to warm them up whoa youre pretty big thats what they tell me said shadow who are you im sam said the voice neil caiman boy sam or girl sam girl sam i used to be sammi with an i and id do a smiley face over the i but then i got completely sick of it because like absolutely everybody was doing it so i stopped okay girl sam you go over there and look out at the road why are you

the next stall major shy bladder syndrome now please she walked to the far side of the car and shadow took a few steps closer to the field unzipped his jeans and pissed against a fence post for a very long time he walked back to the car the last of the gloaming had become night you still there he asked yes she said you must have a bladder like lake erie i think empires rose and fell in the time it took you to pee i could hear it the whole time thank you do you want something well i wanted to see if you were okay i mean if you were dead or something i would have called the cops but the windows

distress she said and you are a knight in whatever a really dirty car you know someone wrote wash me on your rear window shadow got into the car and opened the passenger door the light that goes on in cars when the front door is opened did not go on in this car no he said i didnt she climbed in it was me she said i wrote it while there was still enough light to see shadow started the car turned on the headlights and headed back onto the road left said sam helpfully shadow turned left and he drove after several minutes the heater started to work and blessed warnttlf filled the car you havent said anything yet said sam say something are you human asked shadoitf an honesttogoodness bornofmanandwoman living breathing human being sure she said okay just checking so what would you like me to say something to reassure me at this point i suddenly have that oh shit im in the wrong car with a crazy man feeling yeah he said ive had that one what would you find reassuring just tell me youre not an escaped convict or a mass murderer or something neil caiman he thought for a moment you know im really not you had to think about it though didnt you done my time never killed anybody oh they entered a small town lit up by streetlights and blinking christmas decorations and shadow glancedtto his right the girl had a tangle of short dark hair and a face that was both attractive and he decided faintly mannish her features might have been chiseled out of rock she was looking at him what were you in prison for i hurt a couple of people real bad i got angry did they deserve it shadow thought for a moment i thought so at the time would you do it again hell no i lost three years of my life in there mm you got indian blood in you not that i know of you looked like it was all sorry to disappoint you sokay you hungry shadow nodded i could eat he said theres a good place just past the next set of lights good food cheap too shadow pulled up in the parking lot they got out of the car he didnt bother to lock it although he pocketed the keys he pulled out some coins to buy a newspaper can you afford to eat here he asked yeah she said raising her chin i can pay for myself shadow nodded tell you what ill toss you for it he said heads you pay for my dinner tails i pay for yours let me see the coin first she said suspiciously i had an uncle had a doubleheaded quarter she inspected it satisfied herself there was nothing strange about the quarter shadow placed the coin head up on his thumb and cheated the toss so it wobbled and looked american gods like it was spinning then he caught it and flipped it over onto the back of his left hand and uncovered it with his right in front of her tails she said happily dinners on you yup he said you cant win them all shadow ordered the meat loaf sam ordered lasagna shadow flipped through the newspaper to see if there was anything in it about dead men in a freight train there wasnt the only story of interest was on the cover crows in record numbers were infesting the town local farmers wanted to hang dead crows around the town on public buildings to frighten the others away ornithologists said that it wouldnt work that the living crows would simply eat the dead ones the locals were implacable when they see the corpses of their friends said a spokesman theyll know that we dont want them here the food came mounded high on plates and steaming more than any one person could eat so whats in cairo asked sam with her mouth full no idea i got a message from my boss saying he needs me down there what do you do im an errand boy she smiled well she said you arentmafia not looking like that and driving that piece of shitjwhy does your car smell like bananas anyway he shrugged carried on eating sam narrowed her eyes maybe youre a banana smuggler she said you havent asked me what i do yet i figure youre at school uw madison where you are undoubtedly studying art history womens studies and probably casting your own bronzes and you probably work in a coffeehouse to help cover the rent she put down her fork nostrils flaring eyes wide how the fuck did you do that neil caiman what now you say no actually im studying romance languages and ornithology so youre saying that was a lucky guess or something what was she stared at him with dark eyes you are one peculiar guy mister i dont know your name they call me shadow he said she twisted her mouth wryly as if she were tasting something she disliked she stopped talking put her head down finished her lasagna do you know why its called egypt asked shadow when sam finished eating down cairo way yeah its in the delta of the ohio and the mississippi like cairo in egypt in the nile delta that makes sense she sat back in her chair ordered coffee and chocolate cream pie ran a hand through her black hair you married mister shadow and then as he hesitated gee i just asked another tricky question didnt i they buried her on thursday he said picking his words with care she was killed in a car crash oh god jesus im sorry me too an awkward pause my half sister lost her kid my nephew end of last year its rough yeah it is what did he die of she sipped her coffee we dont know we dont even really know that hes dead he just vanished but he was only thirteen it was the middle of last winter my sister was pretty broken up about it were there any any clues he sounded like a tv cop he tried again did they suspect foul play that sounded worse they suspected my noncustodial asshole brotherinlaw his father who was asshole enough to have stolen him away probably did but this is in a little town in the north american gods woods lovely sweet pretty little town where no one ever locks their doors she sighed shook her head she held her coffee cup in both hands are you sure you arent part indian not that i know its possible i dont know much about my father i guess my ma would have told me if he was native american though maybe again the mouth twist sam gave up halfway through her chocolate cream pie the slice was half the size of her head she pushed the plate across the table to shadow you want he smiled said sure and finished it off the waitress handed them the check and shadow paid thanks said sam it was getting colder now the car coughed a couple of times before it started shadow drove back onto the road and kept going south you ever read a guy named herodotus he asked jesus what herodotus you ever read his histories you know she said dreamily i dont get it i dont get how you talk or the words you use or anything one moment youre a big dumb guy the next youre reading my friggin mind and the next were talking vabout herodotus so no i have not read herodotus ive heard about him maybe on npr isnt he the one they cal the father of lies i thought that was the devil yeah him too but they were talking about herodotus saying there were giant ants and gryphons guarding gold mines and how he made this stuff up i dont think so he wrote what hed been told its like hes writing these histories and theyre mostly pretty good histories loads of weird little detailslike did you know in egypt if a particularly beautiful girl or the wife of a lord or whatever died they wouldnt send her to the embalmer for three days theyd let her body spoil in the heat first neil caiman why oh hold on okay i think i know why oh thats disgusting and therere battles in there all sorts of normal things and then there are the gods some guy is running back to report on the outcome of a battle and hes running and running and he sees pan in a glade and pan says teh them to build me a temple here so he says okay and runs the rest of the way back and he reports the battle news and then says oh and by the way pan wants you to build him a temple its really matteroffact you know so there are stories with gods in them what are you trying to say that these guys had hallucinations no said shadow thats not it she chewed a hangnail i read some book about brains she said my roommate had it and she kept waving it around it was like how five thousand years ago the lobes of the brain fused and before that people thought when the right lobe of the brain said anything it was the voice of some god telling them what to do its just brains i like my theory better said shadow whats your theory that back then people used to run into the gods from time to time oh silence only the rattling of the car the roar of the engine the growling of the mufflerwhich did not sound healthy then do you think theyre still there where greece egypt the islands those places do you think if you walked where those people walked youd see the gods maybe but i dont think peopled know that was what theyd seen i bet its like space aliens she said these days people see space aliens back then they saw gods maybe the space aliens come from the right side of the brain i dont think the gods ever gave rectal probes said american gods shadow and they didnt mutilate cattle themselves they got people to do it for them she chuckled they drove in silence for a few minutes and then she said hey that reminds me of my favorite god story from comparative religion oneohone you want to hear it sure said shadow okay this is one about odin the norse god you know there was some viking king on a viking shipthis was back in the viking times obviouslyand they were becalmed so he says hell sacrifice one of his men to odin if odin will send them a wind and get them to land okay the wind comes up and they get to land so on land they draw lots to figure out who gets sacrificedand its the king himself well hes not happy about this but they figure out that they can hang him in effigy and not hurt him they take a calfs intestines and loop them loosely around the guys neck and they tie the other end to a thin branch and they take a reed instead of a spear and poke him with it and go okay youve been hunghangedwhatever youve been sacrificed to odin the road curved another town ttime of the runnerup to the state unders speedskating championship two huge gianteconomysized funeral parlors on each side of the road and how many funeral jjarlors do you need shadow wondered when you only have three hundred people okay as soon as they say odins name the reed transforms into a spear and stabs the guy in the side the calf intestines become a thick rope the branch becomes the bough of a tree and the tree pulls up and the ground drops away and the king is left hanging there to die with a wound in his side and his face going black end of story white people have some fuckedup gods mister shadow yes said shadow youre not white im cherokee she said neil caiman fullblooded nope only four pints my mom was white my dad was a real reservation indian he came out this way eventually married my mom had me then when they split he went back to oklahoma he went back to the reservation no he borrowed money and opened a taco bell knockoff called taco bills he does okay he doesnt like me says im halfbreed im sorry hes a jerk im proud of my indian blood it helps pay my college tuition hell one day itll probably help get me a job if i cant sell my bronzes theres always that said shadow he stopped in el paso illinois to let sam out at a downatheel house on the edge of the town a large wireframed model of a reindeer covered in twinkling lights stood in the front yard you want to come in she asked my aunt would give you a coffee no he said ive got to keep moving she smiled at him looking suddenly and for the first time vulnerable she patted him on the arm youre fucked up mister but youre cool i believe thats what they call the human condition said shadow thanks for the company no problem she said if you see any gods on the road to cairo you make sure and say hi to them from me she got out of the car and went to the door of the house she pressed a doorbell and stood there at the door without looking back shadow waited until the door was opened and she was safely inside before he put his foot down and headed back for the highway he passed through normal and bloomington and lawndale at eleven that night shadow started shaking he was just entering middletown he decided he needed sleep or just not to drive any longer and he pulled up in front of a american gods nights inn paid thirtyfive dollars cash in advance for his groundfloor room and went into the bathroom a sad cockroach lay on its back in the middle of the tiled floor shadow took a towel and cleaned off the inside of the tub then ran the water in the main room he took off his clothes and put them on the bed the bruises on his torso were dark and vivid he sat in the tub watching the color of the bathwater change then naked he washed his socks and briefs and tshirt in the basin wrung them out and hung them on the clothesline that pulled out from the wall above the bathtub he left the cockroach where it was out of respect for the dead shadow climbed into the bed he wondered about v itching an adult movie but the payperview device by the phone needed a credit card and it was too risky then again he was not convinced that it would make him feel any better to watch other people have sex that he wasnt having he turned on the tv for company pressed the sleep button on the remote three times which would make the tv set turn itself off automatically in fortyfiveminutes it was a quarter to midnight the picture was motelfuzzy and the colors swam across the screen he flipped from late show to late show in the televisual wasteland unable to focus someone was demonstrating something that did something jjn the kitchen and replaced a dozen other kitchen utensils none of which shadow possessed flip a man in a suit explained that these were the end times and that jesusa four or fivesyllable word the way the man pronounced itwould make shadows business prosper and thrive if shadow sent him money flip an episode of m a s h ended and a dick van dyke show began shadow hadnt seen an episode of the dick van dyke show for years but there was something comforting about the blackandwhite world it painted and he put the channel changer down beside the bed and turned off the neil caiman bedside light he watched the show eyes slowly closing aware that something was odd he had not seen many episodes of the dick van dyke show so he was not surprised that it was an episode he could not remember seeing before what he found strange was the tone all the regulars were concerned about robs drinking he was missing days at work they went to his home he had locked himself in the bedroom and had to be persuaded to come out he was staggering drunk but still pretty funny his friends played by morey amsterdam and rose marie left after getting some good gags in then when robs wife went to remonstrate with him he hit her hard in the face she sat down on the floor and began to cry not in that famous mary tyler moore wail but in small helpless sobs hugging herself and whispering dont hit me please ill do anything just dont hit me anymore what the fuck is this said shadow aloud the picture dissolved into phosphordot fuzz when it came back the dick van dyke show had inexplicably become love lucy lucy was trying to persuade ricky to let her replace their old icebox with a new refrigerator when he left however she walked over to the couch and sat down crossing her ankles resting her hands in her lap and staring out patiently in black and white across the years shadow she said we need to talk shadow said nothing she opened her purse and took out a cigarette lit it with an expensive silver lighter put the lighter away im talking to you she said well this is crazy said shadow like the rest of your life is sane give me a fucking break whatever lucille ball talking to me from the tv is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything thats happened to me so far said shadow its not lucille ball its lucy ricardo and you know american gods somethingim not even her its just an easy way to look given the context thats all she shifted uncomfortably on the sofa who are you asked shadow okay she said good question im the idiot box im the tv im the allseeing eye and the world of the cathode ray im the boob tube im the little shrine the family gathers to adore youre the television or someone in the television the tvs the altar im what people are sacrificing to what do they sacrifice asked shadow their time mostly said lucy sometimes each other she raised two fingers blew imaginary gunsmoke from the tips then she winked a big old love lucy wink youre a god said shadow lucy smirked and took a ladylike puff of her cigarette you could say that she said sam says hi said shadow what whos sam what are you talking about shadow looked at his watch it was twentyfive past twelve doesnt matter he said so lucyonthetv what do we need to talk about too manypeople have needed to talk recently normally it ends with someone hitting me f the camera moved in for a closeup lucji looked concerned her lips pursed i hate that i hate that people were hurting you shadow id never do that honey no i want to offer you a job doing what working for me i heard about the trouble you had with the spookshow and i was impressed with how you dealt with it efficient nononsense effective whodve thought you had it in you they are really pissed really they underestimated you sweetheart not a mistake neil caiman im going to make i want you in my camp she stood up walked toward the camera look at it like this shadow we are the coming thing were shopping mallsyour friends are crappy roadside attractions hell were online malls while your friends are sitting by the side of the highway selling homegrown produce from a cart nqthey arent even fruit sellers buggywhip vendors whalebonecorset repairers we are now and tomorrow your friends arent even yesterday anymore it was a strangely familiar speech shadow asked did you ever meet a fat kid in a limo she spread her hands and rolled her eyes comically funny lucy ricardo washing her hands of a disaster the technical boy you met the technical boy look hes a good kid hes one of us hes just not good with people he doesnt know when youre working for us youll see how amazing he is and if i dont want to work for you ilovelucy there was a knock on the door of lucys apartment and rickys voice could be heard offstage asking loocy what was keepin her so long they was due down at the club in the next scene a flash of irritation touched lucys cartoonish face hell she said look whatever the old guys are paying you i can pay you double treble a hundred times whatever theyre giving you i can give you so much more she smiled a perfect roguish lucy ricardo smile you name it honey what do you need she began to undo the buttons of her blouse hey she said you ever wanted to see lucys tits the screen went black the sleep function had kicked in and the set turned itself off shadow looked at his watch it was half past midnight not really said shadow he rolled over in bed and closed his eyes it occurred to him that the reason he liked wednesday and mr nancy and the rest of them better than then opposition was pretty straightforward they might be dirty and cheap and their americangods food might taste like shit but at least they didnt speak in cliches and he guessed he would take a roadside attraction no matter how cheap how crooked or how sad over a shopping mall any day morning found shadow back on the road driving through a gently undulating brown landscape of winter grass and leafless trees the last of the snow had vanished he filled up the tank of the piece of shit in a town that was home to the runnerup of the state womens under s threehundredmeter dash and hoping that the dirt wasnt all that was holding it together he ran the car through the gas station car wash he was surprised to discover that the car was when clean against all reasonwhite and pretty much free of rust he drove on the sky was impossibly blue and white industrial smoke rising from factory chimneys was frozen in the sky like a photograph a hawk launched itself from a dead tree and flew toward him wings strobing in the sunlight like a series of stopmotion photographs at some point he found himself heading into east st louis he attempted to avoid it and instead found himself driving through what appeared to be a redljght district in an industrial park eighteenwheelers and bjuge rigs were parked outside buildings that looked like temporary warehouses that claimed to be hour nite clubs and in one case the best peap show in town shadow shook his head and drove on laura had loved to dance clothed or naked and he had loved to watch her lunch was a sandwich and a can of coke in a town called red bud he passed a valley filled with the wreckage of thousands of yellow bulldozers tractors and caterpillars he won neil caiman dered if this was the bulldozers graveyard where the bulldozers went to die he drove past the popatop lounge he drove through chester he noticed that the houses had started to gain pillars out front that even the shabbiest thinnest house now had its white pillars proclaiming it in someones eyes a mansion he drove over a big muddy river and laughed out loud when he saw that the name of it according to the sign was the big muddy river he saw a covering of brown kudzu over three winterdead trees twisting them into strange almost human shapes they could have been witches three bent old crones ready to reveal his fortune he drove alongside the mississippi shadow had never seen the nile but there was a blinding afternoon sun burning on the wide brown river that made him think of the muddy expanse of the nile not the nile as it is now but as it was long ago flowing like an artery through the papyrus marshes home to cobra and jackal and wild cow a road sign pointed to thebes the road was built up about twelve feet so he was driving above the marshes clumps and clusters of birds in flight were questing back and forth black dots against the blue sky moving in some desperate brownian motion in the late afternoon the sun began to lower gilding the world in elflight a thick warm custardy light that made the world feel unearthly and more than real and it was in this light that shadow passed the sign telling him he was now entering historical cairo he drove under a bridge and found himself in a small port town the imposing structures of the cairo courthouse and the even more imposing customs house looked like enormous freshly baked cookies in the syrupy gold of the light at the end of the day he parked his car in a side street and walked to the em americangods bankment at the edge of a river unsure whether he was gazing at the ohio or the mississippi a small brown cat nosed and sprang among the trash cans at the back of a building and the light made even the garbage magical a lone seagull was gliding along the rivers edge flipping a wing to correct itself as it went shadow realized that he was not alone a small girl wearing old tennis shoes on her feet and a mans gray woolen sweater as a dress was standing on the sidewalk ten feet away from him staring at him with the somber gravity of a sixyearold her hair was black and straight and long her skin was as brown as the river he grinned at her she stared back at him defiantly there was a squeal and a yowl from the waterfront and the little brown cat shot away from a spilled garbage can pursued by a longmuzzled black dog the cat scurried under a car hey said shadow to the girl you ever seen invisible powder before she hesitated then she shook her head okay said shadow well watch this shadow pulled out a quarter with his left hand held it up tiitingttfrom one side to another then appeared to toss it into his right hand closing his hand hard on nothing and puttingthe hand forward now he said i just take some inv ible powder from my pocket and he reached his left nand into his breast pocket dropping the quarter into the pocket as he did so and i sprinkle it on the hand with the coin and he mimed sprinkling and looknow the quarters invisible too he opened his empty right hand and in astonishment his empty left hand as well the little girl just stared shadow shrugged and put his hands back in his pockets loading a quarter in one hand a folded up fivedollar bill in the other he was going to produce them from the air and jt neil caiman then give the girl the five bucks she looked like she needed it hey he said weve got an audience the black dog and the little brown cat were watching him as well flanking the girl looking up at him intently the dogs huge ears were pricked up giving it a comically alert expression a cranelike man with goldrimmed spectacles was coming up the sidewalk toward them peering from side to side as if he were looking for something shadow wondered if he was the dogs owner what did you think shadow asked the dog trying to put the little girl at her ease was that cool the black dog licked its long snout then it said in a deep dry voice i saw harry houdini once and believe me man you are no harry houdini the little girl looked at the animals she looked up at shadow and then she ran off her feet pounding the sidewalk as if all the powers of hell were after her the two animals watched her go the cranelike man had reached the dog he reached down and scratched its high pointed ears come on said the man in the goldrimmed spectacles to the dog it was only a coin trick its not like he was doing an underwater escape not yet said the dog but he will the golden light was done and the gray of twilight had begun shadow dropped the coin and the folded bill back into his pocket okay he said which one of you is jackal use your eyes said the black dog with the long snout it began to amble along the sidewalk beside the man in the gold glasses and after a moments hesitation shadow followed them the cat was nowhere to be seen they reached a large old building on a row of boardedup houses the sign beside the door said ibis and jacquel a family firm funeral parlor since im mr ibis said the man in the goldrimmed glasses i think i should buy you a spot of supper im afraid my friend here has some work that needs doing american gods somewhere in america new york scares salim and so he clutches his sample case protectively with both hands holding it to his chest he is scared of black people the way they stare at him and he is scared of the jewsthe ones dressed all in black with hats and beards and side curls he can identify and how many others that he cannothe is scared of the sheer quantity of the people all shapes and sizes of people as they spill from their high high filthy buildings onto the sidewalks he is scared of the honking hullabaloo of the traffic and he is even scared of the air which smells both dirty and sweet and nothing at all like the air of oman salim has been in new york in america for a week each day he visits two perhaps three different offices opens his sample case shows them the copper trinkets the rings and bottles and tiny flashlights the models of the empire state building the statue of liberty the eiffel tower gleaming in copper inside each night he writes a fax to his brotherinlaw fuad at home in muscat telling him that he has taken no orders or on one happy day that he had taken several orders for reasons salim does not understand his brotherinlaws business partners have booked ttim into the paramount hotel on th street he finds it confusing claustrophobic expensive alien fuad is salims sisters husband he is not a rich man but he is the coowner of a small trinket factory everything is made for export to other arab countries to europe to america salim has been working for fuad for six months fuad scares him a little the tone of fuads faxes is becoming harsher in the evening salim sits in his hotel room reading his quran telling himself that this will pass that his stay in this strange world is limited and finite his brotherinlaw gave him a thousand dollars for mis neil caiman cellaneous traveling expenses and the money which seemed so huge a sum when first he saw it is evaporating faster than salim can believe when he first arrived scared of being seen as a cheap arab he tipped everyone handing extra dollar bills to everyone he encountered and then he decided that he was being taken advantage of that perhaps the were even laughing at him and he stopped tipping entirely on his first and only journey by subway he got lost and confused and missed his appointment now he takes taxis only when he has to and the rest of the time he walks he stumbles into overheated offices his cheeks numb from the cold outside sweating beneath his coat shoes soaked by slush and when the winds blow down the avenues he feels a cold on his exposed skin that is so intense it is like being struck he never eats at the hotel instead he buys food at falafel houses and at little food stores smuggles it up to the hotel beneath his coat for days before he realizes that no one cares and even then he feels strange about carrying the bags of food into the dimly lit elevators and up to the tiny white room in which he stays salim is upset the fax that was waiting for him when he woke this morning was curt and alternately chiding stem and disappointed salim was letting them downhis sister fuad fuads business partners the sultanate of oman the whole arab world unless he was able to get the orders fuad would no longer consider it his obligation to employ salim they depended upon him his hotel was too expensive what was salim doing with their money living like a sultan in america salim read the fax in his room and sat there for a time american gods his face frozen into an expression of complete misery then salim walks downtown holding his sample case as if it contained diamonds and rubies trudging through the cold for block after block until on broadway and th street he finds a squat building over a deli he walks up the stairs to the fourth floor to the office of panglobal imports the office is dingy but he knows that panglobal handles almost half of the ornamental souvenirs that enter the us from the far east a real order a significant order from panglobal could redeem salims journey could make the difference between failure and success so salim sits on an uncomfortable wooden chair in an outer office his sample case balanced on his lap staring at the middleaged woman with her hair dyed too bright a red who sits behind the desk blowing her nose on kleenex after kleenex after she blows her nose she wipes it and drops the kleenex into the trash salim got there at am hah an hour before his appointment now he sits there flushed and shivering wondering if he is running a fever the time ticks by so slowly salim looks at his watch then he clears his throat the woman behind the desk glares at himr yes she says it sounds like yed it is eleventhirtyfive says salim the woman glances at the clock on the wall and says yed again id id my appointment was for eleven says salim with a placating smile mister blanding knows youre here she tells him reprovingly salim picks up an old copy of the new york post from the table he speaks english better than he reads it and he puzzles his way through the stories like a man doing a crossword puzzle he waits a plump young man with the eyes of a hurt puppy glancing from his watch to his newspaper to the clock on the wall neil caiman at twelvethirty several men come out from the inner office they talk loudly jabbering away to each other in american one of them a big paunchy man has a cigar unlit in his mouth he glances at salim as he comes out he tells the woman behind the desk to try the juice of a lemon and zinc as his sister swears by zinc and vitamin c she promises him that she will and gives him several envelopes he pockets them and then he and the other men go out into the hall the sound of their laughter disappears down the stairwell it is one oclock the woman behind the desk opens a drawer and takes out a brown paper bag from which she removes several sandwiches an apple and a milky way she also takes out a small plastic bottle of freshly squeezed orange juice excuse me says salim but can you perhaps call mister blanding and tell him that i am still waiting she looks up at him as if surprised to see that he is still there as if they have not been sitting five feet apart for two and a half hours hes at lunch she says he d ad dudge salim knows knows deep down in his gut that blanding was the man with the unlit cigar when will he be back she shrugs takes a bite of her sandwich hes busy with appointments for the rest of the day she says hed biddy wid abboidmeds for the red ob the day will he see me then when he comes back asks salim she shrugs and blows her nose salim is hungry increasingly so and frustrated and powerless at three oclock the woman looks at him and says he wode be gubbig bag excuse bidder bladdig he wode be gubbig bag today can i make an appointment for tomorrow american gods she wipes her nose you hab to teddephode appoidbeds odly by teddephode i see says salim and then he smiles a salesman fuad had told him many times before he left muscat is naked in america without his smile tomorrow i will telephone he says he takes his sample case and he walks down the many stairs to the street where the freezing rain is turning to sleet salim contemplates the long cold walk back to the th street hotel and the weight of the sample case then he steps to the edge of the sidewalk and waves at every yellow cab that approaches whether the light on top is on or off and every cab drives past him one of them accelerates as it passes a wheel dives into a waterfilled pothole spraying freezing muddy water over salims pants and coat for a moment he contemplates throwing himself in front of one of the lumbering cars and then he realizes that his brotherinlaw would be more concerned with the fate of the sample case than of salim himself and that he would bring grief to no one but his beloved sister fuads wife also he doubts that any of the cars are going fast enough actually to end his life a battered yellow taxi draws up beside hinijand grateful to be able to abandon his train of thought salim gets in the backseat is patched with gray duct tape the halfopen plexiglas barrier is covered with notices warning him not to smoke telling him how much to pay to get to the various airports the recorded voice of somebody famous he has never heard of tells him to remember to wear his seat belt the paramount hotel please says salim the cabdriver grunts and pulls away from the curb into the traffic he is unshaven and he wears a thick dustcolored sweater and black plastic sunglasses the weather is gray neil caiman and night is falling salim wonders if the man has a problem with his eyes the wipers smear the street scene into grays and smudged lights from nowhere a truck pulls out in front of them and the cabdriver swears by the beard of the prophet salim stares at the name on the dashboard but hetcannot make it out from here how long have you been driving a cab my friend he asks the man in his own language ten years says the driver in the same tongue where are you from muscat says salim in oman from oman i have been in oman it was a long time ago have you heard of the city of ubar asks the taxi driver indeed i have says salim the lost city of towers they found it in the desert five ten years ago i do not remember exactly were you with the expedition that excavated it something like that it was a good city says the taxi driver on most nights there would be three maybe four thousand people camped there every traveler would rest at ubar and the music would play and the wine would flow like water and the water would flow as well which was why the city existed that is what i have heard says salim and it perished what a thousand years ago two thousand the taxi driver says nothing they are stopped at a red traffic light the light turns green but the driver does not move despite the immediate discordant blare of horns behind them hesitantly salim reaches through the hole in the plexiglas and he touches the driver on the shoulder the mans head jerks up with a start and he puts his foot down on the gas lurching them across the intersection fuckshitfuckfuck he says in english you must be very tired my friend says salim i have been driving this allahforgotten taxi for thirty hours says the driver it is too much before that i sleep american gods for five hours and i drove fourteen hours before that we are shorthanded before christmas i hope you have made a lot of money says salim the driver sighs not much this morning i drove a man from fiftyfirst street to newark airport when we got there he ran off into the airport and i could not find him again a fiftydollar fare gone and i had to pay the tolls on the way back myself salim nods i had to spend today waiting to see a man who will not see me my brotherinlaw hates me i have been in america for a week and it has done nothing but eat my money i sell nothing what do you sell shit says sajim worthless gewgaws and baubles and tourist trinkets horrible cheap foolish ugly shit the taxi driver wrenches the wheel to the right swings around something drives on salim wonders how he can see to drive between the rain the night and the thick sunglasses you try to sell shit yes says salim thrilled and horrified that he has spoken the truth about his brotherinlaws samples and they will not buy it no strange you look at the stores here that is all they sell salim smiles nervously jj a truck is blocking the street in front of them a redfaced cop standing in front of it waves and shouts and points them down the nearest street we will go over to eighth avenue come uptown that way says the taxi driver they turn onto the street where the traffic has stopped completelythere is a cacophony of horns but the cars do not move the driver sways in his seat his chin begins to descend to his chest one two three times then he begins gently to snore salim reaches out to wake the man hoping that he is doing the right thing as he shakes his shoulder the driv neil caiman er moves and salims hand brashes the mans face knocking the sunglasses from his face into his lap the taxi driver opens his eyes reaches for and replaces the black plastic sunglasses but it is too late salim has seen his eyes the car crawls forward in the rain the numbers onithe meter increase are you going to kill me asks salim the taxi drivers lips are pressed together salim watches his face in the drivers mirror no says the driver very quietly the car stops again the rain patters on the roof salim begins to speak my grandmother swore that she had seen an ifrit or perhaps a marid late one evening on the edge of the desert we told her that it was just a sandstorm a little wind but she said no she saw its face and its eyes like yours were burning flames the driver smiles but his eyes are hidden behind the black plastic glasses and salim cannot tell whether there is any humor in that smile or not the grandmothers came here too he says are there many jinn in new york asks salim no not many of us there are the angels and there are men who allah made from mud and then there are the people of the fire the jinn says salim people know nothing about my people here says the driver they think we grant wishes if i could grant wishes do you think i would be driving a cab i do not understand the taxi driver seems gloomy salim stares at his face in the mirror as he speaks watching the ifrits dark lips they believe that we grant wishes why do they believe that i sleep in one stinking room in brooklyn i drive this taxi for any stinking freak who has the money to ride in it and for some who dont i drive them where they need to american gods go and sometimes they tip me sometimes they pay me his lower lip began to tremble the ifrit seemed on edge one of them shat on the backseat once i had to clean it before i could take the cab back how could he do that i had to clean the wet shit from the seat is that right salim puts out a hand pats the ifrits shoulder he can feel solid flesh through the wool of the sweater the ifrit raises his hand from the wheel rests it on salims hand for a moment salim thinks of the desert then red sands blow a dust storm through his thoughts and the scarlet silks of the tents that surrounded the lost city of ubar flap and billow through his mind they drive up eighth avenue the old believe they do not piss into holes because the prophet told them that jinn live in holes they know that the angels throw flaming stars at us when we try to listen to their conversations but even for the old when they come to this country we are very very far away back there i did not have to drive a cab i am sorry says salim it is a bad time says the driver a stomris coming it scares me i would do anything to get away the two of them say nothing more on their way back to the hotel j when salim gets out of the cab he gives the ifrit a twentydollar bill tells him to keep the change then with a sudden burst of courage he tells him his room number the taxi driver says nothing in reply a young woman clambers into the back of the cab and it pulls out into the cold and the rain six oclock in the evening salim has not yet written the fax to his brotherinlaw he goes out into the rain buys himself this nights kabob and french fries it has only been a week but he feels that he is becoming heavier rounder softening in this country of new york neil caiman when he comes back to the hotel he is surprised to see the taxi driver standing in the lobby hands deep in his pockets he is staring at a display of blackandwhite postcards when he sees salim he smiles selfconsciously i called your room he says but there was no answer so i thought i would wait salim smiles also and touches the mans arm i am here he says together they enter the dim greenlit elevator ascend to the fifth floor holding hands the ifrit asks if he may use salims bathroom i feel very dirty he says salim nods he sits on the bed which fills most of the small white room and listens to the sound of the shower running salim takes off his shoes his socks and then the rest of his clothes the taxi driver comes out of the shower wet with a towel wrapped about his midsection he is not wearing his sunglasses and in the dim room his eyes burn with scarlet flames salim blinks back tears i wish you could see what i see he says i do not grant wishes whispers the ifrit dropping his towel and pushing salim gently but irresistibly down onto the bed it is an hour or more before the ifrit comes thrusting and grinding into salims mouth salim has already come twice in this time the jinns semen tastes strange fiery and it burns salims throat salmi goes to the bathroom washes out his mouth when he returns to the bedroom the taxi driver is already asleep in the white bed snoring peacefully salim climbs into the bed beside him cuddles close to the ifrit imagining the desert on his skin as he starts to fall asleep he realizes that he still has not written his fax to fuad and he feels guilty deep inside he feels empty and alone he reaches out rests his hand on the ifrits tumescent cock and comforted he sleeps american gods they wake in the small hours moving against each other and they make love again at one point salim realizes that he is crying and the ifrit is kissing away his tears with burning lips what is your name salim asks the taxi driver there is a name on my driving permit but it is not mine the ifrit says afterward salim could not remember where the sex had stopped and the dreams began when salim wakes the cold sun creeping into the white room he is alone also he discovers his sample case is gone all the bottles and rings and souvenir copper flashlights all gone along widi his suitcase his wallet his passport and his air tickets back to oman he finds a pair of jeans the tshirt and the dustcolored woolen sweater discarded on the floor beneath them he finds a drivers license in the name of ibrahim bin irem a taxi permit in the same name and a ring of keys with an address written on a piece of paper attached to them in english the photographs on the license and the permit do not look much like salim but then they did notok much like the ifrit the telephone rings it is the front desk calling to point out that salim has already checked outand his guest needs to leave soon so that they can service ttie room to get it ready for another occupant i do not grant wishes says salim tasting die way the words shape themselves in his mouth he feels strangely lightheaded as he dresses new york is very simple the avenues run north to south the streets run west to east how hard can it be he asks himself he tosses the car keys into die air and catches them then he puts on the black plastic sunglasses he found in the pockets and leaves the hotel room to go and look for his cab chapter eight he said the dead had souls but when i asked him how that could bei thought the dead were souls he broke my trance dont that make you suspicious that theres something the dead are keeping back yes theres something the dead are keeping back robert frost two witches the week before christmas is often a quiet one in a funeral parlor shadow learned over supper they were sitting in a small restaurant two blocks from ibis and jacquels funeral parlor shadows meal consisted of an allday full breakfastit came with hush puppieswhile mr ibis picked and pecked at a slice of coffee cake mr ibis explained it to him the lingering ones are holding on for one final christmas said mr ibis or even for new years while the others the ones for whom other peoples jollity and celebration will prove too painful have not yet been tipped over the edge by that last showing of its a wonderful life have not quite encountered the final straw or should i say the final sprig of holly that breaks not the camels but the reindeers back and he made a little noise as he said it half smirk half snort which suggested that he had just uttered a wellhoned phrase of which he was particularly fond ibis and jacquel was a small familyowned funeral american gods home one of the last truly independent funeral homes in the area or so mr ibis maintained most fields of human merchandising value nationwide brand identities he said mr ibis spoke in explanations a gentle earnest lecturing that put shadow in mind of a college professor who used to work out at the muscle farm and who could not talk could only discourse expound explain shadow had figured out within the first few minutes of meeting mr ibis that his expected part in any conversation with the funeral director was to say as little as possible this i believe is because people like to know what they are getting ahead of time thus mcdonalds walmart f w woolworth store brands maintained and visible across the entire country wherever you go you will get something that is with small regional variations the same in the field of funeral homes however things are perforce different you need to feel that you are getting smalltown personal service from someone who has a calling to the profession you want personal attention to you and your loved one in a time of great loss you wish to know that your grief is happening on a local level not bn a national one but in all branches of industryand death is an industry my young friend make no mistake about thatone makes ones money from operating in bulk from buying in quantity from centralizing ones operations its not pretty but its true trouble is no one wants to know that their loved ones are traveling in a coolervan to some big old converted warehouse where they may have twenty fifty a hundred cadavers on the go no sir folks want to think theyre going to a family concern somewhere theyll be treated with respect by someone wholl tip his hat to them if he sees them in the street mr ibis wore a hat it was a sober brown hat that matched his sober brown blazer and his sober brown face small goldrimmed glasses perched on his nose in shadows neil caiman memory mr ibis was a short man whenever he would stand beside him shadow would rediscover that mr ibis was well over six feet in height with a cranelike stoop sitting opposite him now across the shiny red table shadow found himself staring into the mans face so when the big companies come in they buy the nme of the company they pay the funeral directors to stay on they create the apparency of diversity but that is merely the tip of the gravestone in reality they are as local as burger king now for our own reasons we are truly an independent we do all our own embalming and its the finest embalming in the country although nobody knows it but us we dont do cremations though we could make more money if we had our own crematorium but it goes against what were good at what my business partner says is if the lord gives you a talent or a skill you have an obligation to use it as best you can dont you agree sounds good to me said shadow the lord gave my business partner dominion over the dead just as he gave me skill with words fine things words i write books of tales you know nothing literary just for my own amusement accounts of lives he paused by the time shadow realized that he should have asked if he might be allowed to read one the moment had passed anyway what we give them here is continuity theres been an ibis and jacquel in business here for almost two hundred years we werent always funeral directors though we used to be morticians and before that undertakers and before that well said mr ibis smiling just a little smugly we go back a very long way of course it wasnt until after the war between the states that we found our niche here that was when we became the funeral parlor for the colored folks hereabouts before that no one thought of us as coloredforeign maybe exotic and dark but not colored american gods once the war was done pretty soon no one could remember a time when we werent perceived as black my business partner hes always had darker skin than mine it was an easy transition mostly you are what they think you are its just strange when they talk about africanamericans makes me think of the people from punt ophir nubia we never thought of ourselves as africanswe were the people of the nile so you were egyptians said shadow mr ibis pushed his lower lip upward then let his head bob from side to side as if it were on a spring weighing the pluses and minuses seeing things from both points of view well yes and no egyptians makes me think of the folk who live there now the ones who built their cities over our graveyards and palaces do they look like me shadow shrugged hed seen black guys who looked like mr ibis hed seen white guys with tans who looked like mr ibis hows your coffee cake asked the waitress refilling their coffees best i ever had said mr ibis you give my best to your ma ill do that she said and bustled away you dont want to ask after the health of anyone if youre a funeral director they think maybe jioure scouting for business said mr ibis in an undertone shall we see if your room is ready their breath steamed in the night air christmas lights twinkled in the windows of the stores they passed its good of you putting me up said shadow i appreciate it we owe your employer a number of favors and lord knows we have the room its a big old house there used to be more of us you know now its just the three of us you wont be in the way any idea how long im meant to stay with you neil caiman mr ibis shook his head he didnt say but we are happy to have you here and we can find you work if you are not squeamish if you treat the dead with respect so asked shadow what are you people doing here in cairo was it just the name or something no not at all actually this region takes its nameg from us although people barely know it it was a trading post back in the old days frontier times you might call it that said mr ibis evening miz simmons and a merry christmas to you too the folk who brought me here came up the mississippi a long time back shadow stopped in the street and stared are you trying to tell me that ancient egyptians came here to trade five thousand years ago mr ibis said nothing but he smirked loudly then he said three thousand five hundred and thirty years ago give or take okay said shadow ill buy it i guess what were they trading not much said mr ibis animal skins some food copper from the mines in what would now be michigans upper peninsula the whole thing was rather a disappointment not worth the effort they stayed here long enough to believe in us to sacrifice to us and for a handful of the traders to die of fever and be buried here leaving us behind them he stopped dead in the middle of the sidewalk turned around slowly arms extended this country has been grand central for ten thousand years or more you say to me what about columbus sure said shadow obligingly what about him columbus did what people had been doing for thousands of years theres nothing special about coming to america ive been writing stories about it from time to time they began to walk again true stories american gods up to a point yes ill let you read one or two if you like its all there for anyone who has eyes to see it personally and this is speaking as a subscriber to scientific american herei feel very sorry for the professionals whenever they find another confusing skull something that belonged to the wrong sort of people or whenever they find statues or artifacts that confuse themfor theyll talk about the odd but they wont talk about the impossible which is where i feel sorry for them for as soon as something becomes impossible it slipslides out of belief entirely whether its true or not i mean heres a skull that shows the ainu the japanese aboriginal race were in america nine thousand years ago heres another that shows there were polynesians in california nearly two thousand years later and all the scientists mutter and puzzle over whos descended from whom missing the point entirely heaven knows what happen if they ever actually find the hopi emergence tunnels thatll shake a few things up you just wait did the irish come to america in the dark ages you ask me of course they did and the welsh and the vikings while the africans from the west coastwhat in later days they called the slave coast or the ivory coaststhey were trading with south america and the chinese visited oregon a couple of timesthey called it fu sang the basque established their secret sacred fishing grounds off the coast of newfoundland twelve hundred years back now i suppose youre going to say but mister ibis these people were primitives they didnt have radio controls and vitamin pills and jet airplanes shadow hadnt said anything and hadnt planned to say anything but he felt it was required of him so he said well werent they the last dead leaves of fall crackled underfoot wintercrisp the misconception is that men didnt travel long distances in boats before the days of columbus yet new zealand and tahiti and countless pacific islands were set neil caiman tied by people in boats whose navigation skills would have put columbus to shame and the wealth of africa was from trading although that was mostly to the east to india and china my people the nile folk we discovered early on that a reed boat will take you around the world if you have the patience and enough jars of sweet water you seet the biggest problem with coming to america in the old days was that there wasnt a lot here that anyone wanted to trade and it was much too far away they had reached a large house built in the style people called queen anne shadow wondered who queen anne was and why she had been so fond of addams familystyle houses it was the only building on the block that wasnt locked up with boardedover windows they went through the gate and walked around the back of the building through large double doors which mr ibis unlocked with a key from his key chain and they were in a large unheated room occupied by two people they were a very tall darkskinned man holding a large metal scalpel and a dead girl in her late teens lying on a long porcelain table that resembled both a slab and a sink there were several photographs of the dead girl pinned up on a corkboard on the wall above the body she was smiling in one a high school head shot in another she was standing in a line with three other girls they were wearing what might have been prom dresses and her black hair was tied above her head in an intricate knotwork cold on the porcelain her hair was down loose around her shoulders and matted with dried blood this is my partner mister jacquel said ibis we met already said jacquel forgive me if i dont shake hands shadow looked down at the girl on the table what happened to her he asked american gods poor taste in boyfriends said jacquel its not always fatal said mr ibis with a sigh this time it was he was drunk and he had a knife and she told him that she thought she was pregnant he didnt believe it was his she was stabbed said mr jacquel and he counted there was a click as he stepped on a foot switch turning on a small dictaphone on a nearby table five times there are three knife wounds in the left anterior chest wall the first is between the fourth and fifth intercostal spaces at the medial border of the left breast two point two centimeters in length the second and third are through the inferior portion of the left midbreast penetrating at the sixth interspace overlapping and measuring three centimeters there is one wound two centimeters long in the upper anterior left chest in the second interspace and one wound five centimeters long and a maximum of one point six centimeters deep in the anteromedial left deltoid a slashing injury all the chest wounds are deep penetrating injuries there are no other visible wounds externally he released pressure from the foot switch shadow noticed a small microphone dangling above the embalming table by its cord so youre the coroner as well asked shadow coroners a political appointment around here said ibis his job is to kick the corpse if it doesnt kick him back he signs the death certificate jacquels what they call a prosector he works for the county medical examiner he does autopsies and saves tissue samples for analysis hes already photographed her wounds jacquel ignored them he took a big scalpel and made a deep incision in a large v that began at both collarbones and met at the bottom of her breastbone and then he turned the v into a y another deep incision that continued from her breastbone to her pubis he picked up what looked like a small heavy chrome drill with a medallionsized round saw neil caiman blade at the business end he turned it on and cut through the ribs at both sides of her breastbone the girl opened like a purse shadow suddenly was aware of a mild but unpleasantly penetrating pungent meaty smell i thought it would smell worse said shadow shes pretty fresh said jacquel and the intestines werent pierced so it doesnt smell of shit shadow found himself looking away not from revulsion as he would have expected but from a strange desire to give the girl some privacy it would be hard to be nakeder than this open thing jacquel tied off the intestines glistening and snakelike in her belly below the stomach and deep in the pelvis he ran them through his fingers foot after foot of them described them as normal to the microphone put them in a bucket on the floor he sucked all the blood out of her chest with a vacuum pump and measured the volume then he inspected the inside of her chest he said to the microphone there are three lacerations in the pericardium which is filled with clotted and liquefying blood jacquel grasped her heart cut it at its top turned it about in his hand examining it he stepped on his switch and said there are two lacerations of the myocardium a onepointfivecentimeter laceration in the right ventricle and a onepointeightcentimeter laceration penetrating the left ventricle jacquel removed each lung the left lung had been stabbed and was half collapsed he weighed them and the heart and he photographed the wounds from each lung he sliced a small piece of tissue which he placed into ajar formaldehyde whispered mr ibis helpfully jacquel continued to talk to the microphone describing what he was doing what he saw as he removed the girls liver the stomach spleen pancreas both kidneys the uterus and the ovaries american gods he weighed each organ reported them as normal and uninjured from each organ he took a small slice and put it into a jar of formaldehyde from the heart the liver and from one of the kidneys he cut an additional slice these pieces he chewed slowly making them last while he worked somehow it seemed to shadow a good thing for him to do respectful not obscene so you want to stay here with us for a spell said jacquel masticating the slice of the girls heart if youll have me said shadow certainly well have you said mr ibis no reasons why not and plenty of reasons why youll be under our protection as long as youre here i hope you dont mind sleeping under the same roof as the dead said jacquel shadow thought of the touch of lauras lips bitter and cold no he said not as long as they stay dead anyhow jacquel turned and looked at him with dark brown eyes as quizzical and cold as a desert dogs they stay dead here was all he said seems to me said shadow seems to me that the dead come back pretty easy not at all said ibis even zombies they make them out of the living you know a little powderia little chanting a little push and you have a zombie they live but they believe they are dead but to truly bring the dead back to life in their bodies that takes power he hesitated then in the old land in the old days it was easier then you could bind the ka of a man to his body for five thousand years said jacquel binding or loosing but that was a long time ago he took all the organs that he had removed and replaced them respectfully in the body cavity he replaced the intestines and the breastbone and pulled the skin edges near each other then he took a thick needle and thread and with deft quick strokes he sewed it up like a neil caiman man stitching a baseball the cadaver transformed from meat into girl once again i need a beer said jacquel he pulled off his rubber gloves and dropped them into the bin he dropped his dark brown overalls into a hamper then he took the cardboard tray of jars filled with little red and brown and purple slices of the organs coming they walked up the back stairs to the kitchen it was brown and white a sober and respectable room that looked to shadow as if it had last been decorated in there was a huge kelvinator rattling to itself by one wall jacquel opened the kelvinator door put the plastic jars with their slivers of spleen of kidney of liver of heart inside he took out three brown bottles ibis opened a glassfronted cupboard removed three tall glasses then he gestured for shadow to sit down at the kitchen table ibis poured the beer and passed a glass to shadow a glass to jacquel it was a fine beer bitter and dark good beer said shadow we brew it ourselves said ibis in the old days the women did the brewing they were better brewers than we are but now it is only the three of us here me him and her he gestured toward the small brown cat fast asleep in a catbasket in the corner of the room there were more of us in the beginning but set left us to explore what two hundred years ago must be by now we got a postcard from him from san francisco in then nothing while poor horus he trailed off in a sigh and shook his head i still see him on occasion said jacquel on my way to a pickup he sipped his beer ill work for my keep said shadow while im here you tell me what you need doing and ill do it well find work for you agreed jacquel the small brown cat opened her eyes and stretched to her feet she padded across the kitchen floor and pushed at american gods shadows boot with her head he put down his left hand and scratched her forehead and the back of her ears and the scruff of her neck she arched ecstatically then sprang into his lap pushed herself up against his chest and touched her cold nose to his then she curled up in his lap and went back to sleep he put his hand down to stroke her her fur was soft and she was warm and pleasant in his lap she acted like she was in the safest place in the world and shadow felt comforted the beer left a pleasant buzz in shadows head your room is at the top of the stairs by the bathroom said jacquel your work clothes will be hanging in the closetyoull see youll want to wash up and shave first i guess shadow did he showered standing in the castiron tub and he shaved very nervously with a straight razor that jacquel loaned him it was obscenely sharp and had a motherofpearl handle and shadow suspected it was usually used to give dead men their final shave he had never used a straight razor before but he did not cut himself he washed off the shaving cream looked at himself naked in the flyspecked bathroom mirror he was btiused fresh bruises on his chest and arms overlaying the fading bruises that mad sweeney had left him his eyes looked back mistrustfully from the mirror at him j and then as if someone else were holding his hand he raised the straight razor placed it blade open against his throat it would be a way out he thought an easy way out and if theres anyone whod simply take it in their stride whod just clean up the mess and get on with things its the two guys sitting downstairs at the kitchen table drinking their beer no more worries no more laura no more mysteries and conspiracies no more bad dreams just peace and quiet and rest forever one clean slash ear to ear thats all itll take neil caiman he stood there with the razor against his throat a tiny smudge of blood came from the place where the blade touched the skin he had not even noticed a cut see he told himself and he could almost hear the words being whispered in his ear its painless too sharp to hurt ill be gone before i know it then the door to the bathroom swung open just a few inches enough for the little brown cat to put her head around the door frame and mrr up at him curiously hey he said to the cat i thought i locked that door he closed the cutthroat razor put it down on the side of the sink dabbed at his tiny cut with a toilet paper swab then he wrapped a towel around his waist and went into the bedroom next door his bedroom like the kitchen seemed to have been decorated some time in the s there was a washstand and a pitcher beside the chest of drawers and mirror someone had already laid out clothes for him on the bed a black suit white shirt black tie white undershirt and underpants black socks black shoes sat on the worn persian carpet beside the bed he dressed himself the clothes were of good quality although none of them was new he wondered who they had belonged to was he wearing a dead mans socks would he be stepping into a dead mans shoes he adjusted the tie in the mirror and now it seemed to him that his reflection was smiling at him sardonically now it seemed inconceivable to him that he had ever thought of cutting his throat his reflection continued to smile as he adjusted his tie hey he said to it you know something that i dont and immediately felt foolish the door creaked open and the cat slipped between the doorpost and the door and padded across the room then up on the windowsill hey he said to the cat i did shut that door i know i shut that door she looked at him interested american gods her eyes were dark yellow the color of amber then she jumped down from the sill onto the bed where she wrapped herself into a curl of fur and went back to sleep a circle of cat upon the old counterpane shadow left the bedroom door open so the cat could leave and the room air a little and he walked downstairs the stairs creaked and grumbled as he walked down them protesting his weight as if they just wanted to be left in peace damn you look good said jacquel he was waiting at the bottom of the stairs and was now himself dressed in a black suit similar to shadows you ever driven a hearse no first time for everything then said jacquel its parked out front an old woman had died her name had been lila goodchild at mr jacquels direction shadow carried the folded aluminum gurney up the narrow stairs to her bedroom and unfolded it next to her bed he took out a translucent blue plastic body bag laid it next to the dead woman oa the bed and unzipped it open she wore a pink nightgown and a quilted robe shadow lifted her and wrapped her fragile and almost weightless in a blanket and placed it onto the bag he zipped the bag shut and put it on the gurney while shadow did this jacquel talked to a very old man who had when she was alive been married to lila goodchild or rather jacquel listened while the old man talked as shadow had zipped mrs goodchild away the old man had been explaining how ungrateful his children had been and grandchildren too though that wasnt their fault that was their parents the apple didnt fall far from the tree and he thought hed raised thembetter than that shadow and jacquel wheeled the loaded gurney to the narrow flight of stairs the old man followed them still talking mostly about money and greed and ingratitude he neil caiman wore bedroom slippers shadow carried the heavier bottom end of the gurney down the stairs and out onto the street then he wheeled it along the icy sidewalk to the hearse jacquel opened the hearses rear door shadow hesitated and jacquel said just push it on in there the supportsll fold up out of the way shadow pushed the gurney anjl the supports snapped up the wheels rotated and the gurney rolled right onto the floor of the hearse jacquel showed him how to strap it in securely and shadow closed up the hearse while jacquel listened to the old man who had been married to lila goodchild unmindful of the cold an old man in his slippers and his bathrobe out on the wintry sidewalk telling jacquel how his children were vultures no better than hovering vultures waiting to take what little he and lila had scraped together and how the two of them had fled to st louis to memphis to miami and how they wound up in cairo and how relieved he was that lila had not died in a nursing home how scared he was that he would they walked the old man back into the house up the stairs to his room a small tv set droned from one corner of the couples bedroom as shadow passed it he noticed that the newsreader was grinning and winking at him when he was sure that no one was looking in his direction he gave the set the finger theyve got no money said jacquel when they were back in the hearse hell come in to see ibis tomorrow hell choose the cheapest funeral her friends will persuade him to do her right give her a proper sendoff in the front room i expect but hell grumble got no money nobody around heres got money these days anyway hell be dead in six months a year at the outside snowflakes tumbled and drifted in front of the headlights the snow was coming south shadow said is he sick it aint that women survive their men menmen like himdont live long when their women are gone youll american gods seehell just start wandering all the familiar things are going to be gone with her he gets tired and he fades and then he gives up and then hes gone maybe pneumonia will take him or maybe itll be cancer or maybe his heart will stop old age and all the fight gone out of you then you die shadow thought hey jacquel yeah do you believe in the soul it wasnt quite the question he had been going to ask and it took him by surprise to hear it coming from his mouth he had intended to say something less direct but there was nothing less direct that he could say depends back in my day we had it all set up you lined up when you died and youd answer for your evil deeds and for your good deeds and if your evil deeds outweighed a feather wed feed your soul and your heart to ammet the eater of souls he must have eaten a lot of people not as many as youd think it was a really heavy feather we had it made special you had to be pretty damn evil to tip the scales on that baby stop here thargas station well put in a few gallons the streets were quiet in the way thatstreets only are when the first snow falls its going to be white christmas said shadow as he pumped the gas yup shit that boy was one lucky son of a virgin jesus lucky lucky guy he could fall in a cesspit and come up smelling like roses hell its not even his birthday you know that he took it from mithras you run into mithras yet red cap nice kid no i dont think so well ive never seen mithras around here he was an army brat maybe hes back in the middle east taking it easy but i expect hes probably gone by now it happens neil caiman one day every soldier in the empire has to shower in the blood of your sacrificial bull the next they dont even remember your birthday swish went the windshield wipers pushing the snow to the side bunching the flakes up into knots and swirls of clear ice t a traffic light turned momentarily yellow and then red and shadow put his foot on the brake the hearse fishtailed and swung around on the empty road before it stopped the light turned green shadow took the hearse up to ten miles per hour which seemed enough on the slippery roads it was perfectly happy cruising in second gear he guessed it must have spent a lot of its time at that speed holding up traffic thats good said jacquel so yeah jesus does pretty good over here but i met a guy who said he saw him hitchhiking by the side of the road in afghanistan and nobody was stopping to give him a ride you know it all depends on where you are i think a real storms coming said shadow he was talking about the weather jacquel when eventually he began to answer wasnt talking about the weather at all you look at me and ibis he said well be out of business in a few years we got savings put aside for the lean years but the lean years have been here for a long while and every year they just get leaner horus is crazy really bugfuck crazy spends all his time as a hawk eats roadkill what kind of a life is that youve seen bast and were in better shape than most of them at least weve got a little belief to be going along with most of the suckers out there have barely got that its like the funeral businessthe big guys are going to buy you up one day like it or not because theyre bigger and more efficient and because they work fightings not going to change a damned thing because we lost this particular battle when we came to this green land a hundred years ago or american gods a thousand or ten thousand we arrived and america just didnt care that wed arrived we get bought out or we press on or we hit the road so yes youre right the storms coming shadow turned onto the street where the houses were all but one of them dead their windows blind and boarded take the back alley said jacquel he backed the hearse up until it was almost touching the double doors at the rear of the house ibis opened the hearse and the mortuary doors and shadow unbuckled the gurney and pulled it out the wheeled supports rotated and dropped as they cleared the bumper he wheeled the gurney to the embalming table he picked up lila goodchild cradling her in her opaque bag like a sleeping child and placed her carefully on the table in the chilly mortuary as if he were afraid to wake her you know i have a transfer board said jacquel you dont have to carry her aint nothing said shadow he was starting to sound more like jacquel im a big guy it doesnt bother me as a kid shadow had been small for his ageall elbows and knees the only photograph of shadow asa kid that laura had liked enough to frame showed a solemn child with unruly hair and dark eyes standing beside a table laden high with cakes and cookies shadow thought the picture might have been taken at an embassy christmas party as he had been dressed in a bow tie and his best clothes they had moved too much his mother and shadow first around europe from embassy to embassy where his mother had worked as a communicator in the foreign service transcribing and sending classified telegrams across the world and then when he was eight years old back to the united states where his mother now too sporadically sick to hold down a steady job had moved from city to city restlessly spending a year here or a year there temping when she was well enough they never spent long enough neil caiman in any place for shadow to make friends to feel at home to relax and shadow had been a small child he had grown so fast in the spring of his thirteenth year the local kids had been picking on him goading him into fights they knew they could not fail to win and after which shadow would run angry and often weeping to the boys room to wash the mud or the blood from his face before anyone could see it then came summer a long magical thirteenth summer which he spent keeping out of the way of the bigger kids swimming in the local pool reading library books at poolside at the start of the summer he could barely swim by the end of august he was swimming length after length in an easy crawl diving from the high board ripening to a deep brown from the sun and the water in september he returned to school to discover that the boys who had made him miserable were small soft things no longer capable of upsetting him the two whontried it were taught better manners hard and fast and painfully and shadow found that he had redefined himself he could no longer be a quiet kid doing his best to remain unobtrusively at the back of things he was too big for that too obvious by the end of the year he was on the swimming team and the weightlifting team and the coach was courting him for the triathlon team he liked being big and strong it gave him an identity hed been a shy quiet bookish kid and that had been painful now he was a big dumb guy and nobody expected him to be able to do anything more than move a sofa into the next room on his own nobody until laura anyway mr ibis had prepared dinner rice and boiled greens for himself and mr jacquel i am not a meat eater he explained while jacquel gets all the meat he needs in the course of his work beside shadows place was a carton of chicken pieces from kfc and a bottle of beer there was more chicken than shadow could eat and he american gods shared the leftovers with the cat removing the skin and crusty coating then shredding the meat for her with his fingers there was a guy in prison named jackson said shadow as he ate worked in the prison library he told me that they changed the name from kentucky fried chicken to kfc because they dont serve real chicken anymore its become this genetically modified mutant thing like a giant centipede with no head just segment after segment of legs and breasts and wings its fed through nutrient tubes this guy said the government wouldnt let them use the word chicken mr ibis raised his eyebrows you think thats true nope now my old cellmate low key he said they changed the name because the word fried had become a bad word maybe they wanted people to think that the chicken cooked itself after dinner jacquel excused himself and went down to the mortuary ibis went to his study to write shadow sat in the kitchen for a little longer feeding fragments of chicken breast to the little brown cat sipping his beetwhen the beer and the chicken were gone he washed pthe plates and cutlery put them on the rack to dry and went upstairs by the time he reached the bedroom the little brown cat was once more asleep at the bottom of the bed curled into a fur crescent in the middle drawer of the vanity he found several pairs of striped cotton pajamas they looked seventy years old but smelled fresh and he pulled on a pair that like the black suit fitted him as if they had been tailored for him there was a small stack of readers digests on the little table beside the bed none of them dated later than march jackson the library guythe same one who had sworn to the truth of the kentucky fried mutant chicken creature story who had told him the story of the black freight trains that the government uses to haul political pris neil caiman oners off to secret northern californian concentration camps moving across the country in the dead of the nightjackson had also told him that the cia used the readers digest as a front for their branch offices around the world he said that every readers digest office in every country was really cia a joke said the late mr wood in shadows memory how can we be sure the cia wasnt involved in the kennedy assassination shadow cracked the window open a few inchesenough for fresh air to get in enough for the cat to be able to get out onto the balcony outside he turned on the bedside lamp climbed into bed and read for a little trying to turn off his mind to get the last few days out of his head picking the dullestlooking articles in the dullestlooking digests he noticed he was falling asleep halfway through i am joes pancreas he barely had time enough to turn out the bedside light and put his head down on the pillow before his eyes closed for the night later he was never able to recollect the sequence and details of that dream attempts to remember it produced nothing more than a tangle of dark images there was a girl he had met her somewhere and now they were walking across a bridge it spanned a small lake in the middle of a town the wind was ruffling the surface of the lake making waves tipped with whitecaps which seemed to shadow to be tiny hands reaching for him down there said the woman she was wearing a leopardprint skirt which flapped and tossed in the wind and the flesh between the top of her stockings and her skirt was creamy and soft and in his dream on the bridge before god and the world shadow went down to his knees in front of her burying his head in her crotch drinking in the intoxicating jungle female scent of her he became aware in his american gods dream of his erection in real life a rigid pounding monstrous thing as painful in its hardness as the erections hed had as a boy when he was crashing into puberty he pulled away and looked upward and still he could not see her face but his mouth was seeking hers and her lips were soft against his and his hands were cupping her breasts and then they were running across the satin smoothness of her skin pushing into and parting the furs that hid her waist sliding into the wonderful cleft of her which warmed and wetted and parted for him opening to his hand like a flower the woman purred against him ecstatically her hand moving down to the hardness of him and squeezing it he pushed the bedsheets away and rolled on top of her his hand parting her thighs her hand guiding him between her legs where one thrust one magical push now he was back in his old prison cell with her and he was kissing her deeply she wrapped her arms tightly around him clamped her legs about his legs to hold him tight so he could not pull out not even if he wanted to never had he kissed lips so soft he had not known that there were lips so soft in the whole worldrffer tongue though was sandpaperrough as it slipped against his who are you he asked she made no answer just pushed him onto his back and in one lithe movement straddled him and began to ride him no not to ride him to insinuate herself against him in a series of silkensmooth waves each more powerful than the one before strokes and beats and rhythms that crashed against his mind and his body just as the windwaves on the lake splashed against the shore her nails were needlesharp and they pierced his sides raking them but he felt no pain only pleasure everything was transmuted by some alchemy into moments of utter pleasure he struggled to find himself struggled to talk his head now filled with sand dunes and desert winds neil caiman who are you he asked again gasping for the words she stared at him with eyes the color of dark amber then lowered her mouth to his and kissed him with a passion kissed him so completely and so deeply that there on the bridge over the lake in his prison cell in the bed in the cairo funeral home he almost came he rode the sensation like a kite riding a hurricane willing it not to crest not to explode wanting it never to end he pulled it under control he had to warn her my wife laura she will kill you not me she said a fragment of nonsense bubbled up from somewhere in his mind in medieval days it was said that a woman on top during coitus would conceive a bishop that was what they called it trying for a bishop he wanted to know her name but he dared not ask her a third time and she pushed her chest against his and he could feel the hard nubs of her nipples against his chest and she was squeezing him somehow squeezing him down there deep inside her and this time he could not ride it or surf it this time it picked him up and spun and tumbled him away and he was arching up pushing into her as deeply as he could imagine as if they were in some way part of the same creature tasting drinking holding wanting let it happen she said her voice a throaty feline growl give it to me let it happen and he came spasming and dissolving the back of his mind itself liquefying then sublimating slowly from one state to the next somewhere in there at the end of it he took a breath a clear draught of air he felt all the way down to the depths of his lungs and he knew that he had been holding his breath for a long time now three years at least perhaps even longer now rest she said and she kissed his eyelids with her soft lips let it go let it all go american gods the sleep he slept after that was deep and dreamless and comforting and shadow dived deep and embraced it the light was strange it was he checked his watch am and still dark outside although the room was filled with a pale blue dimness he climbed out of bed he was certain that he had been wearing pajamas when he went to bed but now he was naked and the air was cold on his skin he walked to the window and closed it there had been a snowstorm in the night six inches had fallen perhaps more the corner of the town that shadow could see from his window dirty and rundown had been transformed into somewhere clean and different these houses were not abandoned and forgotten they were frosted into elegance the streets had vanished completely lost beneath a white field of snow there was an idea that hovered at the edge of his perception something about transience it flickered and was gone he could see as well as if it were full daylight in the mirror shadow noticed something sttange he stepped closer and stared puzzled all his bruises had vanished he touched his side pressing firmly with his fingertips feeling for one of the deep pains thattold him he had encountered mr stone and mr wood hunting for the greening blossoms of bruise that mad sweeney had gifted him with and finding nothing his face was clear and unmarked his sides however and his back were scratched with what looked like claw marks he hadnt dreamed it then not entirely shadow opened the drawers and put on what he found an ancient pair of bluedenim levis a shirt a thick blue sweater and a black undertakers coat he found hanging in the wardrobe at the back of the room he wore his own old shoes the house was still asleep he crept through it willing neil caiman the floorboards not to creak and then he was outside and he walked through the snow his feet leaving deep prints on the sidewalk it was lighter out than it had seemed from inside the house and the snow reflected the light from the sky after fifteen minutes of walking shadow came to a bridge with a big sign on the side of it warning him he was now leaving historical cairo a man stood under the bridge tall and gangling sucking on a cigarette and shivering continually shadow thought he recognized the man and then under the bridge in the winter darkness he was close enough to see the purple smudge of bruise around the mans eye and he said good morning mad sweeney the world was so quiet not even cars disturbed the snowbound silence hey man said mad sweeney he did not look up the cigarette had been rolled by hand you keep hanging out under bridges mad sweeney said shadow people gonna think youre a troll this time mad sweeney looked up shadow could see the whites of his eyes all around his irises the man looked scared i was lookin for you he said you gotta help me man i fucked up big time he sucked on his handrolled cigarette pulled it away from his mouth the cigarette paper stuck to his lower lip and the cigarette fell apart spilling its contents onto his ginger beard and down the front of his filthy tshirt mad sweeney brushed it off convulsively with blackened hands as if it were a dangerous insect my resources are pretty much tapped out mad sweeney said shadow but why dont you tell me what it is you need you want me to get you a coffee mad sweeney shook his head he took out a tobacco pouch and papers from the pocket of his denim jacket and began to roll himself another cigarette his beard bristled and his mouth moved as he did this although no words were said aloud he licked the adhesive side of the cigarette american gods paper and rolled it between his fingers the result looked only distantly like a cigarette then he said m not a troll shit those bastardsre fucken mean i know youre not a troll sweeney said shadow gently how can i help you mad sweeney flicked his brass zippo and the first inch of his cigarette flamed and then subsided to ash you remember i showed you how to get a coin you remember yes said shadow he saw the gold coin in his minds eye watched it tumble into lauras casket saw it glitter around her neck i remember you took the wrong coin man a car approached the gloom under the bridge blinding them with its lights it slowed as it passed them then stopped and a window slid down everything okay here gentlemen everythings just peachy thank you officer said shadow were just out for a morning walk okay now said the cop he did not look as if he believed that everything was okay he waited shadow put a hand on mad sweeneys shoulder and walked him forward out of town away from the police car he heardfhe window hum closed but the car remained where it wast shadow walked mad sweeney walked and sometimes he staggered the police car cruised past them slowly jhen turned and went back into the city accelerating down the snowy road now why dont you tell me whats troubling you said shadow i did it like he said i did it all like he said but i gave you the wrong coin it wasnt meant to be that coin thats for royalty you see i shouldnt even have been able to take it thats the coin youd give to the king of america himself not some pissant bastard like you or me and now im in big trouble just give me the coin back man youll never see me again if you do i sweartofuckenbran okay i swear by the years i spent in the fucken trees neil caiman you did it like who said sweeney grimnir the dude you call wednesday you know who he is who he really is yeah i guess there was a panicked look in the irishmans crazy blue eyes it was nothing bad nothing you cannothing bd he just told me to be there at that bar and to pick a fight with you he said he wanted to see what you were made of he tell you to do anything else sweeney shivered and twitched shadow thought it was the cold for a moment then knew where hed seen that shuddering shiver before in prison it was a junkie shiver sweeney was in withdrawal from something and shadow would have been willing to bet it was heroin a junkie leprechaun mad sweeney pinched off the burning head of his cigarette dropped it on the ground put the unfinished yellowing rest of it into his pocket he rubbed his dirtblack fingers together breathed on them to try and rub warmth into them his voice was a whine now listen just give me the fucken coin man ill give you another just as good hell ill give you a shitload of the fuckers he took off his greasy baseball cap then with his right hand he stroked the air producing a large golden coin he dropped it into his cap and then he took another from a wisp of breath steam and another catching and grabbing them from the still morning air until the baseball cap was brimming with them and sweeney was forced to hold it with both hands he extended the baseball cap filled with gold to shadow here he said take them man just give me back die coin i gave to you shadow looked down at the cap wondered how much its contents would be worth where am i going to spend those coins mad sweeney shadow asked are there a lot of places you can turn your gold into cash he thought the irishman was going to hit him for a mo americangods ment but the moment passed and mad sweeney just stood there holding out his goldfilled cap with both hands like oliver twist and dien tears swelled in his blue eyes and began to spill down his cheeks he took the cap and put it now empty of everything except a greasy sweatbandback over his thinning scalp you gotta man he was saying didnt i show you how to do it i showed you how to take coins from the hoard i showed you where the hoard was just give me that first coin back it didnt belong to me i dont have it anymore mad sweeneys tears stopped and spots of color appeared in his cheeks you you fucken he said and then the words failed him and his mouth opened and closed wordlessly im telling you the truth said shadow im sorry if i had it id give it back to you but i gave it away sweeneys grimy hands clamped on shadows shoulders and the pale blue eyes stared into his the tears had made streaks in the dirt on mad sweeneys face shit he said shadow could smell tobacco and stale bepr and whiskeysweat youre telling the truth you fucker gave it away and freely and of your own will damn your dark eyes you gave it afuckenway im sorry shadow remembered the whispering thump the coin had made as it landed on lauras cajjket sorry or not im damned and im doomed he wiped his nose and his eyes on his sleeves muddying his face into strange patterns shadow squeezed mad sweeneys upper arm in an awkward male gesture twere better i had never been conceived said mad sweeney at length then he looked up the fellow you gave it to would he give it back its a woman and i dont know where she is but no i dont believe she would sweeney sighed mournfully when i was but a young neil caiman pup he said there was a woman i met under the stars who let me play with her hubbies and she told me my fortune she told me that i would be undone and abandoned west of the sunset and that a dead womans bauble would seal my fate and i laughed and poured more barley wine and played with her bubbies some more and i kissed her full on her pretty lips those were the good daysthe first of the gray monks had not yet come to our land nor had they ridden the green sea to westward and now he stopped midsentence his head turned and he focused on shadow you shouldnt trust him he said reproachfully who wednesday you mustnt trust him i dont have to trust him i work for him do you remember how to do it what shadow felt he was having a conversation with half a dozen different people the selfstyled leprechaun sputtered and jumped from persona to persona from theme to theme as if the remaining clusters of brain cells were igniting flaming and then going out for good the coins man the coins i showed you remember he raised two fingers to his face stared at them then pulled a gold coin from his mouth he tossed the coin to shadow who stretched out a hand to catch it but no coin reached him i was drunk said shadow i dont remember sweeney stumbled across the road it was light now and the world was white and gray shadow followed him sweeney walked in a long loping stride as if he were always falling but his legs were there to stop him to propel him into another stumble when they reached the bridge he held onto the bricks with one hand and turned and said you got a few bucks i dont need much just enough for a ticket out of this place twenty bucks will do me fine just a lousy twenty american gods where can you go on a twenty dollar bus ticket asked shadow i can get out of here said sweeney i can get away before the storm hits away from a world in which opiates have become the religion of the masses away from he stopped wiped his nose on the side of his hand then wiped his hand on his sleeve shadow reached into his jeans pulled out a twenty and passed it to sweeney here sweeney crumpled it up and pushed it deep into the breast pocket of his oilstained denim jacket under the sewon patch showing two vultures on a dead branch and beneath them the words patience my ass im going to kill something he nodded thatll get me where i need to go he said he leaned against the bricks fumbled in his pockets until he found the unfinished stub of cigarette he had abandoned earlier he lit it carefully trying not to burn his fingers or his beard ill tell you something he said as if he had said nothing that day youre walking on gallows ground and theres a rope around your neck and a ravenbird on each shoulder waiting for youreyes and the galknvs tree has deep roots for it stretches from heaven to hell and our world is only the branch from which the rope is swinging he stopped ill rest here a spell he said ojouching down his back resting against the black brickwork good luck said shadow hell im fucked said mad sweeney whatever thanks shadow walked back toward the town it was am and cairo was waking he glanced back to the bridge and saw sweeneys pale face striped with tears and dirt watching him go it was the last time shadow saw mad sweeney alive neil caiman the brief winter days leading up to christmas were like moments of light between the winter darknesses and they fled fast in the house of the dead it was the twentythird of december and jacquel and ibiss played host to a wake for lila goodchild bustling women filled the kitchen with tubs and with saucepans and with skillets and with tupperware and the deceased was laid out in her casket in the funeral homes front room with hothouse flowers around her there was a table on the other side of the room laden high with coleslaw and beans and cornmeal hush puppies and chicken and ribs and blackeyed peas and by midafternoon the house was filled with people weeping and laughing and shaking hands with the minister everything being quietly organized and overseen by the sobersuited messrs jacquel and ibis the burial would be on the following morning when the telephone in the hall rang mr ibis answered then he took shadow aside that was the police he said can you make a pickup sure be discreet here he wrote down an address on a slip of paper then passed it to shadow who read the address written in perfect copperplate handwriting and then folded it up and put it in his pocket therell be a police car ibis added shadow went out back and got the hearse both mr jacquel and mr ibis had made a point individually of explaining that really the hearse should only be used for funerals and they had a van that they used to collect bodies but the van was being repaired had been for three weeks now and could he be very careful with the hearse shadow drove carefully down the street the snowplows had cleaned the roads by now but he was comfortable driving slowly it seemed right to go slow in a hearse although he could barely remember the last time he had seen a hearse on american gods the streets death had vanished from the streets of america thought shadow now it happened in hospital rooms and in ambulances we must not startle the living thought shadow mr ibis had told him that they move the dead about in some hospitals on the lower level of apparently empty covered gurneys the deceased traveling their own paths in their own covered ways a dark blue police cruiser was parked on a side street and shadow pulled up the hearse behind it there were two cops inside the cruiser drinking their coffee from thermos tops they had the engine running to keep warm shadow tapped on the side window yeah im from the funeral home said shadow were waiting for the medical examiner said the cop shadow wondered if it was the same man who had spoken to him under the bridge the cop who was black got out of the car leaving his colleague in the drivers seat and walked shadow back to a dumpster mad sweeney was sitting in the snow beside the dumpster there was an empty green bottle in his lap a dusting of snow and ice on his face and baseball cap and shoulders he didnt whlk dead wino said the cop looks like it said shadow dont touch anything yet said the c medical examiner should be here any time now you ask me the guy drank himself into a stupor and froze his ass yes agreed shadow thats certainly what it looks like he squatted down and looked at the bottle in mad sweeneys lap jameson irish whiskey a twentydollar ticket out of this place a small green nissan pulled up and a harassed middleaged man with sandy hair and a sandy mustache got out walked over he touched the corpses neck he kicks the corpse thought shadow and if it doesnt kick him back neil caiman hes dead said the medical examiner any id hes a john doe said the cop the medical examiner looked at shadow you working for jacquel and ibis he asked yes said shadow tell jacquel to get dentals and prints for id and identity photos we dont need a post he should just draw blood for toxicology got that do you want me to write it down for you no said shadow its fine i can remember the man scowled fleetingly then pulled a business card from his wallet scribbled on it and gave it to shadow saying give this to jacquel then the medical examiner said merry christmas to everyone and was on his way the cops kept the empty bottle shadow signed for the john doe and put it on the gurney the body was pretty stiff and shadow couldnt get it out of a sitting position he fiddled widi the gurney and found out that he could prop up one end he strapped john doe sitting to the gurney and put him in the back of the hearse facing forward might as well give him a good ride he closed the rear curtains then he drove back to the funeral home the hearse was stopped at a traffic light when shadow heard a voice croak and its a fine wake ill be wanting with the best of everything and beautiful women shedding tears and their clothes in their distress and brave men lamenting and telling fine tales of me in my great days youre dead mad sweeney said shadow you take what youre given when youre dead aye that i shall sighed the dead man sitting in the back of the hearse the junkie whine had vanished from his voice now replaced with a resigned flatness as if the words were being broadcast from a long long way away dead words being sent out on a dead frequency american gods the light turned green and shadow put his foot gently down on the gas but give me a wake nonetheless said mad sweeney set me a place at table and give me a stinking drunk wake tonight you killed me shadow you owe me that much i never killed you mad sweeney said shadow its twenty dollars he thought for a ticket out of here it was the drink and the cold killed you not me there was no reply and there was silence in the car for the rest of the journey after he parked at the back shadow wheeled the gurney out of the hearse and into the mortuary he manhandled mad sweeney onto the embalming table as if he were hauling a side of beef he covered the john doe with a sheet and left him there with the paperwork beside him as he went up the back stairs he thought he heard a voice quiet and muted like a radio playing in a distant room which said and what would drink or cold be doing killing me a leprechaun of the blood no it was you losing the little golden sun killed me shadow killed me dead as sure as waters wet and days are long and a friend will always disappoint you iri the end shadow wanted to point out to mad sweeney that that was a kind of bitter philosophy but he suspected it was the being dead that made you bitter he went upstairs to the main house wljfere a number of middleaged women were putting saran wrap on casserole dishes popping the tupperware tops onto plastic pots of cooling fried potatoes and macaroni and cheese mr goodchild the husband of the deceased had mr ibis against a wall and was telling him how he knew none of his children would come out to pay their respects to their mother the apple dont fall far from the tree he told anyone who would listen to him the apple dont fall far from the tree neil caiman that evening shadow laid an extra place at the table he put a glass at each place and a bottle of jameson gold in the middle of the table it was the most expensive irish whiskey they sold at the liquor store after they ate shadow poured a generous tot into each glasshis ibiss jacquefs andmad sweeneys so what if hes sitting on a gurney in the cellar said shadow as he poured on his way to a paupers grave tonight well toast him and give him the wake he wanted shadow raised his glass to the empty place at the table i only met mad sweeney twice alive he said the first time i thought he was a worldclass jerk with the devil in him the second time i thought he was a major fuckup and i gave him the money to kill himself he showed me a coin trick i dont remember how to do gave me some bruises and claimed he was a leprechaun rest in peace mad sweeney he sipped the whiskey letting the smoky taste evaporate in his mouth the other two drank toasting the empty chair along with him mr ibis reached into an inside pocket and pulled out a notebook which he flipped through until he found the appropriate page and he read out a summarized version of mad sweeneys life according to mr ibis mad sweeney had started his me as the guardian of a sacred rock in a small irish glade over three thousand years ago mr ibis told them of mad sweeneys love affairs his enmities the madness that gave him his power the worship and adoration in his own land that slowly transmuted into a guarded respect and then finally into amusement he told them the story of the girl from bantry who came to the new world and who brought her belief in mad sweeney the leprechaun with her for hadnt she seen him of a night down by the american gods pool and hadnt he smiled at her and called her by her own true name she had become a refugee in the hold of a ship of people who had watched their potatoes turn to black sludge in the ground who had watched friends and lovers die of hunger who dreamed of a land of full stomachs the girl from bantry bay dreamed specifically of a city where a girl would be able to earn enough to bring her family over to the new world many of the irish coming into america thought of themselves as catholics even if they knew nothing of the catechism even if all they knew of religion was the bean sidhe the banshee who came to wail at the walls of a house where death soon would be and saint bride who was once bridget of the two sisters and tales of finn of ofsin of cdnan the baldeven of the leprechauns the little people all this and more mr ibis told them in the kitchen that night his shadow on the wall was stretched and birdlike and as the whiskey flowed shadow imagined itme head of a huge waterfowl beak long and curved andif was somewhere in the middle of the second glass that mad sweeney himself began to throw both details andirrelevancies into ibiss narrative and then sweeney was trying with both hands to explain the history of the gods in ireland wave after wave of them as they came in from gaul and from spain and from every damn place each wave of them transforming the last gods into trolls and fairies and every damn creature until holy mother church herself arrived and every god in ireland was transformed into a fairy or a saint or a dead king without so much as a byyourleave neil caiman mr ibis polished his goldrimmed spectacles and explainedenunciating even more clearly and precisely than usual so shadow knew he was drunk with forefinger wagging that he was an artist and that his tales should ngt be seen as literal constructs but as imaginative recreations truer than the truth and mad sweeney said ill show you an imaginative recreation my fist imaginatively recreating your fucken face for starters and mr jacquel bared his teeth and growled at sweeney the growl of a huge dog whos not looking for a fight but can always finish one by ripping out your throat and sweeney took the message and sat down and poured himself another glass of whiskey have you remembered how i do my little coin trick he asked shadow with a grin i have not if you can guess how i did it said mad sweeney his lips purple his blue eyes beclouded ill tell you if you get warm its not a palm is it asked shadow it is not is it a gadget of some kind something up your sleeve or elsewhere that shoots the coins up for you to catch it is not that neither more whiskey anybody i read in a book about a way of doing the misers dream with latex covering the palm of your hand making a skincolored pouch for the coins to hide behind this is a sad wake for great sweeney who flew like a bird across all of ireland and ate watercress in his madness to be dead and unmourned save for a bird a dog and an idiot no it is not a pouch well thats pretty much it for ideas said shadow i expect you just take them out of nowhere it was meant to be sarcasm but then he saw the expression on sweeneys face you do he said you do take them from nowhere american gods well not exactly nowhere said mad sweeney but now youre getting the idea you take them from the hoard the hoard said shadow starting to remember yes you just have to hold it in your mind and its yours to take from the suns treasure its there in those moments when the world makes a rainbow its there in the moment of eclipse and the moment of the storm and he showed shadow how to do the thing this time shadow got it shadows head ached and pounded and his tongue tasted and felt like flypaper he squinted at the glare of the daylight he had fallen asleep with his head on the kitchen table he was fully dressed although he had at some point taken off his black tie he walked downstairs to the mortuary and was relieved but unsurprised to see that john doe was still on the embalming table shadow pried the empty bottle of jameson gold from the corpses rigormortised fingers and threw it away he could hear someone moving about in the house above mr wednesday was sitting at the kitchen stable when shadow went upstairs he was eating leftoverpotato salad from a tupperware container with a plastic spoon he wore a dark gray suit a white shirt and a deep gray tie the moming sun glittered on the silver tie pin in the ghape of a tree he smiled at shadow when he saw him ah shadow mboy good to see youre up i thought you were going to sleep forever mad sweeneys dead said shadow so i heard said wednesday a great pity of course it will come to all of us in the end he tugged on an imaginary rope somewhere on the level of his ear and then jerked his neck to one side tongue protruding eyes bulging as quick pantomimes went it was disturbing and then he let go of the rope and smiled his familiar grin would you like some potato salad neil caiman i would not shadow darted a look around the kitchen and out into the hall do you know where ibis and jacquel are indeed i do they are burying mrs lila goodchild something that they would probably have liked your help in doing but i asked them not to wake you you have a long part drive ahead of you t were leaving within the hour i should say goodbye goodbyes are overrated youll see them again i have no doubt before this affair is done for the first time since that first night shadow observed np vbt r the small brown cat was curled up in her basket she opened her incurious amber eyes and watched him go so shadow left the house of the dead ice sheathed the winterblack bushes and trees as if theyd been insulated made into dreams the path was slippery wednesday led the way to shadows white chevy nova parked out on the road it had been recently cleaned and a a i the wisconsin plates had been removed replaced with min v truel nesota plates wednesdays luggage was already stacked in the backseat wednesday unlocked the car with keys that were duplicates of the ones shadow had in his own pocket ill drive said wednesday itll be at least an hour before youre good for anything they drove north the mississippi on their left a wide silver stream beneath a gray sky shadow saw perched on a leafless gray tree beside the road a huge brownandwhite hawk which stared down at them with mad eyes as they drove toward it then took to the wing and rose in slow and powerful circles shadow realized it had only been a temporary reprieve his time in the house of the dead and already it was beginning to feel like something that happened to somebody else a long time ago chapter nine not to mention mythic creatures in the rubble wendy cope a policemans lot as they drove out of illinois late that evening shadow asked wednesday his first question he saw the welcome to wisconsin sign and said so who were the guys that grabbed me in the parking lot mister wood and mister stone who were they the lights of the car illuminated the winter landscape wednesday had announced that they were not to take freeways because he didnt know whose side the freeways were on so shadow was sticking to back roads heidnt mind he wasnt even sure that wednesday was crazy wednesday grunted just spooks members of the opposition black hats jj i think said shadow that they think theyre the white hats of course they do theres never been a true war that wasnt fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right the really dangerous people believe that they are doing whatever they are doing solely and only because it is without question the right thing to do and that is what makes them dangerous and you asked shadow why are you doing what youre doing neil caiman because i want to said wednesday and then he grinned so thats all right shadow said how did you all get away or did you all get away we did said wednesday although it was a close thing if theyd not stopped to grab you they migljt have taken the lot of us it convinced several of the people who had been sitting on the fence that i might not be completely crazy so how did you get out wednesday shook his head i dont pay you to ask questions he said ive told you before shadow shrugged they spent the night in a super motel south of la crosse christmas day was spent on the road driving north and east the farmland became pine forest the towns seemed to come farther and farther apart they ate their christmas lunch late in the afternoon in a halllike family restaurant in northern central wisconsin shadow picked cheerlessly at the dry turkey jamsweet red lumps of cranberry sauce toughaswood roasted potatoes and violently green canned peas from the way he attacked it and the way he smacked his lips wednesday seemed to be enjoying the food as the meal progressed he became positively expansivetalking joking and whenever she came close enough flirting with the waitress a thin blonde girl who looked scarcely old enough to have dropped out of high school excuse me mdear but might i trouble you for another cup of your delightful hot chocolate and i trust you wont think me too forward if i say what a mightily fetching and becoming dress that is festive yet classy the waitress who wore a bright redandgreen skirt edged with glittering silver tinsel giggled and colored and smiled happily and went off to get wednesday another mug of hot chocolate american gods fetching said wednesday thoughtfully watching her go becoming he said shadow did not think he was talking about the dress wednesday shoveled the final slice of turkey into his mouth flicked at his beard with his napkin and pushed his plate forward aaah good he looked around him at the family restaurant in the background a tape of christmas songs was playing the little drummer boy had no gifts to bring parupapompom rapappom pom rapappom pom some things may change said wednesday abruptly people however people stay the same some grifts last forever others are swallowed soon enough by time and by the world my favorite grift of all is no longer practical still a surprising number of grifts are timelessthe spanish prisoner the pigeon drop the fawney rig the fiddle game ive never heard of the fiddle game said shadow i think ive heard of the others my old cellmate said hed actually done the spanish prisoner he was agrifter ah said wednesday and his left eye sparkled the fiddle game was a fine and wonderful coir flf its purest form it is a twoman grift it trades on cupidity and greed as all great grifts do you can always cheat an honest man but it takes more work so we are in a hotel or an inn or a fine restaurant and dining there we find a manshabby but shabby genteel not downatheel but certainly down on his luck we shall call him abraham and when the time comes to settle his billnot a huge bill you understand fifty seventyfive dollarsan embarrassment where is his wallet good lord he must have left it at a friends not far away he shall go and obtain his wallet forthwith but here mine host saysabraham take this old fiddle of mine for security its old as you can see but its how i make my living wednesdays smile when he saw the waitress approaching was huge and predatory ah the hot chocolate brought neil caiman to me by my christmas angel tell me my dear could i have some more of your delicious bread when you get a moment the waitresswhat was she shadow wondered sixteen seventeenlooked at the floor and her cheeks flushed crimson she put down the chocolate with shaking hands and retreated to the edge of the room by the slowly rotating display of pies where she stopped and stared at wednesday then she slipped into the kitchen to fetch wednesday his bread so the violinold unquestionably perhaps even a little batteredis placed away in its case and our temporarily impecunious abraham sets off in search of his wallet but a welldressed gentleman only just done with his own dinner has been observing this exchange and now he approaches our host could he perchance inspect the violin that honest abraham left behind certainly he can our host hands it over and the welldressed manlet us call him barringtonopens his mouth wide then remembers himself and closes it examines the violin reverentially like a man who has been permitted into a holy sanctum to examine the bones of a prophet why he says this isit must beno it cannot bebut yes there it ismy lord but this is unbelievable and he points to the makers mark on a strip of browning paper inside the violinbut still he says even without it he would have known it by the color of the varnish by the scroll by the shape now barrington reaches inside his pocket and produces an engraved business card proclaiming him to be a preeminent dealer in rare and antique musical instruments so this violin is rare asks mine host indeed it is says barrington still admiring it with awe and worth in excess of a hundred thousand dollars unless i miss my guess even as a dealer in such things i would pay fiftyno seventyfive thousand dollars good cash money for such an exquisite american gods piece i have a man on the west coast who would buy it tomorrow sight unseen with one telegram and pay whatever i asked for it and then he consults his watch and his face falls my train he says i have scarcely enough time to catch my train good sir when the owner of this inestimable instrument should return please give him my card for alas i must be away and with that barrington leaves a man who knows that time and the train wait for no man mine host examines the violin curiosity mingling with cupidity in his veins and a plan begins to bubble up through his mind but the minutes go by and abraham does not return and now it is late and through the door shabby but proud comes our abraham our fiddle player ai d he holds in his hands a wallet a wallet that has seen better days a wallet that has never contained more than a hundred dollars on its best day and from it he takes the money to pay for his meal or his stay and he asks for the return of his violin mine host puts the fiddle in its case on the counter and abraham takes it like a mother cradling her child tell me says the host how much is a violin like this worth for my niece has a yearning on her to play the fiddle and its her birthday coming up in a week or so a sell this fiddle says abraham i could never sell her ive had her for twenty years i have fiddled in every state of the union with her and to tell the truth she cost me all of five hundred dollars back when i bought her mine host keeps the smile from his face five hundred dollars what if i were to offer you a thousand dollars for it here and now the fiddle player looks delighted then crestfallen and he says but lordy im a fiddle player sir its all iknow how to do this fiddle knows me and she loves me and my fingers know her so well i could play an air upon her in the neil caiman dark where will i find another that sounds so fine a thousand dollars is good money but this is my livelihood not a thousand dollars not for five thousand mine host sees his profits shrinking but this is business and you must spend money to make money eight thousand dollars he says its not worth that but ive taken a fancy to it and i do love and indulge my niece abraham is almost in tears at the thought of losing his beloved fiddle but how can he say no to eight thousand dollarsespecially when mine host goes to the wall safe and removes not eight but nine thousand dollars all neatly banded and ready to be slipped into the fiddle players threadbare pocket youre a good man he tells his host youre a saint but you must swear to take care of my girl and reluctantly he hands over his violin but what if mine host simply hands over barringtons card and tells abraham that hes come into some good fortune asked shadow then were out the cost of two dinners said wednesday he wiped the remaining gravy and leftovers from his plate with a slice of bread which he ate with lipsmacking relish let me see if ive got it straight said shadow so abraham leaves nine thousand dollars the richer and in the parking lot by the train station he and barrington meet up they split the money get into barringtons model a ford and head for the next town i guess in the trunk of that car they must have a box filled with hundreddollar violins i personally made it a point of honor never to pay more than five dollars for any of them said wednesday then he turned to the hovering waitress now my dear regale us with your description of the sumptuous desserts available to us on this our lords natal day he stared at herit was almost a leeras if nothing that she could offer him would be as toothsome a morsel as herself shadow felt deeply uncomfortable it was like watching an old wolf stalking a american gods fawn too young to know that if it did not run and run now it would wind up in a distant glade with its bones picked clean by the ravens the girl blushed once more and told them that dessert was apple pie a la modethats with a scoop of vanilla ice creamchristmas cake a la mode or a redandgreen whipped pudding wednesday stared into her eyes and told her that he would try the christmas cake a la mode shadow passed now as grifts go said wednesday the fiddle game goes back three hundred years or more and if you pick your chicken correctly you could still play it anywhere in america tomorrow i thought you said that your favorite grift was no longer practical said shadow i did indeed however that is not my favorite no my favorite was one they called the bishop game it had everything excitement subterfuge portability surprise perhaps i think from time to time perhaps with a little modification it might he thought for a moment then shook his head no its time has passed it is let us say in a city of medium to large sizechicago perhaps ornew york or philadelphia we are in a jewelers emporium a man dressed as a clergymanand not just any clergyman but a bishop in his purpleenters and picks oit a necklacea gorgeous and glorious confection of diamonds and pearls and pays for it with a dozen of the crispest hundreddollar bills theres a smudge of green ink on the topmost bill and the store owner apologetically but firmly sends the stack of bills to the bank on the corner to be checked soon enough the store clerk returns with the bills the bank says they are none of them counterfeit the owner apologizes again and the bishop is most gracious he well understands the problem there are such lawless and ungodly types in the world today such immorality and lewdness abroad in the world neil caiman and shameless women and now that the underworld has crawled out of the gutter and come to live on the screens of the picture palaces what more could anyone expect and the necklace is placed in its case and the store owner does his best not to ponder why a bishop of the church would be purchasing a twelvehundreddollar diamond necklace nor why he would be paying good cash money for it the bishop bids him a hearty farewell and walks out on the street only for a heavy hand to descend on his shoulder why soapy yez spalpeen up to your old tricks are you and a broad beat cop with an honest irish face walks the bishop back into the jewelry store beggin your pardon but has this man just bought anything from you asks the cop certainly not says the bishop tell him i have not indeed he has says the jeweler he bought a pearl and diamond necklace from me paid for it in cash as well would you have the bills available sir asks the cop so the jeweler takes the twelve hundreddollar bills from the cash register and hands them to the cop who holds them up to the light and shakes his head in wonder oh soapy soapy he says these are the finest that youve made yet youre a craftsman that you are a selfsatisfied smile spreads across the bishops face you cant prove nothing says the bishop and the bank said that they were on the level its the real green stuff tm sure they did agrees the cop on the beat but i doubt that the bank had been warned that soapy sylvester was in town nor of the quality of the hundreddollar bills hed been passing in denver and in st louis and with that he reaches into the bishops pocket and pulls out the necklace twelve hundred dollars worth of diamonds and pearls in exchange for fifty cents worth of paper and ink says the policeman who is obviously a philosopher at heart and passing yourself off as a man of the church you should be ashamed he says as he claps the handcuffs on the bishop american gods who is obviously no bishop and he marches him away but not before he gives the jeweler a receipt for both the necklace and the twelve hundred counterfeit dollars its evidence after all was it really counterfeit asked shadow of course not fresh banknotes straight from the bank only with a thumbprint and a smudge of green ink on a couple of them to make them a little more interesting shadow sipped his coffee it was worse than prison coffee so the cop was obviously no cop and the necklace evidence said wednesday he unscrewed the top from the salt shaker poured a little heap of salt on the table but the jeweler gets a receipt and assurance that hell get the necklace straight back as soon as soapy conies to trial he is congratulated on being a good citizen and he watches proudly already thinking of the tale hell have to tell at the next meeting of the oddfellows tomorrow night as the policeman marches the man pretending to be a bishop out of the store twelvehundreddollars in one pocket a twelve hundred dollar diamond necklace in the other on their way to a police station thatll never see hide nor hau of either of them the waitress had returned to clear the table tell me my dear said wednesday are you married she shook her head astonishing that a young lady of such loveliness has not yet been snapped up he was doodling with his fingernail in the spilled salt making squat blocky runelike shapes the waitress stood passively beside him reminding shadow less of a fawn and more of a young rabbit caught in an eighteenwheelers headlights frozen in fear and indecision wednesday lowered his voice so much so that shadow only across the table could barely hear him what time do you get off work nine she said and swallowed ninethirty latest and what is the finest motel in this area neil caiman theres a motel she said its not much wednesday touched the back of her hand fleetingly with the tips of his fingers leaving crumbs of salt on her skin she made no attempt to wipe them off to us he said his voice an almost inaudible rumble it shall be a pleasure palace the waitress looked at him she bit her thin lips hesitated then nodded and fled for the kitchen cmon said shadow she looks barely legal ive never been overly concerned about legality wednesday told him and i need her not as an end in herself but to wake me up a little even king david knew that there is one easy prescription to get warm blood flowing through an old frame take one virgin call me in the morning shadow caught himself wondering if the girl on night duty in the hotel back in eagle point had been a virgin dont you ever worry about disease he asked what if you knock her up what if shes got a brother no said wednesday i dont worry about diseases i dont catch them unfortunatelyfor the most partpeople like me fire blanks so theres not a great deal of interbreeding it used to happen in the old days nowadays its possible but so unlikely as to be almost unimaginable so no worries there and many girls have brothers and fathers its not my problem ninetynine times out of a hundred ive left town already so were staying here for the night wednesday rubbed his chin i shall stay in the motel he said then he put his hand into his coat pocket he pulled out a front door key bronzecolored with a card tag attached on which was typed an address northridge rd apt you on the other hand have an apartment waiting for you in a city far from here wednesday closed his eyes for a moment then he opened them gray and gleaming and fractionally mismatched and he said the greyhound american gods bus will be coming through town in twenty minutes it stops at the gas station heres your ticket he pulled out a folded bus ticket passed it across the table shadow picked it up and looked at it whos mike ainsel he asked that was the name on the ticket you are merry christmas and wheres lakeside your happy home in the months to come and now because good things come in direes he took a small giftwrapped package from his pocket pushed it across the table it sat beside the ketchup bottle with the black smears of dried ketchup on the top shadow made no move to take it well reluctantly shadow tore open the red wrapping paper to reveal a fawncolored calfskin wallet shiny from use it was obviously somebodys wallet inside the wallet was a drivers license with shadows photograph on it in the name of michael ainsel with a milwaukee address a mastercard for m ainsel and twenty crisp ftydollar bills shadow closed the wallet put it into an inside pocket thanks he said think of it as a christmas bonus now let me walk you down to the greyhound i shall wave to you as you ride the gray dog north j they walked outside the restaurant shadow found it hard to believe how much colder it had gotten in the last few hours it felt too cold to snow now aggressively cold this was a bad winter hey wednesday both of the scams you were telling me aboutthe violin scam and the bishop one the bishop and the cop he hesitated trying to form his thought to bring it into focus what of them then he had it theyre both twoman scams one guy on each side did you used to have a partner shadows neil caiman breath came in clouds he promised himself that when he got to lakeside he would spend some of his christmas bonus on the warmest thickest winter coat that money could buy yes said wednesday yes i had a partner a junior partner but alas those days are gone theres the as station and there unless my eye deceives me is the bus it was already signaling its turn into the parking lot your address is on the key said wednesday if anyone asks i am your uncle and i shall be rejoicing in the unlikely name of emerson borson settle in in lakeside nephew ainsel ill come for you within the week we shall be traveling together visiting the people i have to visit in the meantime keep your head down and stay out of trouble my car said shadow ill take good care of it have a good time in lakeside said wednesday he thrust out his hand and shadow shook it wednesdays hand was colder than a corpses jesus said shadow youre cold then the sooner i am making the twobacked beast with the little hotsytotsy lass from die restaurant in a back room of the motel the better and he reached out his other hand and squeezed shadows shoulder shadow experienced a dizzying moment of double vision he saw the grizzled man facing him squeezing his shoulder but he saw something else so many winters hundreds and hundreds of winters and a gray man in a broadbrimmed hat walking from settlement to settlement leaning on his staff staring in tiirough windows at the firelight and a joy and a burning life he would never be able to touch never even be able to feel go said wednesday his voice a reassuring growl all is well and all is well and all shall be well shadow showed his ticket to the driver hell of a day to be traveling she said and then she added with a certain grim satisfaction merry christmas american gods the bus was almost empty when will we get into lakeside asked shadow two hours maybe a bit more said the driver they say theres a cold snap coming she thumbed a switch and the doors closed with a hiss and a mump shadow walked halfway down the bus put the seat back as far as it would go and he started to think the motion of the bus and the warmth combined to lull him and before he was aware that he was becoming sleepy he was asleep in the earth and under die earth the marks on the wall were the red of wet clay handprints fingermarks and here and there crude representations of animals and people and birds the fire still burned and the buffalo man still sat on the other side of the fire staring at shadow with huge eyes eyes like pools of dark mud the buffalo lips fringed with matted brown hair did not move as the buffalo voice said well shadow do you believe yet i dont know said shadow his mouth had not moved either he observed whatever words were passing between the two of them were not being spoken not iirsfiy way that shadow understood speech are you real believe said the buffalo man are you shadow hesitated and thenjne asked are you a god too the buffalo man reached one hand into die flames of the fire and he pulled out a burning brand he held the brand in the middle blue and yellow flames licked his red hand but they did not burn this is not a land for gods said the buffalo man but it was not the buffalo man talking anymore shadow knew in his dream it was the fire speaking the crackling and the burning of the flame itself that spoke to shadow in the dark place under the earth this land was brought up from the depths of the ocean neil caiman by a diver said the fire it was spun from its own substance by a spider it was shat by a raven it is the body of a fallen father whose bones are mountains whose eyes are lakes this is a land of dreams and fire said the flame the buffalo man put the brand back on the fire t why are you telling me this stuff said shadow im not important im not anything i was an okay physical trainer a really lousy smalltime crook and maybe not so good a husband as i thought i was he trailed off how do i help laura shadow asked the buffalo man she wants to be alive again i said id help her i owe her that the buffalo man said nothing he pointed up toward the roof of the cave shadows eyes followed there was a thin wintery light coming from a tiny opening far above up there asked shadow wishing that one of his questions would be answered im supposed to go up there the dream took him then the idea becoming the thing itself and shadow was crushed into the rock and earth he was like a mole trying to push through the earth like a badger climbing through the earth like a groundhog pushing the earth out of his way like a bear but the earth was too hard too dense and his breath was coming in gasps and soon he could go no farther dig and climb no more and he knew then that he would die somewhere in the deep place beneath the world his own strength was not enough his efforts became weaker he knew that though his body was riding in a hot bus through cold woods if he stopped breathing here beneath the world he would stop breathing there as well that even now his breath was coming in shallow panting gasps he struggled and he pushed ever more weakly each movement using precious air he was trapped could go no farther and could not return the way that he had come now bargain said a voice in his mind american gods what do i have to bargain with shadow asked i have nothing he could taste the clay now thick and mudgritty in his mouth and then shadow said except myself i have myself dont i it seemed as if everything was holding its breath i offer myself he said the response was immediate the rocks and the earth that had surrounded him began to push down on shadow squeezed him so hard that the last ounce of air in his lungs was crushed out of him the pressure became pain pushing him on every side he reached the zenith of pain and hung there cresting knowing that he could take no more at that moment the spasm eased and shadow could breathe again the light above him had grown larger he was being pushed toward the surface as the next earthspasm hit shadow tried to ride with it this time he felt himself being pushed upward the pain on that last awful contraction was impossible to believe as he felt himself being squeezed crushed and pushed through an unyielding rock gap his bones shattering his flesh becoming something shapeless ftsfhis mouth and ruined head cleared the hole he began to scream in fear and pain he wondered as he screamed whether bck in the waking world he was also screamingif he was screaming in his sleep back on the darkened bus and as that final spasm ended shadow was on the ground his fingers clutching the red earth he pulled himself into a sitting position wiped the earth from his face with his hand and looked up at the sky it was twilight a long purple twilight and the stars were coming out one by one stars so much brighter and more vivid than any stars he had ever seen or imagined soon said the crackling voice of the flame coming from behind him they will fall soon they will fall and the neil caiman star people will meet the earth people there will be heroes among them and men who will slay monsters and bring knowledge but none of them will be gods this is a poor place for gods a blast of air shocking in its coldness touched his face it was like being doused in ice water he could hear thg drivers voice saying that they were in pinewood anyone who needs a cigarette or wants to stretch their legs well be stopping here for ten minutes then well be back on the road shadow stumbled off the bus they were parked outside another rural gas station almost identical to the one they had left the driver was helping a couple of teenage girls onto the bus putting their suitcases away in the luggage compartment hey the driver said when she saw shadow youre getting off at lakeside right shadow agreed sleepily that he was heck thats a good town said the bus driver i think sometimes that if i were just going to pack it all in id move to lakeside prettiest town ive ever seen youve lived there long my first visit you have a pasty at mabels for me you hear shadow decided not to ask for clarification tell me said shadow was i talking in my sleep if you were i didnt hear you she looked at her watch back on the bus ill call you when we get to lakeside the two girlshe doubted that either of them was much more than fourteen years oldwho had got on in pinewood were now in the seat in front of him they were friends shadow decided eavesdropping without meaning to not sisters one of them knew almost nothing about sex but knew a lot about animals helped out or spent a lot of time at some kind of animal shelter while the other was not interested in animals but armed with a hundred tidbits gleaned american gods from the internet and from daytime television thought she knew a great deal about human sexuality shadow listened with a horrified and amused fascination to the one who thought she was wise in the ways of the world detail the precise mechanics of using alkaseltzer tablets to enhance oral sex shadow started to tune them out blanked everything except the noise of the road and now only fragments of conversation would come back every now and again goldie is like such a good dog and he was a purebred retriever if only my dad would say okay he wags his tail whenever he sees me its christmas he has to let me use the snowmobile you can write your name with your tongue on the side of his thing i miss sandy yeah i miss sandy too six inches tonight they said but they just make it up they make up the weather and nobody ever calls them on it and then the brakes of the bus were hissing and the driver was shouting lakeside and the doors ducked open shadow followed the girls out into the floodlit parking lot of a video store and tanning salon that functioned shadow guessed as lakesides greyhound station the air was dreadfully cold but it was a fresh cold it vjpke him up he stared at the lights of the town to the south and the west and pale expanse of a frozen lake to the east the girls were standing in the lot stamping and blowing on their hands dramatically one of them the younger one snuck a look at shadow smiled awkwardly when she realized that he had seen her do so merry christmas said shadow yeah said the other girl perhaps a year or so older than the first merry christmas to you too she had carroty red hair and a snub nose covered with a hundred thousand freckles neil caiman nice town you got here said shadow we like it said the younger one she was the one who liked animals she gave shadow a shy grin revealing blue rubberband braces stretching across her front teeth you look like somebody she told him gravely are you somebodys brother or somebodys son or something you are such a spaz alison said her friend everybodys somebodys son or brother or something that wasnt what i meant said alison headlights framed them all for one brilliant white moment behind the headlights was a station wagon with a mother in it and in moments it took the girls and their bags away leaving shadow standing alone in the parking lot young man anything i can do for you the old man was locking up the video store he pocketed his keys store aint open christmas he told shadow cheerfully but i come down to meet the bus make sure everything was okay couldnt live with myself if some poor sould found emselves stranded on christmas day he was close enough that shadow could see his face old but contented the face of a man who had sipped lifes vinegar and found it by and large to be mostly whiskey and good whiskey at that well you could give me the number of the local taxi company said shadow i could said the old man doubtfully but tom be in his bed this time of night and even if you could rouse him youll get no satisfactioni saw him down at the buck stops here earlier this evening and he was very merry very merry indeed where is it youre aiming to go shadow showed him the address tag on the door key well he said thats a ten mebbe a twentyminute walk over the bridge and around but its no fun when its this cold and when you dont know where youre going it always seems longeryou ever notice that first time takes forever and then ever after its over in a flash american gods yes said shadow ive never thought of it like that but i guess its true the old man nodded his face cracked into a grin what the heck its christmas ill run you over there in tessie shadow followed the old man to the road where a huge old roadster was parked it looked like something that gangsters might have been proud to drive in the roaring twenties running boards and all it was a deep dark color under the sodium lights that might have been red and might have been green this is tessie the old man said aint she a beaut he patted her proprietorially where the hood curved up and arched over the front nearside wheel what make is she asked shadow shes a wendt phoenix wendt went under in name was bought by chrysler but they never made any more wendts harvey wendt who founded the company was a local boy went out to california killed himself in oh great tragedy the car smelled of leather and old cigarette smokenot a fresh smell but as if enough people had smoked enough cigarettes and cigars in the car over the years thauthe smell of burning tobacco had become part of the fabric of the car the old man turned the key in the ignition and tessie started first time y tomorrow he told shadow she goes irao the garage ill cover her with a dust sheet and thats where shell stay until spring truth of the matter is i shouldnt be driving her right now with the snow on the ground doesnt she ride well in snow rides just fine its the salt they put on the roads rusts these old beauties faster than you could believe you want to go door to door or would you like the moonlight grand tour of the town i dont want to trouble you its no trouble you get to be my age youre grateful for the least wink of sleep im lucky if i get five hours a night neil caiman nowadayswake up and my mind is just turning and turning where are my manners my names hinzelmann id say call me richie but around here folks who know me just call me plain hinzelmann id shake your hand but i need two hands to drive tessie she knows when im not paying attention mike ainsel said shadow pleased to meet you hinzelmann so well go around the lake grand tour said hinzelmann main street which they were on was a pretty street even at night and it looked oldfashioned in the best sense of the wordas if for a hundred years people had been caring for that street and they had not been in a hurry to lose anything they liked hinzelmann pointed out the towns two restaurants as they passed them he pointed out the bakery and the bookstore he slowed tessie as they passed the library so shadow could get a good look at it antique gaslights flickered over the doorwayhinzelmann proudly called shadows attention to them built in the s by john henning local lumber baron he wanted it called the henning memorial library but when he died they started calling it the lakeside library and i guess itll be the lakeside library now until the end of time isnt it a dream he couldnt have been prouder of it if he had built it himself the building reminded shadow of a castle and he said so thats right agreed hinzelmann turrets and all henning wanted it to look like that on the outside inside they still have all the original pine shelving miriam shultz wants to tear the insides out and modernize but its american gods on some register of historic places and theres not a damn thing she can do they drove around the south side of the lake the town circled die lake which was a thirtyfoot drop below the level of the road shadow could see the patches of white ice dulling the surface of the lake with here and there a shiny patch of water reflecting the lights of the town looks like its freezing over he said its been frozen over for a month now said hinzelmann the dull spots are snowdrifts and die shiny spots are ice it froze just after thanksgiving in one cold night froze smooth as glass you do much icefishing mr ainsel never best thing a man can do its not the fish you catch its the peace of mind that you take home at the end of the day ill remember that shadow peered down at die lake through tessies window can you actually walk on it already you can walk on it drive on it too but i wouldnt want to risk it yet its been cold up here for six weeks said hinzelmann but you also got to allow tiiat things freeze harder and faster up here in northern wisconsin than they do most anyplace else there is i was outvhunting once hunting for deer and this was oh thirty forty years back and i shot at a buck missed him and sent hjjm running off through the woodsthis was over acrost the north end of die lake up near where youll be living mike now he was the finest buck i ever did see twenty point big as a small horse no lie now im younger and feistier back then dian i am now and though it had started snowing before halloween that year now it was thanksgiving and diere was clean snow on the ground fresh as anything and i could see the bucks footprints it looked to me like the big fellow was heading for the lake in a panic well only a damn fool tries to run down a buck but neil caiman there am i a damn fool running after him and there he is standing in the lake in oh eight nine inches of water and hes just looking at me that very moment the sun goes behind a cloud and the freeze comestemperature must have fallen thirty degrees in ten minutes not a word of a lie and that old stag he gets ready to run and he cant movet hes frozen into the ice me i just walk over to him slowly you can see he wants to run but hes iced in and it just isnt going to happen but theres no way i can bring myself to shoot a defenseless critter when he cant get awaywhat kind of man would i be if i done that heh so i takes my shotgun and i fires off one shell straight up into the air well the noise and the shock is enough to make that buck just about jump out of his skin and seein that his legs are iced in thats just what he proceeds to do he leaves his hide and his antlers stuck to the ice while he charges back into the woods pink as a newborn mouse and shivering fit to bust i felt bad enough for that old buck that i talked the lakeside ladies knitting circle into making him something warm to wear all the winter and they knitted him an allover onepiece woolen suit so he wouldnt freeze to death course the joke was on us because they knitted him a suit of bright orange wool so no hunter ever shot at it hunters in these parts wear orange at hunting season he added helpfully and if you think theres a word of a lie in that i can prove it to you ive got the antlers up on my rec room wall to this day shadow laughed and the old man smiled the satisfied smile of a master craftsman they pulled up outside a brick building with a large wooden deck from which golden holiday lights hung and twinkled invitingly thats fiveohtwo said hinzelmann apartment three would be on the top floor around the other side overlooking the lake there you go mike american gods thank you mr hinzelmann can i give you anything toward gas just hinzelmann and you dont owe me a penny merry christmas from me and from tessie are you sure you wont accept anything the old man scratched his chin tell you what he said sometime in the next week or so ill come by and sell you some tickets for our raffle charity for now young man you can be getting onto bed shadow smiled merry christmas hinzelmann he said the old man shook shadows hand with one redknuckled hand it felt as hard and as callused as an oak branch now you watch the path as you go up there its going to be slippery i can see your door from here at the side there see it ill just wait in the car down here until youre safely inside you just give me the thumbsup when youre in okay and ill drive off he kept the wendt idling until shadow was safely up the wooden steps on the side of the house and had opened the apartment door with his key the door to the apartment swung open shadow made a thumbsup sign and the old man in the wendttessie thought shadow and the thought of a car with a name made him smile one more timehinzelmann and tessie swung around and made their way back across the bridge j shadow shut the front door the room was freezing it smelled of people who had gone away to live other lives and of all they had eaten and dreamed he found the thermostat and cranked it up to seventy degrees he went into the tiny kitchen checked the drawers opened the avocadocolored refrigerator but it was empty no surprise there at least the fridge smelled clean inside not musty there was a small bedroom with a bare mattress in it beside the kitchen next to an even tinier bathroom that was mostly shower stall an aged cigarette butt sat in the toilet bowl staining the water brown shadow flushed it away neil caiman he found sheets and blankets in a closet and made the bed then he took off his shoes his jacket and his watch and he climbed into the bed fully dressed wondering how long it would take him to get warm the lights were off and there was silence mostly nothing but the hum of the refrigerator and somewhere in the building a radio playing he lay there in the darkness wondering if he had slept himself out on the greyhound if the hunger and the cold and the new bed and the craziness of the last few weeks would combine to keep him awake that night in the stillness he heard something snap like a shot a branch he thought or the ice it was freezing out there he wondered how long he would have to wait until wednesday came for him a day a week however long he had he knew he had to focus on something in the meantime he would start to work out again he decided and practice his coin sleights and palms until he was smooth as anything but this was a good town he could feel it he thought of his dream if it had been a dream that first night in cairo he thought of zorya what the hell was her name the midnight sister and then he thought of laura it was as if thinking of her opened a window in his mind he could see her he could somehow see her she was in eagle point in the backyard outside her mothers big house she stood in the cold which she did not feel anymore or which she felt all the time she stood outside the house that her mother had bought in with the insurance money american gods after lauras father harvey mccabe had passed on a heart attack while straining on the can and she was staring in her cold hands pressed against the glass her breath not fogging it not at all watching her mother and her sister and her sisters children and husband in from texas home for christmas out in the darkness that was where laura was unable not to look tears prickled in shadows eyes and he rolled over in his bed he felt like a peeping tomturned his thoughts away willed them to come back to him he could see the lake spread out below him as the wind blew down from the arctic prying jackfrost fingers a hundred times colder than the fingers of any corpse shadows breath came shallowly now he could hear a wind rising a bitter screaming around the house and for a moment he thought he could hear words on the wind if he was going to be anywhere he might as well be here he thought and then he slept meanwhile a conversation v dingdong mizcrow yes miz samantha black crow yes do you mind if we ask you a few questions maam are you cops what are you my name is town my

i lie about my past so send me off to bed for evermore tom waits tango till theyre sore a whole life in darkness surrounded by filth that was what shadow dreamed his first night in lakeside a childs life long ago and far away in a land across the ocean in the lands where the sun rose but this life contained no sunrises only dimness by day and blindness by night nobody spoke to him he heard human voices from outside but could understand human speech no better than he understood the howling of the owls or the yelps of dogs he remembered or thought he remembered one night half a lifetime ago when one of the big people had entered quietly and had not cuffed him or fed him but had picked him up to her breast and embraced him she smelled good hot drops of water had fallen from her face to his he had been scared and had wailed loudly in his fear she put him down on the straw hurriedly and left the hut fastening the door behind her he remembered that moment and he treasured it just as he remembered the sweetness of a cabbage heart the tart taste of plums the crunch of apples the greasy delight of roastedfish american gods and now he saw the faces in the firelight all of them looking at him as he was led out from the hut for the first time which was the only time so that was what people looked like raised in darkness he had never seen faces everything was so new so strange the bonfire light hurt his eyes they pulled on the rope around his neck to lead him to the place where the man waited for him and when the first blade was raised in the firelight what a cheer went up from the crowd the child from the darkness began to laugh with them in delight and in freedom and then the blade came down shadow opened his eyes and realized that he was hungry and cold in an apartment with a layer of ice clouding the inside of the window glass his frozen breath he thought he got out of bed pleased he did not have to get dressed he scraped at a window with a fingernail as he passed felt the ice collect under the nail then melt to water he tried to remember his dream but remembered nothing but misery and darkness he put on his shoes he figured he would walk into the town center walk across the bridge across thenbrthern end of the lake if he had the geography of thetown right he put on his thin jacket remembering his promise to himself that he would buy himself a warm winter coat opened the apartment door and stepped out onto the wooden deck the cold took his breath away he breathed in and felt every hair in his nostrils freeze into rigidity the deck gave him a fine view of the lake irregular patches of gray surrounded by an expanse of white the cold snap had come that was for sure it could not be much above zero and it would not be a pleasant walk but he was certain he could make it into town without too much trouble what did hinzelmann say last night tenminute walk and shadow was a big man he would walk briskly and keep himself warm neil caiman he set off south heading for the bridge soon he began to cough a dry thin cough as the bitterly cold air touched his lungs soon his ears and face and lips hurt and then his feet hurt he thrust his ungloved hands deep into his coat pockets clenched his fingers together trying to find some warmth he found himself remembering low key lyesmiths tall tales of the minnesota winters particularly the one about a hunter treed by a bear during a hard freeze who took out his dick and pissed an arching yellow stream of steaming urine that was already frozen hard before it hit the ground then slid down the rockhard frozenpisspole to freedom a wry smile at the memory and another dry painful cough step after step after step he glanced back the apartment building was not as far away as he had expected this walk he decided was a mistake but he was already three or four minutes from the apartment and the bridge over the lake was in sight it made as much sense to press on as to go home he kept walking revising his estimates of the temperature downward as he walked minus ten minus twenty minus forty maybe that strange point on the thermometer when celsius and fahrenheit say the same thing probably not that cold but then there was wind chill and the wind was now hard and steady and continuous blowing over the lake coming down from the arctic across canada he remembered enviously the chemical hand and footwarmers he wished he had them now ten more minutes of walking he guessed and the bridge seemed to be no nearer he was too cold to shiver his eyes hurt this was not simply cold this was science fiction this was a story set on the dark side of mercury back when they thought mercury had a dark side this was somewhere out on rocky pluto where the sun is just another star shin americangods ing only a little more brightly in the darkness this thought shadow is just a hair away from the places where air comes in buckets and pours just like beer the occasional cars that roared past him seemed unreal spaceships little freezedried packages of metal and glass inhabited by people dressed more warmly than he was an old song his mother had loved walking in a winter wonderland began to run through his head and he hummed it through closed lips kept pace to it as he walked he had lost all sensation in his feet he looked down at his black leather shoes at the thin cotton socks and began seriously to worry about frostbite this was beyond a joke this had moved beyond foolishness slipped over the line into genuine twentyfourkarat jesuschristiscrewedupbigtime territory his clothes might as well have been netting or lace the wind blew through him froze his bones and the marrow in his bones froze the lashes of his eyes froze the warm place under his balls which were retreating into his pelvic cavity keep walking he told himself keep walking i can stop and drink a pail of air when i get home a beatles song started in his head and he adjusted his pace tonflatch it it was only when he got to the chorus that he realized that he was humming help he was almost at the bridge now then ha had to walk across it and he would still be another ten minutes from the stores on the west of the lakemaybe a little more a dark car passed him stopped then reversed in a foggy cloud of exhaust smoke and came to a halt beside him a window slid down and the haze and steam from the window mixed with the exhaust to form a dragons breath mat surrounded the car everything okay here said a cop inside shadows first automatic instinct was to say yup everythings just fine andjimdandy thank you officer but it was too late for that and he started to say i think im freezing i was walking into lakeside to buy food and clothes but i neil caiman underestimated the length of the walkhe was that far through the sentence in his head when he realized that all that had come out was fffreezing and a chattering noise and he said so ssorry cold sorry the cop pulled open the back door of the car and said you get in there this moment and warm yourself up okay shadow climbed in gratefully and he sat in the back and rubbed his hands together trying not to worry about frostbitten toes the cop got back in the drivers seat shadow stared at him through the metal grille shadow tried not to think about the last time hed been in the back of a police car or to notice that there were no door handles in the back and to concentrate instead on rubbing life back into his hands his face hurt and his red fingers hurt and now in the warmth his toes were starting to hurt once more that was shadow figured a good sign the cop put the car in drive and moved off you know that was he said not turning to look at shadow just talking a little louder if youll pardon me saying so a real stupid thing to do you didnt hear any of the weather advisories its minus thirty out there god alone knows what the windchill is minus sixty minus seventy although i figure when youre down at minus thirty windchills the least of your worries thanks said shadow thanks for stopping very very grateful woman in rhinelander went out this morning to fill her birdfeeder in her robe and carpet slippers and she froze literally froze to the sidewalk shes in intensive care now it was on the tv this morning youre new in town it was almost a question but the man knew the answer already i came in on the greyhound last night figured today id buy myself some warm clothes food and a car wasnt expecting this cold yeah said the cop it took me by surprise as well i american gods was too busy worrying about global warming im chad mulligan im the chief of police here in lakeside mike ainsel hi mike feeling any better a little yes so where would you like me to take you first shadow put his hands down to the hotair stream painful on his fingers then he pulled them away let it happen in its own time can you just drop me off in the town center wouldnt hear of it long as you dont need me to drive a getaway car for your bank robbery ill happily take you wherever you need to go think of it as the town welcome wagon where would you suggest we start you only moved in last night thats right you eaten breakfast yet not yet well that seems like a heck of a good starting place to me said mulligan they were over the bridge now and enterinjphe northwest side of the town this is main street said mulligan and this he said crossing main street and turning right is the town square even in the winter the town square was ijnpressive but shadow knew that this place was meant to be seen in summer it would be a riot of color of poppies and irises and flowers of every kind and the clump of birch trees in one corner would be a green and silver bower now it was colorless beautiful in a skeletal way the bandshell empty the fountain turned off for the winter the brownstone city hall capped by white snow and this concluded chad mulligan bringing the car to a stop outside a high glassfronted old building on the west of the square is mabels neil caiman he got out of the car opened the passenger door for shadow the two men put their heads down against the cold and the wind and hurried across the sidewalk and into a warm room fragrant with the smells of newbaked bread of pastry and soup and bacon the place was almost empty mulligan sat dowfa at a table and shadow sat opposite him he suspected that mulligan was doing this to get a feel for the stranger in town then again the police chief might simply be what he appeared friendly helpful good a woman bustled over to their table not fat but big a big woman in her sixties her hair bottlebronze hello chad she said youll want a hot chocolate while youre thinking she handed them two laminated menus no cream on the top though he agreed mabel knows me too well he said to shadow whatll it be pal hot chocolate sounds great said shadow and im happy to have the whipped cream on the top thats good said mabel live dangerously hon are you going to introduce me chad is this young man a new officer not yet said chad mulligan with a flash of white teeth this is mike ainsel he moved to lakeside last night now if youll excuse me he got up walked to the back of the room through the door marked pointers it was next to a door marked setters youre the new man in the apartment up on northridge road the old pilsen place oh yes she said happily i know just who you are hinzelmann was by this morning for his morning pasty he told me all about you you boys only having hot chocolate or you want to look at the breakfast menu breakfast for me said shadow whats good everythings good said mabel i make it but this is the farthest south and east of the yoopie you can get pasties american gods and they are particularly good warming and filling too my speciality shadow had no idea what a pasty was but he said that would be fine and in a few moments mabel returned with a plate with what looked like a foldedover pie on it the lower half was wrapped in a paper napkin shadow picked it up with the napkin and bit into it it was warm and filled with meat potatoes carrots onions first pasty ive ever had he said its real good theyre a yoopie thing she told him mostly you need to be at least up ironwood way to get one the cornish men who came over to work the iron mines brought them over yoopie upper peninsula up yoopie its the little chunk of michigan to the northeast the chief of police came back he picked up the hot chocolate and slurped it mabel he said are you forcing this nice young man to eat one of your pasties its good said shadow it was too a savory delight wrapped in hot pastry they go straight to the belly said chad mulligan patting his own stomach i warn you okay s ryou need a car with his parka off he was revealed as a lanky man with a round applebelly gut on him he looked harassed and competent more like an engineer than a op shadow nodded mouth full right i made some calls justin liebowitzs selling his jeep wants four thousand dollars for it will settle for three the gunthers have had their toyota runner for sale for eight months ugly sonofabitch but at this point theyd probably pay you to take it out of their driveway and if you dont care about ugly its got to be a great deal i used the phone in the mens room left a message for missy gunther down at lakeside realty but she wasnt in yet probably getting her hair done down at sheilas the pasty remained good as shadow chewed his way neil caiman through it it was astonishingly filling sticktoyourribs food as his mother would have said sticks to your sides so said chief of police chad mulligan wiping the hotchocolate foam from around his lips i figure we stop off next at hennings farm and home supplies get you a real winter wardrobe swing by daves finest food so you can fill your larder then ill drop you up by lakeside realty if you can put down a thousand up front for the car theyll be happy otherwise five hundred a month for four months should see them okay its an ugly car like i said but if the kid hadnt painted it purple itd be a tenthousanddollar car and reliable and youll need something like that to get around this winter you ask me this is very good of you said shadow but shouldnt you be out catching criminals not helping newcomers not that im complaining you understand mabel chuckled we all tell him that she said mulligan shrugged its a good town he said simply not much trouble youll always get someone speeding within city limitswhich is a good thing as traffic tickets pay my wages friday saturday nights you get some jerk who gets drunk and beats on a spouseand that one can go both ways believe me men and women but out here things are quiet they call me out when someones locked their keys in their vehicle barking dogs every year theres a couple of high school kids caught with weed behind the bleachers biggest police case weve had here in five years was when dan schwartz got drunk and shot up his own trailer then he went on the run down main street in his wheelchair waving this darn shotgun shouting that he would shoot anyone who got in his way that no one would stop him from getting to the interstate i think he was on his way to washington to shoot the president i still laugh whenever i think of dan heading down the interstate in that wheelchair of his with the bumper sticker on the back my american gods juvenile delinquent is screwing your honor student you remember mabel she nodded lips pursed she did not seem to find it as funny as mulligan did what did you do asked shadow i talked to him he gave me the shotgun slept it off down at the jail dans not a bad guy he was just drunk and upset shadow paid for his own breakfast and over chad mulligans halfhearted protests both hot chocolates hennings farm and home supplies was a warehousesized building on the south of the town that sold everything from tractors to toys the store was bustling with postchristmas shoppers shadow recognized the younger of the girls who had sat in front of him on the bus she was trailing after her parents he waved at her and she gave him a hesitant bluerubberbanded smile shadow wondered idly what shed look like in ten years time probably as beautiful as the girl at the hennings farm and home checkout counter who scanned in hispurchases with a chattering handheld gun capable shaded had no doubt of ringing up a tractor if someone drove it through ten pairs of long underwear said the girl stocking up huh she looked like a movie starlet d shadow felt fourteen again and tonguetiea and foolish he said nothing while she rang up the thermal boots the gloves the sweaters and the goosedownfilled coat he had no wish to put the credit card that wednesday had given him to the test not with chief of police mulligan standing helpfully beside him so he paid for everything in cash then he took his bags into the mens rest room came out wearing many of his purchases looking good big fella said mulligan at least im warm said shadow and outside in the parking lot although the wind burned cold on the skin of neil caiman his face the rest of him was warm enough at mulligans invitation he put his shopping bags in the back of the police car arid rode in the passenger seat in the front so what do you do mister ainsel asked the chief of police big guy like you whats your profession and will you be practicing it in lakeside fc shadows heart began to pound but his voice was steady i work for my uncle he buys and sells stuff all over the country i just do the heavy lifting does he pay well im family he knows im not going to rip him off and im learning a little about the trade on the way until i figure out what it is i really want to do it was coming out of him with conviction smooth as a snake he knew everything about big mike ainsel in that moment and he liked mike ainsel mike ainsel had none of the problems that shadow had ainsel had never been married mike ainsel had never been interrogated on a freight train by mr wood and mr stone televisions did not speak to mike ainsel mike ainsel didnt have bad dreams or believe that there was a storm coming he filled his shopping basket at daves finest food doing what he thought of as a gasstation stopmilk eggs bread apples cheese cookies just some food hed do a real one later as shadow moved around chad mulligan said hello to people and introduced shadow to them this is mike ainsel hes taken the empty apartment at the old pilsen place up around the back hed say shadow gave up trying to remember names he just shook hands with people and smiled sweating a little uncomfortable in his insulated layers in the hot store chad mulligan drove shadow across the street to lakeside realty missy gunther her hair freshly set and lacquered did not need an introductionshe knew exactly who mike ainsel was why that nice mr borson his uncle american gods emerson such a nice man hed been by what about six eight weeks ago now and rented the apartment up at the old pilsen place and wasnt the view just to die for up there well honey just wait until the spring and were so lucky so many of the lakes in this part of the world go bright green from the algae in the summer it would turn your stomach but our lake well come fourth of july you could still practically drink it and mr borson had paid for a whole years lease in advance and as for the toyota runner she couldnt believe that chad mulligan still remembered it and yes shed be delighted to get rid of it tell the truth shed pretty much resigned herself to giving it to hinzelmann as this years klunker and just taking the tax writeoff not that the car was a klunker far from it no it was her sons car before he went to school in green bay and well hed painted it purple one day and haha she certainly hoped that mike ainsel liked purple that was all she had to say and if he didnt she wouldnt blame him chief of police mulligan excused himself near the middle of this litany looks like they need me back at the office good meeting you mike he said and he moved shadows shopping bags into the back of missyђhmthers station wagon missy drove shadow back to her placewhere in the drive he saw an elderly suv the blown snow had bleached half of it to a blinding white while the rest of it was painted the kind of drippy purple that someone would need to be very stoned very often to even begin to be able to find attractive still the car started up on the first try and the heater worked although it took almost ten minutes of running the engine with the heater on full before the interior of the car changed from unbearably cold to merely chilly while this was happening missy gunther took shadow into her kitchenexcuse the mess but the little ones just leave their toys all over after christmas and she just didnt have the neil caiman heart would he care for some leftover turkey dinner well coffee then wont take a moment to brew a fresh potand shadow took a large red toy car off a window seat and sat down while missy gunther asked if he had met his neighbors yet and shadow confessed that he hadnt there were he was informed while the coffee djipped four other inhabitants of his apartment buildingback when it was the pilsen place the pilsens lived in the downstairs flat and rented out the upper two flats now their apartment which was taken by a couple of young men mr holz and mr neiman they actually are a couple and when she said couple mr ainsel heavens we have all kinds here more than one kind of tree in the forest although mostly those kind of people wind up in madison or the twin cities but truth to tell nobody here gives it a second thought theyre in key west for the winter theyll be back in april hell meet them then the thing about lakeside is that its a good town now next door to mr ainsel thats marguerite olsen and her little boy a sweet lady sweet sweet lady but shes had a hard life still sweet as pie and she works for the lakeside news not the most exciting newspaper in the world but truth to tell missy gunther thought that was probably the way most folk around here liked it oh she said and poured him coffee she just wished that mr ainsel could see the town in the summer or late in the spring when the lilacs and the apple and the cherry blossoms were out she thought there was nothing like it for beauty nothing like it anywhere in the world shadow gave her a fivehundreddollar deposit and he climbed up into the car and started to back it up out of her front yard and onto the driveway proper missy gunther tapped on his front window this is for you she said i nearly forgot she handed him a buff envelope its kind of a gag we had them printed up a few years back you dont have to look at it now american gods he thanked her and drove cautiously back into the town he took the road that ran around the lake he wished he could see it in the spring or the summer or the fall it would be very beautiful he had no doubt of that in ten minutes he was home he parked the car out on the street and walked up the outside steps to his cold apartment he unpacked his shopping put the food into the cupboards and the fridge and then he opened the envelope missy gunther had given him it contained a passport blue plasticated cover and inside a proclamation that michael ainsel was a citizen of lakeside there was a map of the town on the next page the rest of it was filled with discount coupons for various local stores i think i may like it here said shadow aloud he looked out of the icy window at the frozen lake if it ever warms up there was a bang at the front door at around pm shadow had been practicing the sucker vanish with a quarter tossing it from one hand to the other undetectably his hands were cold enough and clumsy enpuglhftat he kept dropping the coin onto the tabletop and the knock at the door made him drop it again he went to the door and opened it jj a moment of pure fear the man at the door wore a black mask which covered the lower half of his face it was the kind of mask that a bank robber might wear on tv or a serial killer from a cheap movie might wear to scare his victims the top of the mans head was covered by a black knit cap still the man was smaller and slighter than shadow and he did not appear to be armed and he wore a bright plaid coat of the kind that serial killers normally avoid ih hihelhan said the visitor huh neil caiman the man pulled the mask downward to reveal hinzelmanns cheerful face i said its hinzelmann you know i dont know what we did before they came up with these masks well i do remember what we did thick knitted caps that went all around your face and scarves and you dont want to know what else i think its a miracle what they come up with these days i may be an old man but im not going to grumble about progress not me he finished this speech by thrusting a basket at shadow filled high with local cheeses bottles jars and several small salamis that proclaimed themselves to be venison summer sausage and by coming inside merry day after christmas he said his nose and ears and cheeks were red as raspberries mask or no mask i hear you already ate a whole one of mabels pasties brought you a few things thats very kind of you said shadow kind nothing im going to stick it to you next week for the raffle the chamber of commerce runs it and i run the chamber of commerce last year we raised almost seventeen thousand dollars for the childrens ward of lakeside hospital well why dont you put me down for a ticket now it dont start until the day the klunker hits the ice said hinzelmann he looked out of shadows window toward the lake cold out there must have dropped fifty degrees last night it happened really fast agreed shadow we used to pray for freezes like this back in the old days said hinzelmann my daddy told me youd pray for days like this well yah it was the only way the settlers survived back then werent enough food for everyone and you couldnt just go down to daves and fill up your shopping cart in the old days no sir so my grampaw he got to figgerin and when a really cold day like this come along hed take my grarnmaw and the kids my uncle and my aunt and my american gods daddyhe was the youngestand the serving girl and the hired man and hed go down with them to the creek give em a little drink of rum and herbs it was a recipe hed got from the old country then hed pour creek water over them course theyd freeze in seconds stiff and blue as so many popsicles hed haul them to a trench theyd already dug and filled with straw and hed stack em down there one by one like so much cordwood in the trench and hed pack straw around mem then hed cover the top of the trench with twobfours to keep the critters outin those days there were wolves and bears and all sorts you never see anymore around here no hodags though thats just a story about the hodags and i wouldnt ever stretch your credulity by telling you no stories no sirhed cover the trench with twobfours and the next snowfall would cover it up completely save for the flag hed planted to show him where the trench was then my grampaw would ride through the winter in comfort and never have to worry about running out of food or out of fuel and when he saw that the ttue spring was coming hed go to the flag and hed dig his ay down through the snow and hed move the twob vfourstand hed carry them in one by one and set the family in front of the fire to thaw nobody ever minded except one of the hired men who lost half an ear to a family of mice ho nibbled it off one time my grampaw didnt push those twobfours all the way closed of course in those days we had real winters you could do that back then these pussy winters we get nowadays it dont hardly get cold enough no asked shadow he was playing straight man and enjoying it enormously not since the winter of and youd be too young to remember that one that was a winter i see you bought yourself a vehicle yup what do you think truth to tell i never liked that gunther boy i had a trout neil caiman stream down in the woods a way on back of my property way back well its town land but id put down stones in the river made little pools and places where the trout liked to live caught me some beauties tooone fellow must have been a six sevenpound brook trout and that little gunther soandso he kicked down each of the pools and threatened to report me to the dnr now hes in green bay and soon enough hell be back here if there were any justice in the world hedve gone off into the world as a winter runaway but nope sticks like a cockleburr to a woolen vest he began to arrange the contents of shadows welcome basket on the counter this is katherine powdermakers crabapple jelly shes been giving me a pot for christmas for longer than youve been alive and the sad truth is ive never opened a one theyre down in my basement forty fifty pots maybe ill open one and discover that i like the stuff meantime heres a pot for you maybe youll like it whats a winter runaway mm the old man pushed his woolen cap above his ears rubbed his temple with a pink forefinger well it aint unique to lakesidewere a good town better than most but were not perfect some winters well maybe a kid gets a bit stir crazy when it gets so cold that you cant go out and the snows so dry that you cant make so much as a snowball without it crumbling away they run off the old man nodded gravely i blame the television showing all the kids things theyll never havedallas and dynasty all of that nonsense ive not had a television since the fall of except for a blackandwhite set i keep in a closet for if folk come in from out of town and theres a big game on can i get you anything hinzelmann not coffee gives me heartburn just water hinzelmann shook his head biggest problem in this part of the world is poverty not the poverty we had in the depression american gods but something more in whats the word means it creeps in at the edges like cockaroaches insidious yeah insidious loggings dead minings dead tourists dont drive farther north than the dells cept for a handful of hunters and some kids going to camp on the lakesand they arent spending their money in the towns lakeside seems kind of prosperous though the old mans blue eyes blinked and believe me it takes a lot of work he said hard work but this is a good town and all the work all the people here put into it is worthwhile not that my family werent poor as kids ask me how poor we was as kids shadow put on his straightman face and said how poor were you as kids mister hinzelmann just hinzelmann mike we were so poor that we couldnt afford a fire come new years eve my father would suck on a peppermint and us kids wed stand around with our hands outstretched basking in the glow shadow made a rimshot noise hinzelmann put on his ski mask and did up his huge plaid coat pulled out his car keys from his pocket and then last of all putted on his great gloves you get too bored up here you just come down to the store and ask for me ill show you my collection of handtied fishing flies bore you so mucwmat getting back here will be a relief his voice was muffled but audible ill do that said shadow with a smile hows tessie hibernating shell be out in the spring you take care now mr ainsel and he closed the door behind him as he left the apartment grew ever colder shadow put on his coat and his gloves then he put on his boots he could hardly see through the windows now for the ice on the inside of the panes which turned the view of the lake into an abstract image his breath was clouding in the air neil caiman he went out of his apartment onto the wooden deck and knocked on the door next door he heard a womans voice shouting at someone to for heavens sake shut up and turn that television downa kid he thought adults dont shout like that at other adults the door opened and a tired woman with very long very black hair was staring at him warily yes how do you do maam im mike ainsel im your nextdoor neighbor her expression did not change not by a hair yes maam its freezing in my apartment theres a little heat coming out of the grate but its not warming the place up not at all she looked him up and down then a ghost of a smile touched the edges of her lips and she said come in then if you dont therell be no heat in here either he stepped inside her apartment plastic multicolored toys were strewn all over the floor there were small heaps of torn christmas wrapping paper by the wall a small boy sat inches away from the television set a video of the disney hercules playing an animated satyr stomping and shouting his way across the screen shadow kept his back to the tv set okay she said this is what you do first you seal the windows you can buy the stuff down at hennings its just like saran wrap but for windows tape it to windows then if you want to get fancy you run a blowdryer on it it stays there the whole winter that stops the heat leaving through the windows then you buy a space heater or two the buildings furnace is old and it cant cope with the real cold weve had some easy winters recently i suppose we should be grateful then she put out her hand marguerite olsen good to meet you said shadow he pulled off a glove and they shook hands you know maam id always thought of olsens as being blonder than you american gods my exhusband was as blond as they come pink and blond couldnt tan at gunpoint missy gunther told me you write for the local paper missy gunther tells everybody everything i dont see why we need a local paper with missy gunther around she nodded yes some news reporting here and there but my editor writes most of the news i write the nature column the gardening column an opinion column every sunday and the news from the community column which tells in mindnumbing detail who went to dinner with who for fifteen miles around or is that whom whom said shadow before he could stop himself its the objective case she looked at him with her black eyes and shadow experienced a moment of pure deja vu ive been here before he thought no she reminds me of someone anyway thats how you heat up your apartment she said thank you said shadow when its warm you and your little one must come over his names leon she said good meethjg you mister im sorry ainsel said shadow mike ainsel and what sort of a name is ainsel she asked shadow had no idea my name he sail imafraid i was never very interested in family history norwegian maybe she said we were never close he said then he remembered uncle emerson borson and added on that side anyway by the time mr wednesday arrived shadow had put clear plastic sheeting across all the windows and had one space heater running in the main room and one in the bedroom at the back it was practically cozy what the hell is that purple piece of shit youre driving asked wednesday by way of greeting neil caiman well said shadow you drove off with my white piece of shit where is it by the way i traded it in in duluth said wednesday you cant be too careful dont worryyoull get your share when all this is done what am i doing here asked shadow in lakeside mean not in the world wednesday smiled his smile the one that made shadow want to hit him youre living here because its the last place theyll look for you i can keep you out of sight here by they you mean the black hats exactly im afraid the house on the rock is now out of bounds its a little difficult but well cope now its just stamping our feet and flagwaving caracole and saunter until the action startsa little later than any of us expected i think theyll hold off until spring nothing big can happen until then how come because they may babble on about micromilliseconds and virtual worlds and paradigm shifts and whathaveyou but they still inhabit this planet and are still bound by the cycle of the year these are the dead months a victory in these months is a dead victory i have no idea what youre talking about said shadow that was not entirely true he had a vague idea and he hoped it was wrong its going to be a bad winter and you and i are going to use our time as wisely as we can we shall rally our troops and pick our battleground okay said shadow he knew that wednesday was telling him the truth or a part of a truth war was coming no that was not it the war had already begun the battle was coming mad sweeney said that he was working for you when we met him that first night he said that before he died and would i have wanted to employ someone who american gods could not even best a sad case like that in a bar fight but never fear youve repaid my faith in you a dozen times over have you ever been to las vegas las vegas nevada thats the one no were flying in there from madison later tonight on a gentlemans redeye a charter plane for high rollers ive convinced them that we should be on it dont you ever get tired of lying asked shadow he said it gently curiously not in the slightest anyway its true we are playing for the highest stakes of all it shouldnt take us more than a couple of hours to get to madison the roads are clear so lock your door and turn off the heaters it would be a terrible thing if you burned down the house in your absence who are we going to see in las vegas wednesday told him shadow turned off the heaters packed some clothes into an overnight bag then turned back to wednesday and said look i feel kind of stupid i know you just told me who were going to see but i dunno i just hadatrainfart or something its gone who is it again v wednesday told him once more this time shadow almost had it the naq e was there on the tip of his mind he wished hed been paying closer attention when wednesday told him he let it go whos driving he asked wednesday you are said wednesday they walked out of the house down the wooden stairs and the icy path to where a black lincoln town car was parked shadow drove entering the casino one is beset at every side by invitation invitations such that it would take a man of stone heartless mindless and curiously devoid of avarice to decline them neil caiman listen a machinegun rattle of silver coins as they tumble and spurt down into a slot machine tray and overflow onto monogrammed carpets is replaced by the siren clangor of the slots the jangling blippeting chorus swallowed by the huge room muted to a comforting background chatter by the time one reaches the card tables the distant sounds only loud enough to keep the adrenaline flowing through the gamblersveins there is a secret that the casinos possess a secret they hold and guard and prize the holiest of their mysteries for most people do not gamble to win money after all although that is what is advertised sold claimed and dreamed but that is merely the easy lie that gets them through the enormous everopen welcoming doors the secret is this people gamble to lose money they come to the casinos for the moment in which they feel alive to ride the spinning wheel and turn with the cards and lose themselves with the coins in the slots they may brag about the nights they won the money they took from the casino but they treasure secretly treasure the times they lost its a sacrifice of sorts the money flows through the casino in an uninterrupted stream of green and silver streaming from hand to hand from gambler to croupier to cashier to the management to security finally ending up in the holy of holies the innermost sanctum the counting room and it is here in the counting room of this casino that you come to rest here where the greenbacks are sorted stacked indexed here in a space that is slowly becoming redundant as more and more of the money that flows through the casino is imaginary an electrical sequence of ons and offs sequences that flow down telephone lines in the counting room you see three men counting money under the glassy stare of the cameras they can see the insectile gazes of the tiny cameras they cannot see during the course of one shift each of the men counts american gods more money than he will see in all the pay packets of his life each man when he sleeps dreams of counting money of stacks and paper bands and numbers that climb inevitably that are sorted and lost each of the three men has idly wondered not less than once a week how to evade the casinos security systems and run off with as much money as he could haul and reluctantly each man has inspected the dream and found it impractical has settled for a steady paycheck avoided the twin specters of prison and an unmarked grave and here in the sanctum sanctorum there are the three men who count the money and there are the guards who watch and who bring money and take it away and then there is another person his charcoalgray suit is immaculate his hair is dark he is cleanshaven and his face and his demeanor are in every sense forgettable none of the other men has even observed that he is there or if they have noticed him they have forgotten him on the instant as the shift ends the doors are opened and the nan in the charcoal suit leaves the room and walks with the guards through the corridors their feet shushing along the monogrammed carpets the money in strongboxes is wheeled to an interior loading bay where it is loaded into armored cars as the ramp door swings open to allowthe armored car out onto the early streets of las vegas the man in the charcoal suit walks unnoticed through the doorway and saunters up the ramp out onto the sidewalk he does not even glance up to see the imitation of new york on his left las vegas has become a childs picturebook dream of a cityhere a storybook castle there a sphinxflanked black pyramid beaming white light into the darkness as a landing beam for ufos and everywhere neon oracles and twisting screens predict happiness and good fortune announce singers and comedians and magicians in residence or on their way and the lights always flash and beckon and call neil caiman once every hour a volcano erupts in light and flame once every hour a pirate ship sinks a man o war the man in the charcoal suit ambles comfortably along the sidewalk feeling the flow of the money through the town in the summer the streets are baking and each store doorway he passes breathes wintry ac out into the sweaty warmth and chills the sweat on his face now in the desert winter theres a dry cold which he appreciates in his mind the movement of money forms a fine latticework a three dimensional cats cradle of light and motion what he finds attractive about this desert city is the speed of movement the way the money moves from place to place and hand to hand its a rush for him a high and it pulls him like an addict to the street a taxi follows him slowly down the street keeping its distance he does not notice it it does not occur to him to notice it he is so rarely noticed himself that he finds the concept that he could be being followed almost inconceivable its four in the morning and he finds himself drawn to a hotel and casino that has been out of style for thirty years still running until tomorrow or six months from now when they ii implode it and knock it down and build a pleasure palace where it was and forget it forever nobody knows him nobody remembers him but the lobby bar is tacky and quiet and the air is blue with old cigarette smoke and someones about to drop several million dollars on a poker game in a private room upstairs the man in the charcoal suit settles himself in the bar several floors below the game and is ignored by a waitress a muzak version of why cant he be you is playing almost subliminally five elvis presley impersonators each man wearing a differentcolored jumpsuit watch a late night rerun of a football game on the bar tv a big man in a light gray suit sits at the man in the charcoal suits table and noticing him even if she does not notice the man in the charcoal suit the waitress who is too american gods thin to be pretty too obviously anorectic to work luxor or the tropicana and who is counting the minutes until she gets off work comes straight over and smiles he grins widely at her you re looking a treat tonight m dear a fine sight for these poor old eyes he says and scenting a large tip she smiles broadly at him the man in the light gray suit orders a jack daniels for himself and a laphroaig and water for the man in the charcoal suit sitting beside him you know says the man in the light gray suit when his drink arrives the finest line of poetry ever uttered in the history of this whole damn country was said by canada bill jones in in baton rouge while he was being robbed blind in a crooked game of faro george devol who was like canada bill not a man who was averse to fleecing the odd sucker drew bill aside and asked him if he couldn t see that the game was crooked and canada bill sighed and shrugged his shoulders and said know but its the only game in townand he went back to the game dark eyes stare at the man in the light gray suit mistrustfully the man in the charcoal suit says something in reply the man in the light suit who has a graying reddish beard shakes his head look he says im sorry about what went down in wisconsin but i got you all out safely didn t i no one was hurt j the man in the dark suit sips his laphroaig and water savoring the marshy taste the bodyinthebog quality of the whiskey he asks a question i dont know everythings moving faster than i expected everyones got a hardon for the kid i hired to run errandsive got him outside waiting in the taxi are you still in the man in the dark suit replies the bearded man shakes his head shes not been seen for two hundred years if she isnt dead shes taken herself out of the picture neil caiman something else is said look says the bearded man knocking back his jack daniels you come in be there when we needyou and ill take care of you whaddayou want soma i can get you a bottle of soma the real stuff the man in the dark suit stares then he nods hi head reluctantly and makes a comment of course i am says the bearded man smiling like a knife what do you expect but look at it this way its the only game in town he reaches out a paw like hand and shakes the other mans wellmanicured hand then he walks away the thin waitress comes over puzzled theres now only one man at the corner table a sharply dressed man with dark hair in a charcoalgray suit you doing okay she asks is your friend coming back the man with the dark hair sighs and explains that his friend wont be coming back and thus she wont be paid for her time or for her trouble and then seeing the hurt in her eyes and taking pity on her he examines the golden threads in his mind watches the matrix follows the money until he spots a node and tells her that if shes outside treasure island at am thirty minutes after she gets off work shell meet an oncologist from denver who will just have won fortythousand dollars at a craps table and will need a mentor a partner someone to help him dispose of it all in the fortyeight hours before he gets on the plane home the words evaporate in the waitresss mind but they leave her happy she sighs and notes that the guys in the comer have done a runner and have not even tipped her and it occurs to her that instead of driving straight home when she gets off shift shes going to drive over to treasure island but she would never if you asked her be able to tell you why so who was that guy you were seeing asked shadow as they walked back down the las vegas concourse there american gods were slot machines in the airport even at this time of the morning people stood in front of them feeding them coins shadow wondered if there were those who never left the airport who got off their planes walked along the jetway into the airport building and stopped there trapped by the spinning images and the flashing lights until they had fed their last quarter to the machines and then with nothing left just turned around and got onto the plane back home and then he realized that he had zoned out just as wednesday had been telling him who the man in the dark suit they had followed in the taxi had been and he had missed it so hes in said wednesday itll cost me a bottle of soma though whats soma its a drink they walked onto the charter plane empty but for them and a trio of corporate big spenders who needed to be back in chicago by the start of the next business day wednesday got comfortable ordered himself a jack daniels my kind of people see your kind of people he hesitated its like bees and honey eachbee makes only a tiny tiny drop of honey it takes thousandsof them millions perhaps all working together to make the pot of honey you have on your breakfast table now imagine that you could eat nothing but honey thats jjivhat its like for my kind of people we feed on belief on prayers on love and soma is to take the analogy further its a honey wine like mead he chuckled its a drink concentrated prayer and belief distilled into a potent liqueur they were somewhere over nebraska eating an unimpressive inflight breakfast when shadow said my wife the dead one laura she doesnt want to be dead she told me after she got me away from the guys on the train neil caiman the action of a fine wife freeing you from durance vile and murdering those who would have harmed you you should treasure her nephew ainsel she wants to be really alive can we do that is that possible wednesday said nothing for long enough that shadow started to wonder if he had heard the question or if he had possibly fallen asleep with his eyes open then he said staring ahead of him as he talked i know a charm that can cure pain and sickness and lift the grief from the heart of the grieving i know a charm that will heal with a touch i know a charm that will turn aside the weapons of an enemy i know another charm to free myself from all bonds and locks a fifth charm i can catch an arrow in flight and take no harm from it his words were quiet urgent gone was the hectoring tone gone was the grin wednesday spoke as if he were reciting the words of a religious ritual or remembering something dark and painful a sixth spells sent to hurt me will hurt only the sender a seventh charm i know i can quench a fire simply by looking at it an eighth if any man hates me i can win his friendship a ninth i can sing the wind to sleep and calm a storm for long enough to bring a ship to shore those were the first nine charms i learned nine nights i hung on the bare tree my side pierced with a spears point i swayed and blew in the cold winds and the hot winds without food without water a sacrifice of myself to myself and the worlds opened to me for a tenth charm i learned to dispel witches to spin them around in the skies so that they will never find their way back to their own doors again american gods an eleventh if i sing it when a battle rages it can take warriors through the tumult unscathed and unhurt and bring them safely back to their hearths and their homes a twelfth charm i know if i see a hanged man i can bring him down from the gallows to whisper to us all he remembers a thirteenth if i sprinkle water on a childs head that child will not fall in battle a fourteenth i know the names of all the gods every damned one of them a fifteenth i have a dream of power of glory and of wisdom and i can make people believe my dreams his voice was so low now that shadow had to strain to hear it over the planes engine noise a sixteenth charm i know if i need love i can turn the mind and heart of any woman a seventeenth that no woman i want will ever want another and i know an eighteenth charm and that charm is the greatest of all and that charm i can tell to no man for a secret that no one knows but you is the most powerful secret there can ever be he sighed and then stopped talking shadow could feel his skin crawl it was as if he had just seen a door open to another place somewmere worlds away where hanged men blew in the wind at every crossroads where witches shrieked overhead in the night laura was all he said wednesday turned his head stared into shadows pale gray eyes with his own i cant make her live again he said i dont even know why she isnt as dead as she ought to be i think i did it said shadow it was my fault wednesday raised an eyebrow mad sweeney gave me a golden coin back when he showed me how to do that trick from what he said he gave neil caiman me the wrong coin what he gave me was something more powerful than what he thought he was giving me i passed it on to laura wednesday grunted lowered his chin to his chest frowned then he sat back that could do it he said and no i cant help you what you do in your own time is yqur own affair of course what asked shadow is that supposed to mean it means that i cant stop you from hunting eagle stones and thunderbirds but i would infinitely prefer that you spend your days quietly sequestered in lakeside out of sight and i hope out of mind when things get hairy well need all hands to the wheel he looked very old as he said this and fragile and his skin seemed almost transparent and the flesh beneath was gray shadow wanted wanted very much to reach out and put his hand over wednesdays gray hand he wanted to tell him that everything would be okaysomething that shadow did not feel but that he knew had to be said there were men in black trains out there there was a fat kid in a stretch limo and there were people in the television who did not mean them well he did not touch wednesday he did not say anything later he wondered if he could have changed things if that gesture would have done any good if it could have averted any of the harm that was to come he told himself it wouldnt he knew it wouldnt but still afterward he wished that just for a moment on that slow flight home he had touched wednesdays hand the brief winter daylight was already fading when wednesday dropped shadow outside his apartment the freezing temperature when shadow opened the car door felt even more science fictional when compared to las vegas american gods dont get into any trouble said wednesday keep your head below the parapet make no waves all at the same time dont get smart with me mboy you can keep out of sight in lakeside i pulled in a big favor to keep you here safe and sound if you were in a city theyd get your scent in minutes ill stay put and keep out of trouble shadow meant it as he said it hed had a lifetime of trouble and he was ready to let it go forever when are you coming back he asked soon said wednesday and he gunned the lincolns engine slid up the window and drove off into the frigid night chapter eleven three may keep a secret if two of them are dead ben franklin poor richards almanack three cold days passed the thermometer never made it up to the zero mark not even at midday shadow wondered how people had survived this weather in the days before electricity before thermal face masks and lightweight thermal underwear before easy travel he was down at the video tanning bait and tackle store being shown hinzelmanns handtied trout flies they were more interesting than he had expected colorful fakes of life made of feather and thread each with a hook hidden inside it he asked hinzelmann for real asked hinzelmann for real said shadow well said the older man sometimes they didnt survive it and they died leaky chimneys and badly ventilated stoves and ranges killed as many people as the cold but those days were hardtheyd spend the summer and the fall laying up the food and the firewood for the winter the worst thing of all was the madness i heard on the radio they were saying how it has to do with the sunlight how there isnt enough of it in the winter my daddy he said folk just went stir crazywinter madness they called it lake americangods side always had it easy but some of the other towns around here they had it hard there was a saying still had currency when i was a kid that if the serving girl hadnt tried to kill you by february she hadnt any backbone storybooks were like gold dustanything you could read was treasured back before the town had a lending library when my grampaw got sent a storybook from his brother in bavaria all the germans in town met up in the town hall to hear him read it and the finns and the irish and the rest of them theyd make the germans tell them the stories twenty miles south of here in jibway they found a woman walking mothernaked in the winter with a dead babe at her breast and shed not suffer them to take it from her he shook his head meditatively closed the fly cabinet with a click bad business you want a video rental card eventually theyll open a blockbusters here and then well soon be out of business but for now we got a pretty fair selection shadow reminded hinzelmann that he had no television and no vcr he enjoyed hinzelmanns cotftpanythe reminiscences the tall tales the goblin grin ofthe old man it could make things awkward between them were shadow to admit that television had made him uncomfortable ever since it had started to talk to him j hinzelmann fished in a drawer id took out a tin box by the look of it it had once been a christmas box of the kind that contained chocolates or cookies a mottled santa claus holding a tray of cocacola bottles beamed up from its lid hinzelmann eased off the metal top of the box revealing a notebook and books of blank tickets and said how many you want me to put you down for how many of what klunker tickets shell go out onto the ice today so weve started selling tickets each ticket is five dollars ten neil caiman for forty twenty for seventyfive one ticket buys you five minutes of course we cant promise itll go down in your five minutes but the person whos closest stands to win five hundred bucks and if it goes down in your five minutes you win a thousand dollars the earlier you buy your tickets the more times arent spoken for you want to see the info sheet sure hinzelmann handed shadow a photocopied sheet the klunker was an old car with its engine and fuel tank removed which would be parked out on the ice for the winter sometime in the spring the lake ice would melt and when it was too thin to bear the cars weight the car would fall into the lake the earliest the klunker had ever tumbled into the lake was february the twentyseventh the latest was may the first the beginning of april appeared to be the most common time for the car to sinknormally in midafternoon all of the midafternoons in april had already gone marked off in hinzelmanns lined notebook shadow bought a thirtyminute period on the morning of march from am to am he handed hinzelmann thirty dollars i just wish everybody in town was as easy a sell as you are said hinzelmann its a thankyou for that ride you gave me that first night i was in town no mike said hinzelmann its for the children for a moment he looked serious with no trace of impishness on his creased old face come down this afternoon you can lend a hand pushing the klunker out onto the lake he passed shadow six blue cards each with a date and american gods time written on it in hinzelmanns oldfashioned handwriting then entered the details of each in his notebook hinzelmann asked shadow have you ever heard of eagle stones up north of rhinelander nope thats eagle river cant say i have how about thunderbirds well there was the thunderbird framing gallery up on fifth street but that closed down im not helping am i nope tell you what why dont you go look at the library good people although they may be kind of distracted by the library sale on this week i showed you where the library was didnt i shadow nodded and said so long he wished hed thought of the library himself he got into the purple runner and drove south on main street following the lake around to the southernmost point until he reached the castlelike building that housed the city library he walked inside a sign pointed to the basement library sale it read thg library proper was on the ground floor and he stamped the snow off his boots a forbidding woman with pursed crimsofl colored lips asked him pointedly if she could help him i guess i need a library card he said and i want to know all about thunderbirds jj native american beliefs and traditions were on a single shelf in one castlelike turret shadow pulled down some books and sat in the window seat in several minutes he had learned that thunderbirds were mythical gigantic birds who lived on mountaintops who brought the lightning and who flapped their wings to make the thunder there were some tribes he read who believed that the thunderbirds had made the world another half hours reading did not turn up anything more and he couldfind no mention of eagle stones anywhere in the books indexes neil caiman shadow was putting the last of the books back on the shelf when he became aware of somebody staring at him someone small and grave was peeking at him from around the heavy shelves as he turned to look the face vanished he turned his back on the boy then glanced around to see that he was being watched once more t in his pocket was the liberty dollar he took it out of his pocket and held it up in his right hand making sure the boy could see it he fingerpalmed it into his left hand displayed both hands empty raised his left hand to his mouth and coughed once letting the coin tumble from his left hand into his right the boy looked at him wideeyed and scampered away returning a few moments later dragging an unsmiling marguerite olsen who looked at shadow suspiciously and said hello mister ainsel leon says you were doing magic for him just a little prestidigitation maam say i never did say thank you for your advice about heating the apartment its warm as toast in there right now thats good her icy expression had not begun to thaw its a lovely library said shadow its a beautiful building but the city needs something more efficient and less beautiful you going to the library sale downstairs i wasnt planning on it well you should its for a good cause ill make a point of getting down there head out into the hall and then go downstairs good seeing you mister ainsel call me mike he said she said nothing just took leons hand and walked the boy over to the childrens section but mom shadow heard leon say it wasnt pressed igitation it wasn t i saw it vanish and then it fell out of his nose i saw it american gods an oil portrait of abraham lincoln gazed down from the wall at him shadow walked down the marble and oak steps to the library basement through a door into a large room filled with tables each table covered with books of all kinds indiscriminately assorted and promiscuously arranged paperbacks and hardcovers fiction and nonfiction periodicals and encyclopedias all side by side upon the tables spines up or spines out shadow wandered to the back of the room where there was a table covered with oldlooking leatherbound books each with a catalog number painted in white on the spine youre the first person over in that corner all day said the man sitting by the stack of empty boxes and bags and the small open metal cashbox mostly folk just take the thrillers and the childrens books and the harlequin romances jenny kerton danielle steel all that the man was reading agatha christies the murder of roger ackroyd everything on the tables is fifty cents a book or you can take three for a dollar shadow thanked him and continued to browse he found a copy of herodotuss histories bound inpeeling brown leather it made him think of the paperbadccbpy he had left behind in prison there was a book called perplexing parlour illusions which looked like it might have some coin effects he carried both the books over t the man with the cashbox buy one more its still a dollar said the man and if you take another book away youll be doing us a favor we need the shelfspace shadow walked back to the old leatherbound books he decided to liberate the book that was least likely to be bought by anyone else and found himself unable to decide between common diseases of the urinary tract with illustrations by a medical doctor and minutes of the lakeside city council he looked at the illustrations in the medical book and decided that somewhere in the town neil caiman there was a teenage boy who could use the book to gross out his friends he took the minutes to the man on the door who took his dollar and put all the books into a daves finest food brown paper sack shadow left the library he had a clear view of the lake all the way back he could even see his apartment building like a dolls house up past the bridge and there were men on the ice near the bridge four or five of them pushing a dark green car into the center of the white lake march the twentythird shadow said to the lake under his breath nine am to ninethirty am he wondered if the lake or the klunker could hear himand if they would pay any attention to him even if they could he doubted it the wind blew bitter against his face officer chad mulligan was waiting outside shadows apartment when he got back shadows heart began to pound when he saw the police car to relax a little when he observed that the policeman was doing paperwork in the front seat he walked over to the car carrying his paper sack of books mulligan lowered his window library sale he said yes i bought a box of robert ludlum books there two three years back keep meaning to read them my cousin swears by the guy these days i figure if i ever get marooned on a desert island and i got my box of robert ludlum books with me i can

responsible for him well im not saying i saved your life last week but i still thought i should check in hows the purple gunthermobile doing good said shadow its good running fine pleased to hear it american gods i saw my nextdoor neighbor in the library said shadow miz olsen i was wondering what crawled up her butt and died if you want to put it like that long story you want to ride along for a spell ill tell you all about it shadow thought about it for a moment okay he said he got into the car sat in the front passenger seat mulligan drove north of town then he turned off his lights and parked beside the road darren olsen met marge at uw stevens point and he brought her back north to lakeside she was a journalism major he was studying shit hotel management something like that when they got here jaws dropped this was what thirteen fourteen years ago she was so beautiful that black hair he paused darren managed the motel america over in camden twenty miles west of here except nobody ever seemed to want to stop in camden and eventually the motel closed they had two boys at that time sandy was eleven the little oneleon is itwas just a babe in arms v darren olsen wasnt a brave man hedbeen a good high school football player but that was he last time he was flying high whatever he couldnt find the courage to tell margie that hed lost his job so for a mo h maybe for two months hed drive off early in the morning come home late in the evening complaining about the hard day hed had at the motel what was he doing asked shadow mm couldnt say for certain i reckon he was driving up to ironwood maybe down to green bay guess he started out as a job hunter pretty soon he was drinking the time away getting stoned more than probably meeting the occasional working girl for a little instant gratification he could have been gambling what i do know for certain is that he emptied out their joint account in about ten weeks neil caiman it was only a matter of time before margie figured out there we go he swung the car out flicked on the siren and the lights and scared the daylights but of a small man in a car with iowa plates who had just come down the hill at seventy the rogue lowan ticketed mulligan returned to his story where was i okay so margie kicks him out sues for divorce it turned into a vicious custody battle thats what they call em when they get into people magazine vicious custody battle she got the kids barren got visitation rights and precious little else now back then leon was pretty small sandy was older a good kid the kind of boy who worships his daddy wouldnt let margie say nothing bad about him they lost the househad a nice place down on daniels road she moved into the apartment he left town came back every six months to make everybody miserable this went on for a few years hed come back spend money on the kids leave margie in tears most of us just started wishing hed never come back at all his mom and pop had moved to florida when they retired said they couldnt take another wisconsin winter so last year he came out said he wanted to take the boys to florida for christmas margie said not a hope told him to get lost it got pretty unpleasantat one point i had to go over there domestic dispute by the time i got there darren was standing in the front yard shouting stuff the boys were barely holding it together margie was crying i told darren he was shaping up for a night in the cells i thought for a moment he was going to hit me but he was sober enough not to do that i gave him a ride down to the trailer park south of town told him to shape up that hed hurt her enough next day he left town two weeks later sandy vanished didnt get onto the school bus told his best friend that hed be seeing his dad soon that darren was bringing him a specially cool present to make up for having missed christmas in florida no americangods bodys seen him since noncustodial kidnappings are the hardest its tough to find a kid who doesnt want to be found ysee shadow said that he did he saw something else as well chad mulligan was in love with marguerite olsen himself he wondered if the man knew how obvious it was mulligan pulled out once more lights flashing and pulled over some teenagers doing sixty he didnt ticket them just put the fear of god in them that evening shadow sat at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to transform a silver dollar into a penny it was a trick he had found in perplexing parlour illusions but the instructions were infuriating unhelpful and vague phrases like then vanish the penny in the usual way occurred every sentence or so in this context shadow wondered what was the usual way a french drop sleeving it shouting oh my god look out a mountain lion and dropping the coin into his side pocket while the audiences attention was diverted he tossed his silver dollar into the air caught itr membering the moon and the woman who gave it to himrthen he attempted the illusion it didnt seem to work he walked into the bathroom and tried it in front of the mirror and confirmed that he was right the trick as written simply didnt work he sighed dropped the coins in his pocket and sat down on the couch he spread the cheap throw rug over his legs and flipped open the minutes of the lakeside city council the type in two columns was so small as to be almost unreadable he flipped through the book looking at the reproductions of the photographs of the period at the several incarnations of the lakeside city council therein long side whiskers and clay pipes and battered hats and shiny hats worn with faces that were many of them peculiarly familiar he was unsurprised to see that the portly secretary of the city council was a patrick neil caiman mulligan shave him make him lose twenty pounds and hed be a dead ringer for chad mulligan hiswhat greatgreatgrandson he wondered if hinzelmanns pioneer grandfather was in the photographs but it did not appear that he had been city council material shadow thought he had seen a reference to a hinzelmann in the text while flipping from photograph to photograph but it eluded him when he leafed back for it and the tiny type made shadows eyes ache he put the book down on his chest and realized his head was nodding it would be foolish to fall asleep on the couch he decided soberly the bedroom was only a few feet away on the other hand the bedroom and the bed would still be there in five minutes and anyway he was not going to go to sleep only to close his eyes for a moment darkness roared he stood on an open plain beside him was the place from which he had once emerged from which the earth had squeezed him stars were still falling from the sky and each star that touched the red earth became a man or a woman the men had long black hair and high cheekbones the women all looked like marguerite olsen these were the star people they looked at him with dark proud eyes tell me about the thunderbirds said shadow please its not for me its for my wife one by one they turned their backs on him and as he lost their faces they were gone one with the landscape but the last of them her hair streaked white on dark gray pointed before she turned away pointed into the winecolored sky ask them yourself she said summer lightning flickered momentarily illuminating the landscape from horizon to horizon there were high rocks near him peaks and spires of sandstone and shadow began to climb the nearest the american gods spire was the color of old ivory he grabbed at a handhold and felt it slice into his hand its bone thought shadow not stone its old dry bone it was a dream and in dreams you have no choices either there are no decisions to be made or they were made for you long before ever the dream began shadow continued to climb his hands hurt bone popped and crushed and fragmented under his bare feet the wind tugged at him and he pressed himself to the spire and he continued to climb the tower it was made of only one kind of bone he realized repeated over and over each of the bones was dry and balllike he imagined that they might be the eggshells of some huge bird but another flare of lightning told him differently they had holes for eyes and they had teeth which grinned without humor somewhere birds were calling rain spattered his face he was hundreds of feet above the ground clinging to the side of the tower of skulls while flashes of lightning burned in the wings of the shadowy bird who circled the spireenormous black condorlike birds each with a ruff of white at its neck they were huge gracefift swful birds and the beats of their wings crashed like thunder on the night air they were circling the spire j they must be fifteen twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip thought shadow then the first bird swung out of its glide toward him blue lightning crackling in its wings he pushed himself into a crevice of skulls hollow eyeholes stared at him a clutter of ivory teeth smiled at him but he kept climbing pulling himself up the mountain of skulls every sharp edge cutting into his skin feeling revulsion and terror and awe another bird came at him and one handsized talon sank into his arm he reached out and tried to grasp a feather from its neil caiman wingfor if he returned to his tribe without athunderbirds feather he would be disgraced he would never be a man but the bird pulled up so that he could not grasp a feather the thunderbird loosened its grip and swung back onto the wind shadow continued to climb there must be a thousand skulls thought shadow a thousand thousand and not all of them are human he stood at last on the top of the spire the great birds the thunderbirds circling him slowly navigating the gusts of the storm with tiny flicks of their wings he heard a voice the voice of the buffalo man calling to him on the wind telling him who the skulls belonged to the tower began to tumble and the biggest bird its eyes the blinding bluewhite of forked lightning plummeted down toward him in a rush of thunder and shadow was falling tumbling down the tower of skulls the telephone shrilled shadow had not even known that it was connected groggy shaken he picked it up what the fuck shouted wednesday angrier than shadow had ever heard him what the almighty flying fuck do you think you are playing at i was asleep said shadow into the receiver stupidly what do you think is the fucking point of stashing you in a hiding place like lakeside if youre going to raise such a ruckus that not even a dead man could miss it i dreamed of thunderbirds said shadow and a tower skulls it seemed to him very important to recount his dream i know what you were dreaming everybody damn well knows what you were dreaming christ almighty whats the point in hiding you if youre going to start to rucking advertise shadow said nothing there was a pause at the other end of the telephone ill be there in the morning said wednesday it sounded like american gods the anger had died down were going to san francisco the flowers in your hair are optional and the line went dead shadow put the telephone down on the carpet and sat up stiffly it was am and still nightdark outside he got up from the sofa shivering he could hear the wind as it screamed across the frozen lake and he could hear somebody nearby crying only the thickness of a wall away he was certain it was marguerite olsen and her sobbing was insistent and low and heartbreaking shadow walked into the bathroom and pissed then went into his bedroom and closed the door blocking off the sound of the crying woman outside the wind howled and wailed as if it too was seeking a lost child san francisco in january was unseasonably warm warm enough that the sweat prickled on the back of shadows neck wednesday was wearing a deep blue suit and a pair of goldrimmed spectacles that made him look like an entertainment lawyer they were walking along haight street the street people and the hustlers and the moochers watchedtfiem go by and no one shook a paper cup of change at them no one asked them for anything at all wednesdays jaw was set shadow had sejn immediately that the man was still angry and had asked no questions when the black lincoln town car had pulled up outside the apartment that morning they had not talked on the way to the airport he had been relieved that wednesday was in first class and he was back in coach now it was late in the afternoon shadow who had not been in san francisco since he was a boy who had only seen it since then as a background to movies was astonished at how familiar it was how colorful and unique the wooden houses how steep the hills how very much it didnt feel like anywhere else j k neil caiman its almost hard to believe that this is in the same country as lakeside he said wednesday glared at him then he said its not san francisco isnt in the same country as lakeside anymore than new orleans is in the same country as new york or miami is in the same country as minneapolis is that so said shadow mildly indeed it is they may share certain cultural signifiers money a federal government entertainmentits the same land obviouslybut the only things that give it the illusion of being one country are the greenback the tonight show and mcdonalds they were approaching a park at the end of the road be nice to the lady we are visiting but not too nice ill be cool said shadow they stepped onto the grass a young girl no older than fourteen her hair dyed green and orange and pink stared at them as they went by she sat beside a dog a mongrel with a piece of string for a collar and a leash she looked hungrier than the dog did the dog yapped at them then wagged its tail shadow gave the girl a dollar bill she stared at it as if she was not sure what it was buy dog food with it shadow suggested she nodded and smiled let me put it bluntly said wednesday you must be very cautious around the lady we are visiting she might take a fancy to you and that would be bad is she your girlfriend or something not for all the little plastic toys in china said wednesday agreeably his anger seemed to have dissipated or perhaps to have been invested for the future shadow suspected that anger was the engine that made wednesday run there was a woman sitting on the grass under a tree with a paper tablecloth spread in front of her and a variety of tupperware dishes on the cloth she wasnot fat no far from fat what she was a word american gods that shadow had never had cause to use until now was curvaceous her hair was so fair that it was white the kind of platinumblonde tresses that should have belonged to a longdead movie starlet her lips were painted crimson and she looked to be somewhere between twentyfive and fifty as they reached her she was selecting from a plate of deviled eggs she looked up as wednesday approached her put down the egg she had chosen and wiped her hand hello you old fraud she said but she smiled as she said it and wednesday bowed low took her hand and raised it to his lips he said you look divine how the hell else should i look she demanded sweetly anyway youre a liar new orleans was such a mistakei put on what thirty pounds there i swear i knew i had to leave when i started to waddle the tops of my thighs rub together when i walk now can you believe that this last was addressed to shadow he had no idea what to say in reply and felt a hot flush suffuse his face the woman laughed delightedly hes bbishingl wednesday my sweet you brought me a blusher hdfy perfectly wonderful of you whats he called this is shadow said wednesday he seemed to be enjoying shadows discomfort shadow say hello to easter shadow said something that might have been hello and the woman smiled at him again he felt like he was caught in headlightsthe blinding kind that poachers use to freeze deer before they shoot them he could smell her perfume from where he was standing an intoxicating mixture of jasmine and honeysuckle of sweet milk and female skin so hows tricks asked wednesday the womaneasterlaughed a deep and throaty laugh fullbodied and joyous how could you not like someone who laughed like that everythings fine she said how about you you old wolf i was hoping to enlist your assistance neil caiman wasting your time at least hear me out before dismissing me no point dont even bother she looked at shadow please sit down here and help yourself to some of this food here take a plate and pile it high its all good eggs roast chicken chicken curry chicken salad and over here is lapinrabbit actually but cold rabbit is a delight and in that bowl over there is the jugged harewell why dont i just fill a plate for you and she did taking a plastic plate piling it high with food and passing it to him then she looked at wednesday are you eating she asked i am at your disposal my dear said wednesday you she told him are so full of shit its a wonder your eyes dont turn brown she passed him an empty plate help yourself she said the afternoon sun at her back burned her hair into a platinum aura shadow she said chewing a chicken leg with gusto thats a sweet name why do they call you shadow shadow licked his lips to moisten them when i was a kid he said we lived my mother and i we were i mean she was well like a secretary at a bunch of us embassies we went from city to city all over northern europe then she got sick and had to take early retirement and we came back to the states i never knew what to say to the other kids so id just find adults and follow them around not saying anything i just needed the company i guess i dont know i was a small kid you grew she said yes said shadow i grew she turned back to wednesday who was spooning down a bowl of what looked like cold gumbo is this the boy whos got everybody so upset you heard i keep my ears pricked up she said then to shadow american gods you keep out of their way there are too many secret societies out there and they have no loyalties and no love commercial independent government theyre all in the same boat they range from the barely competent to the deeply dangerous hey old wolf i heard a joke youd like the other day how do you know the cia wasnt involved in the kennedy assassination ive heard it said wednesday pity she turned her attention back to shadow but the spook show the ones you met theyre something else they exist because everyone knows they must exist she drained a paper cup of something that looked like white wine and then she got to her feet shadows a good name she said i want a mochaccino come on she began to walk away what about the food asked wednesday you cant just leave it here she smiled at him and pointed to the girl sitting by the dog and then extended her arms to take in the haight and the world let it feed them she said and she walked with wednesday and shadow trailing behind best remember she said to wednesday as they walked im rich im doing just peachy why stisuld i help you youre one of us he said youre as forgotten and as unloved and unremembered as any of us its pretty clear whose side you should be on they reached a sidewalk coffeehouse went inside sat down there was only one waitress who wore her eyebrow ring as a mark of caste and a woman making coffee behind the counter the waitress advanced upon them smiling automatically sat them down took their orders easter put her slim hand on the back of wednesdays square gray hand im telling you she said im doing fine on my festival days they still feast on eggs and rabbits on candy and on flesh to represent rebirth and copulation they wear flowers in their bonnets and they give each other neil caiman flowers they do it in my name more and more of them every year in my name old wolf and you wax fat and affluent on their worship and their love he said dryly dont be an asshole suddenly she sounded very tired she sipped her mochaccino t serious question mdear certainly i would agree that millions upon millions of them give each other tokens in your name and that they still practice all the rites of your festival even down to hunting for hidden eggs but how many of them know who you are eh excuse me miss this to their waitress she said you need another espresso no my dear i was just wondering if you could solve a little argument we were having over here my friend and i were disagreeing over what the word easter means would you happen to know the girl stared at him as if green toads had begun to push their way between his lips then she said i dont know about any of that christian stuff im a pagan the woman behind the counter said i think its like latin or something for christ has risen maybe really said wednesday yeah sure said the woman easter just like the sun rises in the east you know the risen son of coursea most logical supposition the woman smiled and returned to her coffee grinder wednesday looked up at their waitress i think i shall have another espresso if you do not mind and tell me as a pagan who do you worship worship thats right i imagine you must have a pretty wideopen field so to whom do you set up your household altar to whom do you bow down to whom do you pray at dawn and at dusk her lips described several shapes without saying any americangods thing before she said the female principle its an empowerment thing you know indeed and this female principle of yours does she have a name shes the goddess within us all said the girl with the eyebrow ring color rising to her cheek she doesnt need a name ah said wednesday with a wide monkey grin so do you have mighty bacchanals in her honor do you drink blood wine under the full moon while scarlet candles burn in silver candleholders do you step naked into the seafoam chanting ecstatically to your nameless goddess while the waves lick at your legs lapping your thighs like the tongues of a thousand leopards youre making fun of me she said we dont do any of that stuff you were saying she took a deep breath shadow suspected she was counting to ten any more coffees here another mochaccino for you maam her smile was a lot like the one she had greeted them with when they had entered they shook their heads and the waitress turned to greet another customer there said wednesday is one who deesttot have the faith and will not have the fun chesterton pagan indeed so shall we go out onto the street easter my dear and repeat the exercise find out how many passjrsby know that their easter festival takes its name from eostre of the dawn lets seei have it we shall ask a hundred people for every one that knows the truth you may cut off one of my fingers and when i run out of them toes for every twenty who dont know you spend a night making love to me and the odds are certainly in your favor herethis is san francisco after all there are heathens and pagans and wiccans aplenty on these precipitous streets her green eyes looked at wednesday they were shadow decided the exact same color as a leaf in spring with the sun shining through it she said nothing neil caiman we could try it continued wednesday but i would end up with ten fingers ten toes and five nights in your bed so dont tell me they worship you and keep your festival day they mouth your name but it has no meaning to them nothing at all tears stood out in her eyes i know that she said quietly im not a fool no said wednesday youre not hes pushed her too far thought shadow wednesday looked down ashamed im sorry he said shadow could hear the real sincerity in his voice we need you we need your energy we need your power will you fight beside us when the storm comes she hesitated she had a chain of blue forgetmenots tattooed around her left wrist yes she said after a while i guess i will guess its true what they say thought shadow if you can fake sincerity youve got it made then he felt guilty for thinking it wednesday kissed his finger touched it to easters cheek he called their waitress over and paid for their coffees counting out the money carefully folding it over with the check and presenting it to her as she walked away shadow said maam excuse me i think you dropped this he picked up a tendollar bill from the floor no she said looking at the wrapped bills in her hand i saw it fall maam said shadow politely you should count them she counted the money in her hand looked puzzled and said jesus youre right im sorry she took the tendollar bill from shadow and walked away easter walked out onto the sidewalk with them the light was just starting to fade she nodded to wednesday then she touched shadows hand and said what did you dream about last night american gods thunderbirds he said a mountain of skulls she nodded and do you know whose skulls they were there was a voice he said in my dream it told me she nodded and waited he said it said they were mine old skulls of mine thousands and thousands of them she looked at wednesday and said i think this ones a keeper she smiled her bright smile then she patted shadows arm and walked away down the sidewalk he watched her go tryingand failingnot to think of her thighs rubbing together as she walked in the taxi on the way to the airport wednesday turned to shadow what the hell was that business with the ten dollars about you shortchanged her it comes out of her wages if shes short what the hell do you care wednesday seemed genuinely irate shadow thought for a moment then he said well i wouldnt want anyone to do it to me she hadnt done anything wrong no wednesday stared off into the middle distance and said when she was seven years old she shut a kitten in a closet she listened to it mew for several days when it ceased to mew she took it out of the clo t put it into a shoebox and buried it in the backyard she wanted to bury something she consistently steals from everywhere she works small amounts usually last year she visited her grandmother in the nursing home to which the old woman is confined she took an antique gold watch from her grandmothers bedside table and then went prowling through several of the other rooms stealing small quantities of money and personal effects from the twilight folk in their golden years when she got home she did not know what to do with her spoils scared someone would come after her so she threw everything away except the cash neil caiman i get the idea said shadow she also has asymptomatic gonorrhea said wednesday she suspects she might be infected but does nothing about it when her last boyfriend accused her of having given him a disease she was hurt offended and refused to see him again this isnt necessary said shadow i said i get the idea you could do this to anyone couldnt you tell me bad things about them of course agreed wednesday they all do the same things they may think their sins are original but for the most part they are petty and repetitive and that makes it okay for you to steal ten bucks from her wednesday paid the taxi and the two men walked into the airport wandered up to their gate boarding had not yet begun wednesday said what the hell else can i do they dont sacrifice rams or bulls to me they dont send me the souls of killers and slaves gallowshung and ravenpicked they made me they forgot me now i take a little back from them isnt that fair my mom used to say life isnt fair said shadow of course she did said wednesday its one of those things that moms say right up there with if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you do it too you stiffed that girl for ten bucks i slipped her ten bucks said shadow doggedly it was the right thing to do someone announced that their plane was boarding wednesday stood up may your choices always be so clear he said the cold snap was easing when wednesday dropped shadow off in the small hours of the morning it was still obscenely cold in lakeside but it was no longer impossibly cold the lighted sign on the side of the m i bank flashed american gods alternately am and f as they drove through the town it was am when chief of police chad mulligan knocked on the apartment door and asked shadow if he knew a girl named alison mcgovera i dont think so said shadow sleepily this is her picture said mulligan it was a high school photograph shadow recognized the person in the picture immediately the girl with the blue rubberband braces on her teeth the one who had been learning all about the oral uses of alkaseltzer from her friend oh yeah okay she was on the bus when i came into town where were you yesterday mister ainsel shadow felt his world begin to spin away from him he knew he had nothing to feel guilty about san francisco he said california helping my uncle transport a fourposter bed you got any ticket stubs anything like thai sure he had both his boarding pass stubs in his back pocket pulled them out whats going on chad mulligan examined the boarding passes alison mcgoverns vanished she helped out uplat the lakeside humane society feed animals walk dogs shed come out for a few hours after school so dolly knopf who runs the humane society shed always run her home when they closed up for the night yesterday alison never got there shes vanished yup her parents called us last night silly kid used to hitchhike up to the humane society its out on county w pretty isolated her parents told her not to but this isnt the kind of place where things happen people here dont neil caiman lock their doors you know and you cant tell kids so look at the photo again alison mcgovern was smiling the rubber bands on her teeth in the photograph were red not blue you can honestly say you didnt kidnap her rape her murder her anything like mat i was in san francisco and i wouldnt do that shit that was what i figured pal so you want to come help us look for her me you weve had the k guys out this morningnothing so far he sighed heck mike i just hope she turns up in the twin cities with some dopey boyfriend you think its likely i think its possible you want to join the hunting party shadow remembered seeing the girl in hennings farm and home supplies the flash of a shy bluebraced smile how beautiful he had known she was going to be one day ill come he said there were two dozen men and women waiting in the lobby of the fire station shadow recognized hinzelmann and several other faces looked familiar there were police officers and some men and women in the brown uniforms of the lumber county sheriffs department chad mulligan told them what alison was wearing when she vanished and divided the volunteers into groups of three shadow hinzelmann and a man named brogan comprised one of the groups they were reminded how short the daylight period was told that if god forbid they found alisons body they were not repeat not to disturb anything just to radio back for help but that if she was alive they were to keep her warm until help came they were dropped off out on county w american gods hinzelmann brogan and shadow walked along the edge of a frozen creek each group of three had been issued a small handheld walkietalkie before they left the cloud cover was low and the world was gray no snow had fallen in the last thirtysix hours footprints stood out in the glittering crust of the crisp snow brogan looked like a retired army colonel with his slim mustache and white temples he told shadow he was a retired high school principal i wasnt getting any younger these days i still teach a little do the school playthat was always the high point of the year anyhowand now i hunt a little and have a cabin down on pike lake spend too much time there as they set out brogan said on the one hand i hope we find her on the other if shes going to be found id be very grateful if it was someone else who got to find her and not us you know what i mean shadow knew exactly what he meant the three men did not talk much they walked looking for a red snowsuit or green gloves or a blue hat or a white body now and again brogan who had the walkietalkie would check in with chad mulligan at lunchtime they sat with the rest of the search party on a commandeered school bus and ate hot dogs and drank hot soup someone pointed out a redtailed hawk in a bare tree and someone else said that it looked morejiike a falcon but it flew away and the argument was abandoned hinzelmann told them a story about his grandfathers trumpet and how he tried playing it during a cold snap and the weather was so cold outside by the bam where his grandfather had gone to practice that no music came out then after he came inside he put the trumpet down by the woodstove to thaw well the familyre all in bed that night and suddenly the unfrozen tunes start coming out of that trumpet scared my grandmother so much she nearly had kittens the afternoon was endless unfruitful and depressing neil caiman the daylight faded slowly distances collapsed and the world turned indigo and the wind blew cold enough to burn the skin on your face when it was too dark to continue mulligan radioed to them to call it off for the evening and they were picked up and driven back to the fire station in the block next to the fire station was the buck stops here tavern and that was where most of the searchers wound up they were exhausted and dispirited talking to each other of how cold it had become how more than likely alison would show up in a day or so no idea of how much trouble shed caused everyone you shouldnt think badly of the town because of this said brogan it is a good town lakeside said a trim woman whose name shadow had forgotten if ever theyd been introduced is the best town in the north woods you know how many people are unemployed in lakeside no said shadow less than twenty she said theres over five thousand people live in and around this town we may not be rich but everyones working its not like the mining towns up in the northeastmost of them are ghost towns now there were farming towns that were killed by the falling cost of milk or the low price of hogs you know what the biggest cause of unnatural death is among farmers in the midwest suicide shadow hazarded she looked almost disappointed yeah thats it they kill themselves she shook her head then she continued there are too many towns hereabouts that only exist for the hunters and the vacationers towns that just take their money and send them home with their trophies and their bug bites then there are the company towns where everythings just hunkydory until walmart relocates their distribution center or m stops manufacturing cd cases there or whatever and suddenly theres a boatload of folks who american gods cant pay their mortgages im sorry i didnt catch your name ainsel said shadow mike ainsel the beer he was drinking was a local brew made with spring water it was good im gallic knopf she said dollys sister her face was still ruddy from the cold so what im saying is that lakesides lucky weve got a little of everything here farm light industry tourism crafts good schools shadow looked at her in puzzlement there was something empty at the bottom of all her words it was as if he were listening to a salesman a good salesman who believed in his product burstill wanted to make sure you went home with all the brushes or the full set of encyclopedias perhaps she could see it in his face she said im sorry when you love something you just dont want to stop talking about it what do you do mister ainsel my uncle buys and sells antiques all over the country he uses me to move big heavy things its a good job but not steady work a black cat the bar mascot wound between shadows legs rubbing its forehead jtfn his boot it leapt up beside him onto the bench and wenfkfsleep at least you get to travel said brogan you do anything else you got eight quarters on you asked shadow brogan fumbled for his change he found five quarters pushed them across the table to shadow gallic knopf produced another three quarters he laid out the coins four in each row then with scarcely a fumble he did the coins through the table appearing to drop half the coins through the wood of the table from his left hand into his right after that he took all eight coins in his right hand an empty water glass in his left covered the glass with a napkin and appeared to make the coins vanish one by one from neil caiman his right hand and land in the glass beneath the napkin with an audible clink finally he opened his right hand to show it was empty then swept the napkin away to show the coins in the glass he returned their coinsthree to gallic five to brogan then took a quarter back from brogans hand leaving four coins he blew on it and it was a penny which he gave to brogan who counted his quarters and was dumbfounded to find that he still had all five in his hand youre a houdini cackled hinzelmann in delight thats what you are just an amateur said shadow ive got a long way to go still he felt a whisper of pride they had been his first adult audience he stopped at the food store on the way home to buy a carton of milk the gingerhaired girl at the checkout counter looked familiar and her eyes were redrimmed from crying her face was one big freckle i know you said shadow youre and he was about to say the alkaseltzer girl but bit it back and finished youre alisons friend from the bus i hope shes going to be okay she sniffed and nodded me too she blew her nose on a tissue hard and pushed it back into her sleeve her badge said hi im sophie ask me how you can lose lbs in days i spent today looking for her no luck yet sophie nodded blinked back tears she waved the milk carton in front of a scanner and it chirped its price at them shadow passed her two dollars im leaving this fucking town said the girl in a sudden choked voice im going to live with my mom in ashland alisons gone sandy olsen went last year jo ming the year before that what if its me next year i thought sandy olsen was taken by his father yes said the girl bitterly im sure he was and jo american gods ming went out to california and sarah lindquist got lost on a trail hike and they never found her whateveri want to go to ashland she took a deep breath and held it for a moment then unexpectedly she smiled at him there was nothing insincere about that smile it was just he guessed that she had been told to smile when she gave somebody change she told him to have a nice day then she turned to the woman with the full shopping cart behind him and began to unload and scan shadow took his milk and drove away past the gas station and the klunker on the ice and over the bridge and home coming to america there was a girl and her uncle sold her wrote mr ibis in his perfect copperplate handwriting that is the tale the rest is detail there are accounts that if we open our hearts to them will cut us too deeply lookhere is a good man good by his own lights and the lights of his friends vt is faithful and true to his wife he adores and lavishes attention on his little children he cares about his country he does his job punctiliously as best he can so efficiently and goodnaturedly he exterminates jews he appreciates the music that plays in the background to pacify them he advises the jews not to forget their identification numbers as they go into the showers many people he tells them forget their numbers and take the wrong clothes when they come out of the showers this calms the jews there will be life they assure themselves after the showers our man supervises the detail taking the bodies to the ovens and if there is anything he feels bad neil caiman about it is that he still allows the gassing of vermin to affect him were he a truly good man he knows he would feel nothing but joy as the earth is cleansed of its pests there was a girl and her uncle sold her put like that it seems so simple no man proclaimed donne is an island and he was wrong if we were not islands we would be lost drowned in each others tragedies we are insulated from the tragedy of others by our island nature and by the repetitive shape and form of the stories the shape does not change there was a human being who was born lived and then by some means or another died there you may fill in the details from your own experience as unoriginal as any other tale as unique as any other life lives are snowflakes forming patterns we have seen before as like one another as peas in a pod but still unique without individuals we see only numbers a thousand dead a hundred thousand dead casualties may rise to a million with individual stories the statistics become people but even that is a lie for the people continue to suffer in numbers that themselves are numbing and meaningless look see the childs swollen swollen belly and the flies that crawl at the corners of his eyes his skeletal limbs will it make it easier for you to know his name his age his dreams his fears to see him from the inside and if it does are we not doing a disservice to his sister who lies in the searing dust beside him a distorted distended caricature of a human child and there if we feel for them are they now more important to us than a thousand other children touched by the same famine a thousand other young lives who will soon be food for the flies own myriad squirming children american gods we draw our lines around these moments of pain and remain upon our islands and they cannot hurt us they are covered with a smooth safe nacreous layer to let them slip pearllike from our souls without real pain fiction allows us to slide into these other heads these other places and look out through other eyes and then in the tale we stop before we die or we die vicariously and unharmed and in the world beyond the tale we turn the page or close the book and we resume our lives a life that is like any other unlike any other and the simple truth is this there was a girl and her uncle sold her this is what they used to say where the girl came from no man may be certain who fathered a child but the mother ah that you could be certain of lineage and property was something that moved in the matrilineal line but power remained in the hands of the men a man had complete ownership of his sisters children there was a war in that place and it was a small war no more than a skirmish between the men oftwo rival villages it was almost an argument one village won the argument one village lost it t life as a commodity people as possessions enslavement had been part of the culture of those parts for thousands of years the arab slavers had destroyed the last of the great kingdoms of east africa while me west african nations had destroyed each other there was nothing untoward or unusual about their uncle selling the twins although twins were considered magical beings and their uncle was scared of them scared enough that he did not tell them that they were to be sold in case they harmed his shadow and killed him they were twelve years old she was called wututu the messenger bird he was called agasu the name of a dead king they were healthy children and because they were twins male and female they were told many things about the gods and be neil caiman cause they were twins they listened to the things that they were told and they remembered their uncle was a fat and lazy man if he had owned more cattle perhaps he would have given up one of his cattle instead of the children but he did not he sold the twins enough of him he shall not enter further into this narrative we follow the twins they were marched with several other slaves taken or sold in the war for a dozen miles to a small outpost here they were traded and the twins along with thirteen others were bought by six men with spears and knives who marched them to the west toward the sea and then for many miles along the coast there were fifteen slaves now altogether their hands loosely bound tied neck to neck wututu asked her brother agasu what would happen to them i do not know he said agasu was a boy who smiled often his teeth were white and perfect and he showed them as he grinned his happy smiles making wututu happy in her turn he was not smiling now instead he tried to show bravery for his sister his head back and shoulders spread as proud as menacing as comical as a puppy with its hackles raised the man in the line behind wututu his cheeks scarred said they will sell us to the white devils who will take us to their home across the water and what will they do to us there demanded wututu the man said nothing well asked wututu agasu tried to dart a glance over his shoulder they were not allowed to talk or sing as they walked it is possible they will eat us said the man that is what i have been told that is why they need so many slaves it is because they are always hungry wututu began to cry as she walked agasu said do not american gods cry my sister they will not eat you i shall protect you our gods will protect you but wututu continued to cry walking with a heavy heart feeling pain and anger and fear as only a child can feel it raw and overwhelming she was unable to tell agasu that she was not worried about the white devils eating her she would survive she was certain of it she cried because she was scared that they would eat her brother and she was not certain that she could protect him they reached a trading post and they were kept there for ten days on the morning of the tenth day they were taken from the hut in which they had been imprisoned they were marched to the harbor and wututu saw the ship that was to take them away her first thought was how big a ship it was her second that it was too small for all of them to fit inside it sat lightly on the water the ships boat came back and forth ferrying the captives to the ship where they were manacled and arranged in low decks by sailors some of whom were brick red or tanskinned with strange pointy noses and beards that made them look like beasts several of the sailors looked like her own people like the men who had marched her to the coast the men and the wornem and the children were separated forced into different areas on the slave deck there were too many slaves for the ship to hold easily so another dozen men were chained up on the deck in the open beneath the places where the crew would sling their hammocks wututu was put in with the children not with the women and she was not chained merely locked in agasu her brother was forced in with the men in chains packed like herrings it stank under that deck although the crew had scrubbed it down since their last cargo it was a stink that neil caiman had entered the wood the smell of fear and bile and diarrhea and death of fever and madness and hate wututu sat in the hot hold with the other children she could feel the children on each side of her sweating a wave tumbled a small boy into her hard and he apologized in a tongue that wututu did not recognize she tried to smile at him in the semidarkness the ship set sail now it rode heavy in the water wututu wondered about the place the white men came from were they so short of food that they had to send all the way to her land for people to eat or was it that she was to be a delicacy a rare treat for a people who had eaten so many things that only blackskinned flesh in their cookpots made their mouths water on the second day out of port the ship hit a squall not a bad one but the ships decks lurched and tumbled and the smell of vomit joined the mixed smells of urine and liquid feces and fearsweat rain poured down on them in bucketloads from the air gratings set in the ceiling of the slave deck a week into the voyage and well out of sight of land the slaves were allowed out of irons they were warned that any disobedience any trouble and they would be punished more than they had ever imagined in the morning the captives were fed beans and ships biscuits and a mouthful each of vinegared lime juice harsh enough that their faces would twist and they would cough and splutter and some of them would moan and wail as the lime juice was spooned out they could not spit it out though if they were caught spitting or dribbling it out they were lashed or beaten the night brought them salted beef it tasted unpleasant and there was a rainbow sheen to the gray surface of the american gods meat that was at the start of the voyage as the voyage continued the meat grew worse when they could wututu and agasu would huddle together talking of their mother and their home and their playfellows sometimes wututu would tell agasu the stories their mother had told them like those of elegba the trickiest of the gods who wa s great mawus eyes and ears in the world who took messages to mawu and brought back mawus replies in the evenings to while away the monotony of the voyage the sailors would make the slaves sing for them and dance the dances of their native lands wututu was lucky that she had been put in with the children the childrenwere packed in tightly and ignored the women were not always so fortunate on some slave ships the female slaves were raped repeatedly by the crew simply as an unspoken perquisite of the voyage this was not one of those ships which is not to say that there were no rapes a hundred men women and children died on that voyage and were dropped over the side and some of the captives who were dropped over the side had not yeit died but the green chill of the ocean cooled their final fevgr and they went down flailing choking lost wututu and agasu were traveling on adutch ship but they did not know this and it might as eajily have been british or portuguese or spanish or french the black crewmen on the ship their skins even darker than wututus told the captives where to go what to do when to dance one morning wututu caught one of the black guards staring at her when she was eating the man came over to her and stared down at her without saying anything why do you do this she asked the man why do you serve the white devils he grinned at her as if her question was the funniest neil caiman thing he had ever heard then he leaned over so his lips were almost brushing her ears so his hot breath on her ear made her suddenly feel sick if you were older he told her i would make you scream with happiness from my penis perhaps i will do it tonight i have seen how well you dance t she looked at him with her nutbrown eyes and she said unflinching smiling even if you put it in me down there i will bite it off with my teeth down there i am a witch girl and i have very sharp teeth down there she took pleasure in watching his expression change he said nothing and walked away the words had come out of her mouth but they had not been her words she had not thought them or made them no she realized those were the words of elegba the trickster mawu had made the world and then thanks to elegbas trickery had lost interest in it it was elegba of the clever ways and the ironhard erection who had spoken through her who had ridden her for a moment and that night before she slept she gave thanks to elegba several of the captives refused to eat they were whipped until they put food into their mouths and swallowed although the whipping was severe enough that two men died of it still no one else on the ship tried to starve themselves to freedom a man and a woman tried to kill themselves by leaping over the side the woman succeeded the man was rescued and he was tied to the mast and lashed for the better part of a day until his back ran with blood and he was left there as the day became night he was given no food to eat and nothing to drink but his own piss by the third day he was raving and his head had swollen and grown soft like an old melon when he stopped raving they threw him over the side also for five days following the escape attempt the captives were returned to then manacles and chains it was a long journey and a bad one for the captives and american gods it was not pleasant for the crew although they had learned to harden their hearts to the business and pretended to themselves that they were no more than farmers taking their livestock to the market they made harbor on a pleasant balmy day in bridgeport barbados and the captives were carried from the ship to the shore in low boats sent out from the dock and taken to the market square where they were by dint of a certain amount of shouting and blows from cudgels arranged into lines a whistle blew and the market square filled with men poking prodding redfaced men snouting inspecting calling appraising grumbling wututu and agasu were separated then it happened so fasta big man forced open agasus mouth looked at his teeth felt his arm muscles nodded and two other men hauled agasu away he did not fight them he looked at wututu and called be brave to her she nodded and then her vision smeared and blurred with tears and she wailed together they were twins magical powerful apart they were two children in pain she never saw him again but once and neverjn life this is what happened to agasu first theylook him to a seasoning farm where they whipped him daily for the things he did and didnt do they taught him a smattering of english and they gave him the name of inj y jack for the darkness of his skin when he ran away they hunted him down with dogs and brought him back and cut off a toe with a chisel to teach him a lesson he would not forget he would have starved himself to death but when he refused to eat his front teeth were broken and thin gruel was forced into his mouth until he had no choice but to swallow or to choke even in those times they preferred slaves born into captivity to those brought over from africa the freeborn slaves tried to run or they tried to die and either way there went the profits neil caiman when inky jack was sixteen he was sold with several other slaves to a sugar plantation on the island of st domingue they called him hyacinth the big brokentoothed slave he met an old woman from his own village on that plantationshe had been a house slave before her fingers became too gnarled and arthriticwho tom him that the whites intentionally split up captives from the same towns and villages and regions to avoid insurrection and revolts they did not like it when slaves spoke to each other in their own languages hyacinth learned some french and was taught a few of the teachings of the catholic church each day he cut sugarcane from well before the sun rose until after the sun had set he fathered several children he went with the other slaves in the small hours of the night to the woods although it was forbidden to dance the calinda to sing to damballawedo the serpent god in the form of a black snake he sang to elegba to ogu shango zaka and to many others all the gods the captives had brought with them to the island brought in their minds and their secret hearts the slaves on the sugar plantations of st domingue rarely lived more than a decade the free time they were giventwo hours in the heat of noon and five hours in the dark of the night was also the only time they had to grow and tend the food they would eat and it was also the time they had to sleep and to dream even so they would take that time and they would gather and dance and sing and worship the soil of st domingue was a fertile soil and the gods of dahomey and the congo and the niger put down thick roots there and grew lush and huge and deep and they promised freedom to those who worshiped them at night in the groves hyacinth was twentyfive years of age when a spider bit american gods the back of his right hand the bite became infected and the flesh on the back of his hand was necrotic soon enough his whole arm was swollen and purple and the hand stank it throbbed and it burned they gave him crude rum to drink and they heated the blade of a machete hi the fire until it glowed red and white they cut his arm off at the shoulder with a saw and they cauterized it with the burning blade he lay in a fever for a week then he returned to work the onearmed slave called hyacinth took part in the slave revolt of elegba himself took possession of hyacinth in the grove riding him as a white man rode a horse and spoke through him he remembered little of what was said but the others who were with him told him that he had promised them freedom from their captivity he remembered only his erection rodlike and painful and raising both handsthe one he had and the one he no longer possessedto the moon a pig was killed and the men and the women of that plantation drank the hot blood of the pig pledging themselves and binding themselves into a brotherhood they swore that they were an army of freedomrpledged themselves once more to the gods of all the lands from which they had been dragged as plunder if we die in battle with the whites twfy told each other we will be reborn in africa in our homes in our own tribes there was another hyacinth in the uprising so they now called agasu by the name of big onearm he fought he worshiped he sacrificed he planned he saw his friends and his lovers killed and he kept fighting they fought for twelve years a maddening bloody struggle with the plantation owners with the troops brought over from france they fought and they kept fighting and impossibly they won on january the independence of st domingue neil caiman soon to be known to the world as the republic of haiti was declared big oneann did not live to see it he had died in august bayoneted by a french soldier at the precise moment of the death of big onearm his sister whom he had known as wututu who had been called mary on her first plantation in the carolinas and daisy when she had become a house slave and sukey when she was sold to the lavere family down the river to new orleans felt the cold bayonet slide between her ribs and started to scream and weep uncontrollably her twin daughters woke and began to howl they were creamandcoffee colored her new babies not like the black children she had borne when she was on the plantation and little more than a girl herself children she had not seen since they were fifteen and ten years old the middle girl had been dead for a year when she was sold away from them sukey had been whipped many times since she had come ashoreonce salt had been rubbed into the wounds on another occasion she had been whipped so hard and for so long that she could not sit or allow anything to touch her back for several days she had been raped a number of times when younger by black men who had been ordered to share her wooden palette and by white men she had been chained she had not wept then though since her brother had been taken from her she had only wept once it was in north carolina when she had seen the food for the slave children and the dogs poured into the same trough and she had seen her little children scrabbling with the dogs for the scraps she saw that happen one dayand she had seen it before every day on that plantation and she would see it again many times before she leftshe saw it that one day and it broke her heart she had been beautiful for a while then the years of pain had taken their toll and she was no longer beautiful american gods her face was lined and there was too much pain in those brown eyes eleven years earlier when she was twentyfive her right arm had withered none of the white folk had known what to make of it the flesh seemed to melt from the bones and now her right arm hung by her side little more than a skeletal arm covered in skin and almost immobile after this she had become a house slave the casterton family who had owned the plantation were impressed by her cooking and house skills but mrs casterton found the withered arm unsettling and so she was sold to the lavere family who were out for a year from louisiana m lavere was a fat cheerful man who was in need of a cook and a maid of all work and who was not in the slightest repulsed by the slave daisys withered arm when a year later they returned to louisiana slave sukey went with them in new orleans the women came to her and the men also to buy cures and love charms and little fetishes black folks yes of course but white folks too thelavere family turned a blind eye to it perhaps they enjoyed theprestige of having a slave who was feared and respected they would not however sell her her freedom sukey went into the bayou late at night and she danced the calinda and the bamboula like the dancers of st domingue and the dancers of her native land trie dancers in the bayou had a black snake as their voudon even so the gods of her homeland and of the other african nations did not possess her people as they had possessed her brother and the folk of st domingue she would still invoke them and call their names to beg them for favors she listened when the white folk spoke of the revolt in st domingo and how it was doomed to failthink of it a cannibal landand then she observed that they no longer spoke of it soon it seemed to her that they pretended that there neil caiman never had been a place called st domingo and as for haiti the word was never mentioned it was as if the whole american nation had decided that they could by an effort of belief command a goodsized caribbean island to no longer exist merely by willing it so a generation of lavere children grew up under ukeys watchful eye the youngest unable to say sukey as a child had called her mama zouzou and the name had stuck now the year was and sukey was in her midfifties she looked much older she knew more of the secrets than old sanit ddј who sold candies in front of the cabildo more than marie saloppe who called herself the voodoo queen both were free women of color while mama zouzou was a slave and would die a slave or so her master had said the young woman who came to her to find what had happened to her husband styled herself the widow paris she was highbreasted and young and proud she had african blood in her and european blood and indian blood her skin was reddish her hair was a gleaming black her eyes were black and haughty her husbandjacques paris was perhaps dead he was threequarters white as these things were calculated and the bastard of a onceproud family one of the many immigrants who had fled from st domingo and as freeborn as his striking young wife my jacques is he dead asked the widow paris she was a hairdresser who went from home to home arranging the coiffures of the elegant ladies of new orleans before their demanding social engagements mama zouzou consulted the bones then shook her head he is with a white woman somewhere north of here she said a white woman with golden hair he is alive this was not magic it was common knowledge in new orleans just with whom jacques paris had run off and the color of her hair american gods mama zouzou was surprised to realize that the widow paris did not already know that her jacques was sticking his quadroon little pipi into a pinkskinned girl up in colfax every night well on the nights that he was not so drunk that he could use it for nothing better than pissing perhaps she knew perhaps she had another reason for coming the widow paris came to see the old slave woman one or two times a week after a month she brought gifts for the old woman hair ribbons and a seedcake and a black rooster mama zouzou said the girl it is time for you to teach me what you know yes said mama zouzou who knew which way the wind blew and besides the widow paris had confessed that she had been born with webbed toes which meant that she was a twin and she had killed her twin in the womb what choice did mama zouzou have she taught the girl that two nutmegs hung upon a string around the neck until the string breaks will cure heart murmurs while a pigeon that has never flown cpt open and laid on the patients head will draw a fever she shbwed her how to make a wishing bag a small leather bagetmtaining thirteen pennies nine cotton seeds and the bristles of a black hog and how to rub the bag to make wishes come true b the widow paris learned everything that mama zouzou told her she had no real interest in the gods though not really her interests were in the practicalities she was delighted to learn that if you dip a live frog in honey and place it in an ants nest then when the bones are cleaned and white a close examination will reveal a flat heartshaped bone and another with a hook on it the bone with the hook on it must be hooked onto the garment of the one you wish to love you while the heartshaped bone must be kept safely infallibly if you do this the one you love will be yours neil caiman she learned that dried snake powder placed in the face powder of an enemy will produce blindness and that an enemy can be made to drown herself by taking a piece of her underwear turning it inside out and burying it at midnight under a brick mama zouzou showed the widow paris the wodd won der root the great and the little roots of john the conqueror she showed her dragons blood and valerian and fivefinger grass she showed her how to brew wasteaway tea and followmewater and faireshingo water all these things and more mama zouzou showed the widow paris still it was disappointing for the old woman she did her best to teach her the hidden truths the deep knowledge to tell her of papa legba of mawu of aidohwedo the voudon serpent and the rest but the widow paris she had no interest in the gods of the distant land if st domingo had been a lush black earth for the african gods to grow in this land with its corn and its melons its crawfish and its cotton was barren and infertile she does not want to know complained mama zouzou to clementine her confidante who took in the washing for many of the houses in that district washing their curtains and coverlets clementine had a blossom of bums on her cheek and one of her children had been scalded to death when a copper overturned then do not teach her says clementine i teach her but she does not see what is valuableall she sees is what she can do with it i give her diamonds but she cares only for pretty glass i give her a demibouteille of the best claret and she drinks river water i give her quail and she wishes to eat only rat then why do you persist asks clementine american gods mama zouzou shrugs her thin shoulders causing her withered arm to shake she cannot answer she could say that she teaches because she is grateful to be alive and she is she has seen too many die she could say that she dreams that one day the slaves will rise as they rose in laplace but that she knows in her heart that without the gods of africa without the favor of legba and mawu they will never overcome their white captors will never return to their homelands when she woke on that terrible night almost twenty years earlier and felt the cold steel between her ribs that was when mama zouzous life had ended now she was someone who did not live who simply hated if you asked her about the hate she would have been unable to tell you about a twelveyearold girl on a stinking ship that had scabbed over in her mindthere had been too many whippings and beatings too many nights in manacles too many partings too much pain she could have told you about her son though and how his thumb had been cut off when their master discovered the boy was able to read and to write she could have told you of her daughter ftweiveyears old and already eight months pregnant by an overseer and how they dug a hole in the red earth to take herdaughters pregnant belly and then they whipped her until her back had bled despite the carefully dug hole her daughter had lost her baby and her life on a sunday morning when all the white folks were in church too much pain worship them mama zouzou told the young widow paris in the bayou one hour after midnight they were both naked to the waist sweating in the humid night their skins given accents by the white moonlight the widow pariss husband jacques had told marie a little about the gods of st domingo but neilgaiman she did not care power came from the rituals not from the gods together mama zouzou and the widow paris crooned and stamped and keened in the swamp they were singing in the blacksnakes the free woman of color and the slave woman with the withered arm t there is more to it than just you prosper your enemies fail said mama zouzou many of the words of the ceremonies words she knew once words her brother had also known these words had fled from her memory she told pretty marie laveau that the words did not matter only the tunes and the beats and there singing and tapping in the blacksnakes in the swamp she has an odd vision she sees the beats of the songs the calinda beat the bamboula beat all the rhythms of equatorial africa spreading slowly across this midnight land until the whole country shivers and swings to the beats of the old gods whose realms she had left and even that she understands somehow in the swamp even that will not be enough she turns to pretty marie and sees herself through maries eyes a blackskinned old woman her face lined her bony arm hanging stiffly by her side her eyes the eyes of one who has seen her children fight in the trough for food from the dogs she sawherself and she knew men for the first time the revulsion and the fear the younger woman had for her then she laughed and crouched and picked up in her good hand a blacksnake as tall as a sapling and as thick as a ships rope here she said here will be our voudon she dropped the unresisting snake into a basket that yellow marie was carrying and then in the moonlight the second sight possessed her for a final time and she saw her brother agasu he was not the twelveyearold boy she had last seen in the bridge americangods port market but a huge man bald and grinning with broken teeth his back lined with deep scars in one hand he held a machete his right arm was barely a stump she reached out her own good left hand stay stay awhile she whispered i will be there i will be with you soon and marie paris thought the old woman was speaking to her chapter twelve america has invested her religion as well as her morality in sound incomepaying securities she has adopted the unassailable position of a nation blessed because it deserves to be blessed and her sons whatever other theologies they may affect or disregard subscribe unreservedly to this national creed agnes repplier times and tendencies shadow drove west across wisconsin and minnesota and into north dakota where the snowcovered hills looked like huge sleeping buffalo and he and wednesday saw nothing but nothing and plenty of it for mile after mile they went south then into south dakota heading for reservation country wednesday had traded the lincoln town car which shadow had liked to drive for a lumbering and ancient winnebago which smelled pervasively and unmistakably of male cat which he didnt enjoy driving at all as they passed their first signpost for mount rushmore still several hundred miles away wednesday grunted now that he said is a holy place shadow had thought wednesday was asleep he said i know it used to be sacred to the indians its a holy place said wednesday thats the american waythey need to give people an excuse to come and american gods worship these days people cant just go and see a mountain thus mister gutzon borglums tremendous presidential faces once they were carved permission was granted and now the people drive out in their multitudes to see something in the flesh that theyve already seen on a thousand postcards i knew a guy once he did weight training at the muscle farm years back he said that the dakota indians the young men climb up the mountain then form deathdefying human chains off the heads just so that the guy at the end of the chain can piss on the presidents nose wednesday guffawed oh fine very fine is any specific president the particular butt of then ire shadow shrugged he never said miles vanished beneath the wheels of the winnebago shadow began to imagine that he was staying still while the american landscape moved past them at a steady sixtyseven miles per hour a wintry mist fogged the edges of things it was midday on the second day of the drive and they were almost there shadow who had been thinking said a girl vanished from lakeside last weekfwhen we were in san francisco mm wednesday sounded barely interested kid named alison mcgovern shis not the first kid to vanish there there have been others they go in the wintertime wednesday furrowed his brow it is a tragedy is it not the little faces on the milk cartonsalthough i cant remember the last time i saw a kid on a milk cartonand on the walls of freeway rest areas have you seen me they ask a deeply existential question at the best of times have you seen me pull off at the next exit shadow thought he heard a helicopter pass overhead but the clouds were too low to see anything neil caiman why did

glanced into the mirror there were headlights behind them under a mile back are you sure about this he asked wednesday snorted sure as eggs is eggs he said as the turkey farmer said when he hatched his first turtle ah success and from the bottom of a pocket he produced a small piece of white chalk he started to scratch with the chalk on the dashboard of the camper making marks as if he were solving an algebraic puzzleor perhaps shadow thought as if he were a hobo scratching long messages to the other hobos in hobo codebad dog here dangerous town nice woman soft jail in which to overnight okay said wednesday now increase your speed to thirty and dont slow down from that american gods one of the cars behind them turned on its lights and siren and accelerated toward them do not slow down repeated wednesday they just want us to slow before we get to the roadblock scratch scratch scratch they crested the hill the roadblock was less than a quarter of a mile away twelve cars arranged across the road and on the side of the road police cars and several big black suvs there said wednesday and he put his chalk away the dashboard of the winnebago was now covered with runelike scratchings the car with the siren was just behind them it had slowed to their speed and an amplified voice was shouting pull over shadow looked at wednesday turn right said wednesday just pull off the road i cant take this thing offroad well tip itll be fine take a right now shadow pulled the wheel down with his right hand and the winnebago lurched and jolted for a moment he thought he had been correct that the camper was going to tip and then the world through the windshield dissolved and shimmered like the reflection in a cleay pool when the wind brushes the surface the clouds and the mist and the snow and the day were gone now there were stars overhead hanging like frozen spears of light stabbing the night sky park here said wednesday we can walk the rest of the way shadow turned off the engine he went into the back of the winnebago pulled on his coat his boots and gloves then he climbed out of the vehicle and said okay lets go wednesday looked at him with amusement and something elseirritation perhaps or pride why dont you argue asked wednesday why dont you exclaim that its all impossible whythe hell do you just do what i say and take it all so fucking calmly neil caiman because youre not paying me to ask questions said shadow and then he said realizing the truth as the words came out of his mouth anyway nothings really surprised me since laura since she came back from the dead since i learned she was screwing robbie that oneaurt everything else just sits on the surface where are we going now wednesday pointed and they began to walk the ground beneath their feet was rock of some kind slick and volcanic occasionally glassy the air was chilly but not wintercold they sidestepped their way awkwardly down a hill there was a rough path and they followed it shadow looked down to the bottom of the hill what the hell is that asked shadow but wednesday touched his finger to his lips shook his head sharply silence it looked like a mechanical spider blue metal glittering led lights and it was the size of a tractor it squatted at the bottom of the hill beyond it were an assortment of bones each with a flame beside it little bigger than a candleflame flickering wednesday gestured for shadow to keep his distance from these objects shadow took an extra step to the side which was a mistake on that glassy path as his ankle twisted and he tumbled down the slope rolling and slipping and bouncing he grabbed at a rock as he went past and the obsidian snag ripped his leather glove as if it were paper he came to rest at the bottom of the hill between the mechanical spider and the bones he put a hand down to push himself to his feet and found himself touching what appeared to be a thighbone looking at his watch there were cars all around him some empty some not he was wishing he had not had that last american gods cup of coffee for he dearly needed a piss and it was starting to become uncomfortable one of the local law enforcement people came over to him a big man with frost in his walrus mustache he had already forgotten the mans name i dont know how we could have lost them says local law enforcement apologetic and puzzled it was an optical illusion he replies you get them in freak weather conditions the mist it was a mirage they were driving down some other road we thought they were on this one local law enforcement looks disappointed oh i thought it was maybe like an xfiles kinda thing he says nothing so exciting im afraid he suffers from occasional hemorrhoids and his ass has just started itching in the way that signals that a flareup is on the way he wants to be back inside the beltway he wishes there was a tree to go and stand behind the urge to piss is getting worse he drops the cigarette and steps on it local law enforcement walks over to one of the police cars and says something to the driver they both shake their heads he pulls out his telephone touches the menu pages down and finds the address entry marked laundry which had amused him so much when he typedit in a reference to the man from uncle and as he looks at it he realizes that its not from that at all that was a tailors hes thinking of get smart and he still feels weird and slightly embarrassed after all those years about not realizing it was a comedy when he was a kid and just wanting a shoephone a womans voice on the phone yes this is mister town for mister world there is silence town crosses his legs tugs his belt higher on his belly got to lose those last ten pounds and neil caiman away from his bladder then an urbane voice says hello mister town we lost them says town he feels a knot of frustration in his gut these were the bastards the lousy duty sons of bitches who killed woody and stone for chrissakes good men good men he badly wants to fuck mrs wood but knows its still too soon after woodys death to make a move so he is taking her out for dinner every couple of weeks an investment in the future shes just grateful for the attention how i dont know we set up a roadblock there was nowhere they could have gone and they went there anyway just another one of lifes little mysteries dont worry have you calmed the locals told em it was an optical illusion they buy it probably there was something very familiar about mr worlds voicewhich was a strange thing to think hed been working for him directly for two years now spoken to him every day of course there was something familiar about his voice theyll be far away by now should we send people down to the rez to intercept them not worth the aggravation too many jurisdictional issues and there are only so many strings i can pull in a morning we have plenty of time just get back here ive got my hands full at this end trying to organize the policy meeting trouble its a pissing contest ive proposed that we have it out here the techies want it in austin or maybe san jose the players want it in hollywood the intangibles want it on wall street everybody wants it in their own backyard nobodys going to give american gods you need me to do anything not yet ill growl at some of them stroke others you know the routine yes sir carry on town the connection is broken town thinks he should have had a swat team to pick off that fucking winnebago or land mines on the road or a tactical friggin nukuler device that would have showed those bastards they meant business it was like mr world had once said to him we are writing the future in letters of fire and mr town thinks that jesus christ if he doesnt piss now hell lose a kidney itll just burst and it was like his pop had said when they were on long journeys when town was a kid out on the interstate his pop would always say my back teeth are afloat and mr town could hear that voice even now that sharp yankee accent saying i got to take a leak soon my back teeth are afloat and it was then that shadow felt a hand opening his own hand prising it open one finger at a time off the thighbone it was clutching he no longer needed to innate that was someone else he was standing under trtetstars on a glassy rock plain wednesday made the signal for silence again then he began to walk and shadow followed there was a creak from the mechanical spider and wednesday froze shadow stopped and waited with him green lights flickered and ran up and along its side in clusters shadow tried not to breathe too loudly he thought about what had just happened it had been like looking through a window into someone elses mind and then he thought mr world it was me who thought his voice sounded familiar that was my thought not towns that was why that seemed so strange he tried to identify the voice in his mind to put it into the category in which it belonged but it eluded him neil caiman itll come to me thought shadow sooner or later itll come to me the green lights went blue then red then faded to a dull red and the spider settled down on its metallic haunches wednesday began to walk forward a lonely figure beneath the stars in a broadbrimmed hat his frayed dark cloak gusting randomly in the nowhere wind his staff tapping on the glassy rock floor when the metallic spider was only a distant glint in the starlight far back on the plain wednesday said it should be safe to speak now where are we behind the scenes said wednesday sorry think of it as being behind the scenes like in a theater or something i just pulled us out of the audience and now were walking about backstage its a shortcut when i touched that bone i was in the mind of a guy named town hes with that spook show he hates us yes hes got a boss named mister world he reminds me of someone but i dont know who i was looking into towns heador maybe i was in his head im not certain do they know where were headed i think theyre calling off the hunt right now they didnt want to follow us to the reservation are we going to a reservation maybe wednesday leaned on his staff for a moment then continued to walk what was that spider thing a pattern manifestation a search engine are they dangerous you only get to be my age by assuming the worst shadow smiled and how old would that be old as my tongue said wednesday and a few months older than my teeth american gods you play your cards so close to your chest said shadow that im not even sure that theyre really cards at all wednesday only grunted each hill they came to was harder to climb shadow began to feel headachy there was a pounding quality to the starlight something that resonated with the pulse in his temples and his chest at the bottom of the next hill he stumbled opened his mouth to say something and without warning he vomited wednesday reached into an inside pocket and produced a small hip flask take a sip of this he said only a sip the liquid was pungent and it evaporated in his mouth like a good brandy although it did not taste like alcohol wednesday took the flask away and pocketed it its not good for the audience to find themselves walking about backstage thats why youre feeling sick we need to hurry to get you out of here they walked faster wednesday at a solid trudge shadow stumbling from time to time but feeling better for the drink which had left his mouth tasting of orange peel of rosemary oil and peppermint and cloves wednesday took his arm there he said pointing to two identical hillocks of frozen rockglass to their left walk between those two mounds walk beside me they walked and the cold air and bright daylight smashed into shadows face at the same time they were standing halfway up a gentle hill the mist had gone the day was sunny and chill the sky was a perfect blue at the bottom of the hill was a gravel road and a red station wagon bounced along it like a childs toy car a gust of wood smoke came from a building nearby it looked as if someone had picked up a mobile home and dropped it on the side of the hill thirty years ago the home was much repaired patched and in places added onto as they reached the door it opened and a middleaged neil caiman man with sharp eyes and a mouth like a knife slash looked down at them and said eyah i heard that there were two white men on their way to see me two whites in a winnebago and i heard that they got lost like white men always get lost if they dont put up their signs everywhere and now look at these two sorry beasts at the door you know youre on lakota land his hair was gray and long since when were you lakota you old fraud said wednesday he was wearing a coat and a flapeared cap and already it seemed to shadow unlikely that only a few moments ago under the stars he had been wearing a broadbrimmed hat and a tattered cloak so whiskey jack im starving and my friend here just threw up his breakfast are you going to invite us in whiskey jack scratched an armpit he was wearing blue jeans and an undershirt the gray of his hair he wore moccasins and he seemed not to notice the cold then he said i like it here come in white men who lost their winnebago there was more wood smoke in the air inside the trailer and there was another man in there sitting at a table the man wore stained buckskins and was barefoot his skin was the color of bark wednesday seemed delighted well he said it seems our delay was fortuitous whiskey jack and apple johnny two birds with one stone the man at the table apple johnny stared at wednesday then he reached down a hand to his crotch cupped it and said wrong again i jes checked and i got both of my stones jes where they oughtta be he looked up at shadow raised his hand palm out im john chapman you dont mind anything your boss says about me hes an asshole always was an asshole always goin to be an asshole some people is jes assholes and thats an end of it mike ainsel said shadow chapman rubbed his stubbly chin ainsel he said american gods thats not a name but itll do at a pinch what do they call you shadow ill call you shadow then hey whiskey jackbut it wasnt really whiskey jack he was saying shadow realized too many syllables hows the food looking whiskey jack took a wooden spoon and lifted the lid off a black iron pot bubbling away on the range of the woodburning stove its ready for eating he said he took four plastic bowls and spooned the contents of the pot into the bowls put them down on the table then he opened the door stepped out into the snow and pulled a plastic gallon jug from the snowbank he brought it inside and poured four large glasses of a cloudy yellowbrown liquid which he put beside each bowl last of all he found four spoons he sat down at the table with the other men wednesday raised his glass suspiciously looks like piss he said you still drinking that stuff asked whiskey jack you white men are crazy this is better then to shadow the stew is mostly wild turkey john here brought the applejack its a soft apple cider said john chapman i never believed in hard liquor makes men mad the stew was delicious and it was very gjfcod apple cider shadow forced himself to slow down to chew his food not to gulp it but he was more hungry than he would have believed he helped himself to a second bowl of the stew and a second glass of the cider dame rumor says that youve been out talking to all manner of folk offering them all manner of things says youre takin the old folks on the warpath said john chapman shadow and whiskey jack were washing up putting the leftover stew into tupperware bowls whiskey jack put the bowls into the snowdrifts outside his front door and put neil caiman a milk crate on top of the place hed pushed them so he could find them again i think mats a fair and judicious summary of events said wednesday theyll win said whiskey jack flatly they won already you lost already like the white man and my people mostly they won and when they lost they made treaties then they broke the treaties so they won again im not fighting for another lost cause and its no use you lookin at me said john chapman for even if i fought for youwhichn i wontim no use to you mangy rattailed bastards jes picked me off and clean forgot me he stopped then he said paul bunyan he shook his head slowly and he said it again paul bunyan shadow had never heard two such innocuous words made to sound so damning paul bunyan shadow said what did he ever do he took up head space said whiskey jack he bummed a cigarette from wednesday and the two men sat and smoked its like the idiots who figure that hummingbirds worry about their weight or tooth decay or some such nonsense maybe they just want to spare hummingbirds the evils of sugar explained wednesday so they fill the hummingbird feeders with fucking nutrasweet the birds come to the feeders and they drink it then they die because their food contains no calories even though their little tummies are full thats paul bunyan for you nobody ever told paul bunyan stories nobody ever believed in paul bunyan he came staggering out of a new york ad agency in and filled the nations myth stomach with empty calories i like paul bunyan said whiskey jack i went on his ride at the mall of america few years back you see big old paul bunyan at the top then you come crashing down splash hes okay by me i dont mind that he never ex americangods isted means he never cut down any trees not as good as planting trees though thats better you said a mouthful said johnny chapman wednesday blew a smoke ring it hung in the air dissipating slowly in wisps and curls damn it whiskey jack thats not the point and you know it im not going to help you said whiskey jack when you get your ass kicked you can come back here and if im still here ill feed you again you get the best food in the fall wednesday said all the alternatives are worse you have no idea what the alternatives are said whiskey jack then he looked at shadow you are hunting he said his voice was roughened by wood smoke and cigarettes im working said shadow whiskey jack shook his head you are also hunting something he said there is a debt that you wish to pay shadow thought of lauras blue lips and the blood on her hands and he nodded listen fox was here first and his brothewas the wolf fox said people will live forever if they fe they will not die for long wolf said no people will die people must die all things that live must die or they will spread and cover the world and eat all the salmon and thje caribou and the buffalo eat all the squash and all the corn now one day wolf died and he said to the fox quick bring me back to life and fox said no the dead must stay dead you convinced me and he wept as he said this but he said it and it was final now wolf rules the world of the dead and fox lives always under the sun and the moon and he still mourns his brother wednesday said if you wont play you wont play well be moving on whiskey jacks face was impassive im talking to this neil caiman young man he said you are beyond help he is not he turned back to shadow tell me your dream said whiskey jack shadow said i was climbing a tower of skulls there were huge birds flying around it they had lightning in their wings they were attacking me the tower fell everybody dreams said wednesday can we hit the road not everybody dreams of the wakinyau the thunderbird said whiskey jack we felt the echoes of it here i told you said wednesday jesus theres a clutch of thunderbirds in west virginia said chapman idly a couple of hens and an old cockbird at least theres also a breeding pair in the land they used to call it the state of franklin but old ben never got his state up between kentucky and tennessee course there was never a great number of them even at the best of times whiskey jack reached out a hand the color of red clay and touched shadows face gently eyah he said its true if you hunt the thunderbird you could bring your woman back but she belongs to the wolf in the dead places not walking the land how do you knowt asked shadow whiskey jacks lips did not move what did the buffalo tell you to believe good advice are you going to follow it kind of i guess they were talking without words without mouths without sound shadow wondered if for the other two men in the room they were standing unmoving for a heartbeat or for a fraction of a heartbeat when you find your tribe come back and see me said whiskey jack i can help i shall whiskey jack lowered his hand then he turned to wednesday are you going to fetch your ho chunk american gods my what ho chunk its what the winnebago call themselves wednesday shook his head its too risky retrieving it could be problematic theyll be looking for it is it stolen wednesday looked affronted not a bit of it the papers are in the glove compartment and the keys ive got them said shadow my nephew harry bluejay has an buick why dont you give me the keys to your camper you can take his car wednesday bristled what kind of trade is that whiskey jack shrugged you know how hard it will be to bring back your camper from where you abandoned it im doing you a favor take it or leave it i dont care he closed his knifewound mouth wednesday looked angry and then the anger became rue and he said shadow give the man the keys to the winnebago shadow passed the car keys to whiskey jack johnny said whiskey jack will you take these men down to find harry bluejay tell him i said feriiim to give them his car be my pleasure said john chapman he got up and walked to the door picked up a small burlap sack sitting next to it opened the door and walked outside shadow and wednesday followed him whiskey jack waited in the doorway hey he said to wednesday dont come back here you you are not welcome wednesday extended his finger heavenward rotate on this he said affably they walked downhill through the snow pushing their way through the drifts chapman walked in front his bare feet red against the crusttopped snow arent you cold asked shadow my wife was choctaw said chapman neil caiman and she taught you mystical ways to keep out the cold nope she thought i was crazy said chapman she used tsay johnny why dont you jes put on boots the slope of the hill became steeper and they were forced to stop talking the three men stumbled and slipped on the snow using the trunks of birch trees on the hillside to steady themselves and to stop themselves from falling when the ground became slightly more level chapman said shes dead now acourse when she died i guess maybe i went a mite crazy it could happen to anyone it could happen to you he clapped shadow on the arm by jesus and jehosophat youre a big man so they tell me said shadow they trudged down that hill for about half an hour until they reached the gravel road that wound around the base of it and the three men began to walk along it toward the cluster of buildings they had seen from high on the hill a car slowed and stopped the woman driving it reached over wound down the passenger window and said you bozos need a ride you are very gracious madam said wednesday were looking for a mister harry bluejay hell be down at the rec hall said the woman she was in her forties shadow guessed get in they got in wednesday took the passenger seat john chapman and shadow climbed into the back shadows legs were too long to sit in the back comfortably but he did the best he could the car jolted forward down the gravel road so where did you three come from asked the driver just visiting with a friend said wednesday lives on the hill back there said shadow what hill she asked shadow looked back through the dusty rear window looking back at the hill but there was no high hill back there nothing but clouds on the plains american gods whiskey jack he said ah she said we call him inktomi here i think its the same guy my grandfather used to tell some pretty good stories about him of course all the best of them were kind of dirty they hit a bump in the road and the woman swore you okay back there yes maam said johnny chapman he was holding onto the backseat with both hands rez roads she said you get used to them are they all like this asked shadow pretty much said the woman all the ones around here and dont you go asking about all the money from casinos because who in their right mind wants to come all the way out here to go to a casino we dont see none of that money out here im sorry dont be she changed gear with a crash and a groan you know the white population all around here is falling you go out there you find ghost towns how you going to keep them down on the farm after they seen the world on their television screens and its not worthjcnyones while to farm the badlands anyhow they tookourtands they settled here now theyre leaving they go south they go west maybe if we wait for enough of them to move to new york and miami and la we can take thf whole of the middle back without a fight good luck said shadow they found harry bluejay in the rec hall at the pool table doing trick shots to impress a group of several girls he had a blue jay tattooed on the back of his right hand and multiple piercings in his right ear ho hoka harry bluejay said john chapman fuck off you crazy barefoot white ghost said harry bluejay conversationally you give me the creeps there were older men at the far end of the room some of them playing cards some of them talking there were other neil caiman men younger men of about harry bluejays age waiting for their turn at the pool table it was a fullsized pool table and a rip in the green baize on one side had been repaired with silvergray duct tape i got a message from your uncle said chapman unfazed he says youre to give these two your car k there must have been thirty maybe even forty people in that hall and now they were every one of them looking intently at their playing cards or their feet or their fingernails and pretending as hard as they could not to be listening hes not my uncle a cigarettesmoke fug hung over the hall chapman smiled widely displaying the worst set of teeth that shadow had seen in a human mouth you want to tell your uncle that he says youre the only reason he stays among the lakota whiskey jack says a lot of things said harry bluejay petulantly but he did not say whiskey jack either it sounded almost the same to shadows ear but not quite wisakedjak he thought thats what theyre saying not whiskey jack at all shadow said yeah and one of the things he said was that were trading our winnebago for your buick i dont see a winnebago hell bring you the winnebago said john chapman you know he will harry bluejay attempted a trick shot and missed his hand was not steady enough im not the old foxs nephew said harry bluejay i wish he wouldnt say that to people better a live fox than a dead wolf said wednesday in a voice so deep it was almost a growl now will you sell us your car harry bluejay shivered visibly and violently sure he said sure i was only kidding i kid a lot me he put american gods down the pool cue on the pool table and took a thick jacket pulling it out from a cluster of similar jackets hanging from pegs by the door let me get my shit out of the car first he said he kept darting glances at wednesday as if he were concerned that the older man were about to explode harry bluejays car was parked a hundred yards away as they walked toward it they passed a small whitewashed catholic church and a man in a priests collar who stared at them from the doorway as they went past he was sucking on a cigarette as if he did not enjoy smoking it good day to you father called johnny chapman but the man in the collar made no reply he crushed his cigarette under his heel picked up the butt and dropped it into the bin beside the door and went inside harry bluejays car was missing its wing mirrors and its tires were the baldest shadow had ever seen perfectly smooth black rubber harry bluejay told them the car drank oil but as long as you kept pouring oil in it would just keep running forever unless it stopped harry bluejay filled a black garbage bag with shit from the car sorry i was jerking your chain before said harry bluejay to wednesday passing him the car keys you know when ill get the winnebago ask your uncle hes the fucking usedcar dealer growled wednesday wisakedjak is not my uncle said harry bluejay he took his black garbage bag and went into the nearest house and closed the door behind him they dropped johnny chapman in sioux falls outside a wholefood store neil caiman wednesday said nothing on the drive he was in a black sulk as he had been since they left whiskey jacks place in a family restaurant just outside st paul shadow picked up a newspaper someone else had put down he looked at it once then again then he showed it to wednesday t look at that said shadow wednesday sighed and looked down at the paper i am he said delighted that the airtraffic controllers dispute has been resolved without recourse to industrial action not that said shadow look it says its the fourteenth of february happy valentines day so we set out january the what twentieth twentyfirst i wasnt keeping track of the dates but it was the third week of january we were three days on the road all told so how is it the fourteenth of february because we walked for almost a month said wednesday in the badlands backstage hell of a shortcut said shadow wednesday pushed the paper away fucking johnny appleseed always going on about paul bunyan in real life chapman owned fourteen apple orchards he farmed thousands of acres yes he kept pace with the western frontier but theres not a story out there about him with a word of truth in it save that he went a little crazy once but it doesnt matter like the newspapers used to say if the truth isnt big enough you print die legend this country needs its legends and even the legends dont believe it anymore but you see it im a hasbeen who the fuck cares about me shadow said softly youre a god wednesday looked at him sharply he seemed to be about to say something and then he slumped back in his seat and looked down at die menu and said so american gods its a good thing to be a god said shadow is it asked wednesday and this time it was shadow who looked away in a gas station twentyfive miles outside lakeside on the wall by the rest rooms shadow saw a homemade photocopied notice a blackandwhite photo of alison mcgovern and the handwritten question have you seen me above it same yearbook photograph smiling confidently a girl with rubberband braces on her top teeth who wants to work with animals when she grows up have you seen me shadow bought a snickers bar a bottle of water and a copy of the lakeside news the abovethefold story written by marguerite olsen our lakeside reporter showed a photograph of a boy and an older man out on the frozen lake standing by an outhouselike icefishing shack and between them they were holding a big fish they were smiling father and son catch local record northern pike full story inside wednesday was driving he said read me anything interesting you find in the paper shadow looked carefully and he turned the ages slowly but he couldnt find anything wednesday dropped him off in the driveway outside his apartment a smokecolored cat stared at himtfrom the driveway then fled when he bent to stroke it shadow stopped on the wooden deck outside his apartment and looked out at the lake dotted here and there with green and brown icefishing huts many of them had cars parked beside them on the ice nearer the bridge sat the old green klunker just as it had sat in the newspaper march twentythird said shadow encouragingly round ninefifteen in the morning you can do it not a chance said a womans voice april third six pm that way the day warms up the ice shadow smiled neil caiman marguerite olsen was wearing a ski suit she was at the far end of the deck refilling the bird feeder i read your article in the lakeside news on the town record northern pike exciting huh well educational maybe i thought you werent coming back to us she said you were gone for a while huh my uncle needed me said shadow the time kind of got away from us she placed the last suet brick in its cage and began to fill a net sock with thistle seeds from a plastic milk jug several goldfinches olive in their winter coats twitted impatiently from a nearby fir tree i didnt see anything in the paper about alison mcgovern there wasnt anything to report shes still missing there was a rumor that someone had seen her in detroit but it turned out to be a false alarm poor kid marguerite olsen screwed the top back onto the gallon jug i hope shes dead she said matteroffactly shadow was shocked why because the alternatives are worse the goldfinches hopped frantically from branch to branch of the fir tree impatient for the people to be gone you arent thinking about alison thought shadow youre thinking of your son you re thinking of sandy he remembered someone saying miss sandy who was that good talking to you he said yeah she said you too february passed in a succession of short gray days some days the snow fell most days it didnt the weather american gods warmed up and on the good days it got above freezing shadow stayed in his apartment until it began to feel like a prison cell and then on the days that wednesday did not need him to travel he began to walk he would walk for much of the day long trudges out of the town he walked alone until he reached the national forest to the north and the west or the cornfields and cow pastures to the south he walked the lumber county wilderness trail and he walked along the old railroad tracks and he walked the back roads a couple of times he even walked along the frozen lake from north to south sometimes hed see locals or winter tourists or joggers and hed wave and say hi mostly he saw nobody at all just crows and finches and a few times he spotted a hawk feasting on a roadkill possum or raccoon on one memorable occasion he watched an eagle snatch a silver fish from the middle of the white pine river the water frozen at the edges but still rushing and flowing at the center the fish wriggled and jerked in the eagles talons glittering in the midday sun shadow imagined the fish freeing itself and swimming off across the sky and he smiled grimly if he walked he discovered he did not have tothink and that was just the way he liked it when he thought his mind went to places he could not control places that made him feel uncomfortable exhaustion was the bei thing when he was exhausted his thoughts did not wander to laura or to the strange dreams or to things that were not and could not be he would return home from walking and sleep without difficulty and without dreaming he ran into police chief chad mulligan in georges barber shop in the town square shadow always had high hopes for haircuts but they never lived up to his expectations after every haircut he looked more or less the same only with shorter hair chad seated in the barbers chair beside shadows seemed surprisingly concerned about his neil caiman own appearance when his haircut was finished he gazed grimly at his reflection as if he were preparing to give it a speeding ticket it looks good shadow told him would it look good to you if you were a woman i guess they went across the square to mabels together ordered mugs of hot chocolate chad said hey mike have you ever thought about a career in law enforcement shadow shrugged i cant say i have he said seems like theres a whole lot of things you got to know chad shook his head you know the main part of police work somewhere like this its just keeping your head something happens somebodys screaming at you screaming blue murder you simply have to be able to say that youre sure that its all a mistake and youll just sort it all out if they just step outside quietly and you have to be able to mean it and then you sort it but mostly thats when you put handcuffs on them but yeah you do what you can to sort it out let me know if you want a job were hiring and youre the kind of guy we want ill keep that in mind if the thing with my uncle falls through they sipped their hot chocolate mulligan said say mike what would you do if you had a cousin like a widow and she started calling you calling you how on the phone long distance she lives out of state his cheeks crimsoned i saw her last year at a family wedding she was married back then though i mean her husband was still alive and shes family not a first cousin pretty distant you got a thing for her blush i dont know about that american gods well then put it another way does she have a thing for you well shes said a few things when she called shes a very finelooking woman so what are you going to do about it i could ask her out here i could do that couldnt i shes kind of said shed like to come up here youre both adults id say go for it chad nodded and blushed and nodded again the telephone in shadows apartment was silent and dead he thought about getting it connected but could think of no one he wanted to call late one night he picked it up and listened and was convinced that he could hear a wind blowing and a distant conversation between a group of people talking in voices too low to properly make out he said hello and whos there but there was no reply only a sudden silence and then the faraway sound of laughter so faint he was not certain he was not imagining it shadow made more journeys with wednesday in the weeks that followed he waited in the kitchen of a rhode islandcoltiage and listened while wednesday sat in a darkened bedroom and argued with a woman who would not get out of bed nor would she let wednesday or shadow look at hr face in the refrigerator was a plastic bag filled with crickets and another filled with the corpses of baby mice in a rock club in seattle shadow watched wednesday shout his greeting over the noise of the band to a young woman with short red hair and bluespiral tattoos that talk must have gone well for wednesday came away from it grinning delightedly five days later shadow was waiting in the rental when wednesday walked scowling from the lobby of an office building in dallas wednesday slammed the car door when he got in and sat there in silence his face red with rage he neil caiman said drive then he said fucking albanians like anybody cares three days after that they flew to boulder where they had a pleasant lunch with five young japanese women it was a meal of pleasantries and politeness and shadow walked away from it unsure of whether anything had been agreed to or decided wednesday though seemed happy enough shadow had begun to look forward to returning to lakeside there was a peace there and a welcome that he appreciated each morning when he was not traveling he would drive across the bridge to the town square he would buy two pasties at mabels he would eat one pasty then and there and drink a coffee if someone had left a newspaper out he would read it although he was never interested enough in the news to purchase a newspaper himself he would pocket the second pasty wrapped in its paper bag and eat it for his lunch he was reading usa today one morning when mabel said hey mike where you going today the sky was pale blue the morning mist had left the trees covered with hoarfrost i dont know said shadow maybe ill walk the wilderness trail again she refilled his coffee you ever gone east on county q its kind of pretty out thataway thats the little road that starts acrost from the carpet store on twentieth avenue no never have well she said its kind of pretty it was extremely pretty shadow parked his car at the edge of town and walked along the side of the road a winding country road that curled around the hills to the east of the town each of the hills was covered with leafless maple trees bonewhite birches dark firs and pines at one point a small dark cat kept pace with him beside american gods the road it was the color of dirt with white forepaws he walked over to it it did not run away hey cat said shadow unselfconsciously the cat put its head on one side looked up at him with emerald eyes then it hissednot at him but at something over on the side of the road something he could not see easy said shadow the cat stalked away across the road and vanished into a field of old unharvested corn around the next bend in the road shadow came upon a tiny graveyard the headstones were weathered although several of them had sprays of fresh flowers resting against them there was no wall about the graveyard and no fence only low mulberry trees planted at the margins bent over with ice and age shadow stepped over the piledup ice and slush at the side of the road there were two stone gateposts marking the entry to the graveyard although there was no gate between them he walked into the graveyard between the two posts he wandered around the graveyard looking at the headstones there were no inscriptions later than he brushed the snow from a solidlooking granite aiigel and he leaned against it t he took the paper bag from his pocket and removed the pasty from it he broke off the top it breathed a faint wisp of steam into the wintry air it smelled realm good too he bit into it something rustled behind him he thought for a moment it was the cat but then he smelled perfume and under the perfume the scent of something rotten please dont look at me she said from behind him hello laura said shadow her voice was hesitant perhaps he thought even a little scared she said hello puppy he broke off some pasty would you like some he asked neil caiman she was standing immediately behind him now no she said you eat it i dont eat food anymore he ate his pasty it was good i want to look at you he said you wont like it she told him please she stepped around the stone angel shadow looked at her in the daylight some things were different and some things were the same her eyes had not changed nor had the crooked hopefulness of her smile and she was very obviously very dead shadow finished his pasty he stood up and tipped the crumbs out of the paper bag then folded it up and put it back into his pocket the time he had spent in the funeral home in cairo made it easier somehow for him to be in her presence he did not know what to say to her her cold hand sought his and he squeezed it gently he could feel his heart beating in his chest he was scared and what scared him was the normality of the moment he felt so comfortable with her at his side that he would have been willing to stand there forever i miss you he admitted im here she said thats when i miss you most when youre here when you arent here when youre just a ghost from the past or a dream from another life its easier then she squeezed his fingers so he asked hows death hard she said it just keeps going she rested her head on his shoulder and it almost undid him he said you want to walk for a bit sure she smiled up at him a nervous crooked smile in a dead face they walked out of the little graveyard and made their way back down the road toward the town hand in hand where have you been she asked american gods here he said mostly since christmas she said i kind of lost you sometimes i would know where you were for a few hours for a few days youd be all over then youd fade away again i was in this town he said lakeside its a good little town oh she said she no longer wore the blue suit in which she had been buried now she wore several sweaters a long dark skirt and high burgundy boots shadow commented on them laura ducked her head she smiled arent they great boots i found them in this great shoe store in chicago so what made you decide to come up from chicago oh ive not been in chicago for a while puppy i was heading south the cold was bothering me youd think id welcome it but its something to do with being dead i guess you dont feel it as cold you feel it as a sort of nothing and when youre dead i guess the only thing that youre scared of is nothing i was going to go to texas i planned to spend the winter in galveston i think i used to winter in galveston when i was a kid v i dont think you did said shadow yeurve never mentioned it before no maybe it was someone else then i dont know i remember seagullsthrowing bread in the air foreagulls hundreds of them the whole sky becoming nothing but seagulls as they flapped their wings and snatched the bread from the air she paused if i didnt see it i guess someone else did a car came around the corner the driver waved them hello shadow waved back it felt wonderfully normal to walk with his wife this feels good said laura as if she was reading his mind yes said shadow when the call came i had to hurry back i was barely into texas neil caiman call she looked up at him around her neck the gold coin glinted it felt like a call she said i started to think about you about how much i needed to see you it was like a hunger you knew i was here then t yes she stopped she frowned and her upper teeth pressed into her blue lower lip biting it gently she put her head on one side and said i did suddenly i did i thought you were calling me but it wasnt you was it no you didnt want to see me it wasnt that he hesitated no i didnt want to see you it hurts too much the snow crunched beneath their feet and it glittered diamonds as the sunlight caught it it must be hard said laura not being alive you mean its hard for you to be dead look im still going to figure out how to bring you back properly i think im on the right track no she said i mean im grateful and i hope you really can do it i did a lot of bad stuff she shook her head but i was talking about you im alive said shadow im not dead remember youre not dead she said but im not sure that youre alive either not really this isnt the way this conversation goes thought shadow this isnt the way anything goes i love you she said dispassionately youre my puppy but when youre really dead you get to see things clearer its like there isnt anyone there you know youre like this big solid manshaped hole in the world she frowned even when we were together i loved being with you you adored me and you would do anything for me but sometimes id go into a room and i wouldnt think there was anybody in there and id turn the light on or id american gods turn the light off and id realize that you were hi there sitting on your own not reading not watching tv not doing anything she hugged him then as if to take the sting from her words and she said the best thing about robbie was that he was somebody he was a jerk sometimes and he could be a joke and he loved to have mirrors around when we made love so he could watch himself fucking me but he was alive puppy he wanted things he filled the space she stopped looked up at him tipped her head a little to one side im sorry did i hurt your feelings he did not trust his voice not to betray him so he simply shook his head good she said thats good they were approaching the rest area where he had parked his car shadow felt that he needed to say something love you or please dont go or im sorry the kind of words you use to patch a conversation that had lurched without warning into the dark places instead he said im not dead maybe not she said but are you sure youre alive look at me he said ii thats not an answer said his dead wife youll know it when you are what now he said a well she said ive seen you now im going south again back to texas somewhere warm i dont care i have to wait here said shadow until my boss needs me thats not living said laura she sighed and then she smiled the same smile that had been able to tug at his heart no matter how many times he saw it every time she smiled at him had been the first time all over again he went to put his arm around her but she shook her neil caiman head and pulled out of his reach she sat down on the edge of a snowcovered picnic table and she watched him drive away interlude the war had begun and nobody saw it the storm was lowering and nobody knew it a falling girder in manhattan closed a street for two days it killed two pedestrians an arab taxi driver and the taxi drivers passenger a trucker in denver was found dead in his home the murder instrument a rubbergripped clawheaded hammer had been left on the floor beside his corpse his face was untouched but the back of his head was completely destroyed and several words in a foreign alphabet were written on the bathroom mirror in brown lipstick in a postal sorting station in phoenix arizona a man went crazy went postal as they said on the evening news and shot terry the troll evensen a morbidly obese awkward man who lived alone in a trailer several other people in the sorting station were fired on but only evensen was killed the man who fired the shotsfirst thought to be a disgruntled postal workerwas not caught and was never identified frankly said terry the troll evensens supervisor on the news at five if anyone around here was gonna go postal we would have figured it was gonna be the troll okay worker but a weird guy i mean you never can tell huh

the cause of death was reported as carbon monoxide poisoning from an elderly furnace a crypt was defiled in the key west graveyard an amtrak passenger train hit a ups truck in idaho killing the driver of the truck none of the passengers was seriously injured it was still a cold war at this stage a phony war nothing that could be truly won or lost the wind stirred the branches of the tree sparks flew from the fire the storm was coming the queen of sheba halfdemon they said on her fathers side witch woman wise woman and queen who ruled sheba when sheba was the richest land there ever was when its spices and its gems and scented woods were taken by boat and camelback to the corners of the earth who was worshiped even when she was alive worshiped as a living goddess by the wisest of kings stands on the sidewalk of sunset boulevard at am staring blankly out at the traffic like a slutty plastic bride on a blackandneon wedding cake she stands as if she owns the sidewalk and the night that surrounds her when someone looks straight at her her lips move as if she is talking to herself when men in cars drive past her she makes eye contact and she smiles i its been a long night its been a long week and a long four thousand years she is proud that she owes nothing to anyone the other girls on the street they have pimps they have habits they have children they have people who take what they make not her there is nothing holy left in her profession not anymore a week ago the rains began in los angeles slicking the streets into road accidents crumbling the mud from the hillsides and toppling houses into canyons washing the world into the gutters and storm drains drowning the bums neil caiman and the homeless camped down in the concrete channel of the river when the rains come in los angeles they always take people by surprise bilquis has spent the last week inside unable to stand on the sidewalk she has curled up in her bed in the room the color of raw liver listening to the rain pattering om the metal box of the window air conditioner and placing personals on the internet she has left her invitations on adultrriendfindercom laescortscom classyhollywoodbabes com has given herself an anonymous email address she was proud of herself for negotiating the new territories but remains nervousshe has spent a long time avoiding anything that might resemble a paper trail she has never even taken a small ad in the back pages of the la weekly preferring to pick out her own customers to find by eye and smell and touch the ones who will worship her as she needs to be worshiped the ones who will let her take them all the way and it occurs to her now standing and shivering on the street comer that she has a habit as bad as that of the smack whores and the crack whores and this distresses her and her lips begin to move again if you were close enough to her rubyred lips you would hear her say will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek the one love she is whispering that and she whispers by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth my beloved is mine and i am his bilquis hopes that the break in the rains will bring the johns back most of the year she walks the same two or three blocks on sunset enjoying the cool la nights once a month she pays off an officer in the lapd who replaced the last guy she used to pay off who had vanished his name had been jerry lebec and his disappearance had american gods been a mystery to the lapd he had become obsessed with bilquis had taken to following her on foot one afternoon she woke startled by a noise and opened the door to her apartment and found jerry lebec in civilian clothes kneeling and swaying on the worn carpet his head bowed waiting for her to come out the noise she had heard was the noise of his head thumping against her door as he rocked back and forth on his knees she stroked his hair and told him to come inside and later she put his clothes into a black plastic garbage bag and tossed them into a dumpster behind a hotel several blocks away his gun and his wallet she put into a grocery store bag she poured used coffee grounds and food waste on top of them folded the top of the bag and dropped it into a trash can at a bus stop she kept no souvenirs the orange night sky glimmers to the west with distant lightning somewhere out to sea and bilquis knows that the rain will be starting soon she sighs she does not want to be caught in the rain she will return to her apartment she decides and take a bath and shave her legsit seems to her she is always shaving her legsand sleep i i she begins to walk up a side street walking up the hillside to where her car is parked headlights come up behind her slowing as they approach her and she turns her face to the street and smiles the smile freezes when she sees the car is a white stretch limo men in stretch limos want to fuck in stretch limos not in the privacy of bilquiss shrine still it might be an investment something for the future a tinted window hums down and bilquis walks over to the limo smiling hey honey she says you looking for something sweet loving says a voice from the back of the stretch she peers inside as much as she can through the open window she knows a girl who got into a stretch with five drunk neil caiman football players and got hurt real bad but theres only one john in there that she can see and he looks kind of on the young side he doesnt feel like a worshiper but money good money thats passed from his hand to hers thats an energy in its own rightbaraka they called it once on a timewhich she can use and frankly these days every little helps how much he asks depends on what you want and how long you want it for she says and whether you can afford it she can smell something smoky drifting out of the limo window it smells like burning wires and overheating circuit boards the door is pushed open from inside i can pay for anything i want says the john she leans into the car and looks around theres nobody else in there just the john a puffyfaced kid who doesnt even look old enough to drink nobody else so she gets in rich kid huh she says richer than rich he tells her edging along the leather seat toward her he moves awkwardly she smiles at him mm makes me hot honey she tells him you must be one of them dot corns i read about he preens then puffs like a bullfrog yeah among other things im a technical boy the car moves off so he says tell me bilquis how much just to suck my cock what you call me bilquis he says again and then he sings in a voice not made for singing you are an immaterial girl living in a material world there is something rehearsed about his words as if hes practiced this exchange in front of a mirror she stops smiling and her face changes becomes wiser sharper harder what do you want i told you sweet loving ill give you whatever you want she says she needs to get out of the limo its moving too fast for her to throw her americangods self from the car she figures but shell do it if she cant talk her way out of this whatevers happening here she doesnt like it what i want yes he pauses his tongue runs over his lips i want a clean world i want to own tomorrow i want evolution devolution and revolution i want to move our kind from the fringes of the slipstream to the higher ground of the mainstream you people are underground thats wrong we need to take the spotlight and shine front and center you people have been so far underground for so long youve lost the use of your eyes my names ayesha she says i dont know what youre talking about theres another girl on that corner her names bilquis we could go back to sunset you could have both of us oh bilquis he says and he sighs theatrically theres only so much belief to go around theyre reaching the end of what they can give us the credibility gap and then he sings once again in his tuneless nasal voice you are an analog girl living in a digital world the limo takes a corner too fast and he tumbles across the seat into her the driver of the car is hidden behind tinfecl glass an irrational conviction strikes her that nobody is driving the car that the white limo is driving through beverly hills like herbie the love bug under its own power j then the john reaches out his hand and taps on the tinted glass the car slows and before it has stopped moving bilquis has pushed open the door and she half jumps half falls out onto the blacktop shes on a hillside road to the left of her is a steep hill to the right is a sheer drop she starts to run down the road the limo sits there unmoving it starts to rain and her high heels slip and twist beneath her she kicks them off and runs soaked to the skin looking for somewhere she can get off the road shes scared neil caiman she has power true but its hungermagic cuntmagic it has kept her alive in this land for so long but for everything else she uses her sharp eyes and her mind her height and her presence theres a metal guardrail at knee height on her right to stop cars from tumbling over the side of the hill and now the rain is running down the hill road turning it into a river and the soles of her feet have started to bleed the lights of la are spread out in front of her a twinkling electrical map of an imaginary kingdom the heavens laid out right here on earth and she knows that all she needs to be safe is to get off the road i am black but comely she mouths to the night and the rain lam the rose ofsharon and the lily of the valleys stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for am sick of love a fork of lightning bums greenly across the night sky she loses her footing slides several feet skinning her leg and elbow and she is getting to her feet when she sees the lights of the car descending the hill toward her its coming down too fast for safety and she wonders whether to throw herself to the right where it could crush her against the hillside or the left where she might tumble down the gully she runs across the road intending to push herself up the wet earth to climb when the white stretch limo comes fishtailing down the slick hillside road hell it must be doing eighty maybe even aquaplaning on the surface of the road and shes pushing her hands into a handful of weeds and earth and shes going to get up and away she knows when the wet earth crumbles and she tumbles back down onto the road the car hits her with an impact that crumples the grille and tosses her into the air like a glove puppet she lands on the road behind the limo and the impact shatters her pelvis fractures her skull cold rainwater runs over her face she begins to curse her killer curse him silently as she american gods cannot move her lips she curses him in waking and in sleeping in living and in death she curses him as only someone who is halfdemon on her fathers side can curse a car door slams someone approaches her you were an analog girl he sings again tunelessly living in a digital world and then he says you fucking madonnas all you fucking madonnas he walks away the car door slams the limo reverses and runs back over her slowly for the first time her bones crunch beneath the wheels then the limo comes back down the hill toward her when finally it drives away down the hill all it leaves behind on the road is the smeared red meat of roadkill barely recognizable as human and soon even that will be washed away by the rain interlude hi samantha mags is that you who else leon said that auntie sammy called when i was in the shower we had a good talk hes such a sweet id yeah i think ill keep him a moment of discomfort for both of them barely a crackle of a whisper over the telephone

going on forever you me him too many lives are at stake stephen sondheim old friends it was saturday morning shadow answered thedoor marguerite olsen was there she did hof come in just stood in the sunlight looking serious mister ainsel mike please said shadow mike yes would you like to come d er for dinner tonight about sixish it wont be anything exciting just spaghetti and meatballs i like spaghetti and meatballs obviously if you have any other plans i have no other plans six oclock should i bring flowers if you must but this is a social gesture not a romantic one he showered he went for a short walk down to the bridge and back the sun was up a tarnished quarter in the neil caiman sky and he was sweating in his coat by the time he got home he drove the runner down to daves finest food and bought a bottle of wine it was a twentydollar bottle which seemed to shadow like some kind of guarantee of quality he didnt know wines so he bought a californian cabernet because shadow had once seen a bumper sticker back when he was younger and people still had bumper stickers on their cars which said life is a cabernet and it had made him laugh he bought a plant in a pot as a gift green leaves no flowers nothing remotely romantic about that he bought a carton of milk which he would never drink and a selection of fruit which he would never eat then he drove over to mabels and bought a single lunchtime pasty mabels face lit up when she saw him did hinzelmann catch up with you i didnt know he was looking for me yup wants to take you ice fishing and chad mulligan wanted to know if id seen you around his cousins here from out of state his second cousin what we used to call kissing cousins such a sweetheart youll love her and she dropped the pasty into a brown paper bag twisted the top over to keep the pasty warm shadow drove the long way home eating onehanded the pastry crumbs tumbling onto his jeans and onto the floor of the runner he passed the library on the south shore of the lake it was a blackandwhite town in the ice and the snow spring seemed unimaginably far away the klunker would always sit on the ice with the icefishing shelters and the pickup trucks and the snowmobile tracks he reached his apartment parked walked up the drive up the wooden steps to his apartment the goldfinches and nuthatches on the birdfeeder hardly gave him a glance he went inside he watered the plant wondered whether or not to put the wine into the refrigerator there was a lot of time to kill until six american gods shadow wished he could comfortably watch television once more he wanted to be entertained not to have to think just to sit and let the sounds and the light wash over him do you want to see lucys tits something with a lucy voice whispered in his memory and he shook his head although there was no one there to see him he was nervous he realized this would be his first real social interaction with other peoplenormal people not people in jail not gods or culture heroes or dreamssince he was first arrested over three years ago he would have to make conversation as mike ainsel he checked his watch it was twothirty marguerite olsen had told him to be there at six did she mean six exactly should he be there a little early a little late he decided eventually to walk next door at five past six shadows telephone rang yeah he said thats no way to answer the phone growled wednesday when i get my telephone connected ill answer it politely said shadow can i help you i dont know said wednesday there fas a pause then he said organizing gods is like herding cats into straight lines they dont take naturally to it there was a deadness and an exhaustion in wednesdays voice that shadow had never heard before whats wrong its hard its too fucking hard i dont know if this is going to work we might as well cut our throats just cut our own throats you mustnt talk like that yeah right well if you do cut your throat said shadow trying to jolly wednesday out of his darkness maybe it wouldnt even hurt it would hurt even for my kind pain still hurts if you move and act in the material world then the material world neil caiman acts on you pain hurts just as greed intoxicates and lust burns we may not die easy and we sure as hell dont die well but we can die if were still loved and remembered something else a whole lot like us conies along and takes our place and the whole damn thing starts all over again and if were forgotten were done shadow did not know what to say he said so where are you calling from none of your goddamn business are you drunk not yet i just keep thinking about thor you never knew him big guy like you goodhearted not bright but hed give you the goddamned shirt off his back if you asked him and he killed himself he put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off in philadelphia in what kind of a way is that for a god to die im sorry you dont give two fucking cents son he was a whole lot like you big and dumb wednesday stopped talking he coughed whats wrong said shadow for the second time they got in touch who did the opposition and they want to discuss a truce peace talks live and let fucking live so what happens now now i go and drink bad coffee with the modern assholes in a kansas city masonic hall okay you going to pick me up or shall i meet you somewhere you stay there and you keep your head down dont get into any trouble you hear me but there was a click and the line went dead and stayed dead american gods there was no dial tone but then there never had been nothing but time to kill the conversation with wednesday had left shadow with a sense of disquiet he got up intending to go for a walk but already the light was fading and he sat back down again shadow picked up the minutes of the lakeside city council and turned the pages his eyes scanning the tiny print not actually reading it occasionally stopping to scan something that caught his eye in july shadow learned the city council was concerned about the number of itinerant foreign loggers arriving in the town an opera house was to be built on the corner of third street and broadway it was to be expected that the nuisances attendant to the damming of the millcreek would abate once the millpond had become a lake the council authorized the payment of seventy dollars to mr samuel samuels and of eightyfive dollars to mr heikki salminen in compensation for their land and for the expenses incurred in moving their domiciles out of the area to be flooded it had never occurred to shadow before that the lake was manmade why call a town lakeside when the lake had begun as a dammed millpond he read on to discover that a mr hinzelmann originally of hiidemuhlen in bavaria was in charge of the lakebuilding project andgthat the city council had granted him the sum of toward the project any shortfall to be made up by public subscription shadow tore off a strip of a paper towel and placed it into the book as a bookmark he could imagine hinzelmanns pleasure in seeing the reference to his grandfather he wondered if the old man knew that his family had been instrumental in building the lake shadow flipped forward through the book scanning for more references to the lakebuilding project they had dedicated the lake in a ceremony in the spring of as a precursor to the towns centennial celebra neil caiman tions a vote of thanks to mr hinzelmann was taken by the council shadow checked his watch it was fivethirty he went into the bathroom shaved combed his hair he changed his clothes somehow the final fifteen minutes passed he got the wine and the plant arid he walked next door the door opened as he knocked marguerite olsen looked almost as nervous as he felt she took the wine bottle and the potted plant and said thank you the television was on the wizard ofoz on video it was still in sepia and dorothy was still in kansas sitting with her eyes closed in professor marvels wagon as the old fraud pretended to read her mind and the twisterwind that would tear her away from her life was approaching leon sat in front of the screen playing with a toy fire truck when he saw shadow an expression of delight touched his face he stood up and ran tripping over his feet in his excitement into a back bedroom from which he emerged a moment later triumphantly waving a quarter watch mike ainsel he shouted then closed both his hands and he pretended to take the coin into his right hand which he opened wide i made it disappear mike ainsel you did agreed shadow after weve eaten if its okay with your mom ill show you how to do it even smoother than that do it now if you want said marguerite were still waiting for samantha i sent her out for sour cream i dont know whats taking her so long and as if that was her cue footsteps sounded on the wooden deck and somebody shouldered open the front door shadow did not recognize her at first then she said i didnt know if you wanted the kind with calories or the kind that tastes like wallpaper paste so i went for the kind with calories and he knew her then the girl from the road to cairo thats fine said marguerite sam this is my neighbor mike ainsel mike this is samantha black crow my sister american gods dont know you thought shadow desperately youve never met me before were total strangers he tried to remember how he had thought snow how easy and light that had been this was desperate he put out his hand and said pleased to meetcha she blinked looked up at his face a moment of puzzlement then recognition entered her eyes and curved the corners of her mouth into a grin hello she said ill see how the food is doing said marguerite in the taut voice of someone who burns things in kitchens if they leave them alone and unwatched even for a moment sam took off her puffy coat and her hat so youre the melancholy but mysterious neighbor she said whoda thunk it she kept her voice down and you he said are girl sam can we talk about this later if you promise to tell me whats going on deal leon tugged at the leg of shadows pants will you show me now he asked and held out his quarter okay said shadow but if i show you ybu have to remember that a master magician never tells snyone how its done i promise said leon gravely shadow took the coin in his left hnd then moved leons right hand showing him how to appear to take the coin in his right hand while actually leaving it in shadows left hand then he made leon repeat the movements on his own after several attempts the boy mastered the move now you know half of it said shadow the other half is this put your attention on the place where the coin ought to be look at the place its meant to be if you act like its in your right hand no one will even look at your left hand no matter how clumsy you are neil caiman sam watched all this with her head tipped slightly on one side saying nothing dinner called marguerite pushing her way in from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of spaghetti in her hands leon go wash your hands there was crusty garlic bread thick red sauce ood spicy meatballs shadow complimented marguerite on it old family recipe she told him from the corsican side of the family i thought you were native american dads cherokee said sam mags moms father came from corsica sam was the only person in the room who was actually drinking the cabernet dad left her when mags was ten and he moved across town six months after that i was born mom and dad got married when the divorce came through when i was ten he went away i think he has a tenyear attention span well hes been out in oklahoma for ten years said marguerite now my moms family were european jewish continued sam from one of those places that used to be communist and now are just chaos i think she liked the idea of being married to a cherokee fry bread and chopped liver she took another sip of the red wine sams moms a wild woman said marguerite semiapprovingly you know where she is now asked sam shadow shook his head shes in australia she met a guy on the internet who lived in hobart when they met in the flesh she decided he was actually kind of icky but she really liked tasmania so shes living down there with a womans group teaching them to batik cloth and things like that isnt that cool at her age shadow agreed that it was and helped himself to more meatballs sam told them how all the aboriginal natives of tasmania had been wiped out by the british and about the american gods human chain they made across the island to catch them which trapped only an old man and a sick boy she told him how the thylacinesthe tasmanian tigershad been killed by farmers scared for their sheep how the politicians in the s noticed that the thylacines should be protected only after the last of them was dead she finished her second glass of wine poured her third so mike said sam suddenly her cheeks reddening tell us about your family what are the ainsels like she was smiling and there was mischief in that smile were real dull said shadow none of us ever got as far as tasmania so youre at school in madison whats that like you know she said im studying art history womens studies and casting my own bronzes when i grow up said leon im going to do magic poof will you teach me mike ainsel sure said shadow if your mom doesnt mind sam said after weve eaten while youre putting leon to bed mags i think im going to get mike to take me to the buck stops here for an hour or so v marguerite did not shrug her head moved iyebrow raised slightly i think hes interesting said sam andhve have lots to talk about a marguerite looked at shadow who busieo himself in dabbing an imaginary blob of red sauce from his chin with a paper napkin well youre grownups she said in a tone of voice that implied that they werent and that even if they were they shouldnt be after dinner shadow helped sam with the washing up he driedand then he did a trick for leon counting pennies into leons palm each time leon opened his hand and counted them there was one less coin than he had counted in and as for the final pennyare you squeezing it tightlywhen leon opened his hand he found it had neil caiman transformed into a dime leons plaintive cries of howd you do that momma howd he do that followed him out into the hall sam handed him his coat come on she said her cheeks were flushed from the wine outside it was cold t shadow stopped in his apartment tossed the minutes of the lakeside city council into a plastic grocery bag and brought it along hinzelmann might be down at the buck and he wanted to show him the mention of his grandfather they walked down the drive side by side he opened the garage door and she started to laugh omigod she said when she saw the runner paul gunthers car you bought paul gunthers car omigod shadow opened the door for her then he went around and got in you know the car when i came up here two or three years ago to stay with mags it was me that persuaded him to paint it purple oh said shadow its good to have someone to blame he drove the car out onto the street got out and closed the garage door got back into the car sam was looking at him oddly as he got in as if the confidence had begun to leak out of her he put on his seat belt and she said okay this is a stupid thing to do isnt it getting into a car with a psycho killer i got you home safe last time said shadow you killed two men she said youre wanted by the feds and now i find out youre living under an assumed name next door to my sister unless mike ainsel is your real name no said shadow and he sighed its not he hated saying it it was as if he was letting go of something important abandoning mike ainsel by denying him as if he were taking his leave of a friend did you kill those men american gods no they came to my house and said wed been seen together and this guy showed me photographs of you what was his namemister hat no mister town it was like the fugitive but i said i hadnt seen you thank you so she said tell me whats going on ill keep your secrets if you keep mine i dont know any of yours said shadow well you know that it was my idea to paint this thing purple thus forcing paul gunther to become such an object of scorn and derision for several counties around that he was forced to leave town entirely we were kind of stoned she admitted i doubt mat bit of its much of a secret said shadow everyone in lakeside must have known its a stoner sort of purple and then she said very quiet very fast if youre going to kill me please dont hurt me i shouldnt have come here with you i am so fucking fucking dumb i can identify you jesus shadow sighed ive never killed anybody rsatfy now im going to take you to the buck he said well have a drink or if you give the word ill turn this car around and take you home either way ill just have to ho you arent going to call the cops there was silence as they crossed the bridge who did kill those men she asked you wouldnt believe me if i told you i would she sounded angry now he wondered if bringing the wine to the dinner had been a wise idea life was certainly not a cabernet right now its not easy to believe i she told him can believe anything you have no idea what i can believe really neil caiman i can believe things that are true and i can believe things that arent true and i can believe things where nobody knows if theyre true or not i can believe in santa claus and the easter bunny and marilyn monroe and the beatles and elvis and mister ed listeni believe that people are perfectible that knowledge is infinite that the worm is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women i believe that the future sucks and i believe that the future rocks and i believe that one day white buffalo woman is going to come back and kick everyones ass i believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in america is coincident with the decline in drivein movie theaters from state to state i believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and i still believe that they are better than the alternative i believe that california is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes while florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste i believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day well all be wiped out by the common cold like the martians in war of the worlds i believe that the greatest poets of the last century were edith sitwell and don marquis that jade is dried dragon sperm and that thousands of years ago in a former life i was a onearmed siberian shaman i believe that mankinds destiny lies in the stars i believe that candy really did taste better when i was a kid that its aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly that light is a wave and a particle that theres a cat in a box somewhere whos alive and dead at the same time and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself i believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything i do i american gods believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesnt even know that im alive i believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos background noise and sheer blind luck i believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasnt done it properly i believe that anyone who claims to know whats going on will lie about the little things too i believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies i believe in a womans right to choose a babys right to live that while all human life is sacred theres nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system i believe that life is a game that life is a cruel joke and that life is what happens when youre alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it she stopped out of breath shadow almost took his hands off the wheel to applaud instead he said okay so if i tell you what ive learned you wont think that im a nut maybe she said try me would you believe that all the gods that people have ever imagined are still with us today maybe and that there are new gods out there gods of computers and telephones and whatever and that ti y all seem to think there isnt room for them both in the world and that some kind of war is kind of likely and these gods killed those two men no my wife killed those two men i thought you said your wife was dead she is she killed them before she died then after dont ask she reached up a hand and flicked her hair from her forehead they pulled up on main street outside the buck stops neil caiman here the sign over the window showed a surprisedlooking stag standing on its hind legs holding a glass of beer shadow grabbed the bag with the book in it and got out why would they have a war asked sam it seems kind of redundant what is there to win i dont know admitted shadow its easier to believe in aliens than in gods said sam maybe mister town and mister whatever were men in black only the alien kind they were standing on the sidewalk outside the buck stops here and sam stopped she looked up at shadow and her breath hung on the night air like a faint cloud she said just tell me youre one of the good guys i cant said shadow i wish i could but im doing my best she looked up at him and bit her lower lip then she nodded good enough she said i wont turn you in you can buy me a beer shadow pushed the door open for her and they were hit by a blast of heat and music they went inside sam waved at some friends shadow nodded to a handful of people whose facesalthough not their nameshe remembered from the day he had spent searching for alison mcgovern or who he had met in mabels in the morning chad mulligan was standing at the bar with his arm around the shoulders of a small redhaired womanthe kissing cousin shadow figured he wondered what she looked like but she had her back to him chads hand raised in a mock salute when he saw shadow shadow grinned and waved back at him shadow looked around for hinzelmann but the old man did not seem to be there this evening he spied a free table at the back and started walking toward it then somebody began to scream it was a bad scream a fullthroated seenaghost hysterical scream which silenced all conversation shadow looked around certain somebody was being murdered and american gods then he realized that all the faces in the bar were turning toward him even the black cat who slept in the window during the day was standing up on top of the jukebox with its tail high and its back arched and was staring at shadow time slowed get him shouted a womans voice parked on the verge of hysteria oh for gods sake somebody stop him dont let him get away please it was a voice he knew nobody moved they stared at shadow he stared back at them chad mulligan stepped forward walking through the people the small woman walked behind him warily her eyes wide as if she was preparing to start screaming once more shadow knew her of course he knew her chad was still holding his beer which he put down on a nearby table he said mike shadow said chad audrey burton took hold of chads sleeve her face was white and there were tears in her eyes shadow she said you bastard you murderous evil bastard are you sure that you know this man honsaid chad he looked uncomfortable audrey burton looked at him incredulously are you crazy he worked for robbie for years hisslutty wife was my best friend hes wanted for murder i had to answer questions hes an escaped convict she was way over the top her voice trembling with suppressed hysteria sobbing out her words like a soap actress going for a daytime emmy kissing cousins thought shadow unimpressed nobody in the bar said a word chad mulligan looked up at shadow its probably a mistake im sure we can sort this all out he said then he said to the bar its all fine nothing to worry about we can sort this out everythings fine then to shadow lets step outside mike quiet competence shadow was impressed sure said shadow neil caiman he felt a hand touch his hand and he turned to see sam staring at him he smiled down at her as reassuringly as he could sam looked at shadow then she looked around the bar at the faces staring at them she said to audrey burton i dont know who you are but you are such a cunt then she went up on tiptoes and pulled shadow down to her and kissed him hard on the lips pushing her mouth against his for what felt to shadow like several minutes and might have been as long as five seconds in real clockticking time it was a strange kiss shadow thought as her lips pressed against his it wasnt intended for him it was for the other people in the bar to let them know that she had picked sides it was a flagwaving kiss even as she kissed him he became certain that she didnt even like himwell not like that still there was a tale he had read once long ago as a small boy the story of a traveler who had slipped down a cliff with maneating tigers above him and a lethal fall below him who managed to stop his fall halfway down the side of the cliff holding on for dear life there was a clump of strawberries beside him and certain death above him and below what should he do went the question and the reply was eat the strawberries the story had never made any sense to him as a boy it did now so he closed his eyes threw himself into the kiss and experienced nothing but sams lips and the softness of her skin against his sweet as a wild strawberry cmon mike said chad mulligan firmly please lets take it outside sam pulled back she licked her lips and smiled a smile that nearly reached her eyes not bad she said you kiss good for a boy okay go play outside then she turned to audrey burton but you she said are still a cunt shadow tossed sam his car keys she caught them onehanded he walked through the bar and stepped outside american gods followed by chad mulligan a gentle snow had begun to fall the flakes spinning down into the light of the neon bar sign you want to talk about this asked chad audrey had followed them out onto the sidewalk she looked as if she were ready to start screaming again she said he killed two men chad the fbi came to my door hes a psycho ill come down to the station with you if you want youve caused enough trouble maam said shadow he sounded tired even to himself please go away chad did you hear that he threatened me said audrey get back inside audrey said chad mulligan she looked as if she were about to argue then she pressed her lips together so hard they went white and went back into the bar would you like to comment on anything she said asked chad mulligan ive never killed anyone said shadow chad nodded i believe you he said im sure we can deal with these allegations easily enough you wont give me any trouble will you mike no trouble said shadow this is all a mistake exactly said chad so i figure we ought to head down to my office and sort it all out there am i under arrest asked shadow nope said chad not unless you want to be i figure you come with me out of a sense of civic duty and well straighten all this out chad patted shadow down found no weapons they got into mulligans car again shadow sat in the back looking out through the metal cage he thought sos mayday help he tried to push mulligan with his mind as hed once pushed a cop in chicagothis is your old friend mike ainsel you saved his life dont you know how silly this is why dont you just drop the whole thing neil caiman i figure it was good to get you out of there said chad all you needed was some loudmouth deciding that you were alison mcgoverns killer and wedve had a lynch mob on our hands point they were silent for the rest of the drive to thelakeside police building which chad said as they pulled up outside it actually belonged to the county sheriffs department the local police made do with a few rooms in there pretty soon the county would build something modern for now they had to make do with what they had they walked inside should i call a lawyer asked shadow you arent accused of anything said mulligan up to you they pushed through some swing doors take a seat over there shadow took a seat on the wooden chair with cigarette burns on the side he felt stupid and numb there was a small poster on the notice board beside a large no smoking sign endangered missing it said the photograph was alison mcgoverns there was a wooden table with old copies of sports illustrated and newsweek on it the light was bad the paint on the wall was yellow but it might once have been white after ten minutes chad brought him a watery cup of vending machine hot chocolate whats in the bag he asked and it was only then that shadow realized he was still holding the plastic bag containing the minutes of the lakeside city council old book said shadow your grandfathers pictures in here or greatgrandfather maybe yeah shadow flipped through the book until he found the portrait of the town council and he pointed to the man called mulligan chad chuckled if that dont beat all he said minutes passed and hours in that room shadow read two american gods of the sports illustrateds and he started in on the newsweek from time to time chad would come through once checking to see if shadow needed to use the rest room once to offer him a ham roll and a small packet of potato chips thanks said shadow taking them am i under arrest yet chad sucked the air between his teeth well he said not yet it doesnt look like you came by the name mike ainsel legally on the other hand you can call yourself whatever you want in this state if its not for fraudulent purposes you just hang loose can i make a phone call is it a local call long distance itll save money if i put it on my calling card otherwise youll just be feeding ten bucks worth of quarters into that thing in the hall sure thought shadow and this way youll know the number i dialed and youll probably be listening in on an extension that would be great said shadow they wait into an empty office the number shadow gave chatd dial for him was that of a funeral home in cairo illinois chad dialed it handed shadow the receiver ill leave you in here he said and went out the telephone rang several times then it was picked up jacquel and ibis can i help you hi mister ibis this is mike ainsel i helped out there for a few days over christmas a moments hesitation then of course mike how are you not great mister ibis in a patch of trouble about to be arrested hoping youd seen my uncle about or maybe you could get a message to him i can certainly ask around hold on uh mike theres someone here who wishes a word with you neil caiman the phone was passed to somebody and then a smoky female voice said hi honey i miss you he was certain hed never heard that voice before but he knew her he was sure that he knew her let it go the smoky voice whispered in his mind in a dream let it all go whos that girl you were kissing hon you trying to make me jealous were just friends said shadow i think she was trying to prove a point how did you know she kissed me i got eyes wherever my folk walk she said you take care now hon there was a moment of silence then mr ibis came back on the line and said mike yes theres a problem getting hold of your uncle he seems to be kind of tied up but ill try and get a message to your aunt nancy best of luck the line went dead shadow sat down expecting chad to return he sat in the empty office wishing he had something to distract him reluctantly he picked up the minutes once more opened it to somewhere in the middle of the book and began to read an ordinance prohibiting expectoration on sidewalks and on the floors of public buildings or throwing thereon tobacco in any form was introduced and passed eight to four in december of lemmi hautala was twelve years old and had it was feared wanderedaway in a fit of delirium on december a search being immediately effected but impeded by the snows which are blinding the council had voted unanimously to send the hautala family their condolences the fire at olsens livery stables the following week was extinguished without any injury or loss of life human or equine shadow scanned the closely printed columns he found no further mention of lemmi hautala and then on something slightly more man a whim american gods shadow flipped the pages forward to the winter of he found what he was looking for mentioned as an aside in the january minutes jessie lovat age not given a negro child had vanished on the night of december it was believed that she might have been abducted by traveling socalled pedlars condolences were not sent to the lovat family shadow was scanning the minutes of winter when chad mulligan knocked and entered looking shamefaced like a child bringing home a bad report card mister ainsel he said mike im truly sorry about this personally i like you but that dont change anything you know shadow said he knew i got no choice in the matter said chad but to place you under arrest for violating your parole then mulligan read shadow his rights he filled out some paperwork he took shadows prints he walked him down the hall to the county jail on the other side of the building there was a long counter and several doorways on one side of the room two glassedin holding cells and a doorway on the other one of the cells was occupie a man slept on a cement bed under a thin blanket the other was empty there was a sleepylooking woman in a brawn uniform behind the counter watching jay leno on a small white portable television she took the papers from chad and signed for shadow chad hung around filled in more papers the woman came around the counter patted shadow down took all his possessionswallet coins front door key book watchand put them on the counter then gave him a plastic bag with orange clothes in it and told him to go into the open cell and change into them he could keep his own underwear and socks he went in and changed into the orange clothes and the shower footwear it stank evilly in there the orange top he pulled over his head had lum neil caiman ber county jail written on the back in large black letters the metal toilet in the cell had backed up and was filled to the brim with a brown stew of liquid feces and sour beerish urine shadow came back out gave the woman his clothes which she put into the plastic bag with the rest ofhis possessions he had thumbed through the wallet before he handed it over you take care of this he had said to the woman my whole life is in here the woman took the wallet from him and assured him that it would be safe with them she asked chad if that wasnt true and chad looking up from the last of his paperwork said liz was telling the truth theyd never lost a prisoners possessions yet shadow had slipped the four hundreddollar bills that he had palmed from the wallet into his socks when he had changed along with the silver liberty dollar he had palmed as he had emptied his pockets say shadow asked when he came out would it be okay if i finished reading the book sorry mike rules are rules said chad liz put shadows possessions in a bag in the back room chad said hed leave shadow in officer butes capable hands liz looked tired and unimpressed chad left the telephone rang and lizofficer buteanswered it okay she said okay no problem okay no problem okay she put down the phone and made a face problem asked shadow yes not really kinda theyre sending someone up from milwaukee to collect you why is that a problem i got to keep you in here with me for three hours she said and the cell over thereshe pointed to the cell by the door with the sleeping man in itthats occupied hes on suicide watch i shouldnt put you in with him but its not worth the trouble to sign you in to the county and american gods then sign you out again she shook her head and you dont want to go in thereshe pointed to the empty cell in which hed changed his clothesbecause the can is shot it stinks in there doesnt it yes it was gross its common humanity thats what it is the sooner we get into the new facilities it cant be too soon for me one of the women we had in yesterday mustve flushed a tampon away i tell em not to we got bins for that they clog the pipes every damn tampon down that john costs the county a hundred bucks in plumbers fees so i can keep you out here if i cuff you or you can go in the cell she looked at him your call she said im not crazy about them he said but ill take the cuffs she took a pair from her utility belt then patted the semiautomatic in its holster as if to remind him that it was there hands behind your back she said the cuffs were a tight fit he had big wrists then she put hobbles on his ankles and sat him down on a bench on the far side of the counter against the wall now she said you dont bother me and i wont bothef ou she tilted the television so that he could see it thanks he said when we get our new offices she saij there wont be none of this nonsense the tonight show finished an episode of cheers began shadow had never watched cheers he had only ever seen one episode of itthe one where coachs daughter comes to the baralthough he had seen that several times shadow had noticed that you only ever catch one episode of shows you dont watch over and over years apart he thought it must be some kind of cosmic law officer liz bute sat back in her chair she was not obviously dozing but she was by no means awake so she did not notice when the gang at cheers stopped talking and get neil caiman ting off oneliners and just started staring out of the screen at shadow diane the blonde barmaid who fancied herself an intellectual was the first to talk shadow she said we were so worried about you youd fallen off the world its so good to see you againalbeit in bondage and orange coutur what i figure is the thing to do pontificated bar bore cliff is to escape in hunting season when everybodys wearing orange anyway shadow said nothing ah cat got your tongue i see said diane well youve led us a merry chase shadow looked away officer liz had begun gently to snore carla the little waitress snapped hey jerkwad we interrupt this broadcast to show you something thats going to make you piss in your friggin pants you ready the screen flickered and went black the words live feed pulsated in white at the bottom left of screen a subdued female voice said in voiceover its certainly not too late to change to the winning side but you know you also have the freedom to stay just where you are thats what it means to be an american thats the miracle of america freedom to believe means the freedom to believe the wrong thing after all just as freedom of speech gives you the right to stay silent the picture now showed a street scene the camera lurched forward in the manner of handheld video cameras in reallife documentaries a man with thinning hair a tan and a faintly hangdog expression filled the frame he was standing by a wall sipping a cup of coffee from a plastic cup he looked into the camera and said terrorists hide behind weasel words like freedom fighter you and i know that they are murdering scum pure and simple were risking our lives to make a difference shadow recognized the voice he had been inside the mans head once mr town sounded different from inside american gods his voice was deeper more resonantbut there was no mistaking it the cameras pulled back to show that mr town was standing outside a brick building on an american street above the door was a setsquare and compass framing the letter g in position said somebody offscreen lets see if the cameras inside the hall are rolling said the female voiceover voice the words live feed continued to blink at the bottom left of the screen now the picture showed the interior of a small hall the room was underlit two men sat at a table at the far end of the room one of them had his back to the camera the camera zoomed in to them awkwardly for a moment they were out of focus and then they became sharp once more the man facing the camera got up and began to pace like a bear on a chain it was wednesday he looked as if on some level he was enjoying this as they came into focus the sound came on with a pop the man with his back to the screen was saying we are offering is the chance to end this here and now with no more bloodshed no more aggression no motttpain no more loss of life isnt that worth giving up a little wednesday stopped pacing and turned his nostrils flared first he growled you have to understand that you are asking me to speak for all of us which is manifestly nonsensical secondly what on earth makes you think that i believe that you people are going to keep your word the man with his back to the camera moved his head you do yourself an injustice he said obviously you people have no leaders but youre the one they listen to they pay attention to you and as for keeping my word well these preliminary talks are being filmed and broadcast live and he gestured back toward the camera some of your people are watching as we speak others will see videotapes the camera does not lie neil caiman everybody lies said wednesday shadow recognized the voice of the man with his back to the camera it was mr world the one who had spoken to town on the cellphone while shadow was in towns head you dont believe said mr world that we will keep our word v i think your promises were made to be broken and your oaths to be forsworn but i will keep my word safe conduct is safe conduct said mr world and a flag of truce is what we agreed i should tell you by the way that your young protg is once more in our custody wednesday snorted no he said hes not we were discussing the ways to deal with the coming paradigm shift we dont have to be enemies do we wednesday seemed shaken he said i will do whatever is in my power shadow noticed something strange about the image of wednesday on the television screen a red glint burned on his left eye the glass one the dot left a phosphordot afterimage as he moved he seemed unaware of it its a big country said wednesday marshaling his thoughts he moved his head and the red laserpointer dot slipped to his cheek then it edged up to his glass eye once more there is room for there was a bang muted by the television speakers and the side of wednesdays head exploded his body tumbled backward mr world stood up his back still to the camera and walked out of shot lets see that again in slow motion this time said the announcers voice reassuringly the words live feed became replay slowly now the red laser pointer traced its bead onto wednesdays glass eye and once again the side of his face dissolved into a cloud of blood freeze frame american gods yes its still gods own country said the announcer a news reporter pronouncing the final tag line the only question is which gods another voiceshadow thought that it was mr worlds it had that same halffamiliar qualitysaid we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming on cheers coach assured his daughter that she was truly beautiful just like her mother the telephone rang and officer liz sat up with a start she picked it up said okay okay yes okay put the phone down she got up from behind the counter and said to shadow im going to have to put you in the cell dont use the can the lafayette sheriffs department should be here to collect you soon she removed the cuffs and the hobble locked him into the holding cell the smell was worse now that the door was closed shadow sat down on the concrete bed slipped the liberty dollar from his sock and began moving it from fingep to palm from position to position from hand tp hand his only aim to keep the coin from being seen byjujyone who might look in he was passing the time he was numb he missed wednesday then sudden and deep he missed the mans confidence his attitude his conviction he opened his hand looked down at ladf liberty a silver profile he closed his fingers over the coin held it tightly he wondered if hed get to be one of those guys who got life for something they didnt do if he even made it that far from what hed seen of mr world and mr town they would have little trouble pulling him out of the system perhaps hed suffer an unfortunate accident on the way to the next holding facility he could be shot while making a break for it it did not seem at all unlikely there was a stir of activity in the room on the other side of the glass officer liz came back in she pressed a button neil caiman a door that shadow could not see opened and a black deputy in a brown sheriffs uniform entered and walked briskly over to the desk shadow slipped the dollar coin back into his sock the new deputy handed over some papers liz scanned them and signed chad mulligan came in said a few words to the new man then he unlocked the cell door and walked inside okay folk are here to pick you up seems youre a matter of national security you know that itll make a great frontpage story for the lakeside news said shadow chad looked at him without expression that a drifter got picked up for parole violations not much of a story so thats the way it is thats what they tell me said chad mulligan shadow put his hands in front of him this time and chad cuffed him chad locked on the ankle hobbles and a rod from the cuffs to the hobbles shadow thought theyll take me outside maybe i can make a break for itin hobbles and cuffs and lightweight orange clothes out into the snow and even as he thought it he knew how stupid and hopeless it was chad walked him out into the office liz had turned the tv off now the black deputy looked him over hes a big guy he said to chad liz passed the new deputy the paper bag with shadows possessions in it and he signed for it chad looked at shadow then at the deputy he said to the deputy quietly but loudly enough for shadow to hear look i just want to say im not comfortable with the way this is happening the deputy nodded youll have to take it up with the appropriate authorities sir our job is simply to bring him in chad made a sour face he turned to shadow okay said chad through that door and into the sally port what american gods out there where the car is liz unlocked the doors you make sure that orange uniform comes right back here she said to the deputy the last felon we sent down to lafayette we never saw the uniform again they cost the county money they walked shadow out to the sally port where a car sat idling it wasnt a sheriffs department car it was a black town car another deputy a grizzled white guy with a mustache stood by the car smoking a cigarette he crushed it out underfoot as they came close and opened the back door for shadow shadow sat down awkwardly his movements hampered by the cuffs and the hobble there was no grille between the back and the front of the car the two deputies climbed into the front of the car the black deputy started the motor they waited for the sally port door to open come on come on said the black deputy his fingers drumming against the steering wheel chad mulligan tapped on the side windqw the white deputy glanced at the driver then he iqwergdthe window this is wrong said chad i just wanted to say that your comments have been noted and will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities said the driver the doors to the outside world openeo the snow was still falling dizzying into the cars headlights the driver put his foot on the gas and they were heading back down the street and on to main street you heard about wednesday said the driver his voice sounded different now older and familiar hes dead yeah i know said shadow i saw it on tv those fuckers said the white officer it was the first thing he had said and his voice was rough and accented and like the drivers it was a voice that shadow knew i tell you they are fuckers those fuckers thanks for coming to get me said shadow neil caiman dont mention it said the driver in the light of an oncoming car his face already seemed to look older he looked smaller too the last time shadow had seen him he had been wearing lemonyellow gloves and a check jacket we were in milwaukee had to drive like demons when ibis called you think we let them lock you up and send you to the chair when im still waiting to break your head with my hammer asked the white deputy gloomily fumbling in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes his accent was eastern european the real shit will hit the fan in an hour or less said mr nancy looking more like himself with each moment when they really turn up to collect you well pull over before we get to highway and get you out of those shackles and back into your own clothes czernobog held up a handcuff key and smiled i like the mustache said shadow suits you czernobog stroked it with a yellowed finger thank you wednesday said shadow is he really dead this isnt some kind of trick is it he realized that he had been holding on to some kind of hope foolish though it was but the expression on nancys face told him all he needed to know and the hope was gone coming to america bc cold it was and dark when the vision came to her for in the far north daylight was a gray dim time in the middle of the day that came and went and came again an interlude between darknesses they were not a large tribe as these things were counted then nomads of the northern plains they had a god who american gods was the skull of a mammoth and the hide of a mammoth fashioned into a rough cloak nunyunnini they called him when they were not traveling he rested on a wooden frame at man height she was the holy woman of the tribe the keeper of its secrets and her name was atsula the fox atsula walked before the two tribesmen who carried their god on long poles draped with bearskins that it should not be seen by profane eyes nor at times when it was not holy they roamed the tundra with their tents the finest of the tents was made of caribou hide and it was the holy tent and there were four of them inside it atsula the priestess gugwei the tribal elder yanu the war leader and kalanu the scout she called them there the day after she had her vision atsula scraped some lichen into the fire then she threw in dried leaves with her withered left hand they smoked with an eyestinging gray smoke and gave off an odor that was sharp and strange then she took a wooden cup from the wooden platform and she passed it to gugwei the cup was half filled with a dark yellow liquid atsula had found the pungh mushrdoms each with seven spots only a true holy woman could find a sevenspotted mushroomand had picked them at the dark of the moon and dried them on a string of deer cartilage yesterday before she slept she had eaten the three dried mushroom caps her dreams had been confused and fearful things of bright lights moving fast of rock mountains filled with lights spearing upward like icicles in the night she had woken sweating and needing to make water she squatted over the wooden cup and filled it with her urine then she placed the cup outside the tent in the snow and returned to sleep when she woke she picked the lumps of ice out from the wooden cup leaving a darker more concentrated liquid behind neil caiman it was this liquid she passed around first to gugwei then to yanu and to kalanu each of them took a large gulp of the liquid then atsula took the final draft she swallowed it and poured what was left on the ground in front of their god a libation to nunyunnini they sat in the smoky tent waiting for their god to speak outside in the darkness the wind wailed and breathed kalanu the scout was a woman who dressed and walked as a man she had even taken dalani a fourteenyearold maiden to be her wife kalanu blinked her eyes tightly then she got up and walked over to the mammoth skull she pulled the mammothhide cloak over herself and stood so her head was inside the mammoth skull there is evil in the land said nunyunnini in kalanus voice evil such that if you stay here in the land of your mothers and your mothers mothers you shall all perish the three listeners grunted is it the slavers or the great wolves asked gugwei whose hair was long and white and whose face was as wrinkled as the gray skin of a thorn tree it is not the slavers said nunyunnini old stonehide it is not the great wolves is it a famine is a famine coming asked gugwei nunyunnini was silent kalanu came out of the skull and waited with the rest of them gugwei put on the mammothhide cloak and put his head inside the skull it is not a famine as you know it said nunyunnini through gugweis mouth although a famine will follow then what is it asked yanu i am not afraid i will stand against it we have spears and we have throwing rocks let a hundred mighty warriors come against us still we shall prevail we shall lead them into the marshes and split their skulls with our flints it is not a man thing said nunyunnini in gugweis old american gods voice it will come from the skies and none of your spears or your rocks will protect you how can we protect ourselves asked atsula i have seen flames in the skies i have heard a noise louder than ten thunderbolts i have seen forests flattened and rivers boil ai said nunyunnini but he said no more gugwei came out of the skull bending stiffly for he was an old man and his knuckles were swollen and knotted there was silence atsula threw more leaves on the fire and the smoke made their eyes tear then yanu strode to the mammoth head put the cloak about his broad shoulders put his head inside the skull his voice boomed you must journey said nunyunnini you must travel to sunward where the sun rises there you will find a new land where you will be safe it will be a long journey the moon will swell and empty die and live twice and there will be slavers and beasts but i shall guide you and keep you safe if you travel toward the sunrise atsula spat on the mud of the floor and said no she could feel the god staring at her no she said you are a bad god to tell us this we will die we will all dje and then who will be left to carry you from high place to high place to raise your tent to oil your great tusks with fat the god said nothing atsula and yanu exchanged places atsulas face stared out through the yelldved mammoth bone atsula has no faith said nunyunnini in atsulas voice atsula shall die before the rest of you enter the new land but the rest of you shall live trust me there is a land to the east that is manless this land shall be your land and the land of your children and your childrens children for seven generations and seven sevens but for atsulas faithlessness you would have kept it forever in the morning pack your tents and your possessions and walk toward the sunrise and gugwei and yanu and kalanu bowed their heads and exclaimed at the power and wisdom of nunyunnini neil caiman the moon swelled and waned and swelled and waned once more the people of the tribe walked east toward the sunrise struggling through the icy winds which numbed their exposed skin nunyunnini had promised them truly they lost no one from the tribe on the journey save for a woman in childbirth and women in childbirth belong to the moon not to nunyunnini they crossed the land bridge kalanu had left them at first light to scout the way now the sky was dark and kalanu had not returned but the night sky was alive with lights knotting and flickering and winding flux and pulse white and green and violet and red atsula and her people had seen the northern lights before but they were still frightened by them and this was a display like they had never seen before kalanu returned to them as the lights in the sky formed and flowed sometimes she said to atsula i feel that i could simply spread my arms and fall into the sky that is because you are a scout said atsula the priestess when you die you shall fall into the sky and become a star to guide us as you guide us in life there are cliffs of ice to the east high cliffs said kalanu her ravenblack hair worn long as a man would wear it we can climb them but it will take many days you shall lead us safely said atsula i shall die at the foot of the cliff and that shall be the sacrifice that takes you into the new lands to the west of them back in the lands from which they had come where the sun had set hours before there was a flash of sickly yellow light brighter than lightning brighter than daylight it was a burst of pure brilliance that forced the folk on the land bridge to cover their eyes and spit and exclaim children began to wail that is the doom that nunyunnini warned us of said american gods gugwei the old surely he is a wise god and a mighty one he is the best of all gods said kalanu in our new land we shall raise him up on high and we shall polish his tusks and skull with fish oil and animal fat and we shall tell our children and our childrens children and our seventh childrens children that nunyunnini is the mightiest of all gods and shall never be forgotten gods are great said atsula slowly as if she were imparting a great secret but the heart is greater for it is from our hearts they come and to our hearts they shall return and there is no telling how long she might have continued in this blasphemy had it not been interrupted in a manner that brooked no argument the roar that erupted from the west was so loud that ears bled that the people could hear nothing for some time temporarily blinded and deafened but alive knowing that they were luckier than the tribes to the west of them it is good said atsula but she could not hear the words inside her head atsula died at the foot of the cliffs when the spring sun was at its zenith she did not live to see thenew world and the tribe walked into those lands with no holy woman they scaled the cliffs and they went south and west until they found a valley with fresh water and rivers that teemed with silver fish and deer that hail never seen man before and were so tame it was necessary to spit and to apologize to their spirits before killing them dalani gave birth to three boys and some said that kalanu had performed the final magic and could do the manthing with her bride while others said that old gugwei was not too old to keep a young bride company when her husband was away and certainly once gugwei died dalani had no more children and the ice times came and the ice times went and the people spread out across the land and formed new tribes neil caiman and chose new totems ravens and foxes and ground sloths and great cats and buffalo each a beast that marked a tribes identity each beast a god the mammoths of the new lands were bigger and slower and more foolish than the mammoth of the siberian plains and the pungh mushrooms with their seven spots were not to be found in the new lands and nunyunnini did not speak to the tribe any longer and in the days of the grandchildren of dalani and kalanus grandchildren a band of warriors members of a big and prosperous tribe returning from a slaving expedition in the north to their home in the south found the valley of the first people they killed most of the men and they took the women and many of the children captive one of the children hoping for clemency took them to a cave in the hills in which they found a mammoth skull the tattered remnants of a mammothskin cloak a wooden cup and the preserved head of atsula the oracle while some of the warriors of the new tribe were for taking the sacred objects away with them stealing the gods of the first people and owning their power others counseled against it saying that they would bring nothing but ill luck and the malice of their own god so they threw the objects down the side of the hill into a deep ravine and took the survivors of the first people with them on their long journey south and the raven tribes and the fox tribes grew more powerful in the land and soon nunyunnini was entirely forgotten part three the moment of the storm chapter fourteen people are in the dark they dont know what to do i had a little lantern oh but it got blown out too im reaching out my hand i hope you are too i just want to be in the dark with you greg brown in the dark with you they changed cars at five in the morning in minneapolis in the airports longterm parking lot they drove to the top floor where the parking building was open to the sky shadow took the orange uniform and the handcuffs and leg hobbles put them in the brown paper bag that had briefly held his possessions folded the whole tfiing up and dropped it into a garbage can they had beeq waiting for ten minutes when a barrelchested young man came out of an airport door and walked over to them hej vas eating a packet of burger king french fries shadow recognized him immediately he had sat in the back of the car when they had left the house on the rock and hummed so deeply the car had vibrated he now sported a whitestreaked winter beard he had not had before it made him look older the man wiped the grease from his hands onto his jeans extended one huge hand to shadow i heard of the allfathers death he said they will pay and they will pay dearly wednesday was your father asked shadow he was the allfather said the man his deep voice neil caiman caught in his throat you tell them tell them all that when we are needed my people will be there czernobog picked at a flake of tobacco from between his teeth and spat it out onto the frozen slush and how many of you is that ten twenty the barrelchested mans beard bristled and arent ten of us worth a hundred of them who would stand against even one of my folk in a battle but there are more of us than that at the edge of the cities there are a few in the mountains some in the catskills a few living in the carny towns in florida they keep their axes sharp they will come if i call them you do that elvis said mr nancy shadow thought he said elvis anyway nancy had exchanged the deputys uniform for a thick brown cardigan corduroy trousers and brown loafers you call them its what the old bastard would have wanted they betrayed him they killed him i laughed at wednesday but i was wrong none of us are safe any longer said the man whose name sounded like elvis but you can rely on us he gently patted shadow on the back and almost sent him sprawling it was like being gently patted on the back by a wrecking ball czernobog had been looking around the parking lot now he said you will pardon me asking but our new vehicle is which the barrelchested man pointed there she is he said czernobog snorted that it was a vw bus there was a rainbow decal in the rear window its a fine vehicle and its the last thing that theyll be expecting you to be driving czernobog walked around the vehicle then he started to cough a lungrumbling oldman fiveinthemorning smokers cough he hawked and spat and put his hand to his chest massaging away the pain yes the last car they american gods will suspect so what happens when the police pull us over looking for the hippies and the dope eh we are not here to ride the magic bus we are to blend in the bearded man unlocked the door of the bus so they take a look at you they see you arent hippies they wave you goodbye its the perfect disguise and its all i could find at no notice czernobog seemed to be ready to argue it further but mr nancy intervened smoothly elvis you came through for us we are very grateful now that car needs to get back to chicago well leave it in bloomington said the bearded man the wolves will take care of it dont give it another thought he turned back to shadow again you have my sympathy and i share your pain good luck and if the vigil falls to you my admiration and my sympathy he squeezed shadows hand with his own catchersmitt fist it hurt you tell his corpse when you see it tell him that alviss son of vindalf will keep the faith the vw bus smelled of patchouli of old incense and rolling tobacco there was a faded pink carpet glued to the floor and to the walls who was that asked shadow as he drove them down the ramp grinding the gears just like he said alviss son of vindalf htfs the king of the dwarfs the biggest mightiest greatest of all the dwarf folk but hes not a dwarf pointed out shadow hes what fiveeight fivenine which makes him a giant among dwarfs said czernobog from behind him tallest dwarf in america what was that about the vigil asked shadow the two old men said nothing shadow glanced at mr nancy who was staring out of the window well he was talking about a vigil you heard him czernobog spoke up from the backseat you will not have to do it he said neil caiman do what the vigil he talks too much all the dwarfs talk and talk is nothing to think of better you put it out of your mind driving south was like driving forward in time the nows erased slowly and were completely gone by the following morning when the bus reached kentucky winter was already over in kentucky and spring was on its way shadow began to wonder if there were some kind of equation to explain itperhaps every fifty miles he drove south he was driving a day into the future he would have mentioned his idea to somebody but mr nancy was asleep in the passenger seat in the front while czernobog snored unceasingly in the back time seemed a flexible construct at that moment an illusion he was imagining as he drove he found himself becoming painfully aware of birds and animals he saw the crows on the side of the road or in the buss path picking at roadkill flights of birds wheeled across the skies in patterns that almost made sense cats stared at them from front lawns and fence posts czernobog snorted and woke sitting up slowly i dreamed a strange dream he said i dreamed that i am truly bielebog that forever the world imagines that there are two of us the light god and the dark but that now we are both old i find it was only me all the time giving them gifts taking my gifts away he broke the filter from a lucky strike put the cigarette between his lips and lit it shadow wound down his window arent you worried about lung cancer he said i am cancer said czernobog i do not frighten myself nancy spoke folk like us dont get cancer we dont get arteriosclerosis or parkinsons disease or syphilis were kind of hard to kill they killed wednesday said shadow l american gods he pulled over for gas and then parked next door at a restaurant for an early breakfast as they entered the pay phone in the entrance began to jangle they gave their orders to an elderly woman with a worried smile who had been sitting reading a paperback copy of what my heart meant by jenny kerton the woman sighed then walked back and over to the phone picked it up said yes then she looked back at the room said yep looks like they are you just hold the line now and walked over to mr nancy its for you she said okay said mr nancy now maam you make sure those fries are real crisp now think burnt he walked over to the pay phone this is he and what makes you think im dumb enough to trust you he said i can find it he said i know where it is yes he said of course we want it you know we want it and i know you want to get rid of it so dont give me any shit he hung up the telephone came back to the table who was it asked shadow didnt say what did they want they were offerin us a truce while they hand over the body they lie said czernobog they want to lure us in and then they will kill us what they did to wednesday is what i always used to do he added with gloomy pride its on neutral territory said nancy truly neutral czernobog chuckled it sounded like a metal ball rattling in a dry skull i used to say that also come to a neutral place i would say and then in the night we would rise up and kill them all those were the good days mr nancy shrugged he crunched down on his dark brown french fries grinned his approval mmmm these are fine fries he said neil caiman we cant trust those people said shadow listen im older than you and im smarter than you and im better lookin than you said mr nancy thumping the bottom of the ketchup bottle blobbing ketchup over his burnt fries i can get more pussy in an afternoon than youll get in a year i can dance like an angel fight like a cornered bear plan better than a fox sing like a nightingale and your point here is nancys brown eyes gazed into shadows and they need to get rid of the body as much as we need to take it czernobog said there is no such neutral place theres one said mr nancy its the center determining the exact center of anything can be problematic at best with living thingspeople for example or continentsthe problem becomes one of intangibles what is the center of a man what is the center of a dream and in the case of the continental united states should one count alaska when one attempts to find the center or hawaii as the twentieth century began they made a huge model of the usa the lower fortyeight states out of cardboard and to find the center they balanced it on a pin until they found the single place it balanced as near as anyone could figure it out the exact center of the continental united states was several miles from lebanon kansas on johnny gribs hog farm by the s the people of lebanon were all ready to put a monument up in the middle of the hog farm but johnny grib said that he didnt want millions of tourists coming in and tramping all over and upsetting the hogs so they put the monument to the geographical center of the united states two miles north of the town they built a park and a stone monument to go in the park and a brass plaque on the monument they blacktopped the road from the town and certain of the in americangods flux of tourists waiting to arrive they even built a motel by the monument then they waited the tourists did not come nobody came its a sad little park now with a mobile chapel in it that wouldnt fit a small funeral party and a motel whose windows look like dead eyes which is why concluded mr nancy as they drove into humansville missouri the exact center of america is a tiny rundown park an empty church a pile of stones and a derelict motel hog farm said czernobog you just said that the real center of america was a hog farm this isnt about what is said mr nancy its about what people think is its all imaginary anyway thats why its important people only fight over imaginary things my kind of people asked shadow or your kind of people nancy said nothing czernobog made a noise that might have been a chuckle might have been a snort shadow tried to get comfortable in the back of the bus he had only slept a little he had a bad feeling ijcthe pit of his stomach worse than the feeling he had had in prison worse than the feeling he had had back when laura had come to him and told him about the robbery this was bad the back of his neck prickled he felt sickwid several times in waves he felt scared mr nancy pulled over in humansville parked outside a supermarket mr nancy went inside and shadow followed him in czernobog waited in the parking lot smoking his cigarette there was a young fairhaired man little more than a boy restocking the breakfast cereal shelves hey said mr nancy hey said the young man its true isnt it they killed him yes said mr nancy they killed him neil caiman the young man banged several boxes of capn crunch down on the shelf they think they can crush us like cockroaches he said he had a tarnished silver bracelet circling his wrist we dont crush that easy do we no said mr nancy we dont ill be there sir said the young man his pale blue eyes blazing i know you will gwydion said mr nancy mr nancy bought several large bottles of rc cola a sixpack of toilet paper a pack of evillooking black cigarillos a bunch of bananas and a pack of doublemint chewing gum hes a good boy came over in the seventh century welsh the bus meandered first to the west and then to the north spring faded back into the dead end of winter kansas was the cheerless gray of lonesome clouds empty windows and lost hearts shadow had become adept at hunting for radio stations negotiating between mr nancy who liked talk radio and dance music and czeraobog who favored classical music the gloomier the better leavened with the more extreme evangelical religious stations for himself shadow liked oldies toward the end of the afternoon they stopped at czernobogs request on the outskirts of cherryvale kansas czernobog led them to a meadow outside the town there were still traces of snow in the shadows of the trees and the grass was the color of dirt wait here said czernobog he walked alone to the center of the meadow he stood there in the winds of the end of february for some time at first he hung his head then he began gesticulating he looks like hes talking to someone said shadow ghosts said mr nancy they worshiped him here over a hundred years ago they made blood sacrifice to him libations spilled with the hammer after a time the townsfolk figured out why so many of the strangers who american gods passed through the town didnt ever come back this was where they hid some of the bodies czernobog came back from the middle of the field his mustache seemed darker now and there were streaks of black in his gray hair he smiled showing his iron tooth i feel good now ahh some things linger and blood lingers longest they walked back across the meadow to where they had parked the vw bus czernobog lit a cigarette but did not cough they did it with the hammer he said votan he would talk of the gallows and the spear but for me it is one thing he reached out a nicotinecolored finger and tapped it hard in the center of shadows forehead please dont do that said shadow politely please dont do that mimicked czernobog one day i will take my hammer and do much worse than that to you my friend remember yes said shadow but if you tap my head again ill break your hand czernobog snorted then he said they should be grateful the people here there was such power raised even thirty years after they forced my people interffiding this land this very land gave us the greatest movie star of all time she was the greatest there ever was judy garland asked shadow czernobog shook his head curtly hes talking about louise brooks said mr nancy shadow decided not to ask who louise brooks was instead he said so look when wednesday went to talk to them he did it under a truce yes and now were going to get wednesdays body from them as a truce yes and we know that they want me dead or out of the way they want all of us dead said nancy neil caiman so what i dont get is why do we think theyll play fair this time when they didnt for wednesday that said czernobog is why we are meeting at the center is he frowned what is the word for it the opposite of sacred profane said shadow without thinking t no said czernobog i mean when a place is less sacred than any other place of negative sacredness places where they can build no temples places where people will not come and will leave as soon as they can places where gods only walk if they are forced to i dont know said shadow i dont think there is a word for it all of america has it a little said czernobog that is why we are not welcome here but the center said czernobog the center is worst is like a minefield we all tread too carefully there to dare break the truce they had reached the bus czernobog patted shadows upper arm you dont worry he said with gloomy reassurance nobody else is going to kill you nobody but me shadow found the center of america at evening that same day before it was fully dark it was on a slight hill to the northwest of lebanon he drove around the little hillside park past the tiny mobile chapel and the stone monument and when shadow saw the onestory s motel at the edge of the park his heart sank there was a black humvee parked in front of itit looked like a jeep reflected in a funhouse mirror as squat and pointless and ugly as an armored car there were no lights on inside the building they parked beside the motel and as they did so a man in a chauffeurs uniform and cap walked out of the motel and was illuminated by the headlights of the bus he touched his cap to them politely got into the humvee and drove off big car tiny dick said mr nancy american gods do you think theyll even have beds here asked shadow its been days since i slept in a bed this place looks like its just waiting to be demolished its owned by hunters from texas said mr nancy come up here once a year damned if i know what theyre huntin it stops the place being condemned and destroyed they climbed out of the bus waiting for them in front of the motel was a woman shadow did not recognize she was perfectly madeup perfectly coiffed she reminded him of every newscaster hed ever seen on morning television sitting in a studio that didnt really resemble a living room lovely to see you she said now you must be czernobog ive heard a lot about you and youre anansi always up to mischief eh you jolly old man and you you must be shadow youve certainly led us a merry chase havent you a hand took his pressed it firmly looked him straight in the eye im media good to meet you i hope we can get this evenings business done as pleasantly as possible the main doors opened somehow toto said the fat kid shadow had last seen sitting in a limo i dont believe were in kansas anymore were in kansas said mr nancy i tiiink we must have drove through most of it today damn but this country is flat i this place has no lights no power and no hot water said the fat kid and no offense you people really need the hot water you just smell like youve been in that bus for a week i dont think theres any need to go there said the woman smoothly were all friends here come on in well show you to your rooms we took the first four rooms your late friend is in the fifth all the ones beyond room five are emptyyou can take your pick im afraid its not the four seasons but then what is she opened the door to the motel lobby for them it smelled of mildew of damp and dust and decay neil caiman there was a man sitting in the lobby in the near darkness you people hungry he asked i can always eat said mr nancy drivers gone out for a sack of hamburgers said the man hell be back soon he looked up it was too dark to see faces but he said big guy youre shadow huh the asshole who killed woody and stone no said shadow that was someone else and i know who you are he did he had been inside the mans head youre town have you slept with woods widow yet mr town fell off his chair in a movie it would have been funny in real life it was simply clumsy he stood up quickly came toward shadow shadow looked down at him and said dont start anything youre not prepared to finish mr nancy rested his hand on shadows upper arm truce remember he said were at the center mr town turned away leaned over to the counter and picked up three keys youre down at the end of the hall he said here he handed the keys to mr nancy and walked away into the shadows of the corridor they heard a motel room door open and they heard it slam mr nancy passed a key to shadow another to czernobog is there a flashlight on the bus asked shadow no said mr nancy but its just dark you mustnt be afraid of the dark im not said shadow im afraid of the people in the dark dark is good said czernobog he seemed to have no difficulty seeing where he was going leading them down the darkened corridor putting the keys into the locks without fumbling i will be in room ten he told them and then he said media i think i have heard of her isnt she the one who killed her children different woman said mr nancy same deal mr nancy was in room and shadow opposite the two american gods of them in room the room smelled damp and dusty and deserted there was a bed frame in there with a mattress on it but no sheets a little light entered the room from the gloaming outside the window shadow sat down on the mattress pulled off his shoes and stretched out at full length he had driven too much in the last few days perhaps he slept he was walking a cold wind tugged at his clothes the tiny snowflakes were little more than a crystalline dust thatgusted and flurried in the wind there were trees bare of leaves in the winter there were high hills on each side of him it was late on a winters afternoon the sky and the snow had attained the same deep shade of purple somewhere ahead of himin this light distances were impossible to judgethe flames of a bonfire flickered yellow and orange a gray wolf padded through the snow before him shadow stopped the wolf stopped also and turned and waited one of its eyes glinted yellowishgreenshadow shrugged and walked toward the flames and ihe wolf ambled ahead of him the bonfire burned in the middle of a grove of trees there must have been a hundred trees planted in ftvj rows there were shapes hanging from the trees at the ena of the rows was a building that looked a little like an overturned boat it was carved of wood and it crawled with wooden creatures and wooden facesdragons gryphons trolls and boars all of them dancing in the flickering light of the fire the bonfire was so high that shadow could barely approach it the wolf padded around the crackling fire in place of the wolf a man came out on the other side of the fire he was leaning on a tall stick you are in uppsala in sweden said the man in a familiar gravelly voice about a thousand years ago neil caiman wednesday said shadow the man continued to talk as if shadow were not there first every year then later when the rot set in and they became lax every nine years they would sacrifice here a sacrifice of nines each day for nine days they would hang nine animals from trees in the grove one of those animals was always a man he strode away from the firelight toward the trees and shadow followed him as he approached the trees the shapes that hung from them resolved legs and eyes and tongues and heads shadow shook his head there was something about seeing a bull hanging by its neck from a tree that was darkly sad and at the same time surreal enough almost to be funny shadow passed a hanging stag a wolfhound a brown bear and a chestnut horse with a white mane little bigger than a pony the dog was still alive every few seconds it would kick spasmodically and it was making a strained whimpering noise as it dangled from the rope the man he was following took his long stick which shadow realized now as it moved was actually a spear and he slashed at the dogs stomach with it in one knifelike cut downward steaming entrails tumbled onto the snow i dedicate this death to odin said the man formally it is only a gesture he said turning back to shadow but gestures mean everything the death of one dog symbolizes the death of all dogs nine men they gave to me but they stood for all the men all the blood all the power it just wasn t enough one day the blood stopped flowing belief without blood only takes us so far the blood must flow i saw you die said shadow in the god business said the figureand now shadow was certain it was wednesday nobody else had that rasp that deep cynical joy in words its not the death that matters its the opportunity for resurrection and when the american gods blood flows he gestured at the animals at the people hanging from the trees shadow could not decide whether the dead humans they walked past were more or less horrifying than the animals at least the humans had known the fate they were going to there was a deep boozy smell about the men that suggested that they had been allowed to anesthetize themselves on their way to the gallows while the animals would simply have been lynched hauled up alive and terrified the faces of the men looked so young none of them was older than twenty who am i asked shadow you said the man you were an opportunity you were part of a grand tradition although both of us are committed enough to the affair to die for it eh who are you asked shadow the hardest part is simply surviving said the man the bonfireand shadow realized with a strange horror that it truly was a bonefire rib cages and fireeyed skulls stared and stuck andjuttedfrom the flames sputtering traceelement colors into the night greens andyellows and bhies wasflaring and crackling and burning hotly three dayroftthe tree three days in the underworld three days to find my way back the flames sputtered and flamed too brightly for shadow to look at directly he looked down into themarkness beneath the trees a knock on the doorand now there was moonlight coming in the window shadow sat up with a start dinners served said medias voice shadow put his shoes back on walked over to the door went out into the corridor someone had found some candles and a dim yellow light illuminated the reception hall the driver of the humvee came hi holding a cardboard tray and a paper sack he wore a long black coat and a peaked chauffeurs cap neil caiman sorry about the delay he said hoarsely i got everybody the same a couple of burgers large fries large coke and apple pie ill eat mine out in the car he put the food down then walked back outside the smell of fast food filled the lobby shadow took the paper bag and passed out the food the napkins die packets of ketchup they ate in silence while the candles flickered and the burning wax hissed shadow noticed that town was glaring at him he turned his chair a little so his back was to the wall media ate her burger with a napkin poised by her lips to remove crumbs oh great these burgers are nearly cold said the fat kid he was still wearing his shades which shadow thought pointless and foolish given the darkness of the room sorry about that said town the nearest mcdonalds is in nebraska they finished their lukewarm hamburgers and cold fries the fat kid bit into his singleperson apple pie and the filling spurted down his chin unexpectedly the filling was still hot ow he said he wiped at it with his hand licking his fingers to get them clean that stuff burns he said those pies are a classaction suit waiting to fucking happen shadow wanted to hit the kid hed wanted to hit him since the kid had his goons hurt him in the limo after lauras funeral he pushed the thought away cant we just take wednesdays body and get out of here he asked midnight said mr nancy and the fat kid at the same time these things must be done by the rules said czernobog yeah said shadow but nobody tells me what they are you keep talking about the goddamn rules i dont evenknow what game you people are playing its like breaking the street date said media brightly you know when things are allowed to be on sale town said i think the whole things a crock of shit but american gods if their rules make them happy then my agency is happy and everybodys happy he slurped his coke roll on midnight you take the body you go away were all loveyfuckingdovey and we wave you goodbye and then we can get on with hunting you down like the rats you are hey said the fat kid to shadow reminds me i told you to tell your boss he was history did you ever tell him i told him said shadow and you know what he said to me he said to tell the little snot if ever i saw him again to remember that todays future is tomorrows yesterday wednesday had never said any such thing still these people seemed to like cliches the black sunglasses reflected the flickering candle flames back at him like eyes the fat kid said this place is such a fucking dump no power out of wireless range i mean when you got to be wired youre already back in the stone age he sucked the last of his coke through the straw dropped the cup on the table and walked away down the corridor shadow reached over and placed the fat kids garbage back into the paper sack im going to see the center of america he announced he got up and walked outside into the night mr nancy followed him they strolled together across the little park saying nothing until they reached the stone monument the wind gusted at them fitfully first from one direction then from another so he said now what the halfmoon hung pale in the dark sky now said nancy you should go back to your room lock the door you try to get some more sleep at midnight they give us the body and then we get the hell out of here the center is not a stable place for anybody if you say so mr nancy inhaled on his cigarillo this should never have happened he said none of this should have happened our kind of people we are he waved the cigarillo about as if using it to hunt for a word then stabbing neil caiman forward with it exclusive were not social not even me not even bacchus not for long we walk by ourselves or we stay in our own little groups we do not play well with others we like to be adored and respected and worshipedme i like them to be tellin tales about me tales showing my cleverness its a fault i know but its jhe way i am we like to be big now in these shabby days we are small the new gods rise and fall and rise again but this is not a country that tolerates gods for long brahma creates vishnu preserves shiva destroys and the ground is clear for brahma to create once more so what are you saying asked shadow the fightings over now the battles done mr nancy snorted are you out of your mind they killed wednesday they killed him and they bragged about it they spread the word theyve showed it on every channel to those with eyes to see it no shadow its only just begun he bent down at the foot of the stone monument stubbed out his cigarillo on the earth and left it there like an offering you used to make jokes said shadow you dont anymore its hard to find the jokes these days wednesdays dead are you comin inside soon nancy walked away toward the motel shadow reached out his hand and touched the monuments stones he dragged his big fingers across the cold brass plate then he turned and walked over to the tiny white chapel walked through the open doorway into the darkness he sat down in the nearest pew and closed his eyes and lowered his head and thought about laura and about wednesday and about being alive there was a click from behind him and a scuff of shoe against earth shadow sat up and turned someone stood american gods just outside the open doorway a dark shape against the stars moonlight glinted from something metal you going to shoot me asked shadow jesusi wish said mr town its only for selfdefense so youre praying have they got you thinking that theyre gods they arent gods i wasnt praying said shadow just thinking the way i figure it said town theyre mutations evolutionary experiments a little hypnotic ability a little hocuspocus and they can make people believe anything nothing to write home about thats all they die like men after all they always did said shadow he got up and town took a step back shadow walked out of the little chapel and mr town kept his distance hey shadow said do you know who louise brooks was friend of yours nope she was a movie star from south of here town paused maybe she changed her name and became liz taylor or sharon stone or someone he suggested helpfully maybe shadow started to walk back tohe motel town kept pace with him you should be back in prison said mr town you should be on rucking death row i didnt kill your associates said shadow but ill tell you something a guy once told me back when i was in prison something ive never forgotten and that is there was only one guy in the whole bible jesus ever personally promised a place with him in paradise not peter not paul not any of those guys he was a convicted thief being executed so dont knock the guys on death row maybe they know something you dont the driver stood by the humvee gnight gentlemen he said as they passed neil caiman night said mr town and then he said to shadow i personally dont give a fuck about any of this what i do is what mister world says its easier that way shadow walked down the corridor to room he unlocked the door went inside he said sorry i thought this was my room it is said media i was waiting for you hecould see her hair in the moonlight and her pale face she was sitting on his bed primly ill find another room i wont be here for long she said i just thought it might be an appropriate time to make you an offer okay make the offer relax she said there was a smile in her voice you have such a stick up your butt look wednesdays dead you dont owe anyone anything throw in with us time to come over to the winning team shadow said nothing we can make you famous shadow we can give you power over what people believe and say and wear and dream you want to be the next gary grant we can make that happen we can make you the next beatles i think i preferred it when you were offering to show me lucys tits said shadow if that was you ah she said i need my room back good night and then of course she said not moving as if he had not spoken we can turn it all around we can make it bad for you you could be a bad joke forever shadow or you could be remembered as a monster you could be remembered forever but as a manson a hitler how would you tethat im sorry maam but im kind of tired said shadow id be grateful if youd leave now i offered you the world she said when youre dying in a gutter you remember that american gods ill make a point of it he said after she had gone her perfume lingered he lay on the bare mattress and thought about laura but whatever he thought aboutlaura playing frisbee laura eating a rootbeer float without a spoon laura giggling showing off the exotic underwear she had bought when she attended a travel agents convention in anaheimalways morphed in his mind into laura sucking robbies cock as a truck slammed them off the road and into oblivion and then he heard her words and they hurt every time youre not dead said laura in her quiet voice in his head but im not sure that you re alive either there was a knock shadow got up and opened the door it was the fat kid those hamburgers he said they were just icky can you believe it fifty miles from mcdonalds i didnt think there was anywhere in the world that was fifty miles from mcdonalds this place is turning into grand central station said shadow okay so i guess youre here to offer me the freedom of the internet if i come over to your side of the fence right the fat kid was shivering no youre already dead meat he said youyoure a fucking illuminated gothic blackletter manuscript you couldnt be hypertext if you tried im im synaptic while while youre synoptic he smelled strange shadow realized there w a guy in the cell across the way whose name shadow had never known he had taken off all his clothes in the middle of the day and told everyone that he had been sent to take them away the truly good ones like him in a silver spaceship to a perfect place that had been the last time shadow had seen him the fat kid smelled like that guy are you here for a reason just wanted to talk said the fat kid there was a whine in his voice its creepy in my room thats all its creepy in there fifty miles to a mcdonalds can you believe that maybe i could stay in here with you neil caiman what about your friends from the limo the ones who hit me shouldnt you ask them to stay with you the children wouldnt operate out here were in a dead zone shadow said its a while until midnight and its longer to dawn i think maybe you need rest i know i do the fat kid said nothing for a moment then he nodded and walked out of the room shadow closed his door and locked it with the key he lay back on the mattress after a few moments the noise began it took him a few moments to figure out what it had to be then he unlocked his door and walked out into the hallway it was the fat kid now back in his own room it sounded like he was throwing something huge against the walls of the room from the sounds shadow guessed that what he was throwing was himself its just me he was sobbing or perhaps its just meat shadow could not tell quiet came a bellow from czemobogs room down the hall shadow walked down to the lobby and out of the motel he was tired the driver still stood beside the humvee a dark shape in a peaked cap couldnt sleep sir he asked no said shadow cigarette sir no thank you you dont mind if i do go right ahead the driver used a bic disposable lighter and it was in the yellow light of the flame that shadow saw the mans face actually saw it for the first time and recognized him and began to understand shadow knew that thin face he knew that there would be closecropped orange hair beneath the black drivers cap american gods cut close to the scalp he knew that when the mans lips smiled they would crease into a network of rough scars youre looking good big guy said the driver low key shadow stared at his old cellmate warily prison friendships are good things they get you through bad places and through dark times but a prison friendship ends at the prison gates and a prison friend who reappears in your life is at best a mixed blessing jesus low key lyesmith said shadow and then he heard what he was saying and he understood loki he said loki liesmith youre slow said loki but you get there in the end and his lips twisted into a scarred smile and embers danced in the shadows of his eyes they sat in shadows room in the abandoned motel sitting on the bed at opposite ends of the mattress the sounds from the fat kids room had pretty much stopped you were lucky we were inside together said loki you would never have survived your first year without me you couldnt have walked out if you wante t its easier just to do the time he paused then you got to understand the god thing its not magic its about being you but the you that people believe in its about being the concentrated magnified essence olfyou its about becoming thunder or the power of a running horse or wisdom you take all the belief and become bigger cooler more than human you crystallize he paused and then one day they forget about you and they dont believe in you and they dont sacrifice and they dont care and the next thing you know youre running a threecard monte game on the corner of broadway and fortythird why were you in my cell coincidence pure and simple and now youre driving for the opposition if you want to call them that it depends where youre neil caiman standing the way i figure it im driving for the winning team but you and wednesday you were from the same youre both norse pantheon were both from the norse pantheon is that what youre trying to say yeah so shadow hesitated you must have been friends once no we were never friends im not sorry hes dead he was just holding the rest of us back with him gone the rest of them are going to have to face up to the facts its change or die evolve or perish hes gone wars over shadow looked at him puzzled you arent that stupid he said you were always so sharp wednesdays death isnt going to end anything its just pushed all of the ones who were on the fence over the edge mixing metaphors shadow bad habit whatever said shadow its still true jesus his death did in an instant what hed spent the last few months trying to do it united them it gave them something to believe in perhaps loki shrugged as far as i know the dunking on this side of the fence was that with the troublemaker out of the way the trouble would also be gone its not any of my business though i just drive so tell me said shadow why does everyone care about me they act like im important why does it matter what i do damned if i know you were important to us because you were important to wednesday as for the why of it i guess its just another one of lifes little mysteries im tired of mysteries yeah i think they add a kind of zest to the world like salt in a stew so youre their driver you drive for all of them whoever needs me said loki its a living american gods he raised his wristwatch to his face pressed a button the dial glowed a gentle blue which illuminated his face giving it a haunting haunted appearance five to midnight time said loki you coming shadow took a deep breath im coming he said they walked down the dark motel corridor until they reached room loki took a box of matches from his pocket and thumbnailed a match into flame the momentary flare hurt shadows eyes a candle wick flickered and caught and another loki lit a new match and continued to light the candle stubs they were on the windowsills and on the headboard of the bed and on the sink in the corner of the room the bed had been hauled from its position against the wall into the middle of the motel room leaving a few feet of space between the bed and the wall on each side there were sheets draped over the bed old motel sheets mothholed and stained on top of the sheets lay wednesday perfectly still he was dressed in the pale suit he had been wearing when he was shot the right side of his face was untouched perfect unmarred by blood the left side of his face wa s a ragged mess and the left shoulder and front of the suit was spattered with dark spots his hands were at his sides the expression on that wreck of a face was far from peafeful it looked hurta soulhurt a real downdeep hurt fitted with hatred and anger and raw craziness and on some level it looked satisfied shadow imagined mr jacquels practiced hands smoothing that hatred and pain away rebuilding a face for wednesday with morticians wax and makeup giving him a final peace and dignity that even death had denied him still the body seemed no smaller in death and it still smelled faintly of jack daniels the wind from the plains was rising he could hear it howling around the old motel at the imaginary center neil caiman of america the candles on the windowsill guttered and flickered he could hear footsteps in the hallway someone knocked on a door called hurry up please its time and they began to shuffle in heads lowered town came in first followed by media and mr npncy and czernobog last of all came the fat kid he had fresh red bruises on his face and his lips were moving all the time as if he were reciting some words to himself but he was making no sound shadow found himself feeling sorry for him informally without a word being spoken they ranged themselves about the body each an arms length away from the next the atmosphere in the room was religious deeply religious in a way that shadow had never previously experienced there was no sound but the howling of the wind and the crackling of the candles we are come together here in this godless place said loki to pass on the body of this individual to those who will dispose of it properly according to the rites if anyone would like to say something say it now not me said town i never properly met the guy and this whole thing makes me feel uncomfortable czernobog said these actions will have consequences you know that this can only be the start of it all the fat kid started to giggle a highpitched girlish noise he said okay okay ive got it and then all on one note he recited turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon cannot hear the falconer things fall apart the center cannot hold and then he broke off his brow creasing he said shit i used to know the whole thing and he rubbed his temples and made a face and was quiet american gods and then they were all looking at shadow the wind was screaming now he didnt know what to say he said this whole thing is pitiful half of you killed him or had a hand in his death now youre giving us his body great he was an irascible old fuck but i drank his mead and im still working for him thats all media said in a world where people die every day i think the important thing to remember is that for each moment of sorrow we get when people leave this world theres a corresponding moment of joy when a new baby comes into this world that first wail iswell its magic isnt it perhaps its a hard thing to say but joy and sorrow are like milk and cookies thats how well they go together i think we should all take a moment to meditate on that and mr nancy cleared his throat and said so i got to say it because nobody else here will we are at the center of this place a land that has no time for gods and here at the center it has less time for us than anywhere it is a nomansland a place of truce and we observe our truces here we have no choice so you give us the body of our friend we accept it you will pay for this murder for murder blood for blood t town said whatever you could save yourselves a lot of time and effort by going home and shooting yourselves in the heads cut out the middleman fuck you said czernobog fuck you and fuck your mother and fuck the fucking horse you fucking rode in on you will not even die in battle no warrior will taste your blood no one alive will take your life you will die a soft poor death you will die with a kiss on your lips and a lie in your heart leave it old man said town the blooddimmed tide is loose said the fat kid i think that comes next the wind howled okay said loki hes yours were done take the old bastard away neil caiman he made a gesture with his fingers and town media and the fat kid left the room he smiled at shadow call no man happy huh kid he said and then he too walked away what happens now asked shadow now we wrap him up said anansi and we take him away from here they wrapped the body in the motel sheets wrapped it well in its impromptu shroud so there was no body to be seen and they could carry it the two old men walked to each end of the body but shadow said let me see something and he bent his knees and slipped his arms around the whitesheeted figure pushed him up and over his shoulder he straightened his knees until he was standing more or less easily okay he said ive got him lets put him into the back of the car czernobog looked as if he were about to argue but he closed his mouth he spat on his forefinger and thumb and began to snuff the candles between his fingertips shadow could hear them fizz as he walked from the darkening room wednesday was heavy but shadow could cope if he walked steadily he had no choice wednesdays words were in his head with every step he took along the corridor and he could taste the soursweetness of mead in the back of his throat you protect me you transport me from place to place you run errands in an emergency but only in an emergency you hurt people who need to be hurt in the unlikely event of my death you will hold my vigil mr nancy opened the motel lobby door for him then hurried over and opened the back of the bus the other four were already standing by their humvee watching mem as if they could not wait to be off loki had put his drivers cap back on the cold wind tugged at shadow as he walked whipped at the sheets he placed wednesday down as gently as he could in the back of the bus american gods someone tapped him on the shoulder he turned town stood there with his hand out he was holding something here said mr town mister world wanted you to have this it was a glass eye there was a hairline crack down the middle of it and a tiny chip gone from the front we found it in the masonic hall when we were cleaning up keep it for luck god knows youll need it shadow closed his hand around die eye he wished he could come back with something smart and sharp but town was already back at the humvee and climbing up into the car and shadow still couldnt think of anything clever to say they drove east dawn found them in princeton missouri shadow had not slept yet nancy said anywhere you want us to drop you if i were you id rustle up some id and head for canada or mexico im sticking with you guys said shadow its what wednesday would havewanted you arent working for him anymore hes dead once we drop his body off you are free to go and do what keep out of the way while the war is on said nancy he flipped his turn signal and took a left hide yourself for a little time said czernobog then when this is over you will come back to me and i will finish the whole thing shadow said where are we taking the body virginia theres a tree said nancy a world tree said czernobog with gloomy satisfaction we had one ifl my part of the world but ours grew under the world not above it we put him at the foot of the tree said nancy we leave him there we let you go we drive south theres a battle blood is shed many die the world changes a little neil caiman you dont want me at your battle im pretty big im good in a fight nancy turned his head to shadow and smiledthe first real smile shadow had seen on mr nancys face since he had rescued shadow from the lumber county jail most of this battle will be fought in a place you cannot go and you cannot touch in the hearts and die minds of the people said czernobog like at the big roundabout huh the carousel said mr nancy oh said shadow backstage i got it like the desert with the bones in mr nancy raised his head every time i figure you dont have enough sense to bring guts to a bear you surprise me yeah thats where the real battle will happen everythin else will just be flash and thunder tell me about the vigil said shadow someone has to stay with the body its a tradition well find somebody he wanted me to do it no said czernobog it will kill you bad bad bad idea yeah itll kill me to stay with his body its not what id want at my funeral said mr nancy when i die i just want them to plant me somewhere warm and then when pretty women walk over my grave i would grab their ankles like in that movie i never saw mat movie said czernobog of course you did its right at the end its the high school movie all the children goin to the prom czernobog shook his head shadow said the films called carrie mr czernobog okay one of you tell me about the vigil nancy said you tell him im drivin i never heard of no film called carrie you tell him american gods nancy said the person on the vigilgets tied to the tree just like wednesday was and then they hang there for nine days and nine nights no food no water all alone at the end they cut the person down and if they lived well it could happen and wednesday will have had his vigil czernobog said maybe alviss will send us one of his people a dwarf could survive it ill do it said shadow no said mr nancy yes said shadow the two old men were silent then nancy said why because its the kind of thing a living person would do said shadow you are crazy said czernobog maybe but im going to hold wednesdays vigil when they stopped for gas czernobog announced he felt sick and wanted to ride in the front shadow didnt mind moving to the back of the bus he could stretch out more and sleep they drove on in silence shadow felt that hed made a decision something big and strange hey czernobog said mr nancy afteb a wrote you check out the technical boy back at the motel he was not happy hes been screwin with something that screwed him right back thats the biggest trouble with thf new kids they figure they know every thin and you cant teach them nothin but the hard way good said czernobog shadow was stretched out full length on the seat in the back he felt like two people or more than two there was part of him that felt gently exhilarated he had done something he had moved it wouldnt have mattered if he hadnt wanted to live but he did want to live and that made all the difference he hoped he would live through this but he was willing to die if mat was what it took to be alive and for a moment he thought that the whole thing was funny just the neil caiman funniest thing in the world and he wondered if laura would appreciate the joke there was another part of himmaybe it was mike ainsel he thought vanished off into nothing at the press of a button in the lakeside police departmentwho was still trying to figure it all out trying to see the big picture hidden indians he said out loud what came czernobogs irritated croak from the front seat the pictures youd get to color in as kids can you see the hidden indians in this picture there are ten indians in this picture can you find them all and at first glance you could only see the waterfall and the rocks and the trees then you see that if you just tip the picture on its side that shadow is an indian he yawned sleep suggested ezemobog but the big picture said shadow then he slept and dreamed of hiddeaindians the tree was in virginia it was a long way away from anywhere on the back of an old farm to get to the farm they had had to drive for almost an hour south from blacksburg to drive roads with names like penny winkle branch and rooster spur they got turned around twice and mr nancy and czernobog both lost their tempers with shadow and with each other they stopped to get directions at a tiny general store set at the bottom of the hill in the place where the road forked an old man came out of the back of the store and stared at them he wore oshkosh bgosh denim overalls and nothing else not even shoes czernobog selected a pickled hogs foot from a jar on the counter and went outside to eat it on the deck while the man in the overalls drew mr nancy maps on the back of napkins marking off turnings and local landmarks american gods they set off once more with mr nancy driving and they were there in ten minutes a sign on the gate said ash shadow got out of the bus and opened the gate the bus drove through jolting through the meadowland shadow closed the gate he walked a little behind the bus stretching his legs jogging when the bus got too far in front of him enjoying the sensation of moving his body he had lost all sense of time on the drive from kansas had they been driving for two days three days he did not know the body in the back of the bus did not seem to be rotting he could smell ita faint odor of jack daniels overlaid with something that might have been sour honey but the smell was not unpleasant from time to time he would take out the glass eye from his pocket and look at it it was shattered deep inside fractured from what he imagined was the impact of a bullet but apart from a chip to one side of the iris the surface was unmarred shadow would run it through his hands palming it rolling it pushing it along with his fingers it was a ghastly souvenir but oddly comforting and he suspected that it would have amused wednesday know that his eye had wound up in shadows pocket the farmhouse was dark and shut up the meadows were overgrown and seemed abandoned the farm roof was crumbling at the back it was covered in black plastic sheeting they jolted over a ridge and shadow saw tne tree it was silvergray and it was higher than the farmhouse it was the most beautiful tree shadow had ever seen spectral and yet utterly real and almost perfectly symmetrical it also looked instantly familiar he wondered if he had dreamed it then realized that no he had seen it before or a representation of it many times it was wednesdays silver tie pin the vw bus jolted and buhiped across the meadow and came to a stop about twenty feet from the trunk of the tree neil caiman there were three women standing by the tree at first glance shadow thought that they were the zorya but no they were three women he did not know they looked tired and bored as if they had been standing there for a long time each of them held a wooden ladder the biggest also carried a brown sack they looked like a set qf russian dolls a tall oneshe was shadows height or even taller a middlesized one and a woman so short and hunched mat at first glance shadow wrongly supposed her to be a child they looked so much alike that shadow was certain that the women must be sisters the smallest of the women dropped to a curtsy when the bus drew up the other two just stared they were sharing a cigarette and they smoked it down to the filter before one of them stubbed it out against a root czernobog opened the back of the bus and the biggest of the women pushed past him and as easily as if it were a sack of flour she lifted wednesdays body out of the back and carried it to the tree she laid it in front of the tree about ten feet from the tyunk she and her sisters unwrapped wednesdays body he looked worse by daylight than he had by candlelight in the motel room and after one quick glance shadow looked away the women arranged his clothes tidied his suit then placed him at the corner of the sheet and wound it around him once more then the women came over to shadow you are the one the biggest of them asked the one who will mourn the allfather asked the middlesized one you have chosen to take the vigil asked the smallest shadow nodded afterward he was unable to remember whether he had actually heard their voices perhaps he had simply understood what they had meant from their looks and their eyes mr nancy who had gone back to the house to use the american gods bathroom came walking back to the tree he was smoking a cigarillo he looked thoughtful shadow he called you really dont have to do this we can find somebody more suited im doing it said shadow simply and if you die asked mr nancy if it kills you then said shadow it kills me mr nancy flicked his cigarillo into the meadow angrily i said you had shit for brains and you still have shit for brains cant see when somebodys tryin to give you an out im sorry said shadow he didnt say anything else nancy walked back to the bus czernobog walked over to shadow he did not look pleased you must come through this alive he said come through this safely for me and then he tapped his knuckle gently against shadows forehead and said bam he squeezed shadows shoulder patted his arm and went to join mr nancy the biggest woman whose name seemed to be urtha or urdershadow could not repeat it back to her to her satisfactiontold him in pantomime to take ofe s clothes all of them the big woman shrugged shadow stripped to his briefs and tshirt the women propped the laddegs against the tree one of the laddersit was painted by hind with little flowers and leaves twining up the strutsthey pointed out to him he climbed the nine steps then at their urging he stepped onto a low branch the middle woman tipped out the contents of the sack onto the meadowgrass it was filled with a tangle of thin ropes brown with age and dirt and the woman began to sort them out into lengths and to lay them carefully on the ground beside wednesdays body neil caiman they climbed their own ladders now and they began to knot the ropes intricate and elegant knots and they wrapped the ropes first about the tree and then about shadow unembarrassed like midwives or nurses or those who lay out corpses they removed his tshirt and briefs then they bound him never tightly but firmly andfinally he was amazed at how comfortably the ropes and the knots bore his weight the ropes went under his arms between his legs around his waist his ankles his chest binding him to the tree the final rope was tied loosely about his neck it was initially uncomfortable but his weight was well distributed and none of the ropes cut his flesh his feet were five feet above the ground the tree was leafless and huge its branches black against the gray sky its bark a smooth silvery gray they took the ladders away there was a moment of panic as all his weight was taken by the ropes and he dropped a few inches still he made no sound the women placed the body wrapped in its motelsheet shroud at the foot of the tree and they left him there they left him there alone chapter fifteen hang me o hang me and ill be dead and gone hang me o hang me and ill be dead and gone i wouldn t mind the hangin its bein gone so long its lyinin the grave so long id song the first day that shadow hung from the tree he experienced only discomfort that edged slowly into pain and fear and occasionally an emotion that was somewhere between boredom and apathy a gray acceptance a waiting he hung the wind was still after several hours fleeting bursts of color started to explode across his vision in blossoms of crimson and gold throbbing and pulsing with a life of their own the pain in his arms and legs became by degrees intolerable if he relaxed them let his body go slack and dangle if he flopped forward then the rope around his neck would take up the slack and the world would shimmer and swim so he pushed himself back against the trunk of the tree he could feel his heart laboring in his chest a pounding arrhythmic tattoo as it pumped the blood through his body emeralds and sapphires and rubies crystallized and burst in front of his eyes his breath came in shallow gulps the bark of the tree was rough against his back the chill of the neil caiman afternoon on his naked skin made him shiver made his flesh prickle and goose its easy said someone in the back of his head theres a trick to it you do it or you die he was pleased with the thought and repeated it over and over in the back of his head part mantra part nursery rhyme rattling along to the drumbeat of his heart its easy theres a trick to it you do it or you die its easy theres a trick to it you do it or you die its easy theres a trick to it you do it or you die its easy theres a trick to it you do it or you die time passed the chanting continued he could hear it someone was repeating the words only stopping when shadows mouth began to dry out when his tongue turned dry and skinlike in his mouth he pushed himself up and away from the tree with his feet trying to support his weight in a way that would still allow him to fill his lungs he breathed until he could hold himself up no more and then he fell back into the bonds and hung from the tree when the chattering startedan angry laughing chattering noisehe closed his mouth concerned that it was he himself making it but the noise continued its the world laughing at me then thought shadow his head lolled to one side something ran down the tree trunk beside him stopping beside his head it cluttered loudly in his ear one word which sounded a lot like ratatosk shadow tried to repeat it but his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth he turned slowly and stared into the graybrown face and pointed ears of a squirrel in closeup he learned a squirrel looks a lot less cute than it does from a distance the creature was ratlike and dangerous not sweet or charming and its teeth looked sharp he hoped that it would not perceive him as a threat or as a food source he did not think that squirrels were car americangods nivorous but then so many things he had thought were not had turned out to be so he slept the pain woke him several times in the next few hours it pulled him from a dark dream in which dead children rose and came to him their eyes peeling swollen pearls and they reproached him for failing them a spider edged across his face and he woke he shook his head dislodging or frightening it and returned to his dreamsand now an elephantheaded man potbellied one tusk broken was riding toward him on the back of a huge mouse the elephantheaded man curled his trunk toward shadow and said if you had invoked me before you began this journey perhaps some of your troubles might have been avoided then the elephant took the mouse which had by some means that shadow could not perceive become tiny while not changing in size at all and passed it from hand to hand to hand fingers curling about it as the little creature scampered from palm to palm and shadow was not at all surprised when the elephantheaded god finally opened all four of his hands to reveal them perfectly empty he shrugged arm after arm after arm in a peculiar fluid motion and lobk tat shadow his face unreadable its in the trunk shadow told the elephant man he had been watching as the flickering tail vanished the elephant man nodded his huge head and said yes in the trunk you will forget many things you will give many things away you will lose many things but do not lose this and then the rain began and shadow was tumbled shivering and wet from deep sleep into full wakefulness the shivering intensified until it scared shadow he was shivering more violently than he had ever imagined possible a series of convulsive shudders that built upon each other he willed himself to stop but still he shivered his teeth banging together his limbs twitching and jerking beyond his control there was real pain there too a deep neil caiman knifelike pain that covered his body with tiny invisible wounds intimate and unbearable he opened bis mouth to catch the rain as it fell moistening his cracked lips and his dry tongue wetting die ropes that bound him to the trunk of the tree there was a flash of lightning so bright it felt like a blow to his eyes transforming the world into an intense panorama of image and afterimage then the thunder a crack and a boom and a rumble and as the thunder echoed the rain redoubled in the rain and the night the shivering abated the knife blades were put away shadow no longer felt the cold or rather he felt only the cold but the cold had how become part of himself shadow hung from the tree while the lightning flickered and forked across the sky and the thunder subsided into an omnipresent rumbling with occasional bangs and roars like distant bombs exploding hi the night the wind tugged at shadow trying to pull him from the tree flaying him cutting to the bone and shadow knew in his soul that the real storm had truly begun a strange joy rose within shadow then and he started laughing as the rain washed his naked skin and the lightning flashed and thunder rumbled so loudly that he could barely hear himself laugh he exulted he was alive he had never felt like this ever if he did die he thought if he died right now here on the tree it would be worth it to have had this one perfect mad moment hey he shouted at the storm hey its me im here he trapped some water between his bare shoulder and the trunk of the tree and he twisted his head over and drank the trapped rainwater sucking and slurping at it and he drank more and he laughed laughed with joy and delight not madness until he could laugh no more until he hung there too exhausted to move american gods at the foot of the tree on the ground the rain had made the sheet partly transparent and had lifted it and pushed it forward so that shadow could see wednesdays dead hand waxy and pale and the shape of his head and he thought of the shroud of turin and he remembered the open girl on jacquels table in cairo and then as if to spite the cold he observed that he was feeling warm and comfortable and the bark of the tree felt soft and he slept once more and if he dreamed any dreams this time he could not remember them by the following morning the pain was no longer local not confined to the places where the ropes cut into his flesh or where the bark scraped his skin now the pain was everywhere and he was hungry with empty pangs down in the pit of him his head was pounding sometimes he imagined that he had stopped breathing that his heart had ceased to beat then he would hold his breath until he could hear his heart pounding an ocean in his ears and he was forced to suck air like a diver surfacing from the depths it seemed to him that the tree reached from hell to heaven and that he had been hanging there forever a brown hawk circled the tree landed on a broken branch near to him and then took to the wing flying west the storm which had abated at dawn began to return as the day passed gray roiling clouds stretched from horizon to horizon a slow drizzle began to fall the body at the base of the tree seemed to have become less in its stained motel winding sheet crumbling into itself like a sugar cake left in the rain sometimes shadow burned sometimes he froze when the thunder started once more he imagined that he heard drums beating kettledrums in the thunder and the thump of his heart inside his head or outside it did not matter neilgaiman he perceived the pain in colors the red of a neon bar sign the green of a traffic light on a wet night the blue of an empty video screen the squirrel dropped from the bark of the trunk onto shadows shoulder sharp claws digging into bis skin ratatosk it chattered the tip of its nose touched his lips ratatosk it sprang back onto the tree his skin was on fire with pins and needles a pricking covering his whole body the sensation was intolerable his life was laid out below him on the motelsheet shroud literally laid out like the items at some dada picnic a surrealist tableau he could see his mothers puzzled stare the american embassy in norway lauras eyes on their wedding day he chuckled through dry lips whats so funny puppy asked laura our wedding day he said you bribed the organist to change from playing the wedding march to the theme song from scoobydoo as you walked toward me down the aisle do you remember of course i remember darling i would have made it too if it wasnt for those meddling kids i loved you so much said shadow he could feel her lips on his and they were warm and wet and living not cold and dead so he knew that this was another hallucination you arent here are you he asked no she said but you are calling me for the last time and i am coming breathing was harder now the ropes cutting his flesh were an abstract concept like free will or eternity sleep puppy she said although he thought it might have been his own voice he heard and he slept the sun was a pewter coin in a leaden sky shadow was he realized slowly awake and he was cold but the part of him that understood that seemed very far away from the rest of american gods him somewhere in the distance he was aware that his mouth and throat were burning painful and cracked sometimes in the daylight he would see stars fall other times he saw huge birds the size of delivery trucks flying toward him nothing reached him nothing touched him ratatosk ratatosk the chattering had become a scolding the squirrel landed heavily with sharp claws on his shoulder and stared into his face he wondered if he were hallucinating the animal was holding a walnut shell like a dollshouse cup in its front paws the animal pressed the shell to shadows lips shadow felt the water and involuntarily he sucked it into his mouth drinking from the tiny cup he ran the water around his cracked lips his dry tongue he wet his mouth with it and swallowed what was left which was not much the squirrel leapt back to the tree and ran down it toward the roots and then in seconds or minutes or hours shadow could not tell which the squirrel returned with its walnutshell cup climbing carefully and shadow drank the water it brought to him the muddyiron taste of the water filled himmouth cooled his parched throat it eased his fatigue and his madness by the third walnut shell he was no longer thirsty he began to struggle then pulling at the ropes flailing his body trying to get down to get free to get away he moaned the knots were good the ropes were strong and they held and soon he exhausted himself once more in his delirium shadow became the tree its roots went deep into the loam of the earth deep down into time into the hidden springs he felt the spring of the woman called neil caiman urd which is to say past she was huge a giantess an underground mountain of a woman and the waters she guarded were the waters of time other roots went to other places some of them were secret now when he was thirsty he pulled water from his roots pulled them up into the body of his being t he had a hundred arms that broke into a hundred thousand fingers and all of his fingers reached up into the sky the weight of the sky was heavy on his shoulders it was not that the discomfort was lessened but the pain belonged to the figure hanging from the tree rather than to the tree itself shadow in his madness was now so much more than the man on the tree he was the tree and he was the wind rattling the bare branches of the world tree he was the gray sky and the tumbling clouds he was ratatosk the squirrel running from the deepest roots to the highest branches he was the madeyed hawk who sat on a broken branch at the top of the tree surveying the world he was the worm in the heart of die tree the stars wheeled and he passed his hundred hands over the glittering stars palming them switching them vanishing them a moment of clarity in the pain and die madness shadow felt himself surfacing he knew it would not be for long the morning sun was dazzling him he closed his eyes wishing he could shade them there was not long to go he knew that too when he opened his eyes shadow saw that there was a young man in the tree with him his skin was dark brown his forehead was high and his dark hair was tightly curled he was sitting on a branch high above shadows head shadow could see him clearly by craning his head and the man was mad shadow could see that at a glance american gods youre naked confided the madman in a cracked voice im naked too i see that croaked shadow the madman looked at him then he nodded and twisted his head down and around as if he were trying to remove a crick from his neck eventually he said do you know me no said shadow i know you i watched you in cairo i watched you after my sister likes you you are the name escaped him eats roadkill yes you are horus the madman nodded horus he said i am die falcon of the morning the hawk of the afternoon i am the sun as you are and i know the true name of ra my mother told me thats great said shadow politely the madman stared at the ground below them intently saying nothing then he dropped from the tree a hawk fell like a stone to the ground pulled out of its plummet into a swoop beat its wings heavily and flew back to the tree a baby rabbit in its talons it landed on a branch closer to shadow are you hungry asked the madman no said shadow i guess i should be but im not im hungry said the madman he ate the rabbit rapidly pulling it apart sucking tearing rending at he finished with them he dropped die gnawed bones and the fur to the ground he walked farther down the branch until he was only an arms length from shadow then he peered at shadow unselfconsciously inspecting him with care and caution from his feet to his head there was rabbit blood on his chin and his chest and he wiped it off with the back of his hand shadow felt he had to say something hey he said hey said the madman he stood up on the branch turned away from shadow and let a stream of dark urine arc neil caiman out into the meadow below it went on for a long time when he had finished he crouched down again on the branch what do they call you asked horus shadow said shadow the madman nodded you are the shadow iam the light he said everything that is casts a shadow then he said they will fight soon i was watching them as they started to arrive and then the madman said you are dying arent you but shadow could no longer speak a hawk took wing and circled slowly upward riding the updrafts into the morning moonlight a cough shook shadows frame a racking painful cough that stabbed his chest and his throat he gagged for bream hey puppy called a voice that he knew he looked down the moonlight burned whitely through the branches of the tree bright as day and there was a woman standing in the moonlight on the ground below him her face a pale oval the wind rattled in the branches of the tree hi puppy she said he tried to speak but he coughed instead deep in his chest for a long time you know she said helpfully that doesnt sound good he croaked hello laura she looked up at him with dead eyes and she smiled how did you find me he asked she was silent for a while in the moonlight then she said you are the nearest thing i have to life you are the only thing i have left the only thing that isnt bleak and flat and gray i could be blindfolded and dropped into the deepest ocean and i would know where to find you i could be american gods buried a hundred miles underground and i would know where you are he looked down at the woman in the moonlight and his eyes stung with tears til cut you down she said after a while i spend too much time rescuing you dont i he coughed again then no leave me i have to do this she looked up at him and shook her head youre crazy she said youre dying up there or youll be crippled if you arent already maybe he said but im alive yes she said after a moment i guess you are you told me he said in the graveyard it seems like such a long time ago puppy she said then she said i feel better here it doesnt hurt as much you know what i mean but im so dry the wind let up and he could smell her now a stink of rotten meat and sickness and decay pervasive and unpleasant i lost my job she said it was a night job but they said people had complained i told them i was sick and they said they didnt care im so thirsty the women he told her they have water the house puppy she sounded scared tell them tell them i said to give you water the white face stared up at him i should o she told him then she hacked and made a face and spat a mass of something white onto the grass it broke up when it hit the ground and wriggled away it was almost impossible to breathe his chest felt heavy and his head was swaying stay he said in a breath that was almost a whisper unsure whether or not she could hear him please dont go he started to cough stay the night ill stop awhile she said and then like a mother to a child she said nothings gonna hurt you when im here you know that neil caiman shadow coughed once more he closed his eyesonly for a moment he thought but when he opened them again the moon had set and he was alone a crashing and a pounding in his head beyond the pain of migraine beyond all pain everything dissolved info tiny butterflies which circled him like a multicolored dust storm and then evaporated into the night the white sheet wrapped about the body at the base of the tree flapped noisily in the morning wind the pounding eased everything slowed there was nothing left to make him keep breathing his heart ceased to beat in his chest the darkness that he entered this time was deep and lit by a single star and it was final chapter sixteen i know its crooked but its the only game in town canada bill jones the tree was gone and the world was gone and the morninggray sky above him was gone the sky was now the color of midnight there was a single cold star shining high above him a blazing twinkling light and nothing else he took a single step and almost tripped shadow looked down there were steps cut into the rock going down steps so huge that he could only imagine that giants had cut them and descended them a long time ago he clambered downward half jumping harfvaulting from step to step his body ached but it was the ache of lack of use not the tortured ache of a body that has hung on a tree until it was dead he observed without surprise that he was now fully dressed in jeans and a white tshirt he was barefoot he experienced a profound moment of deja vu this was what he had been wearing when he stood in czemobogs apartment the night when zorya polunochnaya had come to him and told him about the constellation called odins wain she had taken the moon down from the sky for him he knew suddenly what would happen next zorya polinochnaya would be there she was waiting for him at the bottom of the steps there as no moon in the sky but she was bathed in moonlight neil caiman nonetheless her white hair was moonpale and she wore the same laceandcotton nightdress she had worn that night in chicago she smiled when she saw him and looked down as if momentarily embarrassed hello she said hi said shadow how are you i dont know he said i think this is maybe another strange dream on the tree ive been having crazy dreams since i got out of prison her face was silvered by the moonlight and she looked both solemn and vulnerable she said all your questions can be answered if that is what you want but once you learn your answers you can never unlearn them beyond her the path forked he would have to decide which path to take he knew that but there was one thing he had to do first he reached into the pocket of his jeans and was relieved when he felt the familiar weight of the coin at the bottom of the pocket he eased it out held it between finger and thumb a liberty dollar this is yours he said he remembered then that his clothes were really at the foot of the tree the women had placed his clothes in the canvas sack from which they had taken the ropes and tied the end of the sack and the biggest of the women had placed a heavy rock on it to stop it from blowing away and so he knew that in reality the liberty dollar was in a pocket in that sack beneath therock but still it was heavy in his hand at the entrance to the underworld she took it from his palm with her slim fingers thank you it bought you your liberty twice she said and now it will light your way into dark places she closed her hand around the dollar then she reached up and placed it in the air as high as she could reach then american gods she let go of it instead of falling the coin floated upward until it was a foot or so above shadows head it was no longer a silver coin though lady liberty and her crown of spikes were gone the face he saw on the coin was the indeterminate face of the moon in the summer sky shadow could not decide whether he was looking at a moon the size of a dollar a foot above his head or whether he was looking at a moon the size of the pacific ocean many thousands of miles away nor whether there was any difference between the two ideas perhaps it was all a matter of the way you looked at it he looked at the forking path ahead of him which path should i take he asked which one is safe take one and you cannot take the other she said but neither path is safe which way would you walkthe way of hard truths or the way of fine lies truths he said ive come too far for more lies she looked sad there will be a price then she said ill pay it whats the price your name she said your real name you will have to give it to me how like this she said she reached a perfect hand toward his head he felt her fingers brush his skin then he felt them penetrate his skin his skull relt them push deep into his head something tickled in his skull and all down his spine she pulled her hand out of his head a flame like a candle flame but burning with a clear magnesiumwhite luminance was flickering on the tip of her forefinger is that my name he asked she closed her hand and the light was gone it was she said she extended her hand and pointed to the righthand path that way she said for now nameless shadow walked down the righthand path in neil caiman the moonlight when he turned around to thank her he saw nothing but darkness it seemed to him that he was deep under the ground but when he looked up into the darkness above him he still saw the tiny moon he turned a corner if this was the afterlife he thought it was a lot like the house on the rock part diorama part nightmare he was looking at himself in prison blues in the wardens office as the warden told him that laura had died in a car crash he saw the expression on his own facehe looked like a man who had been abandoned by the world it hurt him to see it the nakedness and the fear he hurried on pushed through the wardens gray office and found himself looking at the vcr repair store on the outskirts of eagle point three years ago yes inside the store he knew he was beating the living crap out of larry powers and b j west bruising his knuckles in the process pretty soon he would walk out of there carrying a brown supermarket bag filled with twentydollar bills the money they could never prove he had taken his share of the proceeds and a little more for they shouldnt have tried to rip him and laura off like that he was only the driver but he had done his part done everything that she had asked of him at the trial nobody mentioned the bank robbery although everybody wanted to they couldnt prove a thing as long as nobody was talking and nobody was the prosecutor was forced instead to stick to the bodily damage that shadow had inflicted on powers and west he showed photographs of the two men on their arrival in the local hospital shadow barely defended himself in court it was easier that way neither powers nor west seemed able to remember what the fight had been about but they each admitted that shadow had been their assailant nobody talked about the money american gods nobody even mentioned laura and that was all that shadow had wanted shadow wondered whether the path of comforting lies would have been a better one to walk he walked away from that place and followed the rock path down into what looked like a hospital room a public hospital in chicago and he felt the bile rise in his throat he stopped he did not want to look he did not want to keep walking in the hospital bed his mother was dying again as shed died when he was sixteen and yes here he was a large clumsy sixteenyearold with acne pocking his creamandcoffee skin sitting at her bedside unable to look at her reading a thick paperback book shadow wondered what the book was and he walked around the hospital bed to inspect it more closely he stood between the bed and the chair looking from the one to the other the big boy hunched into his chair his nose buried in gravitys rainbow trying to escape from his mothers death into london during the blitz the fictional madness of the book no escape and no excuse his mothers eyes were closed in a morphine peace what she had thought was just another sicklecell cfislk another bout of pain to be endured had turned out they had discovered too late to be lymphoma there was a lemonishgray tinge to her skin she was in her early thirties but she looked much older shadow wanted to shake himself the awkward boy that he once was get him to hold her hand talk to her do something before she slipped away as he knew that she would but he could not touch himself and he continued to read and so his mother died while he sat in the chair next to her reading a fat book after that he had more or less stopped reading you could not trust fiction what good were books if they couldnt protect you from something like that neil caiman shadow walked away from the hospital room down the winding corridor deep into the bowels of the earth he sees his mother first and he cannot believe how young she is not yet twentyfive he guesses before her medical discharge theyre in their apartment another embassy rental somewhere in northern europe he looks around for something to give him a clue and he sees himself a shrimp of a kid big pale gray eyes and dark hair they are arguing shadow knows without hearing the words what theyre arguing about it was the only thing they quarreled about after all tell me about my father hes dead dont ask about him but who was he forget him dead and gone and you aint missed nothing i want to see a picture of him i ain got a picture shed say and her voice would get quiet and fierce and he knew that if he kept asking her questions she would shout or even hit him and he knew that he would not stop asking questions so he turned away and walked on down die tunnel the path he followed twisted and wound and curled back on itself and it put him in mind of snakeskins and intestines and of deep deep tree roots there was a pool to his left he heard the drip drip of water into it somewhere at the back of the tunnel the falling water barely ruffling the mirrored surface of the pool he dropped to his knees and drank using his hand to bring the water to his lips then he walked on until he was standing in the floating discoglitter patterns of a mirror ball it was like being in the exact center of the universe with all the stars and planets circling him and he could not hear anything not the music nor the shouted conversations over the music and now shadow was staring at a woman who looked just like his mother never looked in all american gods the years he knew her shes little more than a child after all and she is dancing shadow found that he was completely unsurprised when he recognized the man who dances with her he had not changed that much in thirtythree years she is drunk shadow could see that at a glance she is not very drunk but she is unused to drink and in a week or so she will take a ship to norway they have been drinking margaritas and she has salt on her lips and salt clinging to the back of her hand wednesday is not wearing a suit and tie but the pin in the shape of a silver tree he wears over the pocket of his shirt glitters and glints when the mirrorball light catches it they make a finelooking couple considering the difference in their ages there is a lupine grace to wednesdays movements a slow dance he pulls her close to him and his pawlike hand curves around the seat of her skirt possessively moving her closer to him his other hand takes her chin pushes it upward into his face and the two of them kisshere on the floor as the glitterball lights circle them intotfie center of the universe soon after they leave she sways against him and he leads her from the dance hall i shadow buried his head in his hands and did not follow them unable or unwilling to witness his own conception the mirror lights were gone and now the only illumination came from the tiny moon that burned high above his head he walked on at a bend in the path he stopped for a moment to catch his breath he felt a hand run gently up his back and gentle fingers ruffle the hair on the back of his head hello whispered a smoky feline voice over his shoulder neil caiman hello he said turning to face her she had brown hair and brown skin and her eyes were the deep goldenamber of good honey her pupils were vertical slits do i know you he asked puzzled intimately she said and she smiled i used to sleep on your bed and my people have been keeping their eyes on you for me she turned to the path ahead of him pointed to the three ways he could go okay she said one way will make you wise one way will make you whole and one way will kill you im already dead i think said shadow i died on the tree she made a moue theres dead she said and theres dead and theres dead its a relative thing then she smiled again i could make a joke about that you know something about dead relatives no said shadow its okay so she said which way do you want to go i dont know he admitted she tipped her head on one side a perfectly feline gesture suddenly shadow remembered the claw marks on his shoulder he felt himself beginning to blush if you trust me said bast i can choose for you i trust you he said without hesitation do you want to know what its going to cost you ive already lost my name he told her names come and names go was it worth it yes maybe it wasnt easy as revelations go it was kind of personal all revelations are personal she said thats why all revelations are suspect i dont understand no she said you dont ill take your heart well need it later and she reached her hand deep inside his chest and she pulled it out with something ruby and pulsing held between her sharp fingernails it was the color of american cods pigeons blood and it was made of pure light rhythmically it expanded and contracted she closed her hand and it was gone take the middle way she said shadow nodded and walked on the path was becoming slippery now there was ice on the rock the moon above him glittered through the ice crystals in the air there was a ring about the moon a moonbow diffusing the light it was beautiful but it made walking harder the path was unreliable he reached the place where the path divided he looked at the first path with a feeling of recognition it opened into a vast chamber or a set of chambers like a dark museum he knew it already he could hear the long echoes of tiny noises he could hear the noise that the dust makes as it settles it was the place that he had dreamed of that first night that laura had come to him in the motel so long ago the endless memorial hall to the gods that were forgotten and the ones whose very existence had been lost he took a step backward he walked to the path on the far side and looted ahead there was a disneyland quality to the corridor black plexiglas walls with lights set in them the colored lights blinked and flashed in the illusion of order focno particular reason like the console lights on a television itarship he could hear something there as well a deep vibrating bass drone which shadow could feel in the pit of his stomach he stopped and looked around neither way seemed right not any longer he was done with paths the middle way the way the catwoman had told him to walk that was his way he moved toward it the moon above him was beginning to fade the edge of it was pinking and going into eclipse the path was framed by a huge doorway neil caiman shadow walked through the arch in darkness the air was warm and it smelled of wet dust like a city street after the summers first rain he was not afraid not anymore fear had died on die tree as shadow had died there was no fear left no hatred no pain nothjng left but essence something big splashed quietly in the distance and the splash echoed into the vastness he squinted but could see nothing it was too dark and then from the direction of the splashes a ghostlight glimmered and the world took form he was in a cavern and in front of him mirrorsmooth was water the splashing noises came closer and the light became brighter and shadow waited on die shore soon enough a low flat boat came into sight a flickering white lantern burning at its raised prow another reflected in the glassy black water several feet below it the boat was being poled by a tall figure and the splashing noise shadow had heard was the sound of the pole being lifted and moved as it pushed the craft across the waters of the underground lake hello there called shadow echoes of his words suddenly surrounded him he could imagine that a whole chorus of people were welcoming him and calling to him and each of them had his voice the person poling the boat made no reply the boats pilot was tall and very thin heif it was a hewore an unadorned white robe and the pale head mat topped it was so utterly inhuman that shadow was certain that it had to be a mask of some sort it was a birds head small on a long neck its beak long and high shadow was certain he had seen it before this ghostly birdlike figure he grasped at die memory and then disappointed realized that he was picturing the clockwork pennyintheslot machine in the house on the rock and die pale birdlike half americangods glimpsed figure that glided out from behind die crypt for the drunkards soul water dripped and echoed from the pole and die prow and the ships wake rippled die glassy waters the boat was made of reeds bound and tied the boat came close to die shore the pilot leaned on its pole its head turned slowly until it was facing shadow hello it said widiout moving its long beak the voice was male and like everything else in shadows afterlife so far familiar come on board youll get your feet wet im afraid but dieres not a diing can be done about dial these are old boats and if i come in closer i could rip out die bottom shadow took off his shoes and stepped out into die water it came halfway up his calves and was after die initial shock of wetness surprisingly warm he reached die boat and die pilot put down a hand and pulled him aboard the reed boat rocked a little and water splashed over die low sides of it and then it steadied the pilot poled off away from die shore shadow stood tiiere and watched his pants legs dripping i know you he said to die creature at tiietjrow you do indeed said the boatman the oil lamp mat hung at the front of die boat burned more fitfully and die smoke from die lamp made shadow cough you worked for me im afraid we had to inter lila goodchild widiout you the voice was fussy and precise the smoke stung shadows eyes he wiped die tears away widi his hand and through die smoke he diought he saw a tall man in a suit witii goldrimmed spectacles the smoke cleared and die boatman was once more a halfhuman creature with the head of a river bird mister ibis good to see you said die creature widi mr ibiss voice do you know what a psychopomp is neil caiman shadow thought he knew the word but it had been a long time he shook his head its a fancy term for an escort said mr ibis we all have so many functions so many ways of existing in my own vision of myself i am a scholar who lives quietly and pens his little tales and dreams about a past thaj may or may not ever have existed and that is true as far as it goes but i am also in one of my capacities like so many of the people you have chosen to associate with a psychopomp i escort the living to the world of the dead i thought this was the world of the dead said shadow no not per se its more of a preliminary the boat slipped and slid across the mirrorsurface of the underground pool and then mr ibis said without moving its beak you people talk about the living and the dead as if they were two mutually exclusive categories as if you cannot have a river that is also a road or a song that is also a color you cant said shadow can you the echoes whispered his words back at him from across the pool what you have to remember said mr ibis testily is that life and death are different sides of the same coin like the heads and tails of a quarter and if i had a doubleheaded quarter you dont shadow had a frisson then as they crossed the dark water he imagined he could see the faces of children staring up at him reproachfully from beneath the waters glassy surface their faces were waterlogged and softened their blind eyes clouded there was no wind in that underground cavern to disturb the black surface of the lake so im dead said shadow he was getting used to the idea or im going to be dead we are on our way to the hall of the dead i requested that i be the one to come for you why american gods you were a hard worker why not because shadow marshaled his thoughts because i never believed in you because i dont know much about egyptian mythology because i didnt expect this what happened to saint peter and the pearly gates the longbeaked white head shook from side to side gravely it doesnt matter that you didnt believe in us said mr ibis we believed in you the boat touched bottom mr ibis stepped off the side into the pool and told shadow to do the same mr ibis took a line from the prow of the boat and passed shadow the lantern to cany it was in the shape of a crescent moon they walked ashore and mr ibis tied the boat to a metal ring set in the rock floor then he took the lamp from shadow and walked swiftly forward holding the lamp high as he walked throwing vast shadows across the rock floor and the high rock walls are you scared asked mr ibis not really well try to cultivate the emotions of true awe and spiritual terror as we walk they are the appropriate feelings for the situation at hand shadow was not scared he was interested and apprehensive but no more he was not scared of the shifting darkness nor of being dead nor even erf the dogheaded creature the size of a grain silo who stared at them as they approached it growled deep in its throat and shadow felt his neck hairs prickle shadow it said now is the time of judgment shadow looked up at the creature mr jacquel he said the hands of anubis came down huge dark hands and they picked shadow up and brought him close the jackal head examined him with bright and glittering eyes examined him as dispassionately as mr jacquel had examined die dead girl on the slab shadow knew that all his faults all his failings all his weaknesses were being it neil caiman taken out and weighed and measured that he was in some way being dissected and sliced and tasted we do not always remember the things that do no credit to us we justify them cover them in bright lies or with the thick dust of forgetfulness all of the things that shadow had done in his life of which he was not proud all tjie things he wished he had done otherwise or left undone came at him then in a swirling storm of guilt and regret and shame and he had nowhere to hide from them he was as naked and as open as a corpse on a table and dark anubis the jackal god was his prosector and his prosecutor and his persecutor please said shadow please stop but the examination did not stop every lie he had ever told every object he had stolen every hurt he had inflicted on another person all the little crimes and the tiny murders that make up the day each of these things and more were extracted and held up to the light by the jackalheaded judge of the dead shadow began to weep painfully in the palm of the dark gods hand he was a tiny child again as helpless and as powerless as he had ever been and then without warning it was over shadow panted and sobbed and snot streamed from bis nose he still felt helpless but the hands placed him carefully almost tenderly down on the rock floor who has his heart growled anubis i do purred a womans voice shadow looked up bast was standing there beside the thing that was no longer mr ibis and she held shadows heart in her right hand it lit her face with a ruby light give it to me said thoth the ibisheaded god and he tookthe heart in his hands which were not human hands and he glided forward anubis placed a pair of golden scales in front of him american gods so is this where we find out what i get whispered shadow to bast heaven hell purgatory if the feather balances she said you get to choose your own destination and if not she shrugged as if the subject made her uncomfortable then she said then we feed your heart and your soul to ammet the eater of souls maybe he said maybe i can get some kind of a happy ending not only are there no happy endings she told him there arent even any endings on one of the pans of the scales carefully reverently anubis placed a feather anubis put shadows heart on the other pan of the scales something moved in the shadows under the scale something it made shadow uncomfortable to examine too closely it was a heavy feather but shadow had a heavy heart and the scales tipped and swung worryingly but they balanced in the end and the creature in the shadows skulked away unsatisfied f so thats that said bast wistfully just another skull for the pile its a pity i had hoped that you would do some good in the current troubles its like watching a slawmotion car crash and being powerless to prevent it you wont be there she shook her head i dont like other people picking my battles for me she said there was silence then in the vast hall of death where it echoed of water and the dark shadow said so now i get to choose where i go next choose said thoth or we can choose for you no said shadow its okay its my choice well roared anubis neil caiman i want to rest now said shadow thats what i want i want nothing no heaven no hell no anything just let it end youre certain asked thoth yes said shadow mr jacquel opened the last door for shadow anl behind that door there was nothing not darkness not even oblivion only nothing shadow accepted it completely and without reservation and he walked through the door into nothing with a strange fierce joy chapter seventeen everything is upon a great scale upon this continent the riven are immense the climate violent in heat and cold the prospects magnificent the thunder and lightning tremendous the disorders incident to the country make every constitution tremble our own blunders here our misconduct our

translated as the mountain that rises to a point in the s andrew jacksons indian relocation act exiled them from their landall the choctaw and chickamauga and cherokee and chickasawand us troops forced every one of them they could catch to walk over a thousand miles to the new indian territories in what would one day be oklahoma down the trail of tears an act of casual genocide thousands of men women and children died on the way when youve won youve won and nobody can argue with that for whoever controlled lookout mountain controlled the land that was the legend it was a sacred site after all and it was a high place in the civil war the war between the states there was a battle there the battle above the clouds that was the first days fighting and then the union forces did the impossible and without orders swept up missionary ridge and took it the north took lookout mountain and the north took the war there are tunnels and caves some very old beneath lookout mountain for the most part they are blocked off now although a local businessman excavated an underground waterfall which he called ruby falls it can be reached by elevator its a tourist attraction although the biggest tourist attraction of all is at the top of lookout mountain that is rock city rock city begins as an ornamental garden on a mountainside its visitors walk a path that takes them through rocks over rocks between rocks they throw corn into a deer enclosure cross a hanging bridge and peer out through american gods a quarterathrow binoculars at a view that promises mem seven states on the rare sunny days when the air is perfectly clear and from mere like a drop into some strange hell the path takes the visitors millions upon millions of them every year down into caverns where they stare at backlit dolls arranged into nurseryrhyme and fairytale dioramas when they leave they leave bemused uncertain of why they came of what they have seen of whether they had a good time or not they came to lookout mountain from all across the united states they were not tourists they came by car and they came by plane and by bus and by railroad and on foot some of mem flewthey flew low and they flew only in the dark of the night several of them traveled their own ways beneath the earth many of them hitchhiked cadging rides from nervous motorists or from truck drivers those who had cars or trucks would see the ones who had not walking beside the roads or at rest stations and in diners on the way and recognizing them for what they were would offer them rides t they arrived duststained and weary at the footof lookout mountain looking up to the heights of the treecovered slope they could see or imagine that they could see the paths and gardens and waterfall of rock city they started arriving early in the mornfhg a second wave of them arrived at dusk and for several days they simply kept coming a battered uhaul truck pulled up disgorging several travelweary vila and rusalka their makeup smudged runs in their stockings their expressions heavylidded and tired in a clump of trees at the bottom of the hill an elderly wampyr offered a marlboro to a naked apelike creature covered with a tangle of orange fur it accepted graciously and they smoked in silence side by side a toyota previa pulled over by the side of the road and neil caiman seven chinese men and women got out of it they looked above all clean and they wore the kind of dark suits that in some countries are worn by minor government officials one of them carried a clipboard and he checked the inventory as they unloaded large golf bags from the back of the car the bags contained ornate swords with lacquer handles and carved sticks and mirrors the weapons were distributed checked off signed for a oncefamous comedian believed to have died in the s climbed out of his rusting car and proceeded to remove his clothing his legs were goat legs and his tail was short and goatish four mexicans arrived all smiles their hair black and very shiny they passed among themselves a bottle that they kept out of sight in a brown paper bag its contents a bitter mixture of powdered chocolate liquor and blood a small darkbearded man with a dusty black derby on his head curling payess at his temples and a ragged fringed prayer shawl came to them walking across the fields he was several feet in front of his companion who was twice his height and was the blank gray color of good polish clay the word inscribed on his forehead meant truth they kept coming a cab drew up and several rakshasas the demons of the indian subcontinent climbed out and milled around staring at the people at the bottom of the hill without speaking until they found mamaji her eyes closed her lips moving in prayer she was the only thing here that was familiar to them but still they hesitated to approach her remembering old battles her hands rubbed the necklace of skulls about her neck her brown skin became slowly black the glassy black of jet of obsidian her lips curled and her long white teeth were very sharp she opened all her eyes beckoned the rakshasas to her and greeted them as she would have greeted her own children the storms of the last few days to the north and the east american gods had done nothing to ease the feeling of pressure and discomfort in the air local weather forecasters had begun to warn of cells that might spawn tornados of highpressure areas that did not move it was warm by day there but the nights were cold they clumped together in informal companies banding together sometimes by nationality by race by temperament even by species they looked apprehensive they looked tired some of them were talking there was laughter on occasion but it was muted and sporadic sixpacks of beer were handed around several local men and women came walking over the meadows their bodies moving in unfamiliar ways their voices when they spoke were the voices of the loa who rode them a tall black man spoke in the voice of papa legba who opens the gates while baron samedi the voudon lord of death had taken over the body of a teenage goth girl from chattanooga possibly because she possessed her own black silk top hat which sat on her dark hair at a jaunty angle she spoke in the barons owndeep voice smoked a cigar of enormous size and commansed three of the cede the loa of the dead the cede inhabited the bodies of three middleaged brothers they carried shotguns and told jokes of such astounding filthinessfcat only they were willing to laugh at them which they did raucously two ageless chickamauga women in oilstained blue jeans and battered leather jackets walked around watching the people and the preparations for battle sometimes they pointed and shook their heads they did not intend to take part in the coming conflict the moon swelled and rose in the east a day away from full it seemed half as big as the sky as it rose a deep reddishorange immediately above the hills as it crossed the sky it seemed to shrink and pale until it hung high in the sky like a lantern neil caiman there were so many of them waiting there in the moonlight at the foot of lookout mountain laura was thirsty sometimes living people burned steadily in her mind like candles and sometimes they flamed like torches it made them easy to avoid and it made them easy on occasion to find shadow had burned so strangely with his own light up on that tree she had chided him once when they had walked and held hands for not being alive she had hoped then to see a spark of raw emotion to have seen anything she remembered walking beside him wishing that he could understand what she was trying to say but dying on the tree shadow had been utterly alive she had watched him as the life had faded and he had been focused and real and he had asked her to stay with him to stay the whole night he had forgiven her perhaps he had forgiven her it did not matter he had changed that was all she knew shadow had told her to go to the farmhouse that they would give her water to drink there there were no lights burning in the farm building and she could feel nobody at home but he had told her that they would care for her she pushed against the door of the farmhouse and it opened rusty hinges protesting the whole while something moved in her left lung something that pushed and squirmed and made her cough she found herself in a narrow hallway her way almost blocked by a tall and dusty piano the inside of the building smelled of old damp she squeezed past the piano pushed open a door and found herself in a dilapidated drawing room filled with ramshackle furniture an oil lamp burned on the mantelpiece there was a coal fire burning in the fireplace beneath it although she had neither seen nor smelled smoke outside the house the coal fire did nothing american gods to lift the chill she felt in that room although laura was willing to concede that might not be the fault of the room death hurt laura although the hurt consisted mostly of things that were not there a parching thirst that drained every cell of her an absence of heat in her bones that was absolute sometimes she would catch herself wondering whether the crisp and crackling flames of a pyre would warm her or the soft brown blanket of the earth whether the cold sea would quench her thirst the room she realized was not empty three women sat on an elderly couch as if they had come as a matched set in some peculiar artistic exhibition the couch was upholstered in threadbare velvet a faded brown that might once a hundred years ago have been a bright canary yellow they followed her with their eyes as she entered the room and they said nothing laura had not known they would be there something wriggled and fell in her nasal cavity laura fumbled in her sleeve for a tissue and she blew her nose into it she crumpled the tissue and flung it and its contents onto the coals of the fire watched it crumple and blacken and become orange lace she watched the maggoisshrivel and brown and burn this done she turned back to the women on the couch they had not moved since she had entered not a muscle not a hair they stared at her hello is this your farm she asked the largest of the women nodded her hands were very red and her expression was impassive shadowthats the guy hanging on the tree hes my husbandhe said i should tell you that he wants you to give me water something large shifted in her bowels it squirmed and then was still the smallest woman clambered off the couch her feet had not previously reached the floor she scurried from the room neil caiman laura could hear doors opening and closing through the farmhouse then from outside she could hear a series of loud creaks each was followed by a splash of water soon enough the small woman returned she was carrying a brown earthenware jug of water she put it down carefully on the table and retreated to the couch she pulled herself up with a wriggle and a shiver and was seated beside her sisters once again thank you laura walked over to the table looked around for a cup or a glass but there was nothing like that to be seen she picked up the jug it was heavier than it looked the water in it was perfectly clear she raised the jug to her lips and began to drink the water was colder than she had ever imagined liquid water could be it froze her tongue and her teeth and her gullet still she drank unable to stop feeling die water freezing its way into her stomach her bowels her heart her veins the water flowed into her it was like liquid ice she realized that the jug was empty and surprised she put it down on the table the women were observing her dispassionately since her death laura had not thought in metaphors things were or they were not but now as she looked at the women on the sofa she found herself thinking of juries of scientists observing a laboratory animal she shook suddenly and convulsively she reached out a hand to the table to steady herself but the table was slipping and lurching and it almost avoided her grasp as she put her hand on the table she began to vomit she brought up bile and formalin centipedes and maggots and then she felt herself starting to void and to piss stuff was being pushed violently wetly from her body she would have screamed if she could but then the dusty floorboards came up to meet her so fast and so hard that had she been breathing they would have knocked the breath from her body american gods time rushed over her and into her swirling like a dust devil a thousand memories began to play at once she was lost in a department store the week before christmas and her father was nowhere to be seen and now she was sitting in the bar at chichis ordering a strawberry daiquiri and checking out her blind date the big grave manchild and wondering how he kissed and she was in the car as sickeningly it rolled and jolted and robbie was screaming at her until the metal post finally stopped the car but not its contents from moving the water of time which comes from the spring of fate urds well is not the water of life not quite it feeds the roots of the world tree though and there is no other water like it when laura woke in the empty farmhouse room she was shivering and her breath actually steamed in the morning air there was a scrape on the back of her hand and a wet smear on the scrape the vivid red of fresh blood and she knew where she had to go she had drunk from the water of time which comes from the spring of fate she could see the mountain in her mind she licked the blood from the back of her hand marveling at the film of saliva and she began to walfe it was a wet march day and it was unseasonably cold and the storms of the previous few days had lashed their way across the southern states which meant that there were very few real tourists at rock city on lookout mountain the christmas lights had been taken down the summer visitors were yet to start coming still there were people there there was even a tour bus that drew up that morning releasing a dozen men and women with perfect tans and gleaming reassuring smiles they looked like news anchors and one could almost imagine there was a phosphordot quality to them they seemed to blur gently as they moved a black humvee was parked in the front lot of rock city neil caiman the tv people walked intently through rock city stationing themselves near the balancing rock where they talked to each other in pleasant reasonable voices they were not the only people in this wave of visitors if you had walked the paths of rock city that day you might have noticed people who looked like movie stars and people who looked like aliens and a number of people who looked most of all like the idea of a person and nothing like the reality you might have seen them but most likely you would never have noticed them at all they came to rock city in long limousines and in small sports cars and in oversized suvs many of them wore the sunglasses of those who habitually wear sunglasses indoors and out and do not willingly or comfortably remove them there were suntans and suits and shades and smiles and scowls they came in all sizes and shapes all ages and styles all they had in common was a look a very specific look it said you know me or perhaps you ought to know me an instant familiarity that was also a distance a look or an attitudethe confidence that the world existed for them and that it welcomed them and that they were adored the fat kid moved among them with the shuffling walk of one who despite having no social skills has still become successful beyond his dreams his black coat flapped in the wind something that stood beside the soft drink stand in mother goose court coughed to attract his attention it was massive and scalpel blades jutted from its face and its fingers its face was cancerous it will be a mighty battle it told him in a glutinous voice its not going to be a battle said the fat kid all were facing here is a fucking paradigm shift its a shakedown modalities like battle are so fucking lao tzu the cancerous thing blinked at him waiting is all it said in reply american gods whatever said the fat kid then im looking for mister world you seen him the thing scratched itself with a scalpel blade a tumorous lower lip pushed out in concentration then it nodded over there it said the fat kid walked away without a thank you in the direction indicated the cancerous thing waited saying nothing until the kid was out of sight it will be a battle said the cancerous thing to a woman whose face was smudged with phosphor dots she nodded and leaned closer to it so how does that make you feel she asked in a sympathetic voice it blinked and then it began to tell her towns ford explorer had a global positioning system a little screen that listened to the satellites and showed the car its location but he still got lost once he got south of blacksburg and onto the country roads the roads he drove seemed to bear little relationship to the tangle of lines on the map on the screen eventually he stopped the car in a country lane wound down the window and asked a fal white woman being pulled by a wolfhound on its eariytnorning walk for directions to ashtree farm she nodded and pointed and said something to him he could not understand what she had said but he said thanks a million and wound up the window and drovfe off in the general direction she had indicated he kept going for another forty minutes down country road after country road none of them the road he sought town began to chew his lower lip im too old for this shit he said aloud relishing the moviestar worldweariness of the line he was pushing fifty most of his working life had been spent in a branch of government that went only by its initials and whether or not he had left his government job a dozen years ago for employment by the private sector was neil caiman open to debate some days he thought one way some days another anyway it was only the joes on the street that really believed there was a difference he was on the verge of giving up on the farm when he crested a hill and saw the sign hand painted on the gate it said simply as he had been told it would ash he pulled up the ford explorer climbed out and untwisted the wire that held the gate closed he got back in the car and drove through it was like cooking a frog he thought you put the frog in the water and then you turn on the heat and by the time the frog notices that theres anything wrong its already been cooked the world in which he worked was all too weird there was no solid ground beneath his feet the water in the pot was bubbling fiercely when hed been transferred to die agency it had all seemed so simple now it was all sonot complex he decided merely bizarre he had been sitting in mr worlds office at two that morning and he had been told what he was to do you got it said mr world handing him the knife in its dark leather sheath cut me a stick it doesnt have to be longer than a couple of feet affirmative he said and then he said why do i have to do this sir because i tell you to said mr world flatly find the tree do the job meet me down in chattanooga dont waste any time and what about the asshole shadow if you see him just avoid him dont touch him dont even mess with him i dont want you turning him into a martyr theres no room for martyrs in the current game plan he smiled then his scarred smile mr world was easily amused mr town had noticed this on several occasions it had amused him to play chauffeur in kansas after all look american gods no martyrs town and town had nodded and taken the knife in its sheath and pushed the rage that welled up inside him down deep and away mr towns hatred of shadow had become a part of him as he was falling asleep he would see shadows solemn face see that smile that wasnt a smile the way shadow had of smiling without smiling that made town want to sink his fist into the mans gut and even as he fell asleep he could feel his jaws squeeze together his temples tense his gullet bum he drove the ford explorer across the meadow past an abandoned farmhouse he crested a ridge and saw the tree he parked the car a little way past it and turned off the engine the clock on the dashboard said it was am he left the keys in the car and walked toward the tree the tree was large it seemed to exist on its own sense of scale town could not have said if it was fifty feet high or two hundred its bark was the gray of a fine silk scarf there was a naked man tied to the trunk a little way above the ground by a webwork of ropes and there was something wrapped in a sheet at the foot of the tree townrealized what it was as he passed it he pushed at the sheet with his foot wednesdays ruined halfaface stared out at him town reached the tree he walked a little way around the thick trunk away from the sightless eyes of the farmhouse then he unzipped his fly and pissed against the trunk of the tree he did up his fly he walked back over to the house found wooden extension ladder carried it back to the tree he leaned it carefully against the trunk then he climbed up it shadow hung limply from the ropes that tied him to the tree town wondered if the man was still alivehis chest did not rise or fall dead or almost dead it did not matter hello asshole town said aloud shadow did not move neil caiman town reached the top of the ladder and he pulled out the knife he found a small branch that seemed to meet mr worlds specifications and hacked at the base of it with the knife blade cutting it half through then breaking it off with his hand it was about thirty inches long he put the knife back in its sheath then hestarted to climb back down the ladder when he was opposite shadow he paused god i hate you he said he wished he could just have taken out a gun and shot him and he knew that he could not and then he jabbed the stick in the air toward the hanging man in a stabbing motion it was an instinctive gesture containing all the frustration and rage inside town he imagined that he was holding a spear and twisting it into shadows guts come on he said aloud time to get moving then he thought first sign of madness talking to yourself he climbed down a few more steps then jumped the rest of the way to the ground he looked at the stick he was holding and felt like a small boy holding his stick as a sword or a spear could have cut a stick from any tree he thought it didn t have to be this tree who the fuck would have known and he thought mr world would have known he carried the ladder back to the farmhouse from the corner of his eye he thought he saw something move and he looked in through the window into the dark room filled with broken furniture with the plaster peeling from the walls and for a moment in a half dream he imagined that he saw three women sitting in the dark parlor one of them was knitting one of them was staring directly at him one of them appeared to be asleep the woman who was staring at him began to smile a huge smile that seemed to split her face lengthwise a smile that crossed from ear to ear then she raised a finger and touched it to her neck and ran it gently from one side of her neck to the other that was what he thought he saw all in a moment in that american gods empty room which contained he saw at a second glance nothing more than old rotting furniture and flyspotted prints and dry rot there was nobody there at all he rubbed his eyes town walked back to the brown ford explorer and climbed in he tossed the stick onto the white leather of the passenger seat he turned the key in the ignition the dashboard clock said am town frowned and checked his wristwatch which blinked that it was great he thought was either up on that tree for eight hours or for minus a minute that was what he thought but what he believed was that both timepieces had coincidentally begun to misbehave on the tree shadows body began to bleed the wound was in his side the blood that came from it was slow and thick and molassesblack clouds covered the top of lookout mountain easter sat some distance away from the crowd at the bottom of the mountain watching the dawn over the hills to the east she had a chain of blue forgetmenots tattooed around her left wrist and she rubbed themr absently with her right thumb another night had come and gone and nothing the folk were still coming by ones and twos the last night had brought several creatures from the southwest including two small boys each the size of an apple tree and something that she had only glimpsed but that had looked like a disembodied head the size of a vw bug they had disappeared into the trees at the base of the mountain nobody bothered them nobody from the outside world even seemed to have noticed they were there she imagined the tourists at rock city staring down at them through their insertaquarter binoculars staring straight at a ramshackle encampment of things and people at the foot of the mountain and seeing nothing but trees and bushes and rocks neil caiman she could smell the smoke from a cooking fire a smell of burning bacon on the chilly dawn wind someone at the far end of the encampment began to play the harmonica which made her involuntarily smile and shiver she had a paperback book in her backpack and she waited for the sky to become light enough for her to read there were two dots in the sky immediately below the clouds a small one and a larger one a spatter of rain brushed her face in the morning wind a barefoot girl came out from the encampment walking toward her she stopped beside a tree hitched up her skirts and squatted when she had finished easter hailed her the girl walked over good morning lady she said the battle will start soon now the tip of her pink tongue touched her scarlet lips she had a black crows wing tied with leather onto her shoulder a crows foot on a chain around her neck her arms were bluetattooed with lines and patterns and intricate knots how do you know the girl grinned i am macha of the morrigan when war comes i can smell it in the air i am a war goddess and i say blood shall be spilled this day oh said easter well there you go she was watching the smaller dot in the sky as it tumbled down toward them dropping like a rock and we shall fight them and we shall kill them every one said the girl and we shall take their heads as trophies and the crows shall have their eyes and their corpses the dot had become a bird its wings outstretched riding the gusty morning winds above them easter cocked her head on one side is that some hidden war goddess knowledge she asked the whole whosgoingtowin thing who gets whose head no said the girl i can smell the battle but thats all american gods but well win wont we we have to i saw what they did to the allfather its them or us yeah said easter i suppose it is the girl smiled again in the halflight and made her way back to the camp easter put her hand down and touched a green shoot that stabbed up from the earth like a knife blade as she touched it it grew and opened and twisted and changed until she was resting her hand on a green tulip head when the sun was high the flower would open easter looked up at the hawk can i help you she said the hawk circled about fifteen feet above easters head slowly then it glided down to her and landed on the ground nearby it looked up at her with mad eyes hello cutie she said now what do you really look like eh the hawk hopped toward her uncertainly and then it was no longer a hawk but a young man he looked at her and then looked down at the grass you he said his glance went everywhere to the grass to the sky to the bushes not to her me she said what about me you he stopped he seemed to be tryfrigto muster his thoughts strange expressions flitted and swam across his face he spent too long a bird she thought he has forgotten how to be a man she waited patiently eventually he said will you come with me maybe where do you want me to go the man on the tree he needs you a ghost hurt in his side the blood came then it stopped i think he is dead theres a war on i cant just go running away the naked man said nothing just moved from one foot to another as if he were uncertain of his weight as if he were used to resting on the air or on a swaying branch not on the solid earth then he said if he is gone forever it is all over neil caiman but the battle if he is lost it will not matter who wins he looked like he needed a blanket and a cup of sweet coffee and someone to take him somewhere he could just shiver and babble until he got his mind back he held his arms stiffly against his sides where is this nearby he stared at the tulip plant and shook his head way away well she said im needed here and i cant just leave how do you expect me to get there i cant fly like you you know no said horus you cant then he looked up gravely and pointed to the other dot that circled them as it dropped from the darkening clouds growing in size he can another several hours pointless driving and by now town hated the global positioning system almost as much as he hated shadow there was no passion in the hate though he had thought finding his way to the farm to the great silver ash tree had been hard finding his way away from the farm was much harder it did not seem to matter which road he took which direction he drove down the narrow country lanesthe twisting virginia back roads that must have begun he was sure as deer trails and cowpathseventually he would find himself passing the farm once more and the handpainted sign ash this was crazy wasnt it he simply had to retrace his way take a left turn for every right he had taken on his way here a right turn for every left only that was what he had done last time and now here he was back at the farm once more there were heavy storm clouds coming in it was getting dark fast it felt like night not morning and he had a long drive ahead of him american gods he would never get to chattanooga before afternoon at this rate his cell phone gave him only a no service message the foldout map in the cars glove compartment showed the main roads all the interstates and the real highways but as far as it was concerned nothing else existed nor was there anyone around that he could ask the houses were set back from the roads there were no welcoming lights now the fuel gauge was nudging empty he heard a rumble of distant thunder and a single drop of rain splashed heavily onto his windshield so when town saw the woman walking along the side of the road he found himself smiling involuntarily thank god he said aloud and he drew up beside her he thumbed down the window maam im sorry im kind of lost can you tell me how to get to highway eightyone from here she looked at him through the open passengerside window and said you know i dont think i can explain it but i can show you if you like she was pale and her wet hair was long and dark tjr climb in said town he didnt even hesitate first thing we need to buy some gas thanks she said i needed a ride he got in her eyes were astonishingly blue theres a slick here on the seat she said puzzled just throw it in the back where are you heading he asked lady if you can get me to a gas station and back to a freeway ill take you all the way to your own front door she said thank you but i think im going farther than you are if you can get me to the freeway that will be fine maybe a trucker will give me a ride and she smiled a crooked determined smile it was the smile that did it maam he said i can give you a finer ride than any trucker he could smell her perfume it was heady and j neil caiman heavy a cloying scent like magnolias or lilacs but he did not mind im going to georgia she said its a long way im going to chattanooga ill take you as far as i can mm she said whats your name they call me mack said mr town when he was talking to women in bars he would sometimes follow that up with and the ones that know me really well call me big mack that could wait with a long drive ahead of them they would have many hours in each others company to get to know each other whats yours laura she told him well laura he said im sure were going to be great friends the fat kid found mr world in the rainbow rooma walled section of the path its window glass covered in clear plastic sheets of green and red and yellow film he was walking impatiently from window to window staring out in turn at a golden world a red world a green world his hair was reddishorange and closecropped to his skull he wore a burberry raincoat the fat kid coughed mr world looked up excuse me mister world yes is everything on schedule the fat kids mouth was dry he licked his lips and said ive set up everything i dont have confirmation on the choppers the helicopters will be here when we need them good said the fat kid good he stood there not saying anything not going away there was a bruise on his forehead after a while mr world said is there anything else i can do for you a pause the boy swallowed and nodded something else he said yes american gods would you feel more comfortable discussing it in private the boy nodded again mr world walked with the kid back to his operations center a damp cave containing a diorama of drunken pixies making moonshine with a still a sign outside warned tourists away during renovations the two men sat down on plastic chairs how can i help you asked mr world yes okay right two things okay one what are we waiting for and two two is harder look we have the guns right we have the firepower they have they have fucking swords and knives and fucking hammers and stone axes and like tire irons we have fucking smart bombs which we will not be using pointed out the other man i know that you said that already i know that and thats doable but look ever since i did the job on that bitch in la ive been he stopped made a face seemed unwilling to go on youve been troubled yes good word troubled yes like a home for troubled teens funny yes and what exactly is troubling you well we fight we win and that is a source of trouble i find it a matter of triumph and delight myself but theyll die out anyway they are passenger pigeons and thylacines yes who cares this way its going to be a bloodbath ah mr world nodded he was following that was good the fat kid said look im not the only one who feels this way ive checked with the crew at radio modern and theyre all for settling this peacefully and the intangibles are pretty much in favor of letting market forces take care of it im being you know the voice of reason here neil caiman ydu are indeed unfortunately there is information you do not have the smile that followed was twisted and scarred the boy blinked he said mister world what happened to your lips world sighed the truth of the matter he said i that somebody once sewed them together a long time ago whoa said the fat kid serious omertb shit yes you want to know what were waiting for why we didnt strike last night the fat kid nodded he was sweating but it was a cold sweat we didnt strike yet because im waiting for a stick a stick thats right a stick and do you know what im going to do with the stick a head shake okay ill bite what i could tell you said mr world soberly but then id have to kill you he winked and the tension in the room evaporated the fat kid began to giggle a low snuffling laugh in the back of his throat and in his nose okay he said hee hee okay hee got it message received on planet technical loud and clear ixnay on the estionsquay mr world shook his head he rested a hand on the fat kids shoulder hey he said you really want to know sure well said mr world seeing that were friends heres the answer im going to take the stick and im going to throw it over the armies as they come together as i throw it it will become a spear and then as the spear arcs over the battle im going to shout i dedicate this battle to odin huh said the fat kid why power said mr world he scratched his chin and food a combination of the two you see the outcome of the american gods battle is unimportant what matters is the chaos and the slaughter i dont get it let me show you itll be just like this said mr world watch he took the woodenbladed hunters knife from the pocket of his burberry and in one fluid movement he slipped the blade of it into the soft flesh beneath the fat kids chin and pushed hard upward toward the brain i dedicate this death to odin he said as the knife sank in there was a leakage onto his hand of something that was not actually blood and a sputtering sparking noise behind the fat kids eyes the smell on the air was that of burning insulation wire the fat kids hand twitched spastically and then he fell the expression on his face was one of puzzlement and misery look at him said mr world conversationally to the air he looks as if he just saw a sequence of zeroes and ones turn into a flock of brightly colored birds and fly away there was no reply from the empty rock corridor mr world shouldered the body as if it weighed very little and he opened the pixie diorama and dropped the body beside the still covering it with its long black raincoat he would dispose of it that evening he decided and he grinned his scarred grin hiding a body on a battlefielfi would almost be too easy nobody would ever notice nobody would care for a little while there was silence in that place and then a gruff voice which was not mr worlds cleared its throat in the shadows and said good start chapter eighteen they tried to stand off the soldiers but the men fired and killed them both so the songs wrong about the jail iut thats put in far poetry you cant always have things like they are in poetry poetry aint what youd call truth there ain t room enough in the verses a singers commentary on the ballad of sam bass in a treasury of american folklore none of this can actually be happening if it makes you more comfortable you could simply think of it as metaphor religions are by definition metaphors after all god is a dream a hope a woman an ironist a father a city a house of many rooms a watchmaker who left his prize chronometer in the desert someone who loves youeven perhaps against all evidence a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team army business or marriage thrives prospers and triumphs over all opposition religions are places to stand and look and act vantage points from which to view the world so none of this is happening such things could not occur never a word of it is literally true even so the next thing that happened happened like this at the foot of lookout mountain men and women were gathered around a small bonfire in the rain they were standing beneath the trees which provided poor cover and they were arguing american gods the lady kali with her inkblack skin and her white sharp teeth said it is time anansi with lemonyellow gloves and silvering hair shook his head we can wait he said while we can wait we should wait there was a murmur of disagreement from the crowd no listen hes right said an old man with irongray hair czernobog he was holding a small sledgehammer resting the head of it on his shoulder they have the high ground the weather is against us this is madness to begin this now something that looked a little like a wolf and a little more like a man grunted and spat on the forest floor when better to attack them dedushkal shall we wait until the weather clears when they expect it i say we go now i say we move there are clouds between us and them pointed out isten of the hungarians he had a fine black mustache a large dusty black hat and the grin of a man who makes his living selling aluminum siding and new roofs and gutters to senior citizens but who always leaves town the day after the checks clear whether the work is done or not a man in an elegant suit who had until now said nothing put his hands together stepped into the firelight and made his point succinctly and clearly there were nods and mutters of agreement a voice came from one of three warriorwomen who comprised the morrigan standing so close together in the shadows that they had become an arrangement of bluetattooed limbs and dangling crows wings she said it doesnt matter whether this is a good time or a bad time this is the time they have been killing us better to die together on the attack like gods than to die fleeing and singly like rats in a cellar another murmur this time one of deep agreement she had said it for all of them now was the time neil caiman the first head is mine said a very tall chinese man with a rope of tiny skulls around his neck he began to walk slowly and intently up the mountain shouldering a staff with a curved blade at the end of it like a silver moon even nothing cannot last forever he might have been there been nowhere for ten minutes or for ten thousand years it made no difference time was an idea for which he no longer had any need he could no longer remember his real name he felt empty and cleansed in that place that was not a place he was without form and void he was nothing and into that nothing a voice said hohoka cousin we got to talk and something that might once have been shadow said whiskey jack yeah said whiskey jack in the darkness you are a hard man to hunt down when youre dead you didnt go to any of the places i figured i had to look all over before i thought of checking here say you ever find your tribe shadow remembered the man and the girl in the disco beneath the spinning mirrorball i guess i found my family but no i never found my tribe sorry to have to disturb you let me be i got what i wanted im done they are coming for you said whiskey jack they are going to revive you but im done said shadow it was all over and done no such thing said whiskey jack never any such thing well go to my place you want a beer he guessed he would like a beer at that sure get me one too theres a cooler outside the door said whiskey jack and he pointed they were in his shack shadow opened the door to the shack with hands he had not possessed moments before there was a plastic cooler american gods filled with chunks of river ice out there and in the ice a dozen cans of budweiser he pulled out a couple of cans of beer and then sat in the doorway and looked out over the valley they were at the top of a hill near a waterfall swollen with melting snow and runoff it fell in stages maybe seventy feet below them maybe a hundred the sun reflected from the ice that sheathed the trees that overhung the waterfall basin where are we asked shadow where you were last time said whiskey jack my place you planning on holding on to my bud till it warms up shadow stood up and passed him the can of beer you didnt have a waterfall outside your place last time i was here he said whiskey jack said nothing he popped the top of the bud and drank half the can in one long slow swallow then he said you remember my nephew henry bluejay the poet he traded his buick for your winnebago remember sure i didnt know he was a poet whiskey jack raised his chin and looke dproud best damn poet in america he said he drained the rest of his can of beer belched and got another can while shadow popped openliis own can of beer and the two men sat outside on a rock by the pale green ferns in the morning sun and they watched the falling water and they drank their beer there was still snow on the ground in the places where the shadows never lifted the earth was muddy and wet henry was diabetic continued whiskey jack it happens too much you people came to america you take our sugar cane potatoes and corn then you sell us potato chips and caramel popcorn and were the ones who get sick he sipped his beer reflecting hed won a couple of prizes for his poetry there were people in minnesota who wanted to neil caiman put his poems into a book he was driving to minnesota in a sports car to talk to them he had traded your bago for a yellow miata the doctors said they think he went into a coma while he was driving went off the road ran the car into one of your road signs too lazy to look at where you are to read the mountains and the clouds you people need road signs everywhere and so henry bluejay went away forever went to live with brother wolf so i said nothing keeping me there any longer i came north good fishing up here im sorry about your nephew me too so now im living here in the north long way from white mans diseases white mans roads white mans road signs white mans yellow miatas white mans caramel popcorn white mans beer whiskey jack looked at the can when you people finally give up and go home you can leave us the budweiser breweries he said where are we asked shadow am i on the tree am i dead am i here i thought everything was finished whats real yes said whiskey jack yes what kind of an answer is yes its a good answer true answer too shadow said are you a god as well whiskey jack shook his head im a culture hero he said we do the same shit gods do we just screw up more and nobody worships us they tell stories about us but they tell the ones that make us look bad along with the ones where we came out fairly okay i see said shadow and he did see more or less look said whiskey jack this is not a good country for gods my people figured that out early on there are creator spirits who found the earth or made it or shit it out but you think about it whos going to worship coyote he american gods made love to porcupine woman and got his dick shot through with more needles than a pincushion hed argue with rocks and the rocks would win so yeah my people figured that maybe theres something at the back of it all a creator a great spirit and so we say thank you to it because its always good to say thank you but we never built churches we didnt need to the land was the church the land was the religion the land was older and wiserthan the people who walked on it it gave us salmon and corn and buffalo and passenger pigeons it gave us wild rice and walleye it gave us melon and squash and turkey and we were the children of the land just like the porcupine and the skunk and the blue jay he finished his second beer and gestured toward the river at the bottom of the waterfall you follow that river for a way youll get to the lakes where the wild rice grows in wild rice time you go out in your canoe with a friend and you knock the wild rice into your canoe and cook it and store it and it will keep you for a long time different places grow different foods go far enough south there are orange trees lemon trees and those squashy green guys look like pears avocados avocados agreed whiskey jack thats them they dont grow up this way this is wild rice cftuntry moose country what im trying to say is that america is like that its not good growing country for gods they dont grow well here theyre like avocados trying to grow in wild rice country they may not grow well said shadow remembering but theyre going to war that was the only time he ever saw whiskey jack laugh it was almost a bark and it had little humor in it hey shadow said whiskey jack if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you jump off too maybe shadow felt good he didnt think it was just neil caiman the beer he couldnt remember the last time he had felt so alive and so together its not going to be a war then what is it whiskey jack crushed the beer can between his hands pressing it until it was flat look he said and pointed to the waterfall the sun was high enough that it caught the waterfall spray a rainbow nimbus hung in the air shadow thought it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen its going to be a bloodbath said whiskey jack flatly shadow saw it then he saw it all stark in its simplicity he shook his head then he began to chuckle and he shook his head some more and the chuckle became a fullthroated laugh you okay im fine said shadow i just saw the hidden indians not all of them but i saw them anyhow probably ho chunk then those guys never could hide worth a damn he looked up at the sun time to go back he said he stood up its a twoman con said shadow its not a war at all is it whiskey jack patted shadows arm youre not so dumb he said they walked back to whiskey jacks shack he opened the door shadow hesitated i wish i could stay here with you he said this seems like a good place there are a lot of good places said whiskey jack thats kind of the point listen gods die when they are forgotten people too but the lands still here the good places and the bad the land isnt going anywhere and neither am i shadow closed the door something was pulling at him he was alone in the darkness once more but the darkness became brighter and brighter until it was burning like the sun and then the pain began american gods easter walked through the meadow and spring flowers blossomed where she had passed she walked by a place where long ago a farmhouse had stood even today several walls were still standing jutting out of the weeds and the meadow grass like rotten teeth a thin rain was falling the clouds were dark and low and it was cold a little way beyond the place where the farmhouse had been there was a tree a huge silvergray tree winterdead to all appearances and leafless and in front of the tree on the grass were frayed clumps of colorless fabric the woman stopped at the fabric and bent down and picked up something brownishwhite it was a muchgnawed fragment of bone which might once have been a part of a human skull she tossed it back down onto the grass then she looked at the man on the tree and she smiled wryly they just arent as interesting naked she said its the unwrapping thats half the fun like with gifts and eggs the hawkheaded man who walked beside her looked down at his penis and seemed for the first time to become aware of his own nakedness he said i can look at the sun without even blinking thats very clever of you easter told him reassuringly now lets get him down from there the wet ropes that held shadow to the tree had long ago weathered and rotted and they parted easily asthe two people pulled on them the body on the tree slipped and slid down toward the roots they caught him as he fell and they took him up carrying him easily although he was a very big man and they put him down in the gray meadow the body on the grass was cold and it did not breathe there was a patch of dried black blood on its side as if it had been stabbed with a spear what now neil caiman now she said we warm him you know what you have to do i know i cannot if you are not willing to help then you should not have called me here she reached out a white hand to horus and she touched his black hair he blinked at her intently then he shimmered as if in a heat haze the hawk eye that faced her glinted orange as if a flame had just been kindled inside it a flame that had been long extinguished the hawk took to the air and it swung upward circling and ascending in a rising gyre circling the place in the gray clouds where the sun might conceivably be and as the hawk rose it became first a dot and then a speck and then to the naked eye nothing at all something that could only be imagined the clouds began to thin and to evaporate creating a patch of blue sky through which the sun glared the single bright sunbeam penetrating the clouds and bathing the meadow was beautiful but the image faded as more clouds vanished soon the morning sun was blazing down on that meadow like a summer sun at noon burning the water vapor from the mornings rain into mists and burning the mist off into nothing at all the golden sun bathed the body on the floor of the meadow with its radiance and its heat shades of pink and of warm brown touched the dead thing the woman dragged the fingers of her right hand lightly across the bodys chest she imagined she could feel a shiver in his breastsomething that was not a heartbeat but still she let her hand remain there on his chest just above his heart she lowered her lips to shadows lips and she breathed into his lungs a gentle in and out and then the breath became a kiss her kiss was gentle and it tasted of spring rains and meadow flowers american gods the wound in his side began to flow with liquid blood once morea scarlet blood which oozed like liquid rubies in the sunlight and then the bleeding stopped she kissed his cheek and his forehead come on she said time to get up its all happening you dont want to miss it his eyes fluttered and then they opened two eyes the gray of evening and he looked at her she smiled and then she removed her hand from his chest he said you called me back he said it slowly as if he had forgotten how to speak english there was hurt in his voice and puzzlement yes i was done i was judged it was over you called me back you dared im sorry yes he sat up slowly he winced and touched his side then he looked puzzled there was a beading of wet blood there but there was no wound beneath it he reached out a hand and she put her ajnj around him and helped him to his feet he looked across the meadow as if he was trying to remember the names of the things he was looking at the flowers in the long grass the ruins of the farmhouse the haze of green buds that fogged the branches of the huge silver tree do you remember she asked do you remember what you learned i lost my name and i lost my heart and you brought me back im sorry she said they are going to fight soon the old gods and the new ones you want me to fight for you you wasted your time i brought you back because that was what i had to do she said what you do now is whatever you have to do your call i did my part neil caiman suddenly she became aware of his nakedness and she blushed a burning scarlet flush and she looked down and away in the rain and the cloud shadows moved up the side of the mountain up to the rock pathways white foxes padded up the hill in company with redhaired men in green jackets there was a bullheaded minotaur walking beside an ironfingered dactyl a pig a monkey and a sharptoothed ghoul clambered up the hillside in company with a blueskinned man holding a flaming bow a bear with flowers twined into its fur and a man in golden chain mail holding his sword of eyes beautiful antinous who was the lover of hadrian walked up the hillside at the head of a company of leather queens their arms and chests steroidsculpted into perfect shapes a grayskinned man his one cyclopean eye a huge cabochon emerald walked stiffly up the hill ahead of several squat and swarthy men their impassive faces as regular as aztec carvings they knew the secrets that the jungles had swallowed a sniper at the top of the hill took careful aim at a white fox and fired there was an explosion and a puff of cordite gunpowder scent on the wet air the corpse was a young japanese woman with her stomach blown away and her face all bloody slowly the corpse began to fade the people continued up the hill on two legs on four legs on no legs at all the drive through the tennessee mountain country had been startlingly beautiful whenever the storm had eased and nervewracking whenever the rain had pelted down town and laura had talked and talked and talked the whole way he was so glad he had met her it was like meeting an old friend a really good old friend youd simply never met american gods before they talked history and movies and music and she turned out to be the only person the only other person he had ever met who had seen a foreign film from the sixties called the manuscript found in saragassa a film he had been starting to believe he had hallucinated when laura pointed out the first see rock city barn to him he chuckled and admitted that that was where he was headed she said that was so cool she always wanted to visit those kinds of places but she never made the time and always regretted it later that was why she was on the road right now she was having an adventure she was a travel agent she told him separated from her husband she admitted that she didnt think they could ever get back together and said it was her fault i cant believe that she sighed its true mack im just not the woman he married anymore well he told her people change and before he could think he was telling her everything he could tell her about his life he was even telling her about woody nd stoner how the three of them were the three musketeers and the two of them were killed you think youd get hardened to that kind of thing in government work but ydy never did and she reached out one handit was cold enough that he turned up the cars heatingand squeezed his hand tightly in hers lunchtime they ate bad japanese food while a thunderstorm lowered on knoxville and town didnt care that the food was late that the miso soup was cold or that the sushi was warm he loved the fact that she was out with him having an adventure well confided laura i hated the idea of getting stale i was just rotting away where i was so i set off without my neil caiman car and without my credit cards im just relying on the kindness of strangers arent you scared he asked i mean you could be stranded you could be mugged you could starve she shook her head then she said with a hesitant smile i met you didnt i and he couldnt find anything to say when the meal was over they ran through the storm to his car holding japaneselanguage newspapers to cover their heads and they laughed as they ran like schoolchildren in the rain how far can i take you he asked when they made it back into the car ill go as far as youre going mack she told him shyly he was glad he hadnt used the big mack line this woman wasnt a barroom onenighter mr town knew that in his soul it might have taken him fifty years to find her but this was finally it this was the one this wild magical woman with the long dark hair this was love look he said as they approached chattanooga the wipers slooshed the rain across the windshield blurring the gray of the city how about i find a motel for you tonight ill pay for it and once i make my delivery we can well we can take a hot bath together for a start warm you up that sounds wonderful said laura what are you delivering that stick he told her and chuckled the one on the backseat okay she said humoring him then dont tell me mister mysterious he told her it would be best if she waited in the car in the rock city parking lot while he made his delivery he drove up the side of lookout mountain in the driving rain never breaking thirty miles per hour with his headlights burning american gods they parked at the back of the parking lot he turned off the engine hey mack before you get out of the car dont i get a hug asked laura with a smile you surely do said mr town and he put his arms around her and she snuggled close to him while the rain pattered a tattoo on the roof of the ford explorer he could smell her hair there was a faintly unpleasant scent beneath the smell of the perfume travel would do it every time that bath he decided was a real must for both of them he wondered if there was anyplace in chattanooga where he could get those lavender bathbombs his first wife had loved so much laura raised her head against his and her hand stroked the line of his neck absently mack i keep thinking you must really want to know what happened to those friends of yours she asked woody and stone do you yeah he said moving his lips down to hers for their first kiss sure i do so she showed him shadow walked the meadow making his own slew circles around the trunk of the tree gradually widening his circle sometimes he would stop and pick something up a flower or a leaf or a pebble or a twig or a blade ef grass he would examine it minutely as if concentrating entirely on the twigness of the twig the leajhess of the leaf easter found herself reminded of the gaze of a baby at the point where it learns to focus she did not dare to talk to him at that moment it would have been sacrilegious she watched him exhausted as she was and she wondered about twenty feet out from the base of the tree halfovergrown with long meadow grass and dead creepers he found a canvas bag shadow picked it up untied the knots at the top of the bag loosened the drawstring neil caiman the clothes he pulled out were his own they were old but still serviceable he turned the shoes over in his hands he stroked the fabric of the shirt the wool of the sweater stared at them as if he were looking at them across a million years one by one he put them on he put his hands into his pockets and looked puzzled as he pulled one hand out holding what looked to easter like a whiteandgray marble he said no coins it was the first thing he had said in several hours no coins echoed easter he shook his head they gave me something to do with my hands he bent down to pull on his shoes once he was dressed he looked more normal grave though she wondered how far he had traveled and what it had cost him to return he was not the first whose return she had initiated and she knew that soon enough the millionyear stare would fade and the memories and the dreams that he had brought back from the tree would be elided by the world of things you could touch that was the way it always went she led their way to the rear of the meadow her mount waited in the trees it cant carry both of us she told him ill make my own way home shadow nodded he seemed to be trying to remember something then he opened his mouth and he screeched a cry of welcome and of joy the thunderbird opened its cruel beak and it screeched a welcome back at him superficially at least it resembled a condor its feathers were black with a purplish sheen and its neck was banded with white its beak was black and cruel a raptors beak made for tearing at rest on the ground with its wings folded away it was the size of a black bear and its head was on a level with shadows own american gods horus said proudly i brought him they live in the mountains shadow nodded i had a dream of thunderbirds once he said damndest dream i ever had the thunderbird opened its beak and made a surprisingly gentle noise crawroo you heard my dream too asked shadow he reached out a hand and rubbed it gently against the birds head the thunderbird pushed up against him like an affectionate pony he scratched it from the nape of its neck up to the crown shadow turned to easter you rode him here yes she said you can ride him back if he lets you how do you ride him its easy she said if you dont fall like riding the lightning will i see you back there she shook her head im done honey she told him you go do what you need to do im tired good luck shadow nodded whiskey jack i saw hhm after i passed on he came and found me we drank eer together yes she said im sure you did will i ever see you again asked shadow she looked at him with eyes the green jf ripening corn she said nothing then abruptly she shook her head i doubt it she said shadow clambered awkwardly onto the thunderbirds back he felt like a mouse on the back of a hawk there was an ozone taste in his mouth metallic and blue something crackled the thunderbird extended its wings and began to flap them hard as the ground fell away beneath them shadow clung on his heart pounding in his chest like a wild thing it was exactly like riding the lightning neil caiman laura took the stick from the backseat of the car she left mr town in the front seat of the ford explorer climbed out of the car and walked through the rain to rockcity the ticket office was closed the door to the gift shop was not locked and she walked through it past the rock candy and the display of see rock city birdhouses into the eighth wonder of the world nobody challenged her although she passed several men and women on the path in the rain many of them looked faintly artificial several of them were translucent she walked across a swinging rope bridge she passed the white deer gardens and pushed herself through the fat mans squeeze where the path ran between two rock walls and in the end she stepped over a chain with a sign on it telling her that this part of the attraction was closed she went into a cavern and she saw a man sitting on a plastic chair in front of a diorama of drunken gnomes he was reading the washington post by the light of a small electric lantern when he saw her he folded the paper and placed it beneath his chair he stood up a tall man with closecropped orange hair in an expensive raincoat and he gave her a small bow i shall assume that mister town is dead he said welcome spearcarrier thank you im sorry about mack she said were you friends not at all he should have kept himself alive if he wanted to keep his job but you brought his stick he looked her up and down with eyes that glimmered like the orange embers of a dying fire i am afraid you have the advantage of me they call me mister world here at the top of the hill im shadows wife of course the lovely laura he said i should have recognized you he had several photographs of you up above his bed in the cell that once we shared and if you american gods dont mind my saying so you are looking lovelier than you have any right to look shouldnt you be further along on the whole roadtorotandruin business by now i was she said simply but those women in the farm they gave me water from their well an eyebrow raised urds well surely not she pointed to herself her skin was pale and her eye sockets were dark but she was manifestly whole if she was indeed a walking corpse she was freshly dead it wont last said mr world the norns gave you a little taste of the past it will dissolve into the present soon enough and then those pretty blue eyes will roll out of their sockets and ooze down those pretty cheeks which will by then of course no longer be so pretty by the way you have my stick can i have it please he pulled out a pack of lucky strikes took a cigarette lit it with a disposable black bic she said can i have one of those sure ill give you a cigarette if you give me my stick if you want it its worth more than just a cigarette he said nothing she said i want answers i want to know iings he lit a cigarette and passed it to her she took it and inhaled then she blinked i can almost taste this one she said i think maybe i can she smiled mm nicotine yes he said why did you go to the women in the farmhouse shadow told me to go to them she said he said to ask them for water i wonder if he knew what it would do probably not still thats the good thing about having him dead on his tree i know where he is at all times now hes off the board you set up my husband she said you set him up all the way you people he has a good heart you know that yes said mr world i know when this is all done with i guess ill sharpen a stick of mistletoe and go down neil caiman to the ash tree and ram it through his eye now my stick please why do you want it its a souvenir of this whole sorry mess said mr world dont worry its not mistletoe he flashed a grin it symbolizes a spear and in this sorry world the symbol is the thing the noises from outside grew louder which side are you on she asked its not about sides he told her but since you asked im on the winning side always she nodded and she did not let go of the stick she turned away from him and looked out of the cavern door far below her in the rocks she could see something that glowed and pulsed it wrapped itself around a thin mauvefaced bearded man who was beating at it with a squeegee stick the kind of squeegee that people like him use to smear across car windshields at traffic lights there was a scream and they both disappeared from view okay ill give you the stick she said mr worlds voice came from behind her good girl he said reassuringly in a way that struck her as being both patronizing and indefinably male it made her skin crawl she waited in the rock doorway until she could hear his breath in her ear she had to wait until he got close enough she had that much figured out the ride was more than exhilarating it was electric they swept through the storm like jagged bolts of lightning flashing from cloud to cloud they moved like the thunders roar like the swell and rip of the hurricane it was a crackling impossible journey there was no fear only the power of the storm unstoppable and allconsuming and the joy of the flight shadow dug his fingers into the thunderbirds feathers american gods feeling the static prickle on his skin blue sparks writhed across his hands like tiny snakes rain washed his face this is the best he shouted over the roar of the storm as if it understood him the bird began to rise higher every wingbeat a clap of thunder and it swooped and dove and tumbled through the dark clouds in my dream i was hunting you said shadow his words ripped away by the wind in my dream i had to bring back a feather yes the word was a static crackle in the radio of his mind they came to us for feathers to prove that they were men and they came to us to cut the stones from our heads to gift their dead with our lives an image filled his mind then of a thunderbirda female he assumed for her plumage was brown not black lying freshly dead on the side of a mountain beside it was a woman she was breaking open its skull with a knob of flint she picked through the wet shards of bone and the brains until she found a smooth clear stone the tawny color of garnet opalescent fires flickering in its depths eagle stones thought shadow she was going to take iyp her infant son dead these last three nights and she would lay it on his cold breast by the next sunrise the boy would be alive and laughing and the jewel would be gray and clouded and as dead as the bird it had been stolen from i understand he said to the bird the bird threw back its head and crowed and its cry was the thunder the world beneath them flashed past in one strange dream laura adjusted her grip on the stick and she waited for the man she knew as mr world to come to her she was facing away from him looking out at the storm and the dark green hills below neil caiman in this sorry world she thought the symbol is the thing yes she felt his hand close softly onto her right shoulder good she thought he does not want to alarm me he is scared that i will throw his stick out into the storm that it will tumble down the mountainside and he will lose it she leaned back just a little until she was touching his chest with her back his left arm curved around her it was an intimate gesture his left hand was open in front of her she closed both of her hands around the top of the stick exhaled concentrated please my stick he said in her ears yes she said its yours and then not knowing if it would mean anything she said i dedicate this death to shadow and she stabbed the stick into her chest just below the breastbone felt it writhe and change in her hands as the stick became a spear the boundary between sensation and pain had diffused since she had died she felt the spearhead penetrate her chest felt it push out through her back a moments resistance she pushed harderand the spear pushed into mr world she could feel the warm breath of him on the cool skin of her neck as he wailed in hurt and surprise impaled on the spear she did not recognize the words he spoke nor the language he said them in she pushed the shaft of the spear farther in forcing it through her body into and through his she could feel his hot blood spurting onto her back bitch he said in english you fucking bitch there was a wet gurgling quality to his voice she guessed that the blade of the spear must have sliced a lung mrworld was moving now or trying to move and every move he made rocked her too they were joined by the pole impaled together like two fish on a single spear he now had a knife in one hand she saw and he stabbed her chest and breasts randomly and wildly with the knife unable to see what he was doing american gods she did not care what are knife cuts to a corpse she brought her fist down hard on his waving wrist and the knife went flying to the floor of the cavern she kicked it away and now he was crying and wailing she could feel him pushing against her his hands fumbling at her back his hot tears on her neck his blood was soaking her back spurting down the back of her legs this must look so undignified she said in a dead whisper not without a certain dark amusement she felt mr world stumble behind her and she stumbled too and then she slipped in the bloodall of it histhat was puddling on the floor of the cave and they both went down the thunderbird landed in the rock city parking lot rain was falling in sheets shadow could barely see a dozen feet in front of his face he let go of the thunderbirds feathers and half slipped half tumbled to the wet asphalt lightning flashed and the bird was gone shadow climbed to his feet the parking lot was threequarters empty shadow started toward the entrance he passed brown ford explorer parked against a rock wall there was something deeply familiar about the car and he glanced up at it curiously noticing the man inside the car slumped over the steering wheel as if asleep shadow pulled open the driversside door he had last seen mr town standing outside the motel in the center of america the expression on his face was one of surprise his neck had been expertly broken shadow touched the mans face still warm shadow could smell a scent on the air in the car it was faint like the perfume of someone who left a room years before but shadow would have known it anywhere he slammed the door of the explorer and made his way across the parking lot neil caiman as he walked he felt a twinge in his side a sharp jabbing pain that lasted for only a second or less and then it was gone there was nobody selling tickets he walked through the building and out into the gardens of rock city thunder rumbled and it rattled the branches of die trees and shook deep inside the huge rocks and the rain fell with cold violence it was late afternoon but it was dark as night a trail of lightning speared across the clouds and shadow wondered if that was the thunderbird returning to its high crags or just an atmospheric discharge or whether the two ideas were on some level the same thing and of course they were that was the point after all somewhere a mans voice called out shadow heard it the only words he recognized or thought he recognized were to odin shadow hurried across seven states flag court the flagstones now running fast with rainwater once he slipped on the slick stone there was a thick layer of cloud surrounding the mountain and in the gloom and the storm beyond the courtyard he could see no states at all there was no sound the place seemed utterly abandoned he called out and imagined he heard something answering he walked toward the place from which he thought the sound had come nobody nothing just a chain marking the entrance to a cave as offlimits to guests shadow stepped over the chain he looked around peering into the darkness his skin prickled a voice from behind him in the shadows said very quietly you have never disappointed me shadow did not turn thats weird he said i disappointed myself all the way every time not at all said the voice you did everything you were intended to do and more you took everybodys attention american gods so they never looked at the hand with the coin in it its called misdirection and theres power in the sacrifice of a sonpower enough and more than enough to get the whole ball rolling to tell the truth im proud of you it was crooked said shadow all of it none of it was for real it was just a setup for a massacre exactly said wednesdays voice from the shadows it was crooked but it was the only game in town i want laura said shadow i want loki where are they there was only silence a spray of rain gusted at him thunder rumbled somewhere close at hand he walked farther in loki liesmith sat on the ground with his back to ametal cage inside the cage drunken pixies tended their still he was covered with a blanket only his face showed and his hands white and long came around the blanket an electric lantern sat on a chair beside him the lanterns batteries were close to failing and the light it cast was faint and yellow he looked pale and he looked rough his eyes though his eyes were stillaery and they glared at shadow as he walked through the cavern when shadow was several paces fromloki he stopped you are too late said loki his voice was raspy and wet i have thrown the spear i have dedicated the battle it has begun no shit said shadow no shit said loki so it does not matter what you do anymore shadow stopped and thought then he said the spear you had to throw to kick off the battle like the whole uppsala thing this is the battle youll be feeding on am i right silence he could hear loki breathing a ghastly rattling inhalation neil caiman i figured it out said shadow kind of im not sure when i figured it out maybe when i was hanging on the tree maybe before it was from something wednesday said to me at christmas loki just stared at him from the floor saying nothing its just a twoman con said shadow like the bishop with the diamond necklace and the cop who arrests him like the guy with the fiddle and the guy who wants to buy the fiddle two men who appear to be on opposite sides playing the same game loki whispered you are ridiculous why i liked what you did at the motel that was smart you needed to be there to make sure that everything went according to plan i saw you i even realized who you were and i still never twigged that you were their mister world shadow raised his voice you can come out he said to the cavern wherever you are show yourself the wind howled in the opening of the cavern and it drove a spray of rainwater in toward them shadow shivered im tired of being played for a sucker said shadow just show yourself let me see you there was a change in the shadows at the back of the cave something became more solid something shifted you know too damned much mboy said wednesdays familiar rumble so they didnt kill you they killed me said wednesday from the shadows none of this would have worked if they hadnt his voice was faintnot actually quiet but there was a quality to it that made shadow think of an old radio not quite tuned in to a distant station if i hadnt died for real we could never have got them here said wednesday kali and the morrigan and the fucking albanians andwell youve seen them all it was my death that drew them all together i was the sacrificial lamb no said shadow you were the judas goat americangods the wraithshape in the shadows swirled and shifted not at all that implies that i was betraying the old gods for the new which was not what we were doing not at all whispered loki i can see that said shadow you two werent betraying either side you were betraying both sides i guess we were at that said wednesday he sounded pleased with himself you wanted a massacre you needed a blood sacrifice a sacrifice of gods the wind grew stronger the howl across the cave door became a screech as if of something immeasurably huge in pain and why the hell not ive been trapped in this damned land for almost twelve hundred years my blood is thin im hungry and you two feed on death said shadow he thought he could see wednesday now he was a shape made of darkness who became more real only when shadow looked away from him taking shape in his peripheral vision i feed on death that is dedicatedto me said wednesday like my death on the tree said shadow that said wednesday was special and do you also feed on death asked shadow looking at loki loki shook his head wearily no of course not said shadow you feed on chaos loki smiled at that a brief pained smile and orange flames danced in his eyes and flickered like burning lace beneath his pale skin we couldnt have done it without you said wednesday from the corner of shadows eye id been with so many women you needed a son said shadow wednesdays ghostvoice echoed i needed you my boy neil caiman yes my own boy i knew that you had been conceived but your mother left the country it took us so long to find you and when we did find you you were in prison we needed to find out what made you tick what buttons we could press to make you move who you were loki looked momentarily pleased with himself and you had a wife to go back home to it was unfortunate but not insurmountable she was no good for you whispered loki you were better off without her if it could have been any other way said wednesday and this time shadow knew what he meant and if shed hadthe graceto stay dead panted loki wood and stonewere good men you were going to be allowed to escapewhen the train crossed the dakotas where is she asked shadow loki reached a pale arm and pointed to the back of the cavern she went thataway he said then without warning he tipped forward his body collapsing onto the rock floor shadow saw what the blanket had hidden from him the pool of blood the hole through lokis back the fawn raincoat soaked black with blood what happened he said loki said nothing shadow did not think he would be saying anything anymore your wife happened to him mboy said wednesdays distant voice he had become harder to see as if he was fading back into the ether but the battle will bring him back as the battle will bring me back for good im a ghost and hes a corpse but weve still won th game was rigged rigged games said shadow remembering are the easiest to beat there was no answer nothing moved in the shadows shadow said goodbye and then he said father but american gods by then there was no trace of anybody else in the cavern nobody at all shadow walked back up to the seven states flag court but saw nobody and heard nothing but the crack and whip of the flags in the stormwind there were no people with swords at the thousandton balanced rock no defenders of the swingalong bridge he was alone there was nothing to see the place was deserted it was an empty battlefield no not deserted not exactly this was rock city it had been a place of awe and worship for thousands of years today the millions of tourists who walked through the gardens and swung their way across the swingalong bridge had the same effect as water turning a million prayer wheels reality was thin here and shadow knew where the battle must be taking place with that he began to walk he remembered how he had felt on the carousel tried to feel like that he remembered turning the winnebago shifting it at right angles to everything he tried to capture that seiisation and then easily and perfectly it happened it was like pushing through a membrane like plunging up from deep water into air with one step he had moved from the tourist path on the mountain to ј to somewhere real he was backstage he was still on the top of a mountain that much remained the same but it was so much more than that this mountaintop was the quintessence of place the heart of things as they were compared to it the lookout mountain he had left was a painting on a backdrop or a papiermschs model seen on a tv screenmerely a representation of the thing not the thing itself this was the true place the rock walls formed a natural amphitheater paths of stone that wound around and across it forming twisty nat neil caiman ural bridges that eschered through and across the rock walls and the sky the sky was dark it was lit and the world beneath it was illuminated by a burning greenishwhite streak brighter than the sun which forked crazily across the sky from end to end like a white rip in the darkened sky it was lightning shadow realized lightning held in one frozen moment that stretched into forever the light it cast was harsh and unforgiving it washed out faces hollowed eyes into dark pits this was the moment of the storm the paradigms were shifting he could feel it the old world a world of infinite vastness and illimitable resources and future was being confronted by something elsea web of energy of opinions of gulfs people believe thought shadow its what people do they believe and then they will not take responsibility for their beliefs they conjure things and do not trust the conjurations people populate the darkness with ghosts with gods with electrons with tales people imagine and people believe and it is that belief that rocksolid belief that makes things happen the mountaintop was an arena he saw that immediately and on each side of the arena he could see them arrayed they were too big everything was too big in that place there were old gods in that place gods with skins the brown of old mushrooms the pink of chicken flesh the yellow of autumn leaves some were crazy and some were sane shadow recognized the old gods hed met them already or hed met others like them there were ifrits and piskies giants and dwarfs he saw the woman he had met in the darkened bedroom in rhode island saw the writhing green snakecoils of her hair he saw mamaji from the carousel and there was blood on her hands and a smile on her face he knew them all american gods he recognized the new ones too there was somebody who had to be a railroad baron in an antique suit his watch chain stretched across his vest he had the air of one who had seen better days his forehead twitched there were the great gray gods of the airplanes heirs to all the dreams of heavierthanair travel there were car gods there a powerful seriousfaced contingent with blood on their black gloves and on their chrome teeth recipients of human sacrifice on a scale undreamedof since the aztecs even they looked uncomfortable worlds change others had faces of smudged phosphors they glowed gently as if they existed in their own light shadow felt sorry for them all there was an arrogance to the new ones shadow could see that but there was also a fear they were afraid that unless they kept pace with a changing world unless they remade and redrew and rebuilt the world in their image their time would already be over each side faced the other with bravery to eadh side the opposition were the demons the monsters thedamned shadow could see an initial skirmish had taken place there was already blood on the rocks they were readying themselves for the real battle for the real war it was now or never he thought if lie did not move now it would be too late in america everything goes on forever said a voice in the back of his head the s lasted for a thousand years you have all the time in the world shadow walked in something that was half stroll half controlled stumble into the center of the arena he could feel eyes on him eyes and things that were not eyes he shivered the buffalo voice said you are doing just fine shadow thought damn right i came back from the dead neil caiman this morning after that everything else should be a piece of cake you know said shadow to the air in a conversational voice this is not a war this was never intended to be a war and if any of you think this is a war you are deluding yourselves he heard grumbling noises from both sjdes he had impressed nobody we are fighting for our survival lowed a minotaur from one side of the arena we are fighting for our existence shouted a mouth in a pillar of glittering smoke from the other this is a bad land for gods said shadow as an opening statement it wasnt friends romans countrymen but it would do youve probably all learned that in your own way the old gods are ignored the new gods are as quickly taken up as they are abandoned cast aside for the next big thing either youve been forgotten or youre scared youre going to be rendered obsolete or maybe youre just getting tired of existing on the whim of people the grumbles were fewer now he had said something they agreed with now while they were listening he had to tell them the story there was a god who came here from a far land and whose power and influence waned as belief in him faded he was a god who took his power from sacrifice and from death and especially from war the deaths of those who fell in war were dedicated to himwhole battlefields that had given him in the old country power and sustenance now he was old he made his living as a grifter working with another god from his pantheon a god of chaos and deceit together they rooked the gullible together they took people for all theyd got somewhere in theremaybe fifty years ago maybe a hundred they put a plan into motion a plan to create a reserve of power they could both tap into something that would make them stronger than they had ever been after american gods all what could be more powerful than a battlefield covered with dead gods the game they played was called lets you and him fight do you see the battle you came here for isnt something that any of you can win or lose the winning and the losing are unimportant to him to them what matters is that enough of you die each of you that falls in battle gives him power every one of you that dies feeds him do you understand the roaring whoompfing sound of something catching fire echoed across the arena shadow looked to the place the noise came from an enormous man his skin the deep brown of mahogany his chest naked wearing a top hat cigar sticking rakishly from his mouth spoke in a voice as deep as the grave baron samedi said okay but odin he died at the peace talks motherfuckers killed him he died i know death nobody going to fool me about death shadow said obviously he had to die for real he sacrificed his physical body to make this war happen after the battle he would have been more powerful than he had ever been somebody called who are you i ami wasi am his son one of the new godsshadow suspected it was a drug from the way it smiled and spangled said but mister world said there was no mister world there never was any such person he was just another one of you bastards trying to feed on the chaos he created they believed him and he could see the hurt in their eyes shadow shook his head you know he said i think i would rather be a man than a god we dont need anyone to believe in us we just keep going anyhow its what we do there was silence in the high place and then with a shocking crack the lightning bolt neil caiman frozen in the sky crashed to the mountaintop and the arena went entirely dark they glowed many of those presences in the darkness shadow wondered if they were going to argue with him to attack him to try to kill him he waited for some kind of response and then shadow realized that the lights were going out the gods were leaving that place first in handfuls and then by scores and finally in the hundreds a spider the size of a rottweiler scuttled heavily toward him on seven legs its cluster of eyes glowed faintly shadow held his ground although he felt slightly sick when the spider got close enough it said in mr nancys voice that was a good job proud of you you done good kid thank you said shadow we should get you back too long in this place is goin to mess you up it rested one brownhaired spider leg on shadows shoulder and back on seven states flag court mr nancy coughed his right hand rested on shadows shoulder the rain had stopped mr nancy held his left hand across his side as if it hurt shadow asked if he was okay im tough as old nails said mr nancy tougher he did not sound happy he sounded like an old man in pain there were dozens of them standing or sitting on the ground or on the benches some of them looked badly injured shadow could hear a rattling noise in the sky approaching from the south he looked at mr nancy helicopters mr nancy nodded dont you worry about them not anymore theyll just clean up the mess and leave got it shadow knew that there was one part of the mess he wanted to see for himself before it was cleaned up he bor americangods rowed a flashlight from a grayhaired man who looked like a retired news anchor and began to hunt he found laura stretched out on the ground in a side cavern beside a diorama of mining gnomes straight out of snow white the floor beneath her was sticky with blood she was on her side where loki must have dropped her after he had pulled the spear out of them both one of lauras hands clutched her chest she looked dreadfully vulnerable she looked dead but then shadow was almost used to that by now shadow squatted beside her and he touched her cheek with his hand and he said her name her eyes opened and she lifted her head and turned it until she was looking at him hello puppy she said her voice was thin hi laura what happened here nothing she said just stuff did they win i stopped the battle they were trying to start my clever puppy she said that man mister world he said he was going to put a stick through your eye i didnt like him at all hes dead you killed him hon she nodded she said thats good her eyes closed shadows hand found her cold hand and he held it in his in time she opened her eyes again did you ever figure out how to bring me back from the dead she asked i guess he said i know one way anyway thats good she said she squeezed his hand with her cold hand and then she said and the opposite what about that the opposite yes she whispered i think i must have earned it i dont want to do that she said nothing she simply waited neil caiman shadow said okay then he took his hand from hers and put it to her neck she said thats my husband she said it proudly i love you babes said shadow love you puppy she whispered he closed his hand around the golden coin that hung around her neck he tugged hard at the chain which snapped easily then he took the gold coin between his finger and thumb and blew on it and opened his hand wide the coin was gone her eyes were still open but they did not move he bent down then and kissed her gently on her cold cheek but she did not respond he did not expect her to then he got up and walked out of the cavern to stare into the night the storms had cleared the air felt fresh and clean and new once more tomorrow he had no doubt would be one hell of a beautiful day part four epilogue something that the dead are keeping back chapter nineteen one describes a tale best by telling the tale you see the way one describes a story to oneself or to the world is by telling the story it is a balancing act and it is a dream the more accurate the map the more it resembles the territory the most accurate map possible would be the territory and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless the tale is the map that is the territory you must remember this from the notebooks of mr ibis the two of them were in the vw bus heading down to florida on theyd been driving since dawn or rather shadow had driven and mr nancy had sat up front in the passenger seat and from time to time andwith a pained expression on his face offered to drive shadow always said no are you happy asked mr nancy suddenly he had been staring at shadow for several hours whenever shadow glanced over to his right mr nancy was looking at him with his earthbrown eyes not really said shadow but im not dead yet huh call no man happy until he is dead herodotus mr nancy raised a white eyebrow and he said im not neil caiman dead yet and mostly because im not dead yet im happy as a clamboy the herodotus thing it doesnt mean that the dead are happy said shadow it means that you cant judge the shape of someones life until its over and done i dont even judge then said mr nancy and as for happiness theres a lot of different kinds of happiness just as theres a hell of a lot of different kinds of dead me ill just take what i can get when i can get it shadow changed the subject those helicopters he said the ones that took away the bodies and the injured what about them who sent them where did they come from you shouldnt worry yourself about that theyre like valkyries or buzzards they come because they have to come if you say so the dead and the wounded will be taken care of you ask me old jacquels going to be very busy for the next month or so tell me somethin shadowboy okay you learn anythin from all this shadow shrugged i dont know most of what i learned on the tree ive already forgotten he said i think i met some people but im not certain of anything anymore its like one of those dreams that changes you you keep some of the dream forever and you know things down deep inside yourself because it happened to you but when you go looking for details they kind of just slip out of your head yeah said mr nancy and then he said grudgingly youre not so dumb maybe not said shadow but i wish i could have kept more of what passed through my hands since i got out of prison i was given so many things and i lost them again maybe said mr nancy you kept more than you think american gods no said shadow they crossed the border into florida and shadow saw his first palm tree he wondered if theyd planted it there on purpose at the border just so that you knew you were in florida now mr nancy began to snore and shadow glanced over at him the old man still looked very gray and his breath was rasping shadow wondered not for the first time if he had sustained some kind of chest or lung injury in the fight nancy had refused any medical attention florida went on for longer than shadow had imagined and it was late by the time he pulled up outside a small onestory wooden house its windows tightly shuttered on the outskirts of fort pierce nancy who had directed him through the last five miles invited him to stay the night i can get a room in a motel said shadow its not a problem you could do that and id be hurtobviously i wouldnt say anythin but id be real hurt real bad said mr nancy so you better stay here and ill make youabed up on the couch mr nancy unlocked the hurricane shutters and pulled open the windows the house smelted musty and damp and a little sweet as if it were haunted by the ghosts of longdead cookies shadow agreed reluctantly to stay the night there just as he agreed even more reluctantly to walk with mr nancy to the bar at the end of the road for just one latenight drink while the house aired out did you see czernobog asked nancy as they strolled through the muggy floridian night the air was alive with whirring palmetto bugs and the ground crawled with creatures that scuttled and clicked mr nancy lit a cigarillo and coughed and choked on it still he kept right on smoking he was gone when i came out of the cave neil caiman he will have headed home hell be waitin for you there you know yes they walked in silence to the end of the road it wasnt much of a bar but it was open ill buy the first beers said mr nancy were only having one beer remember said shadow what are you asked mr nancy some kind of cheapskate mr nancy bought them their first beers and shadow bought the second round he stared in horror as mr nancy talked the barman into turning on the karaoke machine and then watched in fascinated embarrassment as the old man belted his way through whats new pussycat before crooning out a moving tuneful version of the way you look tonight he had a fine voice and by the end the handful of people still in the bar were cheering and applauding him when he came back to shadow at the bar he was looking brighter the whites of his eyes were clear and the gray pallor that had touched his skin was gone your turn he said absolutely not said shadow but mr nancy had ordered more beers and was handing shadow a stained printout of songs from which to choose just pick a song you know the words to this is not funny said shadow the world was beginning to swim a little but he couldnt muster the energy to argue and then mr nancy was putting on the backing tapes to dont let me be misunderstood and pushing literally pushingshadow up onto the tiny makeshift stage at the end of the bar shadow held the mike as if it was probably live and then the backing music started and he croaked out the initial baby nobody in the bar threw anything in his direction and it felt good can you understand me now his voice was rough but melodic and rough suited the song american gods just fine sometimes i feel a little mad dont you know that no one alive can always be an angel and he was still singing it as they walked home through the busy florida night the old man and the young stumbling and happy im just a soul whose intentions are good he sang to the crabs and the spiders and the palmetto beetles and the lizards and the night oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood mr nancy showed him to the couch it was much smaller than shadow who decided to sleep on the floor but by the time he had finished deciding to sleep on the floor he was already fast asleep half sitting half lying on the tiny sofa at first he did not dream there was just the comforting darkness and then he saw a fire burning in the darkness and he walked toward it you did well whispered the buffalo man without moving his lips i dont know what i did said shadow you made peace said the buffalo man you took our words and made them your own they never understood that they were hereand the people who worshiped them were herebecause it suits us that they are here but we can change our minds and perhaps we will are you a god asked shadow the buffaloheaded man shook his head shadow thought for a moment that the creature was amused i am the land he said and if there was more to that dream then shadow did not remember it he heard something sizzling his head was aching and there was a pounding behind his eyes mr nancy was already cooking breakfast a towering stack of pancakes sizzling bacon perfect eggs and coffee he looked in the peak of health my head hurts said shadow neil caiman you get a good breakfast inside you youll feel like a new man id rather feel like the same man just with a different head said shadow eat said mr nancy shadow ate how do you feel now like ive got a headache only now ive got some food in my stomach and i think im going to throw up come with me beside the sofa on which shadow had spent the night covered with an african blanket was a trunk made of some dark wood which looked like an undersized pirate chest mr nancy undid the padlock and opened the lid inside the trunk there were a number of boxes nancy rummaged among the boxes its an ancient african herbal remedy he said its made of ground willow bark things like that like aspirin yup said mr nancy just like that from the bottom of the trunk he produced a giant economysized bottle of generic aspirin he unscrewed the top and shook out a couple of white pills here nice trunk said shadow he took the bitter pills swallowed them with a glass of water my son sent if to me said mr nancy hes a good boy i dont see him as much as id like i miss wednesday said shadow despite everything he did i keep expecting to see him but i look up and hes not there he kept staring at the pirate trunk trying to figure out what it reminded him of you will lose many things do not lose this who said that you miss him after what he put you through put us all through yes said shadow i guess i do do you think hell be back american gods i think said mr nancy that wherever two men are gathered together to sell a third man a twentydollar violin for ten thousand dollars he will be there in spirit yes but we should get back into the kitchen said mr nancy his expression becoming stony those pans wont wash themselves mr nancy washed the pans and the dishes shadow dried them and put them away somewhere in there the headache began to ease they went back into the sitting room shadow stared at the old trunk some more willing himself to remember if i dont go to see czernobog he said what will happen youll see him said mr nancy flatly maybe hell find you or maybe hell bring you to him but one way or another youll see him shadow nodded something started to fall into place a dream on the tree hey he said is there a god with an elephants head ganesh hes a hindu god he removes obstacles and makes journeys easier good cook too shadow looked up its in the trunk he said i knew it was important but i didnt know whyi thought maybe it meant the trunk of the tree but he wasnt talking about that at all was he mr nancy frowned you lost me its in the trunk said shadow he knew it was true he did not know why it should be true not quite but of that he was completely certain he got to his feet i got to go he said im sorry mr nancy raised an eyebrow why the hurry because said shadow simply the ice is melting chapter twenty shadow drove the rental out of the forest at about in the morning came down the hill doing under fortyfive miles per hour and entered the town of lakeside three weeks after he was certain he had left it for good he drove through the city surprised at how little it had changed in the last few weeks which were a lifetime and he parked halfway down the driveway that led to the lake then he got out of the car there were no more icefishing huts on the frozen lake any longer no suvs no men sitting at a fishing hole with a line and a twelvepack the lake was dark no longer covered with a blind white layer of snow now there were reflective patches of water on the surface of the ice and the water under the ice was black and the ice itself was clear american gods enough that the darkness beneath showed through the sky was gray but the icy lake was bleak and empty almost empty there was one car remaining on the ice parked out on the frozen lake almost beneath the bridge so that anyone driving through the town anyone crossing the town could not help but see it it was a dirty green in color the sort of car that people abandon in parking lots it had no engine it was a symbol of a wager waiting for the ice to become rotten enough and soft enough and dangerous enough to allow the lake to take it forever there was a chain across the short driveway that led down to the lake and a warning sign forbidding entrance to people or to vehicles thin ice it read beneath it was a handpainted sequence of pictograms with lines through them no cars no pedestrians no snowmobiles danger shadow ignored the warnings and scrambled down the bank it was slipperythe snow had already melted turning the earth to mud under his feet and the brown grass barely offered traction he skidded and slid down to the lake and walked carefully out onto a short wooden jetty and from there he stepped down onto the ice the layer of water on the ice made up of melted ice and melted snow was deeper than it had looked from above and the ice beneath the water was slicker and more slippery than any skating rink so that shadow was forced to fight to keep his footing he splashed though the water as it covered his boots to the laces and seeped inside ice water it numbed where it touched he felt strangely distant as he trudged across the frozen lake as if he were watching himself on a movie screena movie in which he was the hero a detective perhaps he walked toward the klunker painfully aware that the ice was too rotten for this and that the water beneath the ice neil caiman was as cold as water could be without freezing he kept walking and he slipped and slid several times he fell he passed empty beer bottles and cans left to litter the ice and he passed round holes cut into the ice for fishing holes that had not frozen again each hole filled with black water the klunker seemed farther away than it had looked from the road he heard a loud crack from the south of the lake like a stick breaking followed by the sound of something huge thrumming as if a bass string the size of a lake were vibrating massively the ice creaked and groaned like an old door protesting being opened shadow kept walking as steadily as he could this is suicide whispered a sane voice in the back of his mind cant you just let it go no he said aloud i have to know and he kept right on walking he arrived at the klunker and even before he reached it he knew that he had been right there was a miasma that hung about the car something that was at the same time a faint foul smell and was also a bad taste in the back of his throat he walked around the car looking inside the seats were stained and ripped the car was obviously empty he tried the doors they were locked he tried the trunk also locked he wished that he had brought a crowbar he made a fist of his hand inside his glove he counted to three then smashed his hand hard against the driversside window glass his hand hurt but the side window was undamaged he thought about running at ithe could kick the window in he was certain if he didnt skid and fall on the wet ice but the last thing he wanted to do was to disturb the klunker enough that the ice beneath it would crack he looked at the car then he reached for the radio antennait was the kind that was supposed to go up and american gods down but that had stuck in the up position a decade ago and with a little waggling he broke it off at the base he took the thin end of the antennait had once had a metal button on the end but that was lost in time and with strong fingers he bent it back up into a makeshift hook then he rammed the extended metal antenna down between the rubber and the glass of the front window deep into the mechanism of the door he fished in the mechanism twisting moving pushing the metal antenna about until it caught and then he pulled up he felt the improvised hook sliding from the lock uselessly he sighed fished again slower more carefully he could imagine the ice grumbling beneath his feet as he shifted his weight and slow and he had it he pulled up on the aerial and the frontdoor locking mechanism popped up shadow reached down one gloved hand and took the door handle pressed the button and pulled the door did not open its stuck he thought iced up thats all he tugged sliding on the ice and suddenly the door of the klunker flew open ice scattering everywhere the miasma was worse inside the car a stench of rot and illness shadow felt sick he reached under the dashboard found the black plastic handle that opened the trunk and tugged on it hard there was a thunk from behind him as the trunk door released shadow walked out onto the ice slipped and splashed around the car holding on to the side of it as he went its in the trunk he thought the trunk was open an inch he reached down and opened it the rest of the way pulling it up the smell was bad but it could have been much worse the bottom of the trunk was filled with an inch or so of halfmelted ice there was a girl in the trunk she wore a scarlet neil caiman snowsuit now stained and her mousy hair was long and her mouth was closed so shadow could not see the blue rubberband braces but he knew that they were there the cold had preserved her kept her as fresh as if she had been in a freezer her eyes were wide open and she looked as if she had been crying when she died and the tears that had frozen on her cheeks had still not melted you were here all the time said shadow to alison mcgoverns corpse every single person who drove over that bridge saw you everyone who drove through the town saw you the ice fishermen walked past you every day and nobody knew and then he realized how foolish that was somebody knew somebody had put her here he reached into the trunkto see if he could pull her out he put his weight on the car as he leaned in maybe that was what did it the ice beneath the front wheels went at that moment perhaps from his movements perhaps not the front of the car lurched downward several feet into the dark water of the lake water began to pour into the car through the open drivers door lake water splashed about shadows ankles although the ice he stood on was still solid he looked around urgently wondering how to get awayand then it was too late and the ice tipped precipitously throwing him against the car and the dead girl in the trunk and the back of the car went down and shadow went down with it into the cold waters of the lake it was ten past nine in the morning on march the twentythird he took a deep breath before he went under closing his eyes but the cold of the lake water hit him like a wall knocking the breath from his body he tumbled downward into the murky ice water pulled down by the car he was under the lake down in the darkness and the cold american gods weighed down by his clothes and his gloves and his boots trapped and swathed in his coat which seemed to have become heavier and bulkier than he could have imagined he was falling still he tried to push away from the car but it was pulling him with it and then there was a bang that he could hear with his whole body not his ears and his left foot was wrenched at the ankle the foot twisted and trapped beneath the car as it settled on the lake bottom and panic took him he opened his eyes he knew it was dark down there rationally he knew it was too dark to see anything but still he could see he could see everything he could see alison mcgoverns white face staring at him from the open trunk he could see other cars as wellthe klunkers of bygone years rotten hulk shapes in the darkness half buried in the lake mud and what else would they have dragged out on to the lake shadow wondered before there were cars each one he knew without any question had a dead child in the trunk there were scores of ftem each had sat out on the ice in front of the eyes of the world all through the cold winter each had tumbled into the cold waters of the lake when the winter was done this was where they rested lemmi hautala and jessie lovat and sandy olsen and jo ming and sarah lindquist and all the rest of them down where it was silent and cold he pulled at his foot it was stuck fast and the pressure in his lungs was becoming unbearable there was a sharp terrible hurt in his ears he exhaled slowly and the air bubbled around his face soon he thought soon ill have to breathe or ill choke he reached down put both hands around the bumper of the klunker and pushed with everything he had leaning into it nothing happened its only the shell of a car he told himself they took out neil caiman the engine thats the heaviest part of the car you can do it just keep pushing he pushed agonizingly slowly a fraction of an inch at a time the car slipped forward in the mud and shadow pulled his foot from the mud beneath the car and kicked and tried to push himself out into the cold lake water he didnt move the coat he told himself its the coat its stuck or caught on something he pulled his arms from his coat fumbled with numb fingers at the frozen zipper then he pulled both hands on each side of the zipper felt the coat give and rend hastily he freed himself from its embrace and pushed upward away from the car there was a rushing sensation but no sense of up no sense of down and he was choking and the pain in his chest and in his head was too much to bear so that he was certain that he was going to have to inhale to breathe in the cold water to die and then his head hit something solid ice he was pushing against the ice on the top of the lake he hammered at it with his fists but there was no strength left in his arms nothing to hold on to nothing to push against the world had dissolved into the chill blackness beneath the lake there was nothing left but cold this is ridiculous he thought and he thought remembering some old tony curtis film hed seen as a kid should roll onto my back and push theice upward and press my face to it and find some air i could breathe again theres air there somewhere but he was just floating and freezing and he could no longer move a muscle not if his life depended on it which it did the cold became bearable became warm and he thought i m dying there was anger there this time a deep fury and he took the pain and the anger and reached with it flailed forced muscles to move that were ready never to move again he pushed up with his hand and felt it scrape the edge of american gods the ice and move up into the air he flailed for a grip and felt another hand take his own and pull his head banged against the ice his face scraped the underneath of the ice and then his head was up in the air and he could see that he was coming up through a hole in the ice and for a moment all he could do was breathe and let the black lake water run from his nose and his mouth and blink his eyes which could see nothing more than a blinding daylight and shapes and someone was pulling him now forcing him out of the water saying something about how hed freeze to death so come on man pull and shadow wriggled and shook like a bull seal coming ashore shaking and coughing and shuddering he breathed deep gasps of air stretched flat out on the creaking ice and even that would not hold for long he knew but it was no good his thoughts were coming with difficulty syrupyslow just leave me he tried to say ill be fine his words were a slur and everything was drawing to a halt he just needed to rest for a moment that was all just rest and then he would get up and move on obviously he could not just lie there forever there was a jerk water splashed his face his head was lifted up shadow felt himself being hauled across the ice sliding on his back across the slick surface and he wanted to protest to explain that he just needed a little rest maybe a little sleep was that asking for so muchand he would be just fine if they just left him alone he did not believe that he had fallen asleep but he was standing on a vast plain and there was a man there with the head and shoulders of a buffalo and a woman with the head of an enormous condor and there was whiskey jack standing between them looking at him sadly shaking his head whiskey jack turned and walked slowly away from shadow the buffalo man walked away beside him the neil caiman thunderbird woman also walked and then she ducked and kicked and she was gliding out into the skies shadow felt a sense of loss he wanted to call to them to plead with them to come back not to give up on him but everything was becoming formless and without shape they were gone and the plains were fading and everything became void the pain was intense it was as if every cell in his body every nerve was melting and waking and advertising its presence by burning him and hurting him there was a hand at the back of his head gripping it by the hair and another hand beneath his chin he opened his eyes expecting to find himself in some kind of hospital his feet were bare he was wearing jeans he was naked from the waist up there was steam in the air he could see a shaving mirror on the wall facing him and a small basin and a blue toothbrush in a toothpastestained glass information was processed slowly one datum at a time his fingers burned his toes burned he began to whimper from the pain easy now mike easy there said a voice he knew what he said or tried to say whats happening it sounded strained and strange to his ears he was in a bathtub the water was hot he thought the water was hot although he could not be certain the water was up to his neck dumbest thing you can do with a fellow freezing to death is to put him in front of a fire the second dumbest thing you can do is to wrap him in blanketsespecially if hes in cold wet clothes already blankets insulate himkeep the cold in the third dumbest thingand this is my private opinionis to take the fellows blood out warm it up and put it back thats what doctors do these days complicated expensive dumb the voice was coming from above and behind his head american gods the smartest quickest thing you can do is what sailors have done to men overboard for hundreds of years you put the fellow in hot water not too hot just hot now just so you know you were basically dead when i found you on the ice back there how are you feeling now houdini it hurts said shadow everything hurts you saved my life i guess maybe i did at that can you hold your head up on your own now maybe im going to let you go if you start sinking below the water ill pull you back up again the hands released their grip on his head he felt himself sliding forward in the tub he put out his hands pressed them against the sides of the tub and leaned back the bathroom was small the tub was metal and the enamel was stained and scratched an old man moved into his field of vision he looked concerned feeling better asked hinzelmann you just lay back and relax ive got the den nice and warm you tell me when youre ready i got a robe you can wear anh can throw your jeans into the dryer with the rest of your clothes sound good mike thats not my name if you say so the old mans goblin face twisted into an expression of discomfort shadow had no real sense of time he lay in the bathtub until the burning stopped and his toes and fingers flexed without real discomfort hinzelmann helped shadow to his feet and let out the warm water shadow sat on the side of the bathtub and together they pulled off his jeans he squeezed without much difficulty into a terrycloth robe too small for him and leaning on the old man he went into the den and flopped down on an ancient sofa he was tired and weak deeply fatigued but alive a log fire neil caiman burned in the fireplace a handful of surprisedlooking deer heads peered down dustily from around the walls where they jostled for space with several large varnished fish hinzelmann went away with shadows jeans and from the room next door shadow could hear a brief pause in the rattle of a clothes dryer before it resumed the old man returned with a steaming mug its coffee he said which is a stimulant and i splashed a little schnapps into it just a little thats what we always did in the old days a doctor wouldnt recommend it shadow took the coffee with both hands on the side of the mug was a picture of a mosquito and the message give bloodvisit wisconsin thanks he said its what friends are for said hinzelmann one day you can save my life for now forget about it shadow sipped the coffee i thought i was dead you were lucky i was up on the bridgeid pretty much figured that today was going to be the big day you get a feel for it when you get to my ageso i was up there with my old pocket watch and i saw you heading out onto the lake i shouted but i sure as heck dont think you coulda heard me i saw the car go down and i saw you go down with it and i thought id lost you so i went out onto the ice gave me the heebiejeebies you must have been under the water for the best part of two minutes then i saw your hand come up through the place where the car went downit was like seeing a ghost seeing you there he trailed off we were both damn lucky that the ice took our weight as i dragged you back to the shore shadow nodded you did a good thing he told hinzelmann and the old man beamed all over his goblin face somewhere in the house shadow heard a door close he sipped at his coffee american gods now that he was able to think clearly he was starting to ask himself questions he wondered how an old man a man half his height and perhaps a third his weight had been able to drag him unconscious across the ice or get him up the bank to a car he wondered how hinzelmann had gotten shadow into the house and the bathtub hinzelmann walked over to the fire picked up the tongs and placed a thin log carefully onto the blazing fire do you want to know what i was doing out on the ice hinzelmann shrugged none of my business you know what i dont understand said shadow he hesitated putting his thoughts in order i dont understand why you saved my life well said hinzelmann the way i was brought up if you see another fellow in trouble no said shadow thats not what i mean i mean you killed all those kids every winter i was the only one to have figured it out you must have seen me open the trunk why didnt you just let me drown hinzelmann tipped his head on one side he scratched his nose thoughtfully rocked back and forth as if he were thinking well he said thats a good question i guess its because i owed a certain party a debt and im good for my debts wednesday thats the fellow there was a reason he hid me in lakeside wasnt there there was a reason nobody should have been able to find me here hinzelmann said nothing he unhooked a heavy black poker from its place on the wall and he prpdded at the fire with it sending up a cloud of orange sparks and smoke this is my home he said petulantly its a good town shadow finished his coffee he put the cup down on the neil caiman floor the effort was exhausting how long have you been here long enough and you made the lake hinzelmann peered at him surprised yes he said i made the lake they were calling it a lake when i got here but it werent nothing more than a spring and a mill pond and a creek he paused i figured that this country is hell on my kind of folk it eats us i didnt want to be eaten so i made a deal i gave them a lake and i gave them prosperity and all it cost them was one child every winter good kids said hinzelmann shaking his old head slowly they were all good kids id only pick ones i liked except for charlie nelligan he was a bad seed that one he was what yeah that was the deal the people of the town said shadow mabel marguerite chad mulligan do they knowt hinzelmann said nothing he pulled the poker from the fire the first six inches at the tip glowed a dull orange shadow knew that the handle of the poker must be too hot to hold but it did not seem to bother hinzelmann and he prodded the fire again he put the poker back into the fire tip first and left it there then he said they know that they live in a good place while every other town and city in this county heck in this part of the state is crumbling into nothing they know that and thats your doing this town said hinzelmann i care for it nothing happens here that i dont want to happen you understand that nobody comes here that i dont want to come here that was why your father sent you here he didnt want you out there in the world attracting attention thats all and you betrayed him i did no such thing he was a crook but i always pay my debts american gods i dont believe you said shadow hinzelmann looked offended one hand tugged at the clump of white hair at his temple i keep my word no you dont laura came here she said something was calling her here and what about the coincidence that brought sam black crow and audrey burton here on the same night i guess i dont believe in coincidence anymore sam black crow and audrey burton two people who both knew who i really was and that there were people out there looking for me i guess if one of them failed there was always the other and if all of them had failed who else was on their way to lakeside hinzelmann my old prison warden up here for a weekends ice fishing lauras mother shadow realized that he was angry you wanted me but of your town you just didnt want to have to tell wednesday that was what you were doing in the firelight hinzelmann seemed more like a gargoyle than an imp this is a good town he said without his smile he looked waxen and corpselike you could have attracted too much attention not good for the town you should have left me back there qp me ice said shadow you should have left me in the lake i opened the trunk of the klunker right now alisonis still iced into the trunk but the ice will melt and her bodyll float out and up to the surface and then theyll go down and look and see what else they can find down there find your whole stash of kids i guess some of those bodies are pretty well preserved hinzelmann reached down and picked up the poker he made no pretense of stirring the fire with it any longer he held it like a sword or a baton the glowing orangewhite tip of it waving in the air it smoked shadow was very aware that he was nexttonaked and he was still tired and clumsy and far from able to defend himself you want to kill me said shadow go ahead do it im a dead man anyway i know you own this townits neil caiman your little world but if you think no ones going to come looking for me youre living in a dreamworld its over hinzelmann one way or another its done hinzelmann pushed himself to his feet using the poker as a walking stick the carpet charred and smoked where he rested the redhot tip as he got up he looked at shallow and there were tears in his pale blue eyes i love this town he said i really like being a cranky old man and telling my stories and driving tessie and icefishing remember what i told you its not the fish you bring home from a days fishing its the peace of mind he extended the tip of the poker in shadows direction shadow could feel the heat of it from a foot away i could kill you said hinzelmann i could fix it ive done it before youre not the first to figure it out chad mulligans father he figured it out i fixed him and i can fix you maybe said shadow but for how long hinzelmann another year another decade they have computers now hinzelmann they arent stupid they pick up on patterns every year a kids going to vanish sooner or later theyll come sniffing about here just like theyll come looking for me tell mehow old are you he curled his fingers around a sofa cushion and prepared to pull it over his head it would deflect a first blow hinzelmanns face was expressionless they were giving their children to me before the romans came to the black forest he said i was a god before ever i was a kobold maybe its time to move on said shadow he wondered what a kobold was hinzelmann stared at him then he took the poker and pushed the tip of it back into the burning embers its not that simple what makes you think i can leave this town even if i want to shadow im part of this town you going american gods to make me go shadow you ready to kill me so i can leave shadow looked down at the floor there were still glimmers and sparks in the carpet where the poker tip had rested hinzelmann followed the look with his own and crushed the embers out with his foot twisting in shadows mind came unbidden children more than a hundred of them staring at him with boneblind eyes the hair twisting slowly around their faces like fronds of seaweed they were looking at him reproachfully he knew that he was letting them down he just didnt know what else to do shadow said i cant kill you you saved my life he shook his head he felt like crap in every way he could feel like crap he didnt feel like a hero or a detective anymorejust another fucking sellout waving a stern finger at the darkness before turning his back on it you want to know a secret asked hinzelmann sure said shadow with a heavy heart he was ready to be done with secrets watch this where hinzelmann had been standing stood a male child no more than five years old his hairwas dark brown and long he was perfectly naked save for a worn leather band around his neck he was pierced with two swords one of them going through his chest the other entering at his shoulder with the point coming out beneath the ribcage blood flowed through the wounds without stopping and ran down the childs body to pool and puddle on the floor the swords looked unimaginably old the little boy stared up at shadow with eyes that held only pain and shadow thought to himself of course thats as good a way as any other of making a tribal god he did not have to be told he knew neil caiman you take a baby and you bring it up in the darkness letting it see no one touch no one and you feed it well as the years pass feed it better than any of the villages other children and then five winters on when the night is at its longest you drag the terrified child out of its hut and into the circle of bonfires and you pierce it with blades of iron and of bronze then you smoke the small body over charcoal fires until it is properly dried and you wrap it in furs and carry it with you from encampment to encampment deep in the black forest sacrificing animals and children to it making it the luck of the tribe when eventually the thing falls apart from age you place its fragile bones in a box and you worship the box until one day the bones are scattered and forgotten and the tribes who worshipped the childgod of the box are long gone and the childgod the luck of the village will be barely remembered save as a ghost or a brownie a kobold shadow wondered which of the people who had come to northern wisconsin years ago a woodcutter perhaps or a mapmaker had crossed the atlantic with hinzelmann living in his head and then the bloody child was gone and the blood and there was only an old man with a fluff of white hair and a goblin smile his sweatersleeves still soaked from putting shadow into the bath that had saved his life hinzelmann the voice came from the doorway of the den hinzelmann turned shadow turned too i came over to tell you said chad mulligan and his voice was strained that the klunker went through the ice i saw it had gone down when i drove over that way and thought id come over and let you know in case youd missed it he was holding his gun it was pointed at the floor hey chad said shadow american gods hey pal said chad mulligan they sent me a note said youd died in custody heart attack how about that said shadow seems like im dying all over the place he came down here chad said hinzelmann he threatened me no said chad mulligan he didnt ive been here for the last ten minutes hinzelmann i heard everything you said about my old man about the lake he walked farther into the den he did not raise the gun jesus hinzelmann you cant drive through this town without seeing that goddamned lake its at the center of everything so what the hell am i supposed to do you got to arrest him he said he was going to kill me said hinzelmann a scared old man in a dusty den chad im pleased youre here no said chad mulligan youre not hinzelmann sighed he bent down as if resigned and he pulled the poker out from the fire the tip of it was burning bright orange put that down hinzelmann just put it down slowly keep your hands in the air where i can seethem and turn and face the wall there was an expression of pure fear on the old mans face and shadow would have felt sorry for him but he remembered the frozen tears on the cheeks of alison mcgovern hinzelmann did not move he did not put down the poker he did not turn to the wall shadow was about to reach for hinzelmann to try to take the poker away from him when the old man threw the burning poker at mulligan hinzelmann threw it awkwardlylobbing it across the room as if for forms sakeand as he threw it he was already hurrying for the door the poker glanced off mulligans left arm neil caiman the noise of the shot in the close quarters of the old mans room was deafening one shot to the head and that was all mulligan said better get your clothes on his voice was dull and dead shadow nodded he walked to the room next door opened the door of the clothes drier and pulled out his clothes the jeans were still damp but he put them on anyway by the time he got back to the den fully dressed except for his coat which was somewhere deep in the freezing mud of the lake and his boots which he could not findmulligan had already hauled several smoldering logs out from the fireplace mulligan said its a bad day for a cop when he has to commit arson just to cover up a murder then he looked up at shadow you need boots he said i dont know where he put them said shadow hell said mulligan then he said sorry about mis hinzelmann and he picked the old man up by the collar and by the belt buckle and he swung him forward dropped the body with its head resting in the open fireplace the white hair crackled and flared and the room began to fill with the smell of charring flesh it wasnt murder it was selfdefense said shadow i know what it was said mulligan flatly he had already turned his attention to the smoking logs he had scattered about the room he pushed one of them to the edge of the sofa picked up an old copy of the lakeside news and pulled it into its component pages which he crumpled up and dropped onto the log the newspaper pages browned and then burst into flame get outside said chad mulligan he opened the windows as they walked out of the house and he sprang the lock on the front door to lock it before he closed it shadow followed him out to the police car in his bare american gods feet mulligan opened the front passenger door for him and shadow got in and wiped his feet off on the mat then he put on his socks which were pretty much dry by now we can get you some boots at hennings farm and home said chad mulligan how much did you hear in there asked shadow enough said mulligan then he said too much they drove to hennings farm and home in silence when they got there the police chief said what size feet shadow told him mulligan walked into the store he returned with a pair of thick woolen socks and a pair of leather farmboots all they had left in your size he said unless you wanted gumboots i figured you didnt shadow pulled on the socks and the boots they fitted fine thanks he said you got a car asked mulligan its parked by the road down to the lake near the bridge mulligan started the car and pulled out of the hennings parking lot what happened to audrey asked shadojv day after they took you away she said she liked me as a friend but it would never work out between us us being family and all and she went back to eagle point broke my goshdarn heart makes sense said shadow and it wasnt personal hinzelmann didnt need her here anymore they drove back past hinzelmanns house a thick plume of white smoke was coming up from the chimney she only came to town because he wanted her here she helped him get me out of town i was bringing attention he didnt need i thought she liked me they pulled up beside shadows rental car what are you going to do now asked shadow neil caiman i dont know said mulligan his normally harassed face was starting to look more alive than it had at any point since hinzelmanns den it also looked more troubled i figure i got a couple of choices either illhe made a gun of his first two fingers put the fingertips into his open mouth and removed themput a bullet through my brain or ill wait another couple of days until the ice is mostly gone and tie a concrete block to my leg and jump off the bridge or pills sheesh maybe i should just drive a while out to one of the forests take pills out there i dont want to make one of my guys have to do the cleanup leave it for the county huh he sighed and shook his head you didnt kill hinzelmann chad he died a long time ago a long way from here thanks for saying that mike but i killed him i shot a man in cold blood and i covered it up and if you asked me why i did it why i really did it im darned if i could tell you shadow put out a hand touched mulligan on the arm hinzelmann owned this town he said i dont think you had a lot of choice about what happened back there i mink he brought you there he wanted you to hear what you heard he set you up i guess it was the only way he could leave mulligans miserable expression did not change shadow could see that the police chief had barely heard anything that he had said he had killed hinzelmann and built him a pyre and now obeying the last of hinzelmanns desires he would commit suicide shadow closed his eyes remembering the place in his head that he had gone when wednesday had told him to make snow that place that pushed mind to mind and he smiled a smile he did not feel and he said chad let it go there was a cloud in the mans mind a dark oppressive cloud and shadow could almost see it and concentrating on it imagined it fading away like a fog in the morning american gods chad he said fiercely trying to penetrate the cloud this town is going to change now its not going to be the only good town in a depressed region anymore its going to be a lot more like the rest of this part of the world theres going to be a lot more trouble people out of work people out of their heads more people getting hurt more bad shit going down they are going to need a police chief with experience the town needs you and then he said marguerite needs you something shifted in the storm cloud that filled the mans head shadow could feel it change he pushed then envisioning marguerite olsens practical brown hands and her dark eyes and her long long black hair he pictured the way she tipped her head on one side and half smiled when she was amused shes waiting for you said shadow and he knew it was true as he said it margie said chad mulligan and at that moment although he could never tell you how he had done it and he doubted that he could ever do it again shadow reached into chad mulligans mind easy as anything and he plucked the events of that afternoon out from it as precisely and dispassionately as a raven picks an eye from roadkill the creases in chads forehead smoothed and he blinked sleepily go see margie said shadow its been good seeing you chad take care of yourself sure yawned chad mulligan a message crackled over the police radio and chad reached out for the handset shadow got out of the car shadow walked over to his rental car he could see the gray flatness of the lake at the center of the town he thought of the dead children who waited at the bottom of the water soon alison would float to the surface as shadow drove past hinzelmanns place he could see neil caiman the plume of smoke had already turned into a maze he could hear a siren wail he drove south heading for highway he was on his way to keep his final appointment but before that he thought he would stop off in madison for one last goodbye best of everything samantha black crow liked closing up the coffee house at night it was a perfectly calming thing to do it gave her a feeling that she was putting order back into the world she would put on an indigo girls cd and she would do her final chores of the night at her own pace and in her own way first she would clean the espresso machine then she would do the final rounds ensuring that any missed cups or plates were deposited back in the kitchen and that the newspapers that were always scattered around the coffee house by the end of each day were collected together and piled neatly by the front door all ready for recycling she loved the coffee house it was a long winding series of rooms filled with armchairs and sofas and low tables on a street lined with secondhand bookstores she covered the leftover slices of cheesecake and put them into the large refrigerator for the night then she took a cloth and wiped the last of the crumbs away she enjoyed being alone a tapping on the window jerked her attention from her chores back to the real world she went to the door and opened it to admit a woman of about sams age with pigtailed magenta hair her name was natalie hello said natalie she went up on tiptoes and kissed sam depositing the kiss snugly between sams cheek and the corner of her mouth you can say a lot of things with a kiss like that you done nearly you want to see a movie american gods sure love to ive got a good five minutes left here though why dont you sit and read the onion i saw this weeks already she sat on a chair near the door ruffled through the pile of newspapers put aside for recycling until she found something and read it while sam bagged up the last of the money in the till and put it in the safe they had been sleeping together for a week now sam wondered if this was it the relationship shed been waiting for all her life she told herself that it was just brain chemicals and pheromones that made her happy when she saw natalie and perhaps that was what it was still all she knew for sure was that she smiled when she saw natalie and that when they were together she felt comfortable and comforted this paper said natalie has another one of those articles in it is america changing well is it they dont say they say that maybe it is but they dont know how and they dont know why and maybe it isnt happening at all sam smiled broadly well she said that covers every option doesnt it i guess natalies brow creased and she went back to her newspaper sam washed the dishcloth and folded it i think its just that despite the government and whatever everything just feels suddenly good right now maybe its just spring coming a little early it was a long winter and im glad its over me too a pause it says in the article that lots of people have been reporting weird dreams i havent really had any weird dreams nothing weirder than normal sam looked around to see if there was anything she had missed nope it was a good job well done she took off her neil caiman apron hung it back in the kitchen then she came back and started to turn off the lights ive had some weird dreams recently she said they got weird enough that i actually started keeping a dream journal i write them down when i wake up but when i read them they dont mean anything at all she put on her street coat and her onesizefitsall gloves i did some dream work said natalie natalie had done a little of everything from arcane selfdefense disciplines and sweat lodges to feng shui and jazz dancing tell me ill tell you what they mean okay sam unlocked the door and turned the last of the lights off she let natalie out and she walked out onto the street and locked the door to the coffee house firmly behind her sometimes i have been dreaming of people who fell from the sky sometimes im underground talking to a woman with a buffalo head and sometimes i dream about this guy i kissed in a bar last month natalie made a noise something you should have told me about maybe but not like that it was a fuckoff kiss you were telling him to fuck off no i was telling everyone else they could fuck off you had to be there i guess natalies shoes clicked down the sidewalk sam padded on next to her he owns my car said sam that purple thing you got at your sisters yup what happened to him why doesnt he want his car i dont know maybe hes in prison maybe hes dead dead i guess sam hesitated a few weeks back i was certain he was dead esp or whatever like i knew but then i started to think maybe he wasnt i dont know i guess my esp isnt that hot how long are you going to keep his car american gods until someone comes for it i think its what he would have wanted natalie looked at sam then she looked again then she said where did you get those from what the flowers the ones youre holding sam where did they come from did you have them when we left the coffee house i would have seen them sam looked down then she grinned you are so sweet i should have said something when you gave them to me shouldnt i she said they are lovely thank you so much but wouldnt red have been more appropriate they were roses their stems wrapped in paper six of them and white i didnt give them to you said natalie her lips firming and neither of them said another word until they reached the movie theater when she got home that night sam put the roses in an improvised vase later she cast them in bronze and she kept to herself the tale of how she got them although she told caroline who came after natalie the story of the ghostroses one night when they were both very drunk and caroline agreed with sam that it was a really really strange and spooky story and deep down did not actually believe a word of it so that was all right shadow had parked near a pay phone he called information and they gave him the number no he was told she isnt here shes probably still at the coffee house he stopped on the way to the coffee house to buy flowers he found the coffee house then he crossed the road and stood in the doorway of a used bookstore and waited and watched the place closed at eight and at ten past eight shadow saw sam black crow walk out of the coffee house in the neil caiman company of a smaller woman whose pigtailed hair was a peculiar shade of red they were holding hands tightly as if simply holding hands could keep the world at bay and they were talkingor rather sam was doing most of the talking while her friend listened shadow wondered what sam was saying she smiled as she talked the two women crossed the road and they walked past the place where shadow was standing the pigtailed girl passed within a foot of him he could have reached out and touched her and they didnt see him at all he watched them walking away from him down the street and felt a pang like a minor chord being played inside him it had been a good kiss shadow reflected but sam had never looked at him the way she was looking at the pigtailed girl and she never would what the hell well always have peru he said under his breath as sam walked away from him and el paso well always have that then he ran after her and put the flowers into sams hands he hurried away so she could not give them back then he walked up the hill back to his car and he followed the signs to chicago he drove at or slightly under the speed limit it was the last thing he had to do he was in no hurry he spent the night in a motel he got up the next morning and realized his clothes still smelled like the bottom of the lake he put them on anyway he figured he wouldnt need them much longer shadow paid his bill he drove to the brownstone apartment building he found it without any difficulty it was smaller than he remembered he walked up the stairs steadilynot fast that would have meant he was eager to go to his death and not slow american gods that would have meant he was afraid someone had cleaned the stairwell the black garbage bags had gone the place smelled of the chlorine smell of bleach no longer of rotting vegetables the redpainted door at the top of the stairs was wide open the smell of old meals hung in the air shadow hesitated then he pressed the doorbell i come called a womans voice and dwarfsmall and dazzlingly blonde zorya utrennyaya came out of the kitchen and bustled toward him wiping her hands on her apron she looked different shadow realized she looked happy her cheeks were rouged red and there was a sparkle in her old eyes when she saw him her mouth became an o and she called out shadow you came back to us and she hurried toward him with her arms outstretched he bent down and embraced her and she kissed his cheek so good to see you she said now you must go away shadow stepped into the apartment all the doors in the apartment were wide open and all the windows he could see were open as well a gentle breeze blew fitfully through the corridor youre spring cleaning he said to zorya utrennyaya we have a guest coming she told him now you must go away first you want coffee i came to see czernobog said shadow its time zorya utrennyaya shook her head violently no no she said you dont want to see him not a good idea i know said shadow but you know the only thing ive really learned about dealing with gods is that if you make a deal you keep it they get to break all the rules they want we dont even if i tried to walk out of here my feet would just bring me back she pushed up her bottom lip then said is true but go today come back tomorrow he will be gone then who is it called a womans voice from farther down neil caiman the corridor zorya utrennyaya to who are you talking this mattress i cannot turn on my own you know shadow walked down the corridor and said good morning zorya vechernyaya can i help which made the woman in the room squeak with surprise and drop her corner of the mattress the bedroom was thick with dust it covered every surface the wood and the glass and motes of it floated arid danced through the beams of sunshine coming through the open window disturbed by occasional breezes and the lazy flapping of the yellowed lace curtains he remembered this room this was the room they had given to wednesday that night bielebogs room zorya vechernyaya eyed him uncertainly the mattress she said it needs to be turned not a problem said shadow he reached out and took the mattress lifted it with ease and turned it over it was an old wooden bed and the feather mattress weighed almost as much as a man dust flew and swirled as the mattress went down why are you here asked zorya vechernyaya it was not a friendly question the way she asked it im here said shadow because back in december a young man played a game of checkers with an old god and he lost the old womans gray hair was up on the top of her head in a tight bun she pursed her lips come back tomorrow said zorya vechernyaya i cant he said simply is your funeral now you go and sit down zorya utrennyaya will bring you coffee czernobog will be back soon shadow walked along the corridor to the sitting room it was just as he remembered although now the window was open the gray cat slept on the arm of the sofa it opened an eye as shadow came in and then unimpressed it went back to sleep american gods this was where he had played checkers with czernobog this was where he had wagered his life to get the old man to join them on wednesdays last doomed grift the fresh air came in through the open window blowing the stale air away zorya utrennyaya came in with a red wooden tray a small enameled cup of steaming black coffee sat on the tray beside a saucer filled with small chocolatechip cookies she put it down on the table in front of him i saw zorya polunochnaya again he said she came to me under the world and she gave me the moon to light my way and she took something from me but i dont remember what she likes you said zorya utrennyaya she dreams so much and she guards us all she is so brave wheres czernobog he says the spring cleaning makes him uncomfortable he goes out to buy newspaper sit in the park buy cigarettes perhaps he will not come back today you do not have to wait why dont you go come back tomorrow ill wait said shadow there was no magic forcing him to wait he knew that this was him it was one last thing that needed to happen and if it was the last thing that happened well he was going there of his own volition after this there would be no more obligations no more mysteries no more ghosts he sipped the hot coffee as black and as sweet as he remembered he heard a deep male voice in the corridor and he sat up straighten he was pleased to see that his hand was not trembling the door opened shadow hi said shadow he stayed sitting down czernobog walked into the room he was carrying a folded copy of the chicago suntimes which he put down on the coffee table he stared at shadow then he put his hand out tentatively the two men shook hands neil caiman i came said shadow our deal you came through with your part of it this is my part czernobog nodded his brow creased the sunlight glinted on his gray hair and mustache making them appear almost golden is he frowned is not he broke off maybe you should go is not a good time take as long as you heed said shadow im ready czernobog sighed you are a very stupid boy you know that i guess you are a stupid boy and on the mountaintop you did a very good thing i did what i had to do perhaps czernobog walked to the old wooden sideboard and bending down pulled an attach case from underneath it he flipped the catches on the case each one sprang back with a satisfying thump he opened the case he took a hammer out and hefted it experimentally the hammer looked like a scaleddown sledgehammer its wooden haft was stained then he stood up he said i owe you much more than you know because of you things are changing this is springtime the true spring i know what i did said shadow i didnt have a lot of choice czernobog nodded there was a look in his eyes that shadow did not remember seeing before did i ever tell you about my brother bielebog shadow walked to the center of the ashstained carpet he went down on his knees you said you hadnt seen him in a long time yes said the old man raising the hammer it has been a long winter boy a very long winter but the winter is ending now and he shook his head slowly as if he were remembering something and he said close your eyes american gods shadow closed his eyes and raised his head and he waited the head of the sledgehammer was cold icy cold and it touched his forehead as gently as a kiss pock there said czernobog is done there was a smile on his face that shadow had never seen before an easy comfortable smile like sunshine on a summers day the old man walked over to the case and he put the hammer away and closed the bag and pushed it back under the sideboard czernobog asked shadow then are you czernobog yes for today said the old man by tomorrow it will all be bielebog but today is still czernobog then why why didnt you kill me when you could the old man took out an unfiltered cigarette from a packet in his pocket he took a large box of matches from the mantelpiece and lit the cigarette with a match he seemed deep in thought because said the old man after some time there is blood but there is also gratitude and it has been a long long winter shadow got to his feet there were dusty patches on the knees of his jeans where he had knelt and e brushed the dust away thanks he said youre welcome said the old man next time you want to play checkers you know where to find me this time i play white thanks maybe i will said shadow but not for a while he looked into the old mans twinkling eyes and he wondered if they had always been that cornflower shade of blue they shook hands and neither of them said goodbye shadow kissed zorya utrennyaya on the cheek on his way out and he kissed zorya vechernyaya on the back of her hand and he took the stairs out of that place two at a time postscript reykjavik in iceland is a strange city even for those who have seen many strange cities it is a volcanic citythe heat for the city comes from deep underground there are tourists but not as many of them as you might expect not even in early july the sun was shining as it had shone for weeks now it ceased shining for an hour or two in the small hours of the morning there would be a dusky dawn of sorts between two and three in the morning and then the day would begin once more the big tourist had walked most of reykjavik that morning listening to people talk in a language that had changed little in a thousand years the natives here could read the ancient sagas as easily as they could read a newspaper there was a sense of continuity on this island that scared him and that he found desperately reassuring he was very tired the unending daylight had made sleep almost impossible and he had sat in his hotel room through the whole long nightless night alternately reading a guidebook and bleak house a novel he had bought in an airport in the last few weeks but which airport he could no longer remember sometimes he had stared out of the window finally the clock as well as the sun proclaimed it morning he bought a bar of chocolate at one of the many candy stores and walked the sidewalk occasionally finding himself reminded of the volcanic nature of iceland he would turn a corner and notice for a moment a sulfurous quality to the air it put him in mind not of hades but of rotten eggs american gods many of the women he passed were very beautiful slender and pale the kind of women that wednesday had liked shadow wondered what could have attracted wednesday to shadows mother who had been beautiful but had been neither of those things shadow smiled at the pretty women because they made him feel pleasantly male and he smiled at the other women too because he was having a good time he was not sure when he became aware that he was being observed somewhere on his walk through reykjavik he became certain that someone was watching him he would turn from time to time trying to get a glimpse of who it was and he would stare into store windows and out at the reflected street behind him but he saw no one out of the ordinary no one who seemed to be observing him he went into a small restaurant where he ate smoked puffin and cloudberries and arctic char and boiled potatoes and he drank cocacola which tasted sweeter more sugary than he remembered it tasting back in the states when the waiter brought his bill he said excuse me you are american yes then happy fourth of july said the waiter he looked pleased with himself shadow had not realized that it was the fourth independence day yes he liked the idea of independence he left the money and a tip on the table and walked outside there was a cool breeze coming in off the atlantic and he buttoned up his coat he sat down on a grassy bank and looked at the city that surrounded him and thought one day he would have to go home and one day he would have to make a home to go back to he wondered whether home was a thing that happened to a place after a while or if it was something that you found in the end if you simply walked and waited and willed it long enough neil caiman an old man came striding across the hillside toward him he wore a dark gray cloak ragged at the bottom as if he had done a lot of traveling and he wore a broadbrimmed blue hat with a seagull feather tucked into the band at a jaunty angle he looked like an aging hippie thought shadow or a longretired gunfighter the old man was ridiculously tall the man squatted beside shadow on the hillside he nodded curtly to shadow he had a piratical black eyepatch over one eye and a jutting white chinbeard shadow wondered if the man was going to hit him up for a cigarette hvernig gengur manst u eftir mer said the old man im sorry said shadow i dont speak icelandic then he said awkwardly thephrase he had learned from his phrase book in the daylight of the small hours of that morning eg tola bora ensku i speak only english and then american the old man noddedslowly he said my people went from here to america a long time ago they went there and then they returned to iceland they said it was a good place for men but a bad place for gods and without their gods they felt too alone his english was fluent but the pauses and the beats of the sentences were strange shadow looked at him closeup the man seemed older than shadow had imagined possible his skin was lined with tiny wrinkles and cracks like the cracks in granite the old man said i do know you boy you do you and i we have walked the same path i also hung on the tree for nine days a sacrifice of myself to myself i am the lord of the acs i am the god of the gallows you are odin said shadow the man nodded thoughtfully as if weighing up the name they call me many things but yes i am odin bors son he said i saw you die said shadow i stood vigil for your american gods body you tried to destroy so much for power you would have sacrificed so much for yourself you did that i did not do that wednesday did he was you he was me yes but i am not him the man scratched the side of his nose his gullfeather bobbed will you go back asked the lord of the gallows to america nothing to go back for said shadow and as he said it he knew it was a lie things wait for you there said the old man but they will wait until you return a white butterfly flew crookedly past them shadow said nothing he had had enough of gods and their ways to last him several lifetimes he would take the bus to the airport he decided and change his ticket get a plane to somewhere he had never been he would keep moving hey said shadow i have something for you his hand dipped into his pocket and palmed the object he needed hold your hand out he said odin looked at him strangely and seriously then he shrugged and extended his right hand palm down shadow reached over and turned it so the palm was upward he opened his own hands showed them one after the other to be completely empty then he pushed the glass eye into the leathery palm of the old mans hand and left it there how did you do that magic said shadow without smiling the old man grinned and laughed and clapped his hands together he looked at the eye holding it between finger and thumb and nodded as if he knew exactly what it was and then he slipped it into a leather bag that hung by his waist takk kcerlega i shall take care of this youre welcome said shadow he stood up brushed the grass from his jeans neil caiman again said the lord of asgard with an imperious motion of his head his voice deep and commanding more do again you people said shadow youre never satisfied okay this is one i learned from a guy whos dead now he reached into nowhere and took a gold coin from the air it was a normal sort of gold coin it couldnt bring back the dead or heal the sick but it was a gold coin sure enough and thats all there is he said displaying it between finger and thumb thats all she wrote he tossed the coin into the air with a flick of his thumb it spun golden at the top of its arc in the sunlight and it glittered and glinted and hung there in the midsummer sky as if it was never going to come down maybe it never would shadow didnt wait to see he walked away and he kept on walking
