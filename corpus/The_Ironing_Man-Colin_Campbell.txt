 chapter one the fridge door marina looked at the fridge for a moment and then read out the list of words written on the fridge door washing up after a meal vacuum cleaning ironing cleaning shopping this was her top five it was a bit like the top ten on the radio you know the best selling records of the week the only difference was that her top five was actually her bottom five let me explain the thing that was top of her list was actually the thing she hated doing the most sometimes it was very difficult to decide which one of the five she really hated the most then she might put two things in first place or three things sometimes she really wanted to put them all in first place she hated all of them she hated all kinds of housework full stop there were just two reasons why she did not put everything in first place reason one the fridge door was not wide enough reason two changing the top five was one of the only things that she enjoyed doing in the kitchen it gave her the time to make a cup of coffee and drink it slowly and it gave her time to think sometimes she played a game with herself and moved the letters around to make other words words describing more interesting activities like move out of the village go back to london find a job and meet funloving people the idea of the game was to use all the letters on the fridge to make new words once she used nearly all of them but then found that the letters she had left spelt out the words leave tom she put the letters back as they had been she hated housework but she loved tom she did not want to leave him tom and marina had been married now for almost three years the first two and a half years in london wonderful london fun london thingstodo and peopletomeet london toofarawaylondon they now lived in a small village called felton near cambridge they had lived here in the middle of nowhere land for ninetytwo days and looking at the clock four hours thirtyeight minutes she looked again at the fridge door the letters had little magnets on the back so that when you put them on anything metal they stayed there marina thought about what other people did with them leave little messages for their husbands and wives like dear bill your dinner is in the cooker i am in the west indies or the cat ran away from home i have decided to join him when tom had seen the list of words marina had put on the fridge door he smiled and said so this is your things to do list good idea and then he added there are two u s in vacuum when she explained to tom about her top five he thought for a moment then he looked sad and put his arm around her oh you poor thing im sorry i know its difficult for you to get used to living here but you are not too unhappy are you give it a little time maybe you could find something to do get a job in the village have coffee mornings for the other women start playing golf tom was making another list for her and she soon stopped listening he enjoyed making lists things to do at work things to do at home things to read he even made lists of other lists he would like to make when he had more time when they could not decide how to spend their bank holidays he would make a list of things they could do sometimes he spent the day just making a list of what they could do by the time he had finished it was too late to go anywhere or do anything this did not really matter as it always seemed to rain on bank holidays anyway he made lists of places they could visit he made lists of restaurants they could stop at on the way to those places he made lists of things they could eat at those restaurants lists of friends they could invite to their house for dinner this last list was very short they had no friends in the village there was noone of their age in the village everyone was older even the grandchildren of the people who lived in the village were probably older than they were tom went through his list of things she could do in the village marina did not speak he talked she listened he made lists she listened but she did think about what he was saying and the lists he made find a job in the village there was one shop in the village there was also a cafe that opened in the summer mrs pringlesmythe was the manager of both of these places and she didnt seem to need anyone else not many people lived in the village and not many people passed through the village and no tourists came to the village well tourists came to the village if they had lost their way so the shop and the cafe were not very busy and there was nowhere else in the village to work coffee mornings the women in the village probably enjoyed coffee mornings the women she had met always enjoyed talking about the weather they got very excited talking about the weather they often compared the weather now with the weather when they were young many many years ago for example the women would say oh its not like it used to be when we were young it was always hot in summer long hot summer days do you remember susan how hot it used to be of course i do sally and the winters were lovely too short cold days and there was always snow on christmas day but now well you never know what the weathers going to be like do you its the end of the world or the women got sad and sometimes almost angry as they talked about how the village had changed and all the changes were bad changes marina had no idea what they were talking about nothing had changed in the village since tom and marina had come to live here well that was not quite true there was a new sign for the national lottery outside the village shop now the women were probably thinking about that nothing else had changed since queen victoria had passed through the village as a young child almost two hundred years ago her driver was new and they had got very lost start playing golf for marina if there was one thing she did not understand about men and actually there were many things she did not understand about men it was why they got so excited running after balls little balls big balls round balls not quite round balls soft balls hard balls and when they were tired of running after balls or too old to run they walked slowly after balls balls she looked again at the fridge door poor tom he was so busy with his new job that he did not see how bored she was becoming how unhappy she was she put ironing at the top of the list on the fridge then she walked over to the ironing board which stood in the corner of the kitchen she picked up a shirt and looked at it she could not remember if she had already ironed this one she probably had ironed it but it still looked as if someone had been playing football with it balls she thought and smiled to herself she looked at the shirt again she remembered once ironing a shirt first she ironed one side then she turned it over and ironed the other side but when she turned the shirt over again it still looked as if it needed ironing she probably spent half an hour ironing the same shirt before she realised what she was doing now that was her idea of a bad time marina stopped smiling as she remembered this she looked at the small mountain of clothes on the floor waiting to be ironed actually it was not a small mountain at all it was small in the same way that mount everest is small how could two people have so many clothes and why did they always need ironing and why oh why could she not find someone else to do this boring ironing for her and who and who was that at the door chapter two the ironing man when the door bell rang marina did three things firstly she did nothing because noone ever rang the door bell noone came to visit noone came at all so she did not believe it was ringing secondly she put the iron down on top of the shirt she was ironing and looked up thirdly she walked to the door she walked slowly carefully and quietly she looked through the small hole in the middle of the door there was someone there someone was standing outside her front door she could not see if it was a man or a woman because the hole was in the middle of the door she could not see a face but there was definitely someone there she looked again through the hole and then jumped as the bell rang again she tried to remember what to do when this happened when they had lived in london she had just opened the door and not really thought too much about it but in london people very often rang the door bell here in the village it almost never happened people did not visit each other people did not go from house to house selling things who could it be maybe it was a wrong number no wrong numbers were just on the telephone werent they the door bell rang again it rang the same way not more impatient than the last time not more impatient than the first time she thought of the film on television she had watched the night before it was a horror film about dead people who come back to life in a small village a young woman is alone in the old dark house on a night when the rain comes down like a river and the wind shakes the trees and the windows the lights suddenly go out and there is a loud knock at the door and then another knock and another heavier than before the young woman goes to the door and asks whos there in a shaking voice but before the words have left her mouth the door opens and the but this was not a film and it wasnt raining and anyway marina did not really believe in the living dead not in the middle of the day anyway when it was light outside the door bell rang again and this time marina opened the door he was quite tall goodlooking very goodlooking and he was wearing jeans and a white tshirt and he had a smile that you only see at the cinema or on television hello hello ive come to do the ironing for you he said marina smiled at him then she stopped smiling and looked at him then she smiled at him again and turned her head to one side just a little because she did not want to look away from this face this smile then she stopped smiling again and tried very hard to think of what to say next finally it came to her sorry and then she thought of something else youve come to do what the man continued to smile at her and explained you wanted someone to do your ironing for you he said you hate doing ironing you made a wish remember about your ironing thats why i am here the conversation might have continued like this for some time but suddenly the smell of burning shirt reached them and they both ran into the kitchen chapter three teddy bears make poor soldiers the smell of burning shirt had almost gone already most of the smell had gone with the shirt which the ironing man had carried out to the garden marina had acted very quickly when they ran back to the kitchen she had picked up the goldfish bowl and emptied it over the burning shirt she remembered to move the iron away first it was not a real goldfish in the bowl marina liked animals too much to throw one on top of a burning shirt there were other things to throw like the mineral water that tom kept in the fridge the mineral water tom kept in the fridge was always the same kind it was still water not sparkling it was irish not french it came in glass bottles not plastic bottles tom knew what he liked and he never changed the things he liked the goldfish however was plastic and so marina did throw him and the water on the burning shirt as he was a plastic goldfish he did not show any great surprise to find himself lying on the floor the little key in his side was turning around slowly if you turned the key a few times and returned the fish to the water he swam around the bowl he opened and closed his mouth trying to take in all the air that plastic goldfish do not actually need marina had bought him in a shop in london as a present for her nephew but then she had decided to keep the goldfish herself and he had soon become very important for her she sometimes stood and watched him swimming round and round once tom had surprised her in the kitchen watching the goldfish she was opening and closing her mouth at the same time as the fish and repeating in a soft voice i know how you feel i know how you feel i know how you feel so the smell in the kitchen now was not burning shirt but coffee fresh coffee that she had made for herself slowly and with love she was now drinking the coffee slowly enjoying every drop the ironing man had gone the shirts were ironed and sitting on the bed one on top of another normally marina just pushed them into a cupboard beside the bed happy not to have to look at them any more happy to see the mountain of clothes disappear into something as small as the cupboard but these shirts were so beautifully ironed they looked just the way they do when you buy them in the shops that she did not want to put them away in the cupboard so she left them on the bed where tom would see them when he came home he would love it she looked forward to when he came back tom would not realise that one shirt was missing he had a lot of shirts and they were all the same they were all white with a thin blue stripe all his suits were dark grey and all his jackets were dark blue all his shoes were black except the ones he used for walking which were brown this way of doing things made life easier as tom once explained to marina i get up in the morning i put on a shirt i put on a suit i put on my shoes and i dont have to think about what im doing i dont have to make decisions about what i am going to wear because i always wear the same things its quick its easy and i save so much time tom was very pleased with this way of getting dressed he never said anything openly about it but he really thought marina should do the same thing he thought she wasted time every day when marina got up she first had to think about how she was feeling and then decide what blouses and skirts and colours and materials matched those feelings she wanted her clothes to say something about her and about how she was feeling that day it took her a long time to get dressed what a waste of time but tom took three minutes to get dressed every day three minutes no tom would not notice that one white shirt with a blue stripe was missing marina did not have to worry about that she could continue to enjoy wasting more time over this cup of coffee listening to the piano music on the radio and looking out the window at the garden the garden was new like the house but there was a difference the house looked finished it did not look very interesting in fact it looked like all the other twentythree houses on the street that had been built at the same time but at least the house did look as if someone had planned it and it did look finished the garden did not noone had planned this garden this garden was still waiting for someone to plan it still waiting for someone with green fingers you know someone who is good with plants and flowers or maybe it was just waiting for someone with a pair of working hands marina and tom had planted some grass in the garden when they first came to the village and bits of grass were coming through here and there but not i am sad to say everywhere the garden looked a bit like the beard tom had tried to grow as a student parts of it were really quite good with lots of hair but other parts had no hair at all the parts with hair looked like a coconut and the parts without hair looked a bit like an egg but well eggs and coconuts do not normally go together so toms beard did not really look like a beard and this garden did not really look like a garden marina saw a butterfly flying in the garden she was not surprised that the butterfly seemed to be flying straight through the garden not finding anything beautiful to look at no flowers to rest on she loved the way butterflies flew no straight lines no hurrying to get somewhere up and down and backwards and forwards then the butterfly stopped he didnt stop in the garden but he had decided to come and sit on the window and look at marina she looked at him sitting on the window looking in he moved his wings as if to say hello and when marina did not answer the butterfly decided to send a message in code at least that is how it seemed to marina the butterfly hit the window first with one wing and then with the other as if he really was sending a message the problem was that marina did not understand the code the butterfly was sending she did not understand any code for sending messages sometimes she thought she was not very good at communicating at all in any language she certainly did not think she was good at communicating with tom any more once when she was at school she had almost learnt morse code she had joined a kind of junior army for schoolchildren her parents could not believe it you want to be a soldier you want to play with guns her mother asked with a look that marina knew well the look said where is the little girl i used to know i like the uniform you know the jacket and the trousers they are really great marina explained and the boots are nice too she added her mother still looked as if she did not believe any of this and the boys her mother asked thinking that maybe her fifteen year old daughter was beginning to show an interest in boys at last nothings perfect said marina with a smile but she soon had a fight with one of the teachers they were going on a training exercise and had to carry heavy bags on their backs marinas bag was a little heavier than anyone elses teddy goes everywhere with me she answered when the teacher asked her what she was doing with a teddy bear on the top of her bag ill take care of him she continued you will not take care of him the teacher said you will not take him anywhere do you understand me this is a serious exercise it is not for children and training exercises are not a place for toys i repeat do you understand me you look stupid you will make us all look stupid and what is most important you will make me look stupid marina did not want to say that the teacher already looked stupid but it was probably a good time for her and the bear to leave the junior army even if it meant she never learnt morse code and could not understand the messages the butterfly was sending she reached out to the butterfly she put her hand on the window and hit her fingers against the window sending out little messages to the butterfly they continued like this for some time fingers and wings knocking against the window both of them happy to rest there and watch each other for a while what did the butterfly think of her living in this house living between these four walls did he know about the straight lines that people lived along school university job family friends boyfriends husband children room flat house bigger house bigger house with garden did the butterfly ask itself why she did not fly like him here and there and up and down and backwards and forwards moving where it wanted when it wanted marina looked at the butterfly and asked herself the same questions then she remembered something else she had read in a newspaper something about an idea that everything in the world is joined together if you change one thing then this will change other things as well she remembered the example they talked about a butterfly lands on a flower somewhere in the east part of the world and this changes something else and then something else changes and then something else and something else until finally there is an earthquake in another part of the world in the west thousands of miles away marina looked at the butterfly and asked him what changes will you bring to my life will there be an earthquake somewhere in the world because you stopped to visit me today will there be an earthquake in my life she smiled at her own thoughts and then opened her hand on her side of the window she invited the butterfly to come in and sit on her hand but the butterfly disappeared as the front door opened and tom came into the house at first she was still so lost in her conversation with the butterfly that she did not realise what was happening but then she did she realised that tom was home and she remembered everything that had happened to her that day the stranger who had offered to do the ironing and the butterfly who had stopped to talk through the window that was a lot to happen in one day she could not remember another day since they had moved to the village when so much had happened everything came back to her suddenly and like a child like the child she was still happy to be like the child most of us have forgotten we ever were she ran towards the door jumping from one foot to another she ran to tell tom everything to share it all with tom she didnt think for a moment that there was anything strange about her day not a thought her only thought was to tell him all about it after all things do not seem real until we tell someone else about them do they and marina wanted this day to be real and so she told tom she told him everything chapter four good bad the next morning after marina had told tom everything about her day tom made his usual trip to work in london he drove to cambridge station and found a table all to himself on the train to london he was worried that someone would arrive and sit opposite this would leave tom no room for his mobile phone his laptop computer and his financial times or his cappuccino from the french cafe at the station but then the train left the station and he could relax a table all to himself this was a good start to the day he should write this down immediately he took out the small notebook he kept in his jacket pocket and opened it this was his good and bad book in this book he wrote down all the good and all the bad things that happened to him every day of his life at the end of the day he could see what kind of day it really had been if there were more good things than bad things it was a good day if there were more bad than good things it was a bad day easy before he was married a girlfriend had once asked him what happens if you have one good thing and seven bad things but the one good thing is really wonderful and the seven bad things are really not important wouldnt that be a good day then tom had thought about that for a while but not for too long he really did not think he would be with this girlfriend much longer anyway so he did not want to waste time that would make it too difficult he said and anyway if something wonderful happens to you then everything you do that day is wonderful so you write down lots more good things because everything seems good to you like when you are in love you know and everything seems wonderful he had sat back and smiled when he said that he was pleased with his answer he liked the middle part of his answer he thought it was very intelligent he thought it might even be true which was another good thing he was not so happy about the last part when he had started talking about love he realised that his girlfriend began to smile at him it was a really wide and open smile and then she took his hand she looked at him with eyes that were impossibly big and said oh tom she thought he was talking about them about him and her about them being in love tom shook his head as he remembered all this the picture of his girlfriends face disappeared well they had stopped going out soon after that they just did not understand each other he came back to the present and looked at his notebook he wrote the date at the top of an empty page and drew a big thick line down the middle of the page from top to bottom on the left side he wrote good at the top of the page and on the other side he wrote bad then he wrote seat and table to myself on train to london under good of course he smiled looked out of the window smiled again and then looked back at the notebook at what he had written the day before there were seven things under good and only one thing under bad he looked at them good fouhd a good place to pack the car finished my report gave my report to the boss before brian did boss laughed at my joke it was a joke that toms nephew told him but it was one of the ten year olds more adult jokes showed the boss how to use the new photocopier got a new phone with three lines boss left office before me and said working late tom good man with a smile what a day what a day he looked at the bad column bad marina he had written this late last night he had not had time to write any more than this he had not really understood what was going on he had wanted to sleep on it think about it that had not helped well it had helped a little because he had forgotten about it when he was sleeping and until this moment he had still forgotten about it but now it was coming back and it felt like how did it feel it felt like someone had thrown a big bowl of very cold water over him on a hot day when he was not expecting it when he was looking somewhere else that is how it felt as he remembered last night and the conversation he had had with marina or rather what marina had talked to him about because tom had said very little he went over the conversation again in his head the way he understood it of course hi marina how are you hi tom have a good day yeah soso he had not had time then to check his notebook so he did not tell her what a good day it actually had been and then he had asked her about hers the way you do you know like this what about you how was your day well you ask these things but of course what you expect to hear is yeah fine oryeah ok oryeah so so and that is usually it you can go on and do something else change your clothes take a shower put your feet up turn the television on maybe even open a beer if it has been a really good day or open a beer if it has been a really bad day you do not expect this kind of answer wonderful great ive had a wonderful day you wont believe it she had said it exactly like that in capital letters great and with exclamation marks she then told him a story about a man who had come to the house done the ironing for her and had stayed a while to talk to her and drink a coffee with her this man did not give his name and did not explain how he knew she was doing the ironing he did not ask for any money or give her any other information about who he worked for or anything it was mad tom could not understand it it did not make any sense secondly marina had told tom about a conversation she had had with a butterfly ok she had told this story with a smile and a laugh but it still seemed strange to tom tom did not use a lot of words and did not easily share them with anyone least of all with animals finally when tom had gone very quiet marina told him that she was going up to london on thursday to meet a friend when tom had asked who she was going to meet she had not answered at first and then she said joanne tom had asked joanne searle because this was the only joanne they knew and marina had replied yes isnt that nice she phoned me a total surprise a total surprise was right tom knew joanne he had worked with her in london for three years but he also knew as marina clearly did not know that joanne had given up her job six months ago and had gone to live with a group of buddhists in nepal ive had enough of running around trying to get somewhere joanne had told him before leaving for nepal because when you get there you cant remember why you wanted to be there in the first place im going to learn to be happy being who i am and where i am joanne was going to spend three years three months and three days learning how to meditate she had not organised a going away party and clearly marina did not even know she had gone away tom looked out of the window of the train for a moment and then looked back at his list of bad things and wrote some more notes under marina like this ironing man butterfly joanne then he wrote is marina going mad is my wife seeing another man maybe yesterday had not been such a good day after all chapter five strangers on a train tom was still sitting on the train when his mobile phone rang someone from his office he answered it his mobile phone rang again someone from the office again he answered it his mobile phone rang again someone from the mobile phone company asking if he was happy with his mobile phone normally tom loved his mobile phone he could be in touch with the world at any time if he was out of the office he could tell them where he was and what he was doing even if his boss could not see him tom could always talk to him tom remembered his mother saying that little children should be seen but not heard but tom knew that to get anywhere in business you either had to be seen or heard all the time usually both now however he was not so happy with his mobile phone he was trying to think he was trying to think about marina and the phone calls were making it impossible to think he went to the toilet he did not need to go but he had found out on his last train journey that for some reason he did not understand his mobile phone did not work in the toilet he had discovered this because he had walked into the toilet with his mobile in his hand talking to someone not his boss thank god and the phone stopped working the minute he got inside and closed the door tom had thought the train was in a tunnel he had looked out of the little window they have in train toilets the one that looks like there is ice all over it but they were not in a tunnel he tried to phone the person back but his phone would not work then the moment he stepped out of the toilet the phone rang so tom went to the toilet so he would have time to think on his way there he suddenly remembered how his father used to spend hours in the toilet when tom was a child maybe his father had also been looking for somewhere to think and so he sat and the phone did not ring and he tried to think but he could not get any further than ironing man is martha going mad is my wife seeing another man butterfly going mad joanne searle another man why would marina say she was going to meet joanne in london if joanne was in nepal who was she going to meet if something was going on between her and this ironing man person would she tell tom about it well maybe she was not sure if she was going to go out with this man or not maybe she just wanted to see what tom would say or do when he heard the story tom had said and done very little when he heard the story maybe she was just going mad because she was so bored at home in the village what was she going to do in london that was the question this question was still going around in toms head as he returned to his seat tom was not very happy when he saw that a man was now sitting on the other side of the table tom could not see his face because the man was reading a newspaper and was holding the newspaper in front of him tom sat down and looked at the back page of the newspaper the man went on reading tom did not like this newspaper tom did not think it was a newspaper at all what news the paper was full of big photographs big headlines big well big everything as if the readers had forgotten their glasses or were just learning to read at university tom and his friends used to play a game in groups with this newspaper each group had three minutes to read the newspaper and then another person would ask both the groups questions about what was in it the groups with men always remembered the name of the girl on page three there was always a girl on page three and she was almost never fully dressed and men always seemed to remember her name but then in three minutes you could actually read all of this newspaper from the front page to the back page and still have time to look at the photograph of the girl on page three and then look at her again and perhaps again so tom very quickly got bored reading the back page of the newspaper he did not however feel like working he noticed another newspaper lying on the table in front of him the man had clearly brought this one as well it was his village newspaper which tom did not normally read because it was so boring it always had stories about people getting married and stories about lost cats and the problem of ducks from the village crossing the main road to get to a river on the other side of the road the headline read save our ducks build bridge there were a lot of headlines like that in the village newspaper but maybe it was better to read a newspaper and not think about marina not think at all the man was still reading the other newspaper so tom looked through the village paper quickly hoping to find something of interest not a lot something about a bank manager who had lost all his hair and had now asked the bank workers to shout at him as often as possible the manager had read somewhere that this might make his hair grow again something about the village school sports day something about a man who had grown the biggest cucumber in england second biggest in the world but his wife had still left him tom looked up at the man across the table but the man was still reading the newspaper still holding it in front of him he did not seem to have turned a page since tom had sat down was he sleeping a slow reader noone could read that slowly tom went back to the village newspaper and started looking through the small advertisements advertisements for houses advertisements for cars advertisements for different kinds of services suddenly one advertisement jumped off the page at tom do you know where your wifehusband really is when they say they are just visiting a friend are you worried that maybe they have found someone else tom could not believe it the questions in the advertisement were the same questions he had been asking himself about marina it was as if the advertisement was speaking directly to him he looked again at the advertisement it was for a private detective there was a phone number a mobile phone number and a promise bring me your problems and i will give you answers fast and noone else will ever know the idea of using a private detective had never entered toms head he had seen private detectives on television usually american ones usually in california but private detectives in england advertisements for private detectives in toms village newspaper beside the story about the ducks crossing the road it did not seem possible but maybe this was the way of finding out what was going on with marina maybe this was the way of finding out who she was going to meet in london tom put the newspaper down and put a line under the phone number with his pen picked up his phone and rang the number almost immediately he heard another phone ring but for some strange reason he could hear it ringing in both his ears he moved the phone away from his ear but could still hear it ringing he could hear it ringing through his own phone and from behind the newspaper of the man sitting opposite him the man opposite put his newspaper down and looked at tom i see you have found my advertisement he said with a big smile chapter six massage and message marina sat looking at the letters on the fridge door the letters clearly spelt out the word london but she had no idea who had moved the letters around to make this word she had not moved the letters not since the day the ironing man came she had seen the word when she was talking to tom telling him about her day tom had not seemed very interested in the story of her day and had been very quiet as she had told him all about the ironing man and the butterfly he had even looked away from her as she told the story and then she had looked away from him and had seen the word london on the fridge door so suddenly she had told him she was going up to london to see a friend on thursday she had no idea where the idea came from but even as she said it she got very excited about it why did she say she was visiting someone called joanne she did not really know of course joanne was the name of their friend when tom said joanne searles name marina had agreed with him and that was it marina was going to london to see joanne on thursday and now it was thursday and marina was sitting at home looking at the fridge door with no idea of what she was going to do marina was so excited about going up to london she had not slept well it was only when she got up in the morning that she realised that she had no plans to go anywhere that the idea of london had come from nowhere and that nowhere was probably where she was going today she felt very empty now that the chance of getting away from the village from the house and from the housework for a day had disappeared she put her hands around the back of her neck this made her feel a little better when she had been a child her mother had always touched marinas back and neck when she was feeling sad it always made her feel better she loved to be touched even the touch of her own hands made her feel better but someone else touching her someone giving her a massage oh that was wonderful that was the most wonderful thing in the world well one of the most wonderful things in the world the door bell rang and marina ran to answer it she was hoping that the ironing man had come back but it was a woman who stood there a young woman about her own age with blonde hair like her own and a big smile i know you have no idea who i am the woman said my names tracy i am a beauty consultant and masseuse your friend phoned me and asked me to come and give you a surprise massage marina laughed out loud you know who phoned me then the woman asked i think so did he give a name marina asked the ironing man im sure you know what that means and she laughed again i like a man with a bit of iron in him too they laughed together as they walked into the living room tracy quickly put up the massage table she had brought with her is this table safe asked marina i havent killed anyone yet tracy laughed tracy took some little candles from her bag and lit them they gave off a sweet smell of flowers would you like some music i have some cds with me to help you relax please tracy found the cd player and soon the room was full of the sounds of brazilian rain forests better than travel tracy joked well cheaper anyway the music and the smell of the candles and the light touch of tracy worked their magic on marina and she was soon travelling pictures of holiday places she had visited with tom came back to her now walks along the empty beaches on that small greek island at sunset the journey in egypt over the hills on the backs of donkeys and down to the valley of kings sitting on croagh patrick the mountain in ireland which looks over the atlantic where saint patrick had spent thirty days and nights alone the smells and the sounds in the room seemed to change as she travelled from place to place in her thoughts she smiled to herself with eyes closed and was still smiling some time later when she realised that tracy had finished her massage marina remembered where she was but she did not want to open her eyes to see it she wanted to hold on to the smells and sounds from other places to the pictures of her and tom in those beautiful places and to the touch of tom from other times finally she opened her eyes and saw tracy smiling down at her how was that tracy asked wonderful marina replied told you it was like travelling almost as good as sex and tracy laughed again they sat for a while over a cup of tea and tracy gave marina some of her life story yeah i was married for a while you know usual story boyfriend from school the first and only boyfriend i didnt know any better i thought love was all about giving giving flowers and chocolates and having time for each other and looking into each others eyes for hours and never looking at your watch so anyway we got married and went on holiday to the west indies that was good too that was wonderful but after that it was never the same again end of giving end of having time only for each other end of all the little surprises he thought that after we were married he didnt have to do that any more he thought he didnt have to work at it any more no more surprises the only surprise was when he actually listened to what i was saying or when he didnt look at his watch when i was trying to talk to him its like all those love stories you read or see at the cinema you know they always seem to end when the man and woman finally get together those stories always stop the day they get married i sometimes think its men who actually write those stories not women you know and men dont think about what happens after you get married and maybe women dont either i didnt i had no idea what was going to happen next and my man he didnt know what to do next so he just did what his father had done he went out earned money came home watched television went out again to the pub with his friends suddenly his idea of a good time seemed to be any time he spent without me tracy looked sad and thoughtful for a moment but then her smile and her laugh returned anyway i gave him the push after a while i told him to leave best thing i ever did and now i do things differently i mean one day i might find a man who understands you have to go on working on the love after you get married i mean there must be men like that somewhere dont you think but at the moment what i do is this i just keep them for a little while i meet them they love me they think im wonderful they think the sun shines out of my eyes they give me their time and they give me wonderful presents but when i see they arent romantic anymore then i just let them go i mean if men cant take love seriously then why should we take them seriously just use them and lose them she laughed again and marina laughed with her it was the kind of laugh that invited you to laugh with her i mean the man ive got at the moment tracy continued hes still in love with me he brought me here this morning and he is picking me up later and taking me out for the day for a day of surprises he has taken the day off work to spend it with me can you believe it no reason he just wants to spend the day with me give him another few months and all the surprises will go but hell go as well then lifes too short love know what i mean marina nodded her head yes she knew what tracy meant your ironing man is still romantic anyway isnt he enjoy it while its there love tracy said the door bell rang tracy looked out the window a man was standing beside a car its my boyfriend tracy said my day of surprises begins oh he is lovely though isnt he look at those shoulders that bottom tracy said so strong just looking at him sometimes makes me shake know what i mean we cant live without that can we marina was not sure if tracy was talking about sex or not if she was marina was not so sure it was certainly possible to live without sex for some time even for quite a long time it was toms birthday wasnt it that was the last time a month ago twentynine years old and she was having regular sex regular sex once a month maybe it was time she took a lover the thought surprised her and so did tracy when she spoke oh my god i almost forgot tracy said i have a message from the ironing man your man of iron he says hell meet you in the national gallery at two oclock this afternoon wheres that then in your favourite room he said you know what that means do you i dont like paintings myself well maybe paintings of men with no clothes on of course and she laughed her laugh again youd better hurry up love its almost twelve now tracy ran out the door and kissed her man then he came into the house and took tracys bags to the car marina smiled again and then looked at her watch tracy was right she would have to hurry she ran up the stairs jumping two stairs at a time she could not remember ever moving this fast in this house she did not hear tracys boyfriend drive off she certainly did not hear the second car start and drive off after them the detective smiled to himself good timing he thought he had arrived only ten minutes earlier he had had trouble finding the house well he did not need to tell tom he had trouble all these houses looked the same anyway but he had time to check the number of the house and the garden looked just the way tom had described it like a young mans beard the detective had parked his car a few houses away and turned on the little cassette recorder he had bought that morning he spoke into it i am now outside the house at he looked at the cassette it was not moving he hit it with his large hand it still did not move he wanted to look inside the recorder but his fingers were too thick and he could not open the back of the machine he looked at it sadly he never had any luck with machines he looked at it again and then threw it onto the back seat of the car ill use a pen and paper he said in a loud and angry voice as if he was speaking to the cassette recorder he started to make notes but at that moment he saw that a car was stopping outside the house and as he watched a young goodlooking man got out no time to make notes now he said to himself throwing the pen and the notebook onto the back seat of the car to join the cassette recorder the detective watched the young woman come to the door he remembered the notes he had made when he was talking to tom where were they of course in the notebook he turned round in the car to get the notebook from the back seat this was not easy because he was a big man and it was a small car it took a little time and by the time he had got the book the woman was walking with the man towards their car carrying two bags interesting they stopped and the woman put her hand around the mans head and pulled him into a long kiss very interesting the detective looked at his notes again young twentynine years old slim blonde yes no mistake this was toms wife this was marina the man put the bags into the car the young woman turned and looked at the house and seemed to wave goodbye to it then she turned and kissed the man again as he helped her into the car very very interesting thought the detective as he started the engine of his car and followed the car with toms wife in it down the street chapter seven its just a painting marina arrived at the national gallery in london and went straight to the room where her favourite painting was when tracy had given her the message about the favourite room marina knew immediately where she meant the painting was one that tom had brought her to see on one of their early dates a favourite painting of his it quickly became a favourite of theirs marina stood in front of the painting now and looked up at it the painting was of a woman standing in a room it could be a kitchen it could be a living room a white room with not much furniture but with a beautiful light coming in through the window above and behind the woman the light falls on the back of the womans head she is in her midtwenties blonde with her hair tied up behind her head in a white scarf she is clearly going to have a baby soon she is holding a letter in one hand and the second hand rests on her stomach she is reading the letter and there is a quiet smile on her face as she reads it is a wonderfully calm painting because of the light the stillness of the woman and her smile tom and marina had sat in front of this painting for twenty minutes when they first came to see it what do you think he had asked its beautiful she had replied in those days they could sit together for twenty minutes or even longer without saying anything to each other and yet still feel very close to each other on their first dates tom had talked so much that there was never any quiet time between them he had wanted her to see that he was a nice man that he was funny and intelligent so he talked and talked about himself but she had wanted him to ask her questions to show that he was interested in her and not only in himself it did not happen tom gave her his full life story or the good parts anyway and he even told her about his earlier girlfriends saying what had gone wrong what he had done wrong but there were no questions and there were no quiet moments later as their love developed they could be quiet together looking at each other looking at a painting looking at the sea looking at children playing in the park they could be quiet and yet be with each other feel very close to each other we sometimes use words to build a wall around ourselves and sometimes saying nothing can be a way of letting people come really close to us so in those days when tom and marina said nothing to each other their silence spoke of their love for each other now there was not so much silence between them she spoke and he made noises to show he was listening they were usually little noises and she thought that sometimes he was thinking of something else they were not noises that invited her to say more there was little of that old quietness there was quietness in the painting too just the woman reading her letter who do you think the letters from tom asked her man marina said tom and marina had once played a game with toms nephew rob in front of this painting rob was ten years old and loved to be with them because they were adults who liked to play games and who did not talk to him as if he were a child in the game they each had to say who they thought the letter was from and what it said her husband her sons school report its from her doctor she has to come to the hospital for a checkup the winner was the person who had the most ideas tom won of course although marina and rob did not like some of his ideas a chance to win world cup tickets a letter from her old lover a bill from her garage a dear john letter rob did not understand this tom explained it was during the war it was the kind of letter that some soldiers got when they had been away from home for a long time a letter from their girlfriends saying dear john i have found someone else they called them dear john letters but shes a woman rob said ok maybe shes just written a dear john letter and shes reading it again to check for spelling mistakes they didnt have computers with spell checks then you know no no marina said and laughed hes away youre right that part is true but its like this its from her husband and hes away looking for a present to give her when the baby is born he wants to find something that no man has ever given a woman before hes travelled around europe and is now in africa hes writing to tell her he has found something almost as beautiful as she is almost as beautiful as the light that came into their bedroom the first morning they lay in bed together as a married couple and he says that he will be back home soon and that even though he is far away when she reads this letter it will be as if he is there with her and that soon they will lie together again in that beautiful light tom sat and looked at marina his mouth and eyes wide open his eyes were the size of dinner plates and he said wow rob too although he made a joke about shopping for presents being easier now with the internet was looking at marina with wide eyes and probably thinking something like i want to marry you dont even think about it tom said to his nephew reading the look on his face yes this was an important painting for tom and marina they came back to it now and again just to check on their feelings for each other they had not been to see the painting for over a year youre right a voice said behind her back she knew it was the ironing man it is from her husband and it is a letter of love but come with me i want to show you another painting the ironing man took her by the hand and they walked through the gallery from room to room slowly moving from one century of paintings to another he knew where he was going finally they stopped in front of a large painting it was not an old painting but it told an old story there were three people in the painting in the middle was a man dressed in expensive clothes looking out from the painting looking important holding his head high smiling with a look that says i have everything now in front of him there is another person its difficult to tell if it is a man or woman this person is dressed in white and is not looking at the man he is looking behind the rich man there are big houses expensive cars beautiful women everywhere everything is expensive everything says this man is rich this man is important this man has the world in his hands but the person in white looks sad what is it marina asked what do you think marina looked again at the painting she now saw a third person in the painting standing behind the smiling rich man almost completely in the dark he is also smiling but it is not a friendly smile it is a smile that says what you have is nothing i will come for you and you can do nothing to stop me your money will not help you noone will be able to help you when i come for you i will come for you as i will come for all men this third person is death marina asked the ironing man nodded and the person in white marina thought a little and then turned and smiled at the ironing man i think the person in white is like you she said i think he has given the man in the painting three wishes and i think the man has asked for money and and all these cars and houses and things she looked back at the painting but now death has come for the man and all of these things mean nothing the ironing man smiled at marina and you have already given me two wishes marina said the ironing man and the massage and i have one more wish the ironing man nodded again and you want me to think carefully about it she added he nodded again and she thought some more and if i asked you to bring tom back to me marina said to make it like it used to be between us to make it like it was when we used to sit here and look at the painting of the lady and the letter could you do that and then what would happen asked the ironing man what has happened between you if you and tom were closer again maybe the same thing would just happen again what do you want marina what do you really want i want tom and me to work hard at making our love grow and continue to grow marina said i know we can do it i think we have just lost our way a bit i love him and i know he loves me but we have forgotten how to work at it can you give me that you have to do that yourself the ironing man said but maybe i could give you both some time together a little holiday perhaps and maybe i can help tom remember just how much you mean to him how much he really loves you could you do that marina asked i think i already have the ironing man thought for a moment and then continued i think i have already started something i think something may already be happening he smiled at marina and she smiled back i am sure you can do it mr ironing man she said and then she thought of something and her smile disappeared she looked at him with a question but that will be four wishes wont it she asked you will help tom to remember and give us time to ourselves do i get four wishes you know marina said the ironing man everything is going up these days the price of everything is going up even the number of wishes you get is going up marina laughed again and looked at him can i buy you a drink she asked he shook his head slowly you people i mean you you dont drink you cant marina said slowly no its not that the ironing man said i just thought dinner was probably a better idea ill pay but you choose the restaurant italian i think thats my wish chapter eight the detective reports tom was leaving the office when his mobile phone rang he looked at it and then turned and looked at the office building behind him he could not believe it the only people who phoned him on his mobile were people from work he was just leaving work and they were phoning him already he thought about not answering it marina did not like the mobile phone for some reason she had only phoned him once on it when she had locked herself out of the house without the key but perhaps it was her he answered it hello is that dr watson a voice asked tom knew at once it was the detective the detective had said it was better not to use their real names when they talked on the phone you can never be too careful on the phone the detective had said you never know who might be listening tom thought this was all a bit childish but the detective seemed hurt when he had said this and so tom had agreed not to use their real names yes this is watson and you are mr holmes tom said i am ready to make my report the detective replied what now on the phone tom asked no we should meet id rather do this facetoface the detective said anyway you have to give me some money for my costs your wife has expensive tastes what do you mean where did she go what did she do did she tom asked all in good time dr watson but not on the phone the detective replied well im just on my way home tom said i know how do you know tom asked i can see you from the phone box the detective said the phone box yes the phone box the detective said my mobile phone isnt working ive had a bad day with machines i can tell you so i had to use a phone box what are you talking about what phone box tom asked behind you the detective replied tom turned round there standing in a phone box a few metres away was the detective he was still wearing his heavy dirty white raincoat although it was a warm day the detective waved at him with his free hand well it was not totally free he was holding a fat cigar in this hand a heavy dirty white raincoat and a cigar tom had seen this before somewhere but he could not remember where on television he asked himself where this detective had learnt his job he wanted to ask him if detectives went to schools or if they just watched lots of american films but not now he listened to the phone and the detectives question where can we meet the detective asked well this might seem like a stupid idea but why dont you come out of the telephone box and we can meet here and now tom answered no someone might see us together the detective said who so what if someone sees us tom said better to be careful the detective replied you never know who might be watching tom began to wonder if all detectives were as strange as this one maybe it came with the job then he suddenly remembered that he wanted to know what marina had done in london what did the detective mean when he said marina had expensive tastes he wanted the detective to say that she had come up to london for the day had not met anyone and had gone back home happy at the thought of seeing him again that is what he wanted the detective to say or something like that but that is not what the detective said tom and the detective sat down with their drinks in a quiet pub well actually it was not quiet the music was playing very loudly even though the pub was empty not surprising it was empty with that noise going on its good noone will hear our conversation the detective shouted tom shouted back sorry a few times and then told the detective that the important thing was that they could hear each other and not that noone else could hear them anyway said tom as the pub is empty i dont think anyone can listen to our conversation he asked the barman to turn the music off the barman was not happy to do this people like music when they come to the pub the barman said we are the only people in the pub and we dont like it replied tom the barman turned the music down not off but down a little not a lot just a little at least it was possible for tom and the detective to hear each other the detective began his report reading from his notebook i parked my car outside number greater blackbird drive at this morning and after waiting for ten minutes i saw a car stop outside the above house greater blackbird drive and i watched as the woman in question came to the door and tom stopped him woman in question you mean marina listen can we do this in english please anyway what car the detective looked a bit hurt he thought this was how detectives should speak when they give their reports but tom clearly did not agree ok the detective said your wife came to the door and kissed the man who had driven up in the car what what man what car tom asked how did she kiss him are you sure it was marina my dear watson the detective smiled at him as if tom was a child if you are going to ask me questions now i will never finish this report please listen and ask me any questions when i have finished i think things will become clearer as i continue ok all right but please stop calling me watson where did you get these names from anyway the detective looked hurt again but continued ok he said the woman in question sorry your wife then returned sorry she went back into the house and came out with the man and they were carrying two large bags what where was she where were they was she leaving he did not finish his questions he did not want to complete his thoughts thoughts like shes leaving me also the detective was now looking at him the way toms teachers used to look at him when he was much younger tom was older now but the look on the detectives face still stopped him speaking the detective continued your wife and the man then drove off together in the car a red volkswagen golf the car number was p sim and they took the a and drove towards boddington village i dont want to know the number of the road tom almost shouted i dont want to know the number of the car i dont care what colour it was i just want to know what they did ok ok ok the detective said they drove to the sports centre they played tennis not very seriously a lot of laughing i watched but i couldnt see who won not my game anyway i prefer football do you play yourself can you please tell me what happened and maybe we can talk about football later tom said the detective looked down at his notebook and continued then they went to lunch thats what i meant about expensive tastes an expensive italian restaurant and i didnt have much money with me so all i had was a plate of spaghetti and a glass of water you dont want to know what they ate do you tom shook his head he did not know that marina liked tennis and he did not know that there were any good restaurants near them at all the last time they had eaten out was on his birthday in a pub they had gone home and made love my god that was the last time they had made love four weeks ago well they didnt seem very interested in what they were eating either you know more looking into each others eyes than looking at the plate if you know what i mean the detective said now it was tom who used a look on the detective the detective coughed said sorry and continued then they drove down to the coast one hundred kilometres can you believe it and all they did when they got there was walk along the beach for ten minutes take off their shoes walk into the sea kiss each other for i dont know probably five minutes and the beach was really wet look at my shoes and then they looked at each other and said something i couldnt hear what they said i mean i was actually quite close to them but they didnt see me i dont think they would have seen the loch ness monster if it had come out of the sea i mean i know the loch ness monster doesnt live in the sea but you know what i mean they were they only had eyes for each other really romantic the detective suddenly remembered that he was telling this story to the womans husband and he stopped he looked at tom toms head was down the detective could not see if tom was crying or not but he suddenly felt really sorry for him he wanted to reach out his hand and touch tom he remembered what it felt like to find out you were losing the person you loved and in that moment the detective thought this is not the job for me and then tom asked he did not want to hear any more and yet at the same time he wanted the detective to finish the story he had to know everything they ran back to the car and drove back to boddington the detective said they parked in front of a small building with six flats in it they took the bags from the car and went up to the front door she opened the door with a key and they went in she opened the door tom asked in surprise yeah i checked with the neighbours the detective replied its her flat he was just the latest visitor theyd seen him a couple of times but there were others before him he was just the latest one chapter nine do not use the toilet while the train is in the station tom got on the train home and sat on the first free seat he came to there were other people already sitting around the table but he did not see them he fell into the seat and let his case fall on the table together with the envelope the detective had given him the conversation with the detective was still going on in his head he was just the latest one the neighbours had told the detective tom shook his head and said aloud the latest one the woman opposite him on the train said sorry what did you say but tom just shook his head at her and returned to his thoughts how long had this been going on was this possible he had not noticed anything well that was not quite true he knew that marina was not happy that she was finding it difficult to get used to living in the country but it was only with this story of the ironing man that he had begun to worry about her now it was already too late she had found someone else because he had not had any time to give her oh god ive been so stupid he said aloud the woman opposite looked at him again maybe it was not too late he loved marina and he was sure she still loved him but maybe she did not love him any more maybe this latest one had become important to her latest one a flat in boddington this was not possible how could she lead a double life like this without him knowing had he really been so busy in his work that he had just not seen what was going on this was not like marina to do something and not tell him about it no this was not like marina could she have done this did she feel so unloved the ticket inspector arrived and tom had to look for his ticket he pulled it out of his pocket together with his notebook actually he had two notebooks in his pocket and after the inspector had seen his ticket tom began to look through the older notebook it was for last year he started at the back of the book and began to read through it back to front marinas name was everywhere sometimes under bad i got really angry with marina last night flow can she spend so much time talking away on the phone talking about nothing but most often her name was under good lots of we talked late lots of we went to that little greek restaurant again tonight lots of we on one day her birthday two years ago he had written eighteen things under good all about marina fourteen of them were about the presents he had bought her like this marina loved the scarf marina loved the earrings marina loved the dinosaur marina loved the other things were about marina waking up to find the bedroom full of candles a cake and a birthday card as big as the television and about their lovemaking tom put the notebook down on the table what was going to happen now would there be another birthday for them to enjoy together could he still show her that he loved her would she take him back he saw the envelope sitting on the table the detective had given it to him just before tom got on the train tom looked at it i dont know if youll want to look at these at all the detective had said tom had taken the envelope from the detective who by this time looked as unhappy as tom did im so sorry i had to tell you all this the detective continued i just wish he had not finished tom now sat looking at the envelope photographs yes it must be photographs tom did not want to look and yet he picked up the envelope he held it in his hand he looked towards the open window and for a moment thought of throwing the envelope out but no he had to look at them he opened the envelope slowly and a number of colour photographs fell on the table he looked at them he picked up one then another then another then another a man getting out of a car a man kissing a young woman a couple walking on a beach the same man and woman the same couple in a restaurant the same couple in front of a house tom did not know the man and he certainly did not know the woman what was going on here maybe the detective had given him the wrong photographs tom looked again at the photograph of the couple outside the first house it was his house it was their house his and marinas there was no mistake but who was this woman was this the woman the detective had followed the detective had followed this woman he had not followed marina he had followed this woman to the sports centre to the restaurant to the beach and back to the flat he had watched this woman open the door of the flat and go in with her latest not with marinas latest he had not followed marina to these places he had not followed marina anywhere yes yes yes tom said aloud between his teeth and hit the envelope with his hand the woman opposite him looked at tom again but before he could say sorry and smile she decided to hide behind her newspaper she held it up in front of her tom said sorry anyway he was so excited now he had to talk to someone but this woman was probably not the right person he thought of the detective he took out his mobile phone and rang the number but there was nothing no sound nothing of course the detective had said his mobile phone was not working tom put the phone down it rang immediately it was the detective tom the detective asked they had changed to using first names in the pub are you ok yes phil but listen tom said this woman in the photographs this is the woman you followed yes the detective did not understand why tom was asking him this tell me what did she look like tell me what she was wearing the detective did not say anything at first he did not understand what was going on please phil this is important tom said the detectives description was very full and it matched the woman in the photograph tom told the detective he was wonderful and that he loved him the detective was surprised and then pleased when tom explained the detective was even more surprised when tom offered to double his pay no i dont want any more money tom the detective said use it to take marina on a really nice holiday i dont want the money im just happy this was all a mistake but listen look after that girl of yours spend more time with her ok i mean i may not be a very good detective but i know something about people and i can see how important your marina is for you so dont lose her ok tom replied anyway im giving up this detective business i dont like to see nice people being unhappy i dont want to be part of that how long have you been doing it tom asked he was not really surprised to hear that this had been phils first job as a detective they both promised to phone each other soon perhaps both of them had learnt more from this than they realised he put the phone down and saw that the woman was still hiding behind the newspaper perhaps she had heard tom telling phil he loved him tom smiled he did not think the woman would come out from behind her newspaper he would not see her again he looked at the back of her newspaper and saw an advertisement the advertisement was for a holiday in the west indies it took tom less than five minutes to ring the number and book a twoweek holiday it took him one minute to phone his boss and leave a message on the answerphone he said that he was going on holiday and that he was leaving the job to spend more time with his wife it took tom less than one minute to walk to the toilet surprisingly when he got there his mobile phone started to ring it actually now worked in the toilet but he didnt want to answer it he wanted some peace and quiet so he let it fall into the toilet the phone continued to ring but more quietly then it disappeared onto the railway lines as tom pressed the button above the toilet for a few seconds he could still hear it ringing and then nothing at all chapter ten on the beach tom and marina had been on holiday for a week now and were feeling very relaxed and very much in love they had spent the long flight to barbados telling each other their side of the story marina told tom about tracy and the massage and her day in london with the ironing man tom had told marina about phil the detective and the wonderful case of the wrong woman they had both laughed a lot and this laughter was helped by the flight assistant she thought tom and marina were on their honeymoon and returned again and again to offer them more and more champagne so who was this ironing man tom asked where did he come from i have no idea marina said maybe it was all in my head tom thought about this for a while well what about the photographs of tracy she wasnt just in your head and she said the ironing man sent her so he said does it matter he helped us didnt he thats all that matters marina replied yeah youre right tom said on the second day they had slept most of the first day after the long journey and the champagne tom had taken a piece of paper and had written things to do at the top of the page he then looked up at marina smiled made a ball of the paper and threw it into the toilet in their bathroom he was becoming good at throwing things down toilets first the mobile phone on the train and now the piece of paper since then they had made no plans at all they had done things as they felt like it and they had done nothing when they felt like it they had done all of this together and now they felt like a walk on the beach the beach was empty as the sun had already set and most of the other visitors had already returned to the hotel tom and marina felt they had the beach all to themselves suddenly tom stopped walking and looked along the beach he could just see a small group of people sitting together looking out at the sea and laughing there were three people two men and a woman one of the men was quite big and for a moment tom thought he knew him he could not be sure because the man was not wearing a dirty white raincoat but he did look a little like phil the detective the second man was goodlooking and tall tom turned towards marina and saw that she was also looking along the beach at the same group of people are you ok tom asked oh yes im fine im very very fine she said as she put her hands around his neck and pulled him into a long kiss when tom and marina finished the kiss they looked up the beach but the group of people had left marina turned again to tom its just did you hear that womans laugh that blonde woman it sounded a bit it sounded a bit like tracy and the tall man looked a bit like but no thats not possible thats not possible is it the end hope you have enjoyed the reading come back to httpenglishebooksnet to find more
