the reluctant orchid arthur c clarke renown publishing co inc though few people in the white hart will concede that any of harry purvis stories are actually true everyone agrees that some are much more probable than others and on any scale of probability the affair of the reluctant orchid must rate very low indeed i dont remember what ingenious gambit harry used to launch this narrative maybe some orchid fancier brought his latest monstrosity into the bar and that set him off no matter i do remember the story and after all thats what counts the adventure did not this time concern any of harrys numerous relatives and he avoided explaining just how he managed to know so many of the sordid details the heroif you can call him thatof this hothouse epic was an inoffensive little clerk named hercules keating and if you think that is the most unlikely part of the story just stick round a while hercules is not the sort of name you can carry off lightly at the best of times and when you are four foot nine and look as if youd have to take a physical culture course before you can even become a pound weakling it is a positive embarrassment perhaps it helped to explain why hercules had very little social life and all his real friends grew in pots in a humid conservatory at the bottom of his garden his needs were simple and he spent very little money on himself consequently his collection of orchids and cacti was really rather remarkable indeed he had a wide reputation among the fraternity of cactophiles and often received from remote comers of the globe parcels smelling of mould and tropical jungles hercules had only one living relative and it would have been hard to find a greater contrast than aunt henrietta she was a massive six footer usually wore a rather loud line in harris tweeds drove a jaguar with reckless skill and chainsmoked cigars her parents had set their hearts on a boy and had never been able to decide whether or not their wish had been granted henrietta earned a living and quite a good one breeding dogs of various shapes and sizes she was seldom without a couple of her latest models and they were not the type of portable canine which ladies like to carry in their handbags the keating kennels specialized in great danes alsatians and saint bernards henrietta rightly despising men as the weaker sex had never married however for some reason she took an avuncular interest in hercules and called to see him almost every weekend it was a curious kind of relationship probably henrietta found that hercules bolstered up her feelings of superiority if he was a good example of the male sex then they were certainly a pretty sorry lot yet if this was henriettas motivation she was unconscious of it and seemed genuinely fond of her nephew she was patronizing but never unkind as might be expected her attentions did not exactly help hercules own welldeveloped inferiority complex at first he had tolerated his aunt then he came to dread her regular visits her booming voice and her bonecrushing handshake and at last he grew to hate her eventually indeed his hate was the dominant emotion in his life exceeding even his love for his orchids but he was careful not to show it realizing that if aunt henrietta discovered how he felt about her she would probably break him in two and throw the pieces to her wolf pack there was no way then in which hercules could express his pentup feelings he had to be polite to aunt henrietta even when he felt like murder and he often did feel like murder though he knew that there was nothing he would ever do about it until one day according to the dealer the orchid came from somewhere in the amazon regiona rather vague postal address when hercules first saw it it was not a very prepossessing sight even to anyone who loved orchids as much as he did a shapeless root about the size of a mans fistthat was all it was redolent of decay and there was the faintest hint of a rank carrion smell hercules was not even sure that it was viable and told the dealer as much perhaps that enabled him to purchase it for a trifling sum and he carried it home without much enthusiasm it showed no signs of life for the first month but that did not worry hercules then one day a tiny green shoot appeared and started to creep up to the light after that progress was rapid soon there was a thick fleshy stem as big as a mans forearm and colored a positively virulent green near the top of the stem a series of curious bulges circled the plant otherwise it was completely featureless hercules was now quite excited he was sure that some entirely new species had swum into his ken the rate of growth was now really fantastic soon the plant was taller than hercules not that that was saying a great deal moreover the bulges seemed to be developing and it looked as if at any moment the orchid would burst into bloom hercules waited anxiously knowing how shortlived some flowers can be and spent as much time as he possibly could in the hothouse despite all his watchfulness the transformation occurred one night while he was asleep in the morning the orchid was fringed by a series of eight dangling tendrils almost reaching to the ground they must have developed inside the plant and emerged withfor the vegetable worldexplosive speed hercules stared at the phenomenon in amazement and went very thoughtfully to work that evening as he watered the plant and checked its soil he noticed a still more peculiar fact the tendrils were thickening and they were not completely motionless they had a slight but unmistakable tendency to vibrate as if possessing a life of their own even hercules for all his interest and enthusiasm found this more than a little disturbing a few days later there was no doubt about it at all when he approached the orchid the tendrils swayed toward him in an unpleasantly suggestive fashion the impression of hunger was so strong that hercules began to feel very uncomfortable indeed and something started to nag at the back of his mind it was quite a while before he could recall what it was then he said to himself of course how stupid of me and went along to the local library here he spent a most interesting halfhour rereading a little piece by one h g wells entitled the flowering of the strange orchid my goodness thought hercules when he had finished the tale as yet there had been no stupefying odor which might overpower the plants intended victim but otherwise the characteristics were all too similar hercules went home in a very unsettled mood indeed he opened the conservatory door and stood looking along the avenue of greenery towards his prize specimen he judged the length of the tendrilsalready he found himself calling them tentacles with great care and walked to within what appeared a safe distance the plant certainly had an impression of alertness and menace far more appropriate to the animal than the vegetable kingdom hercules remembered the unfortunate history of doctor frankenstein and was not amused but really this was ridiculous such things didnt happen in real life well there was one way to put matters to the test hercules went into the house and came back a few minutes later with a broomstick to the end of which he had attached a piece of raw meat feeling a considerable fool he advanced towards the orchid as a liontamer might approach one of his charges at mealtime for a moment nothing happened then two of the tendrils developed an agitated twitch they began to sway back and forth as if the plant was making up its mind abruptly they whipped out with such speed that they practically vanished from view they wrapped themselves round the meat and hercules felt a powerful tug at the end of his broomstick then the meat was gone the orchid was clutching it if one may mix metaphors slightly to its bosom jumping jehosophat yelled hercules it was very seldom indeed that he used such strong language the orchid showed no further signs of life for twentyfour hours it was waiting for the meat to become high and it was also developing its digestive system by the next day a network of what looked like short roots had covered the still visible chunk of meat by nightfall the meat was gone the plant had tasted blood hercules emotions as he watched over his prize were curiously mixed there were times when it almost gave him nightmares and he foresaw a whole range of horrid possibilities the orchid was now extremely strong and if he got within its clutches he would be done for but of course there was not the slightest danger of that he had arranged a system of pipes so that it could be watered from a safe distance and its less orthodox food he simply tossed within range of its tentacles it was now eating a pound of raw meat a day and he had an uncomfortable feeling that it could cope with much larger quantities if given the opportunity hercules natural qualms were on the whole outweighed by his feeling of triumph that such a botanical marvel had fallen into his hands whenever he chose he could become the most famous orchidgrower in the world it was typical of his somewhat restricted viewpoint that it never occurred to him that other people besides orchidfanciers might be interested in his pet the creature was now about six feet tall and apparently still growingthough much more slowly than it had been all the other plants had been moved from its end of the conservatory not so much because hercules feared that it might be cannibalistic as to enable him to tend them without danger he had stretched a rope across the central aisle so that there was no risk of his accidentally walking within range of those eight dangling arms it was obvious that the orchid had a highly developed nervous system and something very nearly approaching intelligence it knew when it was going to be fed and exhibited unmistakable signs of pleasure most fantastic of allthough hercules was still not sure about thisit seemed capable of producing sounds there were times just before a meal when he fancied he could hear an incredibly highpitched whistle skirting the edge of audibility a newborn bat might have had such a voice he wondered what purpose it served did the orchid somehow lure its prey into its clutches by sound if so he did not think the technique would work on him while hercules was making these interesting discoveries he continued to be fussed over by aunt henrietta and assaulted by her hounds which were never as housetrained as she claimed them to be she would usually roar up the street on a sunday afternoon with one dog in the seat beside her and another occupying most of the baggage compartment then she would bound up the steps two at a time nearly deafen hercules with her greeting half paralyze him with her handshake and blow cigar smoke in his face there had been a time when he was terrified that she would kiss him but he had long since realized that such effeminate behavior was foreign to her nature aunt henrietta looked upon hercules orchids with some scorn spending ones spare time in a hothouse was she considered a very effete recreation when she wanted to let off steam she went biggame hunting in kenya this did nothing to endear her to hercules who hated blood sports but despite his mounting dislike for his overpowering aunt every sunday afternoon he dutifully prepared tea for her and they had a tteatte together which on the surface at least seemed perfectly friendly henrietta never guessed that as he poured the tea hercules often wished it was poisoned she was far down beneath her extensive fortifications a fundamentally goodhearted person and the knowledge would have upset her deeply hercules did not mention his vegetable octopus to aunt henrietta he had occasionally shown her his most interesting specimens but this was something he was keeping to himself perhaps even before he had fully formulated his diabolical plan his subconscious was already preparing the ground it was late one sunday evening when the roar of the jaguar had died away into the night and hercules was restoring his shattered nerves in the conservatory that the idea first came fully fledged into his mind he was staring at the orchid noting how the tendrils were now as thick around as a mans thumb when a most pleasing fantasy suddenly flashed before his eyes he pictured aunt henrietta struggling helplessly in the grip of the monster unable to escape from its carnivorous clutches why it would be the perfect crime the distraught nephew would arrive on the scene too late to be of assistance and when the police answered his frantic call they would see at a glance that the whole affair was a deplorable accident true there would be an inquest but the coroners censure would be toned down in view of hercules obvious grief the more he thought of the idea the more he liked it he could see no flaws as long as the orchid cooperated that clearly would be the greatest problem he would have to plan a course of training for the creature it already looked sufficiently diabolical he must give it a disposition to suit its appearance considering that he had no prior experience in such matters and that there were no authorities he could consult hercules proceeded along very sound and businesslike lines he would use a fishing rod to dangle pieces of meat just outside the orchids range until the creature lashed its tentacles in a frenzy at such times its highpitched squeak was clearly audible and hercules wondered how it managed to produce the sound he also wondered what its organs of perception were but this was yet another mystery that could not be solved without close examination perhaps aunt henrietta if all went well would have a brief opportunity of discovering these interesting factsthough she would probably be too busy to report them for the benefit of posterity there was no doubt that the beast was quite powerful enough to deal with its intended victim it had once wrenched a broomstick out of hercules grip and although that in itself proved very little the sickening crack of the wood a moment later brought a smile of satisfaction to its trainers thin lips he began to be much more pleasant and attentive to his aunt in every respect indeed he was the model nephew when hercules considered that his picador tactics had brought the orchid into the right frame of mind he wondered if he should test it with live bait this was a problem that worried him for some weeks during which time he would look speculatively at every dog or cat he passed in the street but he finally abandoned the idea for a rather peculiar reason he was simply too kindhearted to put it into practice aunt henrietta would have to be the first victim he starved the orchid for two weeks before he put his plan into action this was as long as he dared riskhe did not wish to weaken the beastmerely to whet its appetite that the outcome of the encounter might be more certain and so when he had carried the teacups back into the kitchen and was sitting upwind of aunt henriettas cigar he said casually ive got something id like to show you auntie ive been keeping it as a surprise itll tickle you to death that he thought was not a completely accurate description but it gave the general idea auntie took the cigar out of her mouth and looked at hercules with frank surprise i well she boomed wonders will never cease what have you been up to you rascal she slapped him playfully on the back and shot all the air out of his lungs youll never believe it gritted hercules when he had recovered his breath its in the observatory eh said auntie obviously puzzled yescome along and have a look its going to create a real sensation auntie gave a snort that might have indicated disbelief but followed hercules without further question the two alsatians now busily chewing up the carpet looked at her anxiously and half rose to their feet but she waved them away all right boys she ordered gruffly ill be back in a minute hercules thought this unlikely it was a dark evening and the lights in the conservatory were off as they entered auntie snorted gad herculesthe place smells like a slaughterhouse havent met such a stink since i shot that elephant in bulawayo and we couldnt find it for a week sorry auntie apologized hercules propelling her forward through the gloom its a new fertilizer im using it produces the most stunning results go onanother couple of yards i want this to be a real surprise i hope this isnt a joke said auntie suspiciously as she stomped forward i can promise you its no joke replied hercules standing with his hand on the light switch he could just see the looming bulk of the orchid auntie was now within ten feet of it he waited until she was well inside the danger zone and threw the switch there was a frozen moment while the scene was transfixed with light then aunt henrietta ground to a halt and stood arms akimbo in front of the giant orchid for a moment hercules was afraid she would retreat before the plant could get into action then he saw that she was calmly scrutinizing it unable to make up her mind what the devil it was it was a full five seconds before the orchid moved then the dangling tentacles flashed into actionbut not in the way that hercules had expected the plant clutched them tightly protectively around itselfand at the same time it gave a highpitched scream of pure terror in a moment of sickening disillusionment hercules realized the awful truth his orchid was an utter coward it might be able to cope with the wild life of the amazon jungle but coming suddenly upon aunt henrietta had completely broken its nerve as for its proposed victim she stood watching the creature with an astonishment which swiftly changed to another emotion she spun around on her heels and pointed an accusing finger at her nephew hercules she roared the poor things scared to death have you been bullying it hercules could only stand with his head hanging low in shame and frustration nno auntie he quavered i guess its naturally nervous well im used to animals you should have called me before you must treat them firmlybut gently kindness always works as long as you show them youre the master there there diddums dont be frightened of auntieshe wont hurt you it was thought hercules in his blank despair a revolting sight with surprising gentleness aunt henrietta fussed over the beast patting and stroking it until the tentacles relaxed and the shrill whistling scream died away after a few minutes of this pandering it appeared to get over its fright hercules finally fled with a muffled sob when one of the tentacles crept forward and began to stroke henriettas gnarled fingers from that day he was a broken man what was worse he could never escape from the consequences of his intended crime henrietta had acquired a new pet and was liable to call not only at weekends but two or three times in between as well it was obvious that she did not trust hercules to treat the orchid properly and still suspected him of bullying it she would bring tasty tidbits that even her dogs had rejected but which the orchid accepted with delight the smell which had so far been confined to the conservatory began to creep into the house and there concluded harry purvis as he brought this improbable narrative to a close the matter reststo the satisfaction of two at any rate of the parties concerned the orchid is happy and aunt henrietta has something else to dominate from time to time the creature has a nervous breakdown when a mouse gets loose in the conservatory and she rushes to console it as for hercules there is no chance that he will ever give any more trouble to either of them he seems to have sunk into a kind of vegetable sloth indeed said harry thoughtfully every day he becomes more and more like an orchid himself the harmless variety of course
