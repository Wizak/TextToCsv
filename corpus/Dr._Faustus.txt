wagner ask my fellow if i be a thief second scholar well you will not tell us wagner yes sir i will tell you yet if you were not dunces you would never ask me such a question for is not he corpus naturale and is not that mobile then wherefore should you ask me such a question but that i am by nature phlegmatic slow to wrath and prone to lechery to love i would say it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place of execution although i do not doubt to see you both hanged the next sessions thus having triumphed over you i will set my countenance like a precisian and begin to speak thus truly my dear brethren my master is within at dinner with valdes and cornelius as this wine if it could speak would inform your worships and so the lord bless you preserve you and keep you my dear brethren my dear brethren exit first scholar nay then i fear he is fallen into that damned art for which they two are infamous through the world second scholar were he a stranger and not allied to me yet should i grieve for him but come let us go and inform the rector and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him first scholar o but i fear me nothing can reclaim him second scholar yet let us try what we can do exeunt enter faustus to conjure faustus now that the gloomy shadow of the earth longing to view orions drizzling look leaps from th antartic world unto the sky and dims the welkin with her pitchy breath faustus begin thine incantations and try if devils will obey thy hest seeing thou hast prayd and sacrificd to them within this circle is jehovahs name forward and backward anagrammatizd th abbreviated names of holy saints figures of every adjunct to the heavens and characters of signs and erring stars by which the spirits are enforcd to rise then fear not faustus but be resolute and try the uttermost magic can perform sint mihi dei acherontis propitii valeat numen triplex jehovoe ignei aerii aquatani spiritus salvete orientis princeps belzebub inferni ardentis monarcha et demogorgon propitiamus vos ut appareat et surgat mephistophilis quod tumeraris per jehovam gehennam et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo signumque crucis quod nunc facio

friar that holy shape becomes a devil best exit mephistophilis i see theres virtue in my heavenly words who would not be proficient in this art how pliant is this mephistophilis full of obedience and humility such is the force of magic and my spells no faustus thou art conjuror laureat that canst command great mephistophilis quin regis mephistophilis fratris imagine reenter mephistophilis like a franciscan friar mephist now faustus what wouldst thou have me do faustus i charge thee wait upon me whilst i live to do whatever faustus shall command be it to make the moon drop from her sphere or the ocean to overwhelm the world mephist i am a servant to great lucifer and may not follow thee without his leave no more than he commands must we perform faustus did not he charge thee to appear to me mephist no i came hither of mine own accord faustus did not my conjuring speeches raise thee speak mephist that was the cause but yet per accidens for when we hear one rack the name of god abjure the scriptures and his saviour christ we fly in hope to get his glorious soul nor will we come unless he use such means whereby he is in danger to be damnd therefore the shortest cut for conjuring is stoutly to abjure the trinity and pray devoutly to the prince of hell faustus so faustus hath already done and holds this principle there is no chief but only belzebub to whom faustus doth dedicate himself this word damnation terrifies not him for he confounds hell in elysium his ghost be with the old philosophers but leaving these vain trifles of mens souls tell me what is that lucifer thy lord mephist archregent and commander of all spirits faustus was not that lucifer an angel once mephist yes faustus and most dearly lovd of god faustus how comes it then that he is prince of devils mephist

god with lucifer and are for ever damnd with lucifer faustus where are you damnd mephist in hell faustus how comes it then that thou art out of hell mephist why this is hell nor am i out of it thinkst thou that i who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joys of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand hells in being deprivd of everlasting bliss o faustus leave these frivolous demands which strike a terror to my fainting soul faustus what is great mephistophilis so passionate for being deprived of the joys of heaven learn thou of faustus manly fortitude and scorn those joys thou never shalt possess go bear these tidings to great lucifer seeing faustus hath incurrd eternal death by desperate thoughts against joves deity say he surrenders up to him his soul so he will spare him four and twenty years letting him live in all voluptuousness having thee ever to attend on me to give me whatsoever i shall ask to tell me whatsoever i demand to slay mine enemies and aid my friends and

deed of gift with thine own blood for that security craves great lucifer if thou deny it i will back to hell faustus stay mephistophilis and tell me what good will my soul do thy lord mephist enlarge his kingdom faustus is that the reason why he tempts us thus mephist solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris faustus why have you any pain that torture others mephist as great as have the human souls of men but tell me faustus shall i have thy soul and i will be thy slave and wait on thee and give thee more than thou hast wit to ask faustus ay mephistophilis i give it thee mephist then faustus stab thine arm courageously and bind thy soul that at some certain day great lucifer may claim it as his own and then be thou as great as lucifer faustus stabbing his arm lo mephistophilis for love of thee i cut mine arm and with my proper blood assure my soul to be great lucifers chief lord and regent of perpetual night view here the blood that trickles from mine arm and let it be propitious for

and of soul but yet conditionally that thou perform all articles prescribd between us both mephist faustus i swear by hell and lucifer to effect all promises between us made faustus then hear me read them reads on these conditions following first that faustus may be a spirit in form and substance secondly that mephistophilis shall be his servant and at his command thirdly that mephistophilis shall do for him and bring him whatsoever he desires fourthly that he shall be in his chamber or house invisible lastly that he shall appear to the said john faustus at all times in what form or shape soever he please i john faustus of wertenberg doctor by these presents do give both body and soul to lucifer prince of the east and his minister mephistophilis and furthermore grant unto them that

places shall be hell that are not heaven faustus come i think hells a fable mephist ay think so still till experience change thy mind faustus why thinkst thou then that faustus shall be damnd mephist ay of necessity for heres the scroll wherein thou hast given thy soul to lucifer faustus ay and body too but what of that thinkst thou that faustus is so fond to imagine that after this life there is any pain tush these are trifles and mere old wives tales mephist but faustus i am an instance to prove the contrary for i am damnd and am now in hell faustus how now in hell nay an this be hell ill willingly be damnd here what walking disputing c but leaving off this let me have a wife the fairest maid in germany for i am wanton and lascivious and cannot live without a wife mephist how a wife i

us dispute again and argue of divine astrology tell me are there many heavens above the moon are all celestial bodies but one globe as is the substance of this centric earth mephist as are the elements such are the spheres mutually folded in each others orb and faustus all jointly move upon one axletree whose terminine is termd the worlds wide pole nor are the names of saturn mars or jupiter feignd but are erring stars faustus but tell me have they all one motion both situ et tempore mephist all jointly move from east to west in twentyfour hours upon the poles of the world but differ in their motion upon the poles of the zodiac faustus tush these slender trifles wagner can decide hath mephistophilis no greater skill who knows not the double motion of the planets the first is finishd in a natural day the second thus as saturn in thirty years jupiter in twelve mars in four the sun venus and mercury in a year the moon in twentyeight days tush these are freshmens suppositions but tell me hath every sphere a dominion or intelligentia mephist ay faustus how many heavens or spheres are there mephist nine the seven planets the firmament and the empyreal heaven
