quiller shadow executive for londons ultrasecret bureau is pitched into his new mission with a motive most urgent he owes a man a death through contact with an ethereal englishwoman in the shadows of a berlin nightclub quiller is drawn deep into the vortex of nemesis the most feared terrorist faction in europe feeling his way alone across the trembling web of the opposition network quiller infiltrates the nervecentre of nemesis but still can find no means of defeating midnight one an operation designed to establish one man as the archterrorist of all time adam hall quiller solitaire hit i dropped the bundle onto the desk and pulled the string and opened up the crumpled newspaper and tilney stood looking down at the stuff id brought in the two blackened number plates wrist watch bunch of keys ring metal cigarettelighter the upper jawbone the lower one while the reek of burnt flesh began filling the little room sickening me sickening him too i would imagine tilney looking down at the stuff and then bringing his head up thats all thats all what does he look like cinder it was cold in here or it felt like it i shrugged a bit deeper into my coat nothing recognisable tilney asked i gave him a dead stare the object of the exercise i said was to remove all traces of his identity i did that i suppose i would have put it differently if the rage hadnt been in me burning in me like that bloody car burning half the night out there among the trees in a moment have you had any sleep hed caught my tone the far faint echo of the rage others wouldnt have noticed no i had to watch over things a vigil over the dead you could call it but lets not be too dramatic you could have phoned for someone i didnt want anyone out there it would have meant headlights arriving and everything attracting attention things had been bad enough with the fire though nobody had come running last night was the fifth of november with bonfires all over the countryside trust mccane to get himself blown into christendom on guy fawkes night tilney wrapped the things up in the newspaper again and jotted a note on a pad and said lets go along to my room shall we we need to debrief then youd better get some sleep the clock on the wall said there was still dark in the windows in the corridor i asked tilney who was running him shatner but theres no actual mission on the board is he in yet yes tilney was giving me quick sidelong glances still catching things in my tone i couldnt do anything about that they got him on the phone when your signal came in and he i want to see him tilney broke his step and looked at me directly and said you can eventually but first im going to debrief you on mccanes death he opened his door and waited for me to go through tilney has been known to put you in your place less gently than that but he wanted to humour me i think he didnt know what was on my mind why my control was so thin id seen people killed before and he knew that take a pew he said and got behind his desk pushing some stuff to one side spot of tea no he got a taperecorder from a drawer and set it going so what happened i still felt cold though the radiators were on you could hear the water gurgling in the pipes he phoned me in my car he said he was going to reigate and asked me if i wanted to follow him up tilney watched me not looking away much a thin man with glasses and ginger hair and pale freckled hands straight out of some redbrick university you would have said the science department wed been in this bloody place for years he and i and we got on well enough even when the signals room was running hot he asked you to follow him up had he tried to phone you before at your flat or anywhere i dont know i said i mean how important was it to him did he sound worried he just said it offhand but he must have been expecting some sort of attack to have asked you to follow him up i didnt want to talk about it but it was no use telling him that not necessarily attack perhaps surveillance wanted to know if there were any ticks on his tail tilney looked at me mccane was a top shadow he didnt need anyone to help him find out if he was being surveilled if he all right then he was expecting someone to try killing him if you like i dont know how can i tilney looked away he knew the score now mccane had thought someone was liable to have a go at him and hed asked me to cover his rear and id done that but i hadnt done it well enough and hed ended up in a burning car and i was trying to think of some way of ever getting any sleep again what actually happened tilney asked quietly he was about a hundred yards in front of me most of the time and just this side of redhill when we were on a straight stretch another car came up from behind me and went past like a bat out of hell and cut across mccanes bows and he swerved and went into the trees and the tank burst and the whole thing went up tilneys eyes were wandering around the cluttered room he would have been wearing a seatbelt and therefore wasnt thrown clear and the fire started so fast that you didnt have a chance of reaching him in time wasnt that it i should have there was nothing you could have done obviously he was watching me again now i should have been ready for it tilney looked down folding his pale hands on the desk beside the taperecorder its going on record that in my opinion and from what youve described there was quite clearly nothing you could have done to help mccane last night i left it the other car i said kept on going they hit the brakes once i was waiting for them to turn and come back and make sure theyd done the job but when they saw the tank go up they must have known he hadnt got a chance what kind of car did they have a dark mercedes i didnt see much of it i was watching mccanes of course then you phoned signals yes i told them to pass it on to whoever was running him i didnt know it was shatner did anyone he stopped tilting his head thered been the slam of a door he picked up the intercom phone and i waited my body heavy in the worn leather chair my eyes wanting to close but i wasnt going to catch up on my sleep until id seen shatner there was only one thing really i could do that would get me at least some of the way out of this appalling sense of guilt almost of betrayal and shatner could help me do it but id have to be very careful you just come in tilney was saying on the phone listen theres some things on the desk in the storeroom downstairs the one next to clearance theyre in some newspaper youll see what they are i want you to deal with them he put the phone down and looked at me and asked did you get any instructions to blot out mccanes identity for us blot out i could feel the cold going through to the bone no i did it as a matter of routine mccane had been a highechelon shadow executive and when one of us hits the ground theres immediate smoke put out were known to a dozen major intelligence networks and whether a given agent is alive or dead is strictly our own business the essence of intelligence is secrecy of all and any kind you were there all night tilney said and waited the yellow pencil hed picked up to play with was nibbled almost down to the lead but id never seen him at it the crash was soon after nine everything was too hot to touch until the early hours the embers glowing and the smoke drifting in thin grey skeins among the trees the smell of pinewood and frost and the other smell from the thing inside the car sitting there like a charred scarecrow a human sacrifice to gross incompetence rub the salt in let me rub it in and you dont know where he phoned you from tilney was saying no no kind of background noise that you can remember was he in his car or maybe a pub i didnt hear any background it was something youre trained to listen for it can tell you a lot tilney had the pencil between two fingers and was swinging it up and down it was getting on my nerves you didnt see much of each other did you in the ordinary way i was in budapest with him once setting up a courier line we did some infiltration work in beirut a couple of years ago he was first class but im sure you know that i enjoyed working with him and he clearly had a lot of respect for you ive no idea i mean for him to telephone you instead of someone else to ask for help oh for christs sake how do i know i got out of the chair and went across to the window and there was the street down there the lamplight and the first buses the world waking up for all of us but not for mccane i was letting my nerves show shouldnt have said that i needed sleep but couldnt have any how long would it be how long before this smell was out of my clothes out of my soul this smell of burning tilneys voice came from behind me well i think thatll do it for now he snapped the recorder off anything else occurs to you give me a buzz i turned round from the window all right now get me in to see shatner will you he looked at me dont you think you ought to crash first no he puckered his lips then picked up the phone and talked to a couple of people trying to find shatner the controls arent easy to run to ground in this place theyre either in signals or briefing or debriefing or holed up with the top brass working out our destinies where to put which ferret in the field and how soon how to run him and when to call him in how much risk to put on his back and how much mercy to show him when it looks like breaking i was not on this black winter morning inclined to think good of anyone he can see you in half an hour tilney said cupping the mouthpiece that suit you yes where will you be they can page me put your head down somewhere he said there are a few rooms here cubicles really where we can get some sleep if we need to ill try but when i left him i went along to the signals room to put in time not eager for the nightmares that sleep would bring there were only a few people at the floodlit mission boards stacey freeman holmes and a couple of new recruits up from training at norfolk only two of the boards were active with their code names chalked at the top stingray and scimitar croder chief of signals wasnt in here so there couldnt be much going on i told them i wanted to talk to the ambassador but it didnt do any good they wouldnt let you into the embassy this was freeman manning the board for scimitar he didnt look worried they said i could come back tomorrow listen i think then there was some static and all we could hear was his voice behind it nothing intelligible holmes had looked up when id come in and now he was wandering across a cup of coffee in his hand but id say whats happened is that hes caught some of the fallout from the palace coup and hes lying low cant see me or anyone else this whole scenes a mess theyve sacked god knows how many diplomats but they cant even get a plane out holmes was standing beside me what sort of night bloody he was watching me steadily in the backwash from the floodlit mission boards flaying yourself i assume why dont you bugger off he meant well but that wasnt the point i didnt want to talk about it that was an hour ago and she hasnt shown up at the board for stingray one of the new people was looking edgy leaning forward over the console do you think its a trap in a moment i dont know yes by his tone he thought it was a trap but didnt want to say so didnt want to make it real the name on the board was flecke shadow executive in the field and in a way i wasnt surprised he was a worldclass womaniser and therefore a target for any kind of honey trap the opposition wanted to set up hed been warned more than once about this and ferris had refused to work with him on pagoda in bangkok said he could endanger the mission if its a trap what are your options have you got any support out no the voice coming from the speaker sounded a little tight now i came here alone holmes left me and went over to the central console and picked up one of the phones presumably to ask the chief of signals to get here with a new man at the board and flecke out there in thailand caught in a trap theyd need croder to take over are you under surveillance at the moment i cant tell this is the market area with people milling about holmes came back from the phone and looked at me and said come on i need a break and we went down to the caff together because he needed to do this and if i didnt let him hed be miserable tilney phoned me he said just after you left him i know you dont want to talk about it but at least you can listen daisy came limping over with some tea for us and wiped the table down and left wet streaks and went away again and holmes turned his dark serious eyes on me and said from what i gather you couldnt have done anything if youd blocked off the mercedes when it came up in the mirror it could have gone off the road and you could have found out it was a perfectly innocent citizen out for a joy ride and going a bit too fast and you could have got him killed when you realised what that car was going to do you had about half a second to get in its way and you were something like a hundred yards behind not terribly easy he sipped his tea reflectively so what we finish up with is a perfectly competent shadow executive sitting here flaying himself alive in front of his old friend holmes without the slightest justification and said holmes finds it thoroughly distasteful i didnt say anything he didnt want me to the first of the winter daylight was coming through the small high windows it would be creeping among the trees out there touching the blackened wreck giving it highlights it isnt holmes said that i dont know how you feel i just want you to stop feeling it if you like we could go along to a funfair tonight and bash the bumpers off the dodgem cars and get some of that lovely adrenaline out of the bloodstream would that be nice he watched me from under his thick black brows trying to size up exactly how bad things were with me he would have a rough idea holmes is the most sentient being in the whole of this bloody building in a moment i said itll pass he said quietly not with you it wont not so soon take a bit of time yes theres no hurry most of the really shitty situations in life dont have an immediate answer they have to work themselves out the problem with this one was that they were absolutely right tilney and holmes nobody could have stopped mccane getting killed last night given the set up obtaining but in a bleak shadowed corner of my mind the excoriating monologue kept up its whispering he asked you to protect him and what happened he was killed what bothers me holmes said a bit is that tilney says youre suddenly very keen to see mr shatner i dont like that i dont like that at all watching me steadily hed made the quantum leap and it jarred me because shatner might do the same and refuse me the mission my only chance was that holmes knew me very well and was exceptionally sensitive even intuitive whereas id never seen much of shatner we were almost strangers he might not see what i was after would you like a nice buttered bun old horse you go ahead i said even if i could have eaten anything the buns in here were like bits off a boulder and for butter read margarine i dont think i will he stirred the scum on the surface of his tea on the other hand if you can get away with it i realise a thing like that would deal with quite a lot of the angst going on in your soul and that of course would please me the eyeforaneye principle really does do the job despite the fact that in my opinion its morally indefensible but then again youre not passionately concerned with my opinion on the moral indefensibility of anything in the world are you not really i took another go at the tea it tasted like sewage but it was hot and there was enough caffeine in it to keep sleep away for a bit and give me the edge id need for my meeting with shatner but in the final analysis holmes said and i began listening carefully because his voice had gone very quiet what really worries me is that if they decide to put a mission on the board to deal with the mccane incident and if they give it to you since youre obviously going to ask for it you might easily somewhere along the line blow everything up his eyes watched mine blow everything up he said just because youre a man of too much overweening pride and you cant stand the idea that youve failed someone tell me he said gently if im talking absolute rubbish in a moment i said no youre not because there was a risk yes if i let personal considerations get in the way of the mission its one of the really critical dangers we face when were out there in the field because it doesnt come from the opposition it comes from inside ourselves pull up the drawbridge and drop the portcullis but the enemy within the citadel will undo you holmes lowered his head an inch his eyes watching me from the deepened shadow of his brows i know of course that theres nothing i can do to stop you all i ask is that before you take a risk as big as that youll give it some thought before you see mr shatner and if you still decide to see him be very very careful shatner i was on the third floor when they paged me and i saw shatner coming out of clearance and waited for him while he ducked his head back through the doorway for a moment tell him that if he cant get here in time ill send someone along to clear him on the plane he came into the corridor again and saw me and gave me a direct look taking in the nerves and the fatigue oh yes you want to talk to me dont you he led me along to his room on the other side of codes and ciphers dropping into one of the big leather chairs with the torn hide stuffing coming out of them in places theyd furnished this whole building from a discount junk shop typical of them wont spend a bloody penny if they can help it you try fiddling your expense sheet and theyll go for the throat tilneys spoken to me i took the other chair and got a whiff of ancient horsehair as i sat down i didnt say anything youve nothing you want to add he watched me with no particular expression a man with dark untidy hair and bags under his eyes and a flat nightshift pallor leaning forward attentive nothing you want to tell me i mean as mccanes control that you might not have wanted to confide to tilney no when youre debriefed youre debriefed i never keep anything back unless its to protect someone perhaps that was what shatner meant id never thought mccane was especially good on security for instance talked a bit too much when there were people around didnt take overmuch care to check his environment for ticks peeps bugs it could have got him killed last night he might have talked to someone about where he was going and then realised it had been dangerous that could have been his reason for phoning me to cover himself shatner said then i dont know why you want to see me you were mccanes control i was there when they got him there might be questions you want to ask i might not have covered everything with tilney another thing is id like to take over he moved his head up a fraction from mccane yes why id got it ready i havent been in the field for nearly two months and mccane was on my level so it must be something id be able to handle then one of his phones rang and he reached across to the desk yes stretched out like that hed got one foot half out of his shoe a hole in his sock then tell them to route him through paris and phyllis no more calls he dropped the phone and sat back and looked at me and said its not your style to ask for a mission you tend to play hard to get two months is a long time im getting bored i tried to make light of it but his eyes were on me and i knew what i looked like cold with shock still and the nerves flickering there was nothing you could have done bullshit theres always something you can do so i knew what i looked like not quite your eager beaver just dying to see his name on the board again how do you feel quiller and here it came about what happened last night how do you feel personally tread carefully it was a shock of course what else i looked away i suppose i feel a bit responsible or at least i did for a while but tilney pointed out that i shouldnt blame myself and holmes agreed i see he waited until i was looking back at him so you dont feel any lingering sense of guilt not really or anger watching me carefully oh i think ive got over that sort of thing by now hes not the first man ive seen killed shatner waited in case i made the silly mistake of adding something of protesting too much i didnt the phone rang again and the sound brought the sweat out on me because that had been tricky going you couldnt have been listening shatner was saying on the phone i asked for no more calls he dropped it and sat back again and i saw a look of sudden fatigue on his face i suppose hed been up most of the night too because signals would have passed on my message about mccane this man had also had his executive wiped out on home ground and without any warning and he must have had a lot to do in the last few hours i dont know you he said all that well im not keen on running people i dont know i didnt say anything if i begged for this job id never get it pressing the bridge of his nose his eyes squeezed shut youve got a reputation for giving your controls a bad time im not keen on that either i got out of the chair and a spring twanged well theres only a couple of boards active so youve got plenty of people to choose from i was at the door when he said i rather think this is a time for tolerance dont you on both sides i was trying to make it easy for you he got up too and moved around not looking at me now needing to think that was my impression i stayed by the door ive called westerby in from bucharest he said to take over yes hows his german shatner swung me a look had mccane talked about germany when he phoned you last night no he went on moving around the small untidy room id got holmes to fill me in on mccane before we left the caff and hed told me hed come back from berlin the night before so i assumed that was where shatner had been running him id also asked holmes about shatner and it was interesting apart from a few other things hed run tewson in budapest earlier this year and flown there himself to direct the endphase when things had got sticky and not many of them will do that only croder loman childs nobody else i can think of because its so dangerous at that stage shatner had also brought farrow in from sri lanka with a broken thigh and a bullet in him not personally that time but hed organised a lastditch rescue operation through signals with a dozen people in support and orders to use deadly force if they had to no big deal in a place like sri lanka but the bureau is terribly touchy about that sort of thing i might not be in bad hands if shatner agreed to run me in berlin give or take a stray shot or a blown cover westerbys german is adequate shatner said at last but yours is rather better from what i hear youve worked there havent you two or three times i can pass for a native berliner can you now i was still standing by the door and he said for gods sake come and sit down again i compromised and perched on the arm of the chair ready to get up and get out of here if he looked like arguing the toss for much longer if he didnt give me the mission id do the thing i wanted to do some other way i was ready to drop by now and past the point where id lie staring at nightmares on the ceiling youre more conversant then shatner said with berlin than westerby is that makes a difference im a bit surprised you didnt send for me in the first place hed known my background he must have all the controls have got to do in this place is press a button and the computers throw you on the screen like an xray he stood still for a moment and looked at me as ive told you youre not my favourite executive thats a bloody shame i was getting fed up with him now that weve got that over he said lets remember that weve both had a rather trying night and make mutual allowances when can you take over from mccane the focus of this operation shatner said is on a man named maitland or rather on his death we were already into preliminary briefing and the little room was full of smoke hed asked me if id mind his having a cigarette which i thought was civil of him maitland was a cultural attache at our embassy in berlin fond of the city active in his job though for some reason not particularly well liked among his colleagues a week ago he was murdered and his body taken away his flat had been broken into with some violence and the police found evidence of massive blood loss there were marks on the floor indicating that his body had been dragged out of the flat to the lift the telephone was hanging by its cable hed been talking to a woman friend who came forward when the flat was entered she reported sounds of the door being smashed in an outbreak of voices and finally a cry maitlands car was also broken into and rigorously searched the upholstery slashed open and the carpets dragged up shatner reached for the dented chromium ashtray on his desk the foreign office suspected that the new generation of the red army faction was involved and asked us to make enquiries i sent mccane out there the fo approached us instead of di we are able to do things as you know that di cannot but i mean its that sensitive he flicked ash ive been in signals most of the night with some of our agentsinplace out there they couldnt give me much more than a certain amount of raw intelligence but the vibrations im getting are that there may be more to maitlands death than some kind of crude wet affair yes indeed theyd tagged mccane back to london and wiped him out as soon as they found him exposed you didnt get anything useful from mccane when you debriefed him surprisingly little he ran into a lot of resistance when he started asking questions his feeling was that people either didnt want to answer them or were afraid to thats not unusual of course when theres a strong terrorist faction at large and active why did you call mccane in for debriefing partly he got up and went over to a window freeing the fastener and thumping at the frame until it jerked open an inch sending down flakes of paint and partly because his enquiries led him to think that the person who might know more about what was going on is maitlands wife widow he brushed bits of paint off his jacket and sat down again and she lives in reigate yes mccane was going there last night to put up at a hotel and see her this morning thats where i start that is where you start he crushed out his cigarette i dont think i need to point out that you may well attract the attention of these people simply by showing up in reigate you dont normally like support do you only when i ask for it thats a pity it could finish you off one fine day i just hope it doesnt happen while im running you i went back to my flat in sloane square and showered and slept for three hours when i got up i put the clothes id worn last night into a plastic bag and phoned harry and asked him to take them to the cleaners as soon as he could the smell of burning was pervasive lingering then i phoned the stage door at the st jamess but thea was in the middle of rehearsal and i left a message saying i couldnt make it this evening and phoned the conservatory and asked them to send flowers for the opening night tomorrow it was eleven oclock when i checked in again at the bureau they told me theyd arranged for me to have tea with helen maitland in reigate at four and that gave me time to look over the documented briefing that shatner had given mccane and go over the present situation in berlin regarding the red army factions activities shatner said there was no need for me to go through clearance at this stage a lot was going to depend on how much helen maitland was prepared to help us and whether she could give us any positive information to work on when i left whitehall and drove south along millbank by the thames i didnt have any sense of professional engagement shatner had officially started running me but there was no actual mission on the board and the truth was after all that the reason that was driving me south from london on this cold november afternoon was purely personal i owed a man a death helen she was standing in the middle of the lawn behind the house perfectly still her back to me there was frost on the grass and dead leaves their edges silvered in the last of the winter daylight a birdbath stood on a stone pedestal with ice in it and something else a small rounded object perhaps a dead bird i couldnt quite see from here id rung the doorbell at the front of the house but couldnt hear any sound id knocked but not too hard this was a house of grief then id come along the narrow redbrick path and through the gate by the hedge and seen her there on the lawn a thin figure hunched in a sheepskin coat facing away from the house i couldnt see that she was watching anything in particular there was a tennis court and a summer house and farther away a shed with some gardening tools leaning against it and the door half open it was intensely quiet here but in the distance there was traffic its sounds muted it seemed by the cold and the lowering dark she turned round and saw me i hadnt gone close not wanting to startle her we stood facing each other for a time in silence then she spoke who are you victor locke im sorry to disturb you i meant her reverie shed known i was coming it was just four she seemed not to connect then said oh yes youre coming to tea she still didnt move at this distance she looked insubstantial a small cold face above the coat her hands tucked into the sleeves her feet together in their fleecelined boots there was a toy railway engine not far from where she stood lying on its side among the frosted leaves i hadnt been briefed that the maitlands had any children i went towards her thats right im sorry about your husband there was no expression in her cool grey eyes though she looked at me without blinking not at me perhaps but at all the things i meant because i was here all the things she was going to have to do now that she was a widow that was my impression i was breaking into the small confusing world that was taking its place between the old one where her husband had been and the new one where he would not be oh she said at last not having heard what id said perhaps or not knowing how to answer are you in the foreign office im in one of their lesserknown departments not true but the lesserknown bit should give her the idea that she shouldnt ask for specifics she thought about that she was pretty in an ethereal way pale and cool and still i couldnt see her playing tennis but of course she might have looked quite different a week ago before it had happened wed better go in she said but it had the sound of a question not unless you want to she might not feel like being in the house now that it was empty perhaps that was why shed come out here but youd like some tea not really oh she watched me quietly for a moment then looked around and said we could sit down i suppose there were some rusticlooking chairs at the edge of the lawn where the tennis court began their white paint beginning to peel am i being terribly unwelcoming she said it without a smile dipping her head so that her long fair hair swung a little look i said this isnt a social visit and i want to make it as painless for you as i can in a moment painless that was the first clue i need to ask you about berlin they told you didnt they yes but thats all right she moved at last walking across to one of the garden chairs her suede boots leaving streaks on the frost she walked with a slight sway as if through water i dont mind talking about berlin i expect i seem a little distrait everything was rather sudden and of course beastly she perched on the arm of the chair throwing her hair back and looking at me a little defensively i thought no one likes questions about something theyd rather forget i said we want to know what happened over there your husband was his name is george was george you can call him that all right he was well into the scene in berlin knew a lot of people he did a good job at the embassy so i imagine he was pretty popular there not very people tend to envy success dont they i dragged a chair over and hitched myself onto the arm i dont think it was that quite he was rather cocky you see he wasnt too wellliked outside the embassy either would you say not enormously there was a face over there in the hedge in a gap in the hedge but not so unpopular i said that people would want to harm him oh no he was just i mean he was just george rather supercilious no i think it was the red army faction that killed him the police think so do you she seemed surprised ive never thought otherwise then she said he was provoking them i believe oh really how asking too many questions id say why was he interested in the faction she swung her head a little perhaps trying to clear her mind or it was just a mannerism some women do it to show off their long hair without thinking are you feeling better now the voice came from the hedge from the small round face in the gap in the hedge yes helen called yes thank you darling whos that man hes just a friend she threw me a quick little smile the first one id seen it changed her completely whats his name then there was another voice from the garden next door billy come in at once theres a man there billy called oh for goodness sake come in at once im awfully sorry helen dont worry he just wanted to know i was all right there was the sound of scuffling among dead leaves and a final cry as the battle was lost can i have my engine back billy you little brat more scuffling ill give you a ring this evening helen all right a door slammed over there helen looked around her then down at her hands im sorry where were we exactly we were talking about the red army faction i said but lets cut a few corners there must be someone in berlin who could give me some clues about your about george i mean someone among his friends my department wants me to go over there and see what i can find out we want to know who killed him in a moment she looked up so do i it was such a beastly thing to do to a man even to him that was the second clue i wasnt sure that she was really aware of what shed said of how it sounded i left it its probably occurred to you that if you decided to help us in berlin you might be running a risk she looked surprised a risk of what george was murdered you were his wife but i never had anything to do with whatever he was doing he didnt take me into his confidence about anything i was just his she looked away and said in a moment i dont think id be risking anything it doesnt worry me the thing is i really dont see how i can help you knew his friends she looked down she did it quite often he didnt actually have any friends not real ones there were lots of acquaintances he was the first cultural attache as you probably know lots of parties picnics with what he called cultivatable people always something going on but no real friends in the silence we heard the starlings and robins rustling among the frosted leaves a vehicle in the distance with its exhaust pipe blown a man coughing in one of the gardens along the street where smoke rose from a bonfire through the trees did you go to berlin often quite often yes whenever he sent for me i mean whenever he needed me you didnt want to stay over there in berlin instead of making all those trips i dont like berlin its too fast too frenetic after somewhere like reigate a shy smile i like quiet places old places so what i was going to do was leave her here in peace and tell shatner it wasnt on she couldnt help us didnt know any of maitlands friends because hed never had any i would go to berlin under cover and start from scratch shed had quite enough of that place and her last memory of it had been beastly the brutal end of a man shed known not loved but known quite well or had she loved him even a man like him there was she said suddenly now that i think of it someone you could call a friend of his they had a lot of meetings george often said ive got a meeting with willi perhaps a breakthrough can you give me his address she looked at me quickly he wouldnt see you he doesnt trust anyone now because of what happened did you go to any of these meetings with him no but i saw quite a lot of him at the parties and she shrugged around so wed got to go through with it after all would he see me if you took me to him personally she thought about it yes is that what you want me to do one of the hardest things in this trade is to keep some kind of liking for yourself some selfrespect while youre doing the things youve got to do yes i said and as a sop i suppose to my conscience but dont underestimate the risks with a nice smile i expect youre being oversolicitous not really do you know for instance that your house is being watched she swung her head to look at me this house yes why would anyone do that she didnt know what had happened to mccane they might be waiting for you to leave so that they can make a search george could have left something here or concealed something they searched his car in berlin and his flat or of course the man out there in the black vauxhall could be waiting for me i was here in a dead mans shoes i believe she shivered slightly under the heavy coat i wasnt sure she looked cold despite the sheepskin cold or afraid or both dont worry i told her about the man out there well take care of him and you wont see him again i blew into my hands on second thoughts some tea might be rather nice warm us up what do you think she stood up at once im sorry yes im not doing terribly well am i as a hostess as we went across the lawn she asked but what will you do about the man out there then immediately i shouldnt ask i expect he wont bother you thats all that matters i picked up the battered red railway engine youd better look after this or youll be in trouble the smile came again like a flash of soft light poor billy hes got asthma or at least thats what they think it is she led me through a small conservatory at the back of the house with some galoshes in a row and straw for tying plants a big amaryllis in a pot the smell of earth and dampness if youre still willing i said to go to berlin how soon could you make it she stopped and turned and we were suddenly close and i caught her perfume and looked into the cool grey eyes and wondered what in fact she had been to george maitland i was just his and shed looked away i havent any plans she said i could go whenever you wanted me to tonight tonight yes ill check with my department see if they can get tickets whatever you say she took me into a large lowceilinged room with beams and a brick fireplace and a small grand piano framed photographs on a cabinet copies of connoisseur on a wicker stool a glove lying on them its pair on the floor just below a mans his and some road maps the room was in perfect order but as she went past the stool she didnt pick up the glove though she saw it and i think hesitated before she went through into the kitchen sit down wont you she said over her shoulder what sort of tea do you like ive got earl grey lapsang souchong whatever youre having can i use the phone but please its over there i went across to it there was an answering machine switched off i dialled a random number and heard the solenoid trip in and waited for the voice on the tape to tell me id dialled a number that wasnt in service then i rang off i could see helen maitland through the hatchway into the kitchen she was putting some water into a kettle i i switched on the answering machine im just going out to the car i told her if the phone rings do you mind not picking it up let the machine take it in a moment watching me through the hatchway all right i went out to the jaguar and got on the phone to signals and asked for shatner a car was going past the end of the driveway and i slid low in the seat until it had gone some starlings were lined up along the telephone wires nagging and preening there was no other sound this was a peaceful part of the world and i was sorry we were asking this young widow to go to berlin and into possible danger it seemed like gratuitous abuse but some of the things shed said on the lawn had been interesting it was such a beastly thing to do to a man even to him i never had anything to do with whatever he was doing i was just his wife chattle there was something subservient about her unquestioning i havent any plans i could go whenever you wanted me to whatever you say yes shatner i said im there now the house is being watched and the phones bugged shes ready to go over there with me how soon can you take care of things here stand by there was a voice calling billys i think not calling to anyone in particular chanting some rhyme or other he was banging at something keeping time i can put some people in there in thirty minutes shatner said or not much more what do you need i need to get her away from the house unseen and then we should put a watch on the place round the clock they may try to break in and make a search and the phone needs clearing he didnt answer right away he might be making notes i didnt know whether he was a man to make notes of things i hoped not i wanted a control with instant memory to run me in the field youll get a call he said about half an hour i went back into the house do you take milk no pleasant smell of lapsang dry and smoky sugar no silver tray white linen sugar tongs no one had phoned the machine wasnt blinking look i dont want to rush you i said but how long would it take you to pack her head swung up how long for a day or two i cant say exactly she gave me my tea if its any more than that i can buy things shed taken her coat and boots off while id gone to the car she was slighter than shed seemed ive been trained to pack quickly he never gave me any warning when he wanted me out there she conjured a faint smile to mean she hadnt minded she had give me twenty minutes all i need is makeup and some undies and things she was leaning forward over the teatray small stockinged feet together hands on the front of her thighs a lock of fair hair hanging across her cheek would that be quick enough just right id like to leave here in about half an hour do you use a security service no alarm system yes but i never switch it on really george never asked you to when you left the place empty no or i would have never mind we dont need to set it today either my departments going to look after this house with a twentyfourhour guard so you dont have to worry about a thing her eyes widened a little i see all right she straightened up ill take mine up with me shall i she was actually waiting for me i thought to approve of course im sorry its not quite the leisurely tea party you were thinking of that isnt why you came no are there phones upstairs yes theres one in the bedroom dont answer it if it rings all right i looked round the room while she was upstairs there was just an ordinary lock on the door to the conservatory no deadbolt and nothing on the windows just the usual fastener the alarm system wasnt wired it went through a master control from sensors there was only one of them here and it was a big room and maitland never asked her to set the alarm system anyway even though she was apparently away in berlin with him fairly often ive been trained to pack quickly perhaps his flat over there was the same with no real security i thought it was odd that anyone should have rifled his car and smashed their way into his flat and killed him so viciously when he didnt seem to have expected any kind of trouble at all was i quick enough she stood with her feet together at the bottom of the stairs looking very young in a cashmere sweater and slacks and soft flat shoes holding a lufthansa bag shed put more scent on but it seemed almost precocious yes i said and you look very nice i was hoping you might say that have some more tea i said we dont have to go just yet all right she never questioned anything hadnt said then i neednt have hurried her slight breasts moved under the cashmere as she leaned over the teatray would you like some more too thank you no i wondered for the first time whether i should have put my trust in shatner because in the next ten minutes or so wed be in a red sector last night theyd killed mccane and it looked as if theyd killed him because hed been coming here to see maitiands widow id come farther than he had i was here with her now will they she began and then the telephone rang and she jumped slightly and looked at me and i shook my head the answeringmachine cut in this is george maitland i cant come to the telephone now but if youll leave your name number and any message ill phone you back as soon as i can we were listening to a dead mans voice but she didnt react in any way she was sitting on the floor with her legs to one side cupping her tea in both hands the beep sounded er yes this is jim down at the garage we can pick up your car any time you say and have the oil changed and everything before seven tonight give us a buzz if you want us to fetch it will you numbers thank you another beep i said is it all right if we have someone sleep here while youre in berlin a place like this would have a guest room she seemed surprised if you think its necessary she hadnt got the message yet a lot of things were going to be necessary now yes all right she said theres always a bed made up in the guest room well need the keys i went over and picked up her bag the initials gkm on the leather in brass she didnt have luggage of her own all the keys just the front door she got them from her worn suede bag she liked old places perhaps old things too id better lock up all round she said dont worry theyll move in the minute weve left it took her a moment to accept that too she didnt ask where they were coming from or how long it would take them the only clue she had was that she hadnt asked her garage to do an oil change and there probably wasnt a man working there called jim she was learning not to ask questions if she could help it and that was going to be very convenient i said well be on our way then shall we it was nearly dark when we went outside again when youre away for any length of time you leave the answeringmachine on do you yes i dropped her bag into the boot of my car and shut the lid quietly theyll monitor every message and send the daily take to you in berlin will that be all right its not important really theyll only be from you know the tradespeople or marjorie next door or my mother they need to there wont be any calls for george from people who havent heard he never had many calls he was in berlin most of the time i opened the passenger door for her and she got in her fair hair swinging i shut the door without slamming it and went round to the other side the street lights had come on but they werent very high or very bright this was a quiet street on the edge of the town a cat was loping across the pavement opposite its eyes trapping the light for an instant as it turned to look at us would you like to slide down a bit i asked helen on the seat she turned to look at me all right i picked up the phone and dialled and waited the head of the cat moved like a hunters its shoulders flexed rhythmically under the dark fur thered be a small gift of some sort on the mat by morning an offering to its patrons perhaps the bloodied entrails of a rat jim here i said the house is open and ive left the key of the front door on the teatray in the sitting room that all right sure well be there whats your setup i asked him ill give you a countdown then you can move okay all right listen if a boy called billy from next door comes and asks for his railway engine back give it to him its in the little conservatory next to the amaryllis pot will do i started the engine ready when you are i put the phone back and looked at helen and said seat belt im always forgetting she said jims voice started sounding over the speaker all right ten nine eight a bit lower i said to helen can you she slid down some more easing her thin hips under the lap strap just for a minute i told her then you can sit up again i didnt want her silhouette presenting a target against the street lights five four three i shifted into gear two one zero i took it gently at first because i didnt want any squeal from the tyres but as soon as we were out of the driveway i gunned up a little and then a lot as we straightened a lit of a whimper from the treads but it didnt matter now because jim was going into the routine in the street up there and we heard a crash of metal and then glass smashing as i hit second and gave her the gun and then there was quite a lot of tyre scream from behind us as the vauxhall tried backing up and swinging clear but jim would have been waiting for that and got in its way again with a lot of noise as we reached the corner and i took the side street and said you can sit up now solitaire shatner lit another cigarette screwing up his eyes against the smoke whats she like i dont think hed slept as i had since id seen him last i would say hed been in signals with berlin again exhaustively shy i said quiet nervy guileless subservient hed told me we were putting her up at the holiday inn at heathrow until the plane left theyd had a car waiting for her when wed reached whitehall subservient shatner said dominated by maitland do you think yes but id say she was like that when he married her we were trying to get a bearing on maitlands character it could be important i mean women dont usually let a man dominate them unless theyve been set up by their fathers first shatner dropped ash what was their relationship would you say i told him how shed spoken of her husband not lovingly look i said shes got to come with me to persuade willi hartman to talk to me and hes our only access for the moment but as soon as i can i want to send her back home shes appallingly vulnerable shatner watched me through the smoke the light yellowing his dry pale face the bags under his eyes making shadows is she attractive yes but i want to get her out of berlin anyway the minute hartmans accepted me it doesnt matter a damn what she looks like i take your point in a moment now tell me how this maitland affair strikes you i thought about it id say his death wouldnt have looked very important as an isolated incident taken out of context but the opposition cell presumably the red army faction sent some people over here from berlin to monitor mccane and when they knew he was going to see maitlands widow they thought it was worth killing him to prevent it they put a peep on maitlands house in reigate and they bugged the telephone and when your support group got me away from there the opposition went crazy i heard them so i believe maitlands death is now looking very important and id say he was killed because he had something on the faction and it was something quite big big enough for us to take an interest in the telephone rang and shatner took the receiver off and dropped it into a drawer i happen to have reached the same conclusion i think we should give it mission status and send you in as the executive youre still ready to offer your services yes i thought it was a rather elegant way to put it and it pleased me if at some time in the future i fetched up in a wrecked car or a smashed telephone box or a cell running with rats it was going to help a little just a little to know that control was running things with a certain degree of elegance and that i might because of it survive ive set a few things up he said and opened the drawer and put the phone back and if youve had enough sleep we can get you cleared right away ive called in thrower from pakistan to direct you in the field has he handled you before no i think youll like his style hes worked mostly in europe before now has good german and a lot of experience youll go in with the cover of a mediumweight arms dealer objections no it was perfect logic if theres one thing a terrorist faction loves its an arms dealer from your records shatner said youre quite well versed in that area but ill send someone along to update the scene for you he got out of his swivel chair and moved around hands stuck in his pockets a shoelace undone i dont know what time your flight is for berlin tonight but ive asked travel to make it as late as possible because i want you to see a man at the national temperance hospital before you leave london hes had some experience with the red army faction and quite recently so he might be able to fill you in a little im not sure he looked at me sharply im not sure of that but its to be seen he went to the door shoelace trailing and opened it for me standing there hunched with fatigue in his leatherpatched jacket youll be making any direct signals to the board through the crew on duty but youll be able to call on mr croder if you need to and i shall be within reach bureau one is in london and we can bring him in if things get difficult he offered me a dry nicotinestained hand lets hope they wont mary she gave me my card back can you come down i didnt say id go on up and save mary the trouble id been here before and knew the rules you dont get onto the second floor of the national temperance hospital unless youre a close relative of a patient or unless youve got first class credentials and an introduction usually from a department of hm government righto the woman said at the front desk then on the second floor is the clinic of the medical foundation for the care of victims of torture and it offers treatment with a guarantee of the closest possible secrecy mary was middleaged quiet in her speech and had the otherworld calm of a nun you can see him for a few minutes she told me in the lift just a few minutes thats all he was in a private room the man i didnt know his name and nobody here knew mine it wasnt on the card id shown the woman downstairs he was in a wheelchair a book on his lap quantum healing one of his hands his right hand buried under the plaid rug a bandage covering half his face some of his thin dry hair sticking up at the side i said hello he turned his head to look up at me a touch of fear in his eyes i thought and that would be natural if things have been taken too far usually in some kind of interrogation cell we fear strangers afterwards as i had once for a time hes a friend mary told him oh what have you come for you dont in this place say things like to ask a few questions hed had enough of questions and he was here because hed refused to answer them they said youve had a brush with the red army faction i told him and sat down on the edge of his bed so that he didnt have to look up at me any more im going to berlin tonight and probably run across them i thought you might feel like giving me a few tips so i can keep out of trouble he watched me for a bit his eyes full of intelligence they hadnt pulled his brains out and thrown them away they sometimes do not physically of course but it comes to the same thing you cant do any more thinking i see he said there was a drip of mucus under his nose and mary got a kleenex oh shit he said couldnt feel it he blew his nose still watching me as if he darent look away in case i did something i understood that too the faction he said in a minute yes well contrary to popular belief theyre still alive and well not the old ones the new ones not baader and meinhof of course no the story put out was that theyd committed suicide in their cells in stammheim prison but weve never taken that seriously the main thing was they were dead theres a third generation now isnt there third or fourth they keep a low profile you cant easily infiltrate it was a piece of cake once but thats over the man at the top now is dieter klaus and i hope to christ you never run into him mary he said tell me if i start dripping again will you i hate that he sat clutching the box of kleenex theyd worked on his face over there and it was still numbed could even stay like that dieter klaus yes hes inhuman i put him down now as department of information by his idiom low profile infiltrate again i avoided a question he shouldnt be too hard to find hed begun shaking now setting up a vibration in the springs of the wheelchair we listened to it mary and i then the man said hell be extremely difficult to find after the wall came down there were all kinds of rats running all over the place because stasis division xxii was broken up and their terrorist guests had to find some other kind of shelter and there isnt any not now not in the new germany the spring in the wheelchair had started a definite rhythm now as the whole of his thin body began shaking under the blanket i thought i might not have much longer here so i interrupted him some people say theyve based themselves in frankfurt frankfurt oh yes some of them are there dont confuse dieter klaus with dieter lenz though the police got lenz for blowing up herrhausens mercedes remember dieter klaus has never been arrested for anything because hes a cut above your usual terrorist he was with monika helbing and werner lotz when they got picked up christine duemlein was there too and got copped but klaus simply vanished in a puff of smoke hes very agile very clever and a real shit i should keep away from him if i were you i mean at the moment youre just a visitor here arent you the shaking getting worse every minute because i was bringing it all back and id asked mary about that in the lift but shed said it would be good for him to talk they were all trying to get him to bring it out as she called it all well and good but the sweat was starting to come out on his face giving it a bright sheen willi told me much the same thing i said willi hartman did he he clawed another tissue out of the box and kept it pressed to his nose well there you are the sweat was running into his eyes and mary went to the box too whos willi hartman the man asked me not looking at me any more looking down then letting his eyes close as mary pressed the lids gently with the tissue i thought you might know him i said not an uncommon name not uncommon his tone had a deadness to it suddenly he spoke like an old man weary of talking any more keep away i would he said keep away from those bastards if you know if you know whats good for you theyre not theyre not the original angels of of mercy you understand theyre just theyre just a bunch of fucking terrorists you see just just a bunch his voice changing to a spasm of coughing that went on and on with some words in it some stuff mary need more stuff please but she was already at the little white table by the bed filling a syringe as the coughing went on and on and i took his hand and held it for a while the wheelchair shaking as if it had an engine running it the needle going in while i crouched lower so as not to get in her way as she said quietly im afraid times up now i said yes and thanked her and squeezed his cold emaciated hand and left them going out and past the lift and down the stairs and into the lamp lit street when i got back to whitehall a man came across the little square at the back of the building and said through the window you can leave your car here and theyll run it over to your place my names bloom and im driving you to the airport all right are we cutting it fine not too bad but we dont want to im not cleared yet youll do it on the way he took me across to the dark green rover parked by the railings and i got in and the man in the back asked me is there anything you need from the office is there a bag on board he was loder hed cleared me before yes in the boot bloom shut the rear door and went round and got behind the wheel your flights leaving at so theres plenty of time but you know you can always get a puncture loder put a thin briefcase onto my lap have a look through it see if its all there bloom took us into the evening traffic south through parliament square i signed the medical form and the codicil and the active service waiver and checked the maps two of berlin with different scales one of the whole country hotel reservation expense sheet embassy contacts signals grid signed for the bag though i hadnt checked it but they knew my sizes by now no next of kin money to the battered wives home take this bloody thing i said and gave loder the expense sheet my director in the field would have one and he could look after it for me one of the really trying chores of a mission was having to deal with those arthritic old harpies in accounts when you got back and im often tempted to charge them for a bag of cocaine or a tart or a stealth bomber just to get the dust out of their bustles looking good loder said what hed been watching me i suppose in the pale shifting light of the street lamps as we turned west along victoria street im feeling fine i said yes theres never been anything official about it in the book of rules but the people in clearance make a point of catching our mood if they can because theyre the last people we see before we leave the building and the mission starts running and what theyre looking for is an abnormal show of nerves theyd pulled one of the new recruits off a courier job last week because theyd noticed ms hands werent all that steady when he was signing the forms have they got a codename for this one yet solitaire loder said its gone up on the board whos the crew gary and matthews theyd be manning the board in shifts around the clock i hadnt worked with gary but i knew matthews one of the old hands a retired sleeper from marseilles and if i needed the chief of signals hed be there croder with his basilisk eyes and his hook of a hand and his coldblooded expertise and if i needed total support at the signals board thered be ashley bureau one host of hosts with a direct line to the prime minister and enough clout to call every agentinplace out of his foxhole and bring in enough fire power to sink a destroyer an exaggeration but you get my drift smell of burning has she been told i asked loder not to recognise me when she sees me at the departure gate but of course i shouldnt have asked it sounded as if i didnt trust shatner to look after even the basics i almost said to loder do you smell burning but of course he didnt it wasnt on my clothes any more or in my hair it was in my head for all the very good reasons the bureau had for sending me to berlin to infiltrate the red army faction perhaps prevent some kind of coup my own reason for going out there still contained an element that was primitive brutish and urgent they had drawn blood berlin she picked up the phone swinging her head to look at me do you want to talk to him yes i said if hes willing there was nothing i wanted to say to hartman over a telephone all we needed to do was make the rendezvous but it would give my voice an identity for him helen dialled this was her room the bureau had chosen the steglitz i was in on the floor below they knew i would want space and distance so that i could check on any tags when she left her room there wouldnt be any at least not tonight only the bureau knew where we were thered been no message for me shatner had said that thrower my director in the field would reach berlin some time tomorrow there was no hurry i didnt need him yet willi she said on the phone this is helen and its just gone ten i thought youd be there im in room at the steglitz will you ring me when you come in any time tonight she put the phone down and turned and looked at me puzzled i rang him from heathrow before we took off from my hotel there he said hed wait in he wouldnt have gone to bed he never sleeps thats why he loves berlin she came slowly across the room watching me worried a jet lowered across the window the lights of the city colouring its wings as it made its way into the airport when you phoned him i said from heathrow how did he sound he said he was glad i was coming to berlin and i mean did he sound nervous nervous about meeting me she thought about it a little i think yes he said i mustnt tell you where he lives hes going to meet us somewhere else that made sense his friend maitland had been dead less than a week and hartman knew that any enquiry would risk exposing him to the faction when he phones i told helen if he doesnt want to talk to me try and reassure him i guarantee his absolute protection tell him that all right would you like something to drink i can ask them to send us nothing for me you go ahead i dont think so although i should be celebrating in a way this is probably the last time ill be in berlin apart from the odd trip she let her eyes wander across the brilliantly lighted streets but its also nice to be here for the first time alone without george she swung her head to look at me the way he died was so beastly and ive only just realised how much i hated him with a small wry smile do you mind if i unpack not a bit there was a copy of stern on the small round table and i went over and picked it up things get so creased she said from behind me and i heard her pulling the zips of the bag open at least mine do i wear cotton when i can i took it that the small talk was to cover the last thing shed told me about hating george i didnt think she wanted any kind of answer but it was interesting and i wondered whether she was feeling a sense of relief that he was dead and had even perhaps seen it coming it was probably the last thing i said youd been expecting she was pulling drawers open im not absolutely sure he was a rather mysterious person rather secretive in fact he was very secretive her voice had become louder and when i looked up i saw shed swung round from the chest of drawers a pair of white cotton briefs in her hand do you think he could have been a spy it sounds possible berlins almost a beautiful city again and look what theyre planning for the potsdamer platz and everything but there are still some very strong undercurrents here arent there you must know about them and george she broke off as the phone rang thats willi she dropped the briefs onto the bed and picked up the telephone hello i went across to her in case hartman let me talk to him oh gerda how are you i covered the mouthpiece and said tell her youll call her back gerda she said do you mind if i call you back im just out of the shower and dripping all over the floor i wondered if shed thought the easy lie was necessary or if it was just social habit when shed hung up i said shes a friend of yours yes gerda schilling ive known her for i want to keep the line clear for willi so if anyone else rings tell them the same thing youll call them back and then i asked her how did gerda know you were here she looked contrite i rang her from heathrow before i left i shouldnt have should it did you ring anyone else no only willi she watched me with something close to fear in her wide grey eyes the fear of authority it told me a little more about george maitland you didnt tell anyone at all that you were staying at the steglitz or that you were coming to berlin no she didnt look away nobody else then dont worry dont talk to anyone until weve met willi whatever you say in a moment you probably think im a bit i dont know naive dont youre just not used to subterfuge thats all oh she said looking down i dont know about that i tell lies easily dont i she looked up again and the shimmering smile came i think its just that im not terribly bright i was a model that was all before i met george ive never had to use my brain a soft laugh it makes life awkward for me a touch of innocence i said is refreshing in this day and age youre very and she was looking for the right word when the phone rang again and i picked it up and gave it to her hallo she turned to me and nodded slightly yes willi dont worry its still not late would you like to have a word with mr locke she listened for a moment all right but he wants you to know that he guarantees your looking at me safety was it his absolute protection he guarantees your absolute protection willi so everythings all right she listened for another minute and then said goodbye and put the phone back were to meet him at the cafe brahms in twenty minutes do you know where it is oh yes ten minutes from here have you been there before yes i how often she began looking anxious again as if shed done something wrong oh just a few times when with willi yes and with george yes then hartman wasnt terribly bright either i said i just need to know things like that dont worry in a moment youll be rather glad to be rid of me wont you when i leave berlin not really but ive guaranteed your absolute protection too so weve got to take a few little precautions but yes in point of fact i would be very glad indeed when i could put helen maitland onto a plane for london in reigate id thought she was vulnerable and she was but here in berlin i realised she was also a distinct risk to security her own mine and the bureaus solitaire was running close to exposure there was a cold drizzle in the air when we walked out of the lobby at the steglitz and got a cab and drove through the late evening traffic how big i asked helen is the cafe brahms not very she sat close to me her thigh against mine her face looked cold and pinched in the coloured light from the street she was sitting close because she wanted to touch someone who knew much more about what was going on than she did she needed to feel the protection id told her about this was my impression its a basement she said the cafe brahms im going to drop you off there i said i want you to sit as close as you can to the bar where i can find you easily why arent you coming in with me ive got a chore to do ill be there as soon as willi is dont worry what does he look like she was picking at her nails looking out of the windows at the street willi oh hes short thirty or so with a nervous smile he usually wears a rather rakish trilby face she thought about it hes got blue eyes hes germanlooking in that way blond hair thinning a bit hes selfconscious about it we were going east along steglitzer damm crossing bismarck the pavements were shining under the drizzle what kind of nose i cant really say ive noticed tale skin red a heavy face oh no pale and sort of soft mouth i kept on at her until id got all i could it was going to be a situation where i could make a mistake if i werent careful will he be coming by car do you think or by taxi i dont think hes got a car if he leaves the city he flies i see how far is it now were almost there the next block her arm was resting along my thigh i could feel its warmth everythings all right is it of course as i told you were just taking precautions dont worry by this time tomorrow youll be back in reigate are your people there mummy is theyre separated you see your father much nervous smile i havent seen him for ages hes all right i suppose but he likes playing the patriarch mummy finally couldnt stand it the taxi began slowing id like to see gerda before i leave berlin and some other friends her head was turned to watch me id forget it for now wait till things have blown over and please dont leave the hotel or even phone anyone unless you check with me first do that for me in a moment whatever you say and im not being patriarchal a soft laugh know cafe brahms danke i opened the door for her but stayed where i as ill see you in a few minutes as she crossed the pavement her long fair hair caught the light from the marquee she didnt look back i had a moment of doubt which id expected because she looked so alone as she opened the door of the cafe and vanished fahren sie und lassen sie mich an der ecke aussteigen sehrgut i got out at the next corner and paid the driver and walked back towards the cafe brahms on the other side of the street and then crossed over looking at the jade and ivory chess sets in the window of a store putting in time hartman was a german and would be punctual and that made it easier there were canopies over most of the stores here and i stayed under them the rain hit their canvas with the sound of distant drums people came by some of them stopping to take shelter looking along the street for a taxi a police car slowed at the traffic lights and went through as they changed to green a bmw stopped at the kerb and two people got out going across the pavement and into the cafe brahms the chauffeur drove away a bus pulled in at the stop on the other side of the street its massive tyres hissing on the wet tarmac a taxi drew in to the kerb on this side and a man got out and paid the driver and turned across the pavement and i checked him against helens description and he matched it but i didnt move i was working on the assumption that hartman was under surveillance just as helen maitland had been in reigate she was the widow of the dead man and hartman had been his close friend it made sense and as the small black mercedes slid to a stop behind the taxi and a man got out i started off and opened the heavy wooden door of the cafe brahms and let it swing shut behind me there was a tiny hallway and then stairs and i began going down them as the door opened again and i heard someone coming across the hall and then down the stairs behind me a door marked damen was on the right and a door marked herren was just beyondit and then there were three telephones on the other side of the passage and i stopped and turned and looked at the man and said in german youre to phone dieter klaus right away tell him that hartman has just got here he said very well but who are you there was no one else in the passage so i dropped him with a swordhand to the carotid artery and dragged him into the mens room and pulled out his wallet and searched him for weapons and left him propped in a cubicle helen was three tables from the bar and hartman had joined her and i went over there and said were leaving here now and well take the rear exit itll be through that archway past the end of the bar you first helen then you hartman and it be right behind dont move too fast and dont attract attention but start now helen threw me a glance and left the table but hartman was slower i dont understand we theres a rote armee faktion hit man in here and you are the target not strictly true but the colour left his face and he moved at once for the archway and i closed up there was a man playing a violin and quite a few people dancing and i dont think anyone noticed us going out it worried me a little that id got these two people on my hands because i knew now that they were going to need a lot of protection but at least i had that mans wallet in my pocket and could send a signal to london later tonight have made contact and gained access to the opposition willi it was almost dark in here shall i check your coat willi asked ill keep it on helen said she was looking paler than usual perhaps it was the lighting or she hadnt realised it would be quite like this when she came back to berlin shed thought there was just going to be a quiet talk with willi he was lighting a cigarette black with a gold tip his hands were quick nervous a hit man he said how did you know we hadnt talked much in the taxi on our way here wed been looking for somewhere quiet and there arent too many places like that in berlin im not sure he was there in order to make a hit i said he was just the type that was all hed followed you there but how do you know willi its my job to know things like that youve got to trust me he flicked his cigarette but there was no ash on it yet it was just a nervous gesture what happened to him where did he go he went into the mens room i said with a bad headache he didnt follow us here i had to get you out of the cafe brahms because hed been dropped off by a mercedes and that would have stayed in the area theyre waiting for you to come out of the cafe brahms and here you are in this place and youre absolutely in the clear so cheer up all is well guten abend was mochten sie trinken the girl stood looking down at us holding her tray pale and skinny and wearing a black satin slip rouge and red lipstick and short bobbed hair this place was called die zwanziger the twenties and there were girls at the bar and dancing with some palelooking men on the miniature spotlit stage some of them were flourishing long cigarette holders the place was thick with smoke helen willi was attentive considered himself the host oh whatever youre having mr locke tonic my names victor zwei schnapse und ein tonic i waited until the girl had left us have you been here before willi no good for a while keep to unfamiliar places change your daily routine dont phone friends take a private mail box at the post office watch for people youve seen before somewhere in the street in the shops take a good look at people who stand with you in a taxi rank or sit near you in a restaurant so that youll recognise them easily if you see them again just until things get themselves straightened out but i have an apartment must i move i would just get the things you need from there say for a week or two and lock it are there security guards in the building yes slip them something to look after things the newspaper and deliveries but if they were following me he said theyll watch my apartment wont they yes then i cant go there to pick up my things you can if i help you it depends on how much youre ready to tell me he looked down about george maitland you mean about why he was killed who did it where i can find them things like that yes but there are personal things i dont need personal things another girl came and stood looking down at us shed come through the black velvet curtains at the back of the little stage her slip was white and diaphanous her nipples were rouged and thick black pubic hair showed under the silk she smiled the tip of her tongue between her teeth mochtest du ein spiel spielen would we like to play games no willi told her perhaps later she went back through the curtains and he looked at helen im sorry i didnt know it was that kind of place shall we go somewhere else it doesnt matter they wont bother us will they no i shall see that they dont he turned to look at me so what can i tell you victor do you think it was the faktion that killed maitland yes why he was getting too interested in them what started him off in that direction he looked down for a moment i think perhaps i did how it wasnt deliberate i had a girlfriend inge stoph she was very attractive to helen you met her several times she yes i thought she was terribly goodlooking willi shrugged thank you to me but i found out she was involved with the rote armee faktion i was seeing quite a bit of george at that time and helen when she was over here from england just parties and that sort of thing good friends good friends of course willi her beautiful smile came of course he drew smoke in i mentioned my girlfriend to george just casually i told him i thought she was too thick with those people the girl came with our drinks zwei schnapse einer tonic she left the tab i leaned forward what did george say about that he was interested which surprised me interested i said in the rote armee faktion yes he began asking me questions about them then later i realised he was how will we put it playing a kind of game with himself he had a master plan he told me once about how to assassinate moammar gadhafi a counterterrorist game then he fancied himself as an armchair counterterrorist i think yes willi slipped another black cigarette from the pack george was a very unusual man very intense he carried a gun helen said always i dont know i just saw it sometimes when he was taking off his jacket it wasnt a very big one but its illegal willi said in berlin i asked helen did he know youd seen it oh yes it didnt worry him i think he was rather proud of it she played with her glass of schnaps she hadnt drunk any george was very intense as willi says he had a lot of dynamic energy a lot of energy all the time a faint smile it was a little wearing but there was a lot more willi said under the surface dont you agree he flicked his gold lighter it went down deep helen said it was rather attractive in a way when it didnt get too wearing it was like being near i dont know a small power station he was neurotic willi said with sudden force may i say that oh of course terribly so terribly neurotic yes he fascinated me she gave a short laugh embarrassed hate and fascination ive only just realised shed said in the hotel how much i hated him he was also very secretive willi said despite his energy sometimes he would be very quiet for a while and his hand brushed the air and you didnt want to ask what he was thinking he looked round for the waitress i know that part of him helen said rather well george hated being asked what he was thinking about hed shut you up at once and go very cold but then its a silly thing to ask people isnt it its an invitation to a lie i watched the man over there i never knew willi said that he carried a gun it surprises me the girl came to the table and he asked for another schnaps helen and i passed the man had come in alone and was talking to someone near the stage willi i said did george ever meet your girlfriend inge yes did he show any interest in infiltrating the faktion infiltrating in getting closer to them he was how will we put it like a moth at a flame and i thought that was not good for him as a member of the british embassy and everything he had an official position and i thought he might be in danger of of compromising himself so i stopped telling him anything about the faktion the man was asking for a girl i saw now and one of them slipped off the high stool at the bar and went across to him you stopped telling george about the faktion i said to willi so what had you told him already he drew on his cigarette immediately looking down squinting against the smoke oh various things things that inge had told me with a slight shrug i miss her you know she was goodlooking yes you have seen mai britt she is important things willi what had you been telling george maitland important things about the faktion cigarette in a moment i do not think so the girl was taking the man through the black velvet curtains there was only the slightest chance in any case that wed been followed here id checked the environment with extreme care when wed got into the cab outside the cafe brahms the black mercedes hadnt been in sight not that one with the threepronged antenna on the boot the waitress brought willis drink schnaps darling danke he raised his glass and i nodded helen wasnt looking she was watching the girls perched at the bar their white spindly arms angled hands on hips their long legs reaching from their brief silk slips two of them had bruises on them as helen watched them she stroked her cheek against the soft lambswool collar of her coat i leaned nearer willi you see ill be glad to help you fetch your things from your flat as i said as long as you do your bit what for instance was the most important thing you told maitland about the rote armee faktion he shifted on his chair i stopped telling him anything at all he said with a trace of impatience i even stopped seeing my girlfriend i tried to wean her away from those people but she was too involved it excited her you understand so i stopped seeing her its all finished with now he brought his eyes back to mine at last but it wasnt easy i spoke quietly i didnt think helen was listening any more she was watching the velvet curtains now stroking her cheek against her collar willi i said im afraid its not all finished with now since george was murdered those people mounted surveillance put a watch on the house where our gentle friend here is living and they put a watch on your flat as you know and when you left there tonight they had two men tracking you at least two possibly more and youre now cut off from your home and your normal life and i have to tell you willi that unless you earn my protection you may well follow your friend george maitland in a matter of days even a matter of hours i wouldve thought this much would be clear to you and im sorry to have to spell it out but it could in fact save your life i sat back and drank some tonic it was getting warm in this place but that wasnt why there were drops of sweat forming on willis forehead i glanced at helen she was still absorbed by the girls one of them had noticed it and was returning her gaze steadily her long thin fingers playing with her cigarette holder i looked back at willi its getting late i said ive come a long way to see you and for your own sake i want it to be worth while it is difficult he said and crushed his cigarette out in the black onyx bowl and took another one from the packet his hands moving with the speed of a conjurors the sweat giving his forehead a sheen below the blond thinning hair already i am being followed and i have done very little what will happen if i reveal things to you and they find out they wont find out but you cannot guarantee that flicking his lighter his pale face bright suddenly his eyes strained they may capture you ive never talked yet they are vicious he said urgently those people i know this of course theyre terrorists i leaned close to him again across the little table youll be much safer willi if you trust me and let me help you than if you walk out of here on your own tonight where can you go im used to this kind of thing willi its my job and i know how to handle it for you its very different were sitting here tonight talking about george maitland i dont want to be sitting with helen somewhere in a couple of days time talking about willi hartman pulling on his black cigarette his hands on the move the whole time his eyes darting everywhere seeing nothing i was sorry for him hed taken up with a very goodlooking girl and suddenly hed found himself on the fringe of a very nasty set and before he could pull out they were on to him if i hadnt felt sorry for him i would have given him the message a lot less gently than i had either talk or get out and duck when you hear the shots so forth the faktion he said at last has set up an operation and they call it nemesis hed got the message all right and i began listening carefully the object of this operation is to place a bomb on board an international flight scheduled by one of the major us airlines i do not know which airline or which flight oh my god in a moment i asked him have they got a mule lined up i dont know there is never any problem with that they will be using a semtex bomb obviously and they can persuade almost any passenger to take it on board concealed in a suitcase or something like that its what they did with pan am flight they just got a girl to take it on board with her the sweat was bright on his forehead and he got out his handkerchief you know more than that willi his eyes widened but i swear to you whats their timing for this were they was inge talking about days weeks when you last spoke to her she said nothing about you must have got an idea willi did it sound as if they were getting near the deadline did inge sound excited about it yes yes she did but that was the way she always sounded when she talked about the faktion she but ill bet she was as high as a kite about this one willi i mean she wasnt talking about just another financier in a mercedes like herrhausen or just another judge in a restaurant like soderheim she was talking about another lockerbie wasnt she willi youll find you can remember more than you think you do so keep on trying if he was telling the truth and if inge hadnt been selling him a line to make herself look big i was going to have to send a signal to london tonight that i didnt want to that i very much didnt want to the ghost of lockerbie had started walking again willi was sitting with his eyes squeezed shut pinching the bridge of his nose i remember inge said something about waiting for a passenger list a certain passenger list with important people on it yes i think she or just one important person no he looked up at me there was no name mentioned did she talk about a day operation a night operation the weather conditions i dont remember the planes destination the distance involved i dont remember shaking his head all the time she talk about warning a particular airline a particular nation america an american airline i gave it another ten minutes another twenty or thirty questions and got a little bit more but not much this was dieter klaus personal pride and joy something hed set his heart on he had a lot of rage in him because theyd been making so many arrests within the faktion he needed a really important coup to reestablish the group as a major organisation things like that willi got himself another schnaps and put it away in one go im glad he said in a moment im very glad you obliged me to tell you about this about nemesis and what they want to do perhaps you can stop them that would be good very good theres a chance a girl came through the velvet curtains and dropped a short black whip onto one of the little tables and laughed to someone another girl at the bar her lipstick bright and her teeth flashing the man hadnt followed her out the man whod gone in there with her then helen said i think id like a drink now willi of course cognac she pulled her coat closer as willi looked round for the waitress did george know all this about nemesis did you tell him shed been listening more than id thought yes i told him tilting his head if i had known if we all knew the future willi dont have it on your mind she turned to look at me do you think youll be able to do something to stop this awful thing from happening itll be a question of how much time weve got and its so very difficult willi said i telephoned all the major us airlines do you know that but they all said the same thing thank you very much well certainly take this seriously but we get these threats every day and were operating with the best security we can was mochten sie trinken darling willi looked at me but i shook my head em cognac when the girl had gone helen said they had people watching my house do you know that willi its not only you then you must be careful yes and victors looking after me he came from east germany willi said ive just remembered dieter klaus he came across just after unification hes a rabid communist of course then he would have trained there it wasnt anything new when the east german secret police had started to do their laundry it had brought a whole army of villains into the open and running for cover cognac schwenker danke helen cupped her hands round the balloon glass do you think he killed george this man dieter klaus i mean personally does it make any difference willi said maybe we shouldnt be morbid itd be interesting to know she said thats all i think she shivered under the thick coat i gave her time to finish the cognac willi i said can i do this no thank you he got the girl over we are going yes and i need your address he hesitated and i said they know it already youre not giving anything away and where do i find inge shes moved shes met someone else and she lives with him i dont know where i let it go perhaps he was trying to protect her from a belated sense of chivalry id find her anyway willi were going to leave here first helen and i then you wait five minutes and go outside and get a taxi youll be perfectly safe go and buy a toothbrush at an allnight pharmacy and then book in at one of the big hotels make it the ambassador or the kempinski take a room on the top floor and use roomservice for whatever you need i wrote a number for him on the back of his receipt call this number at ten tomorrow morning be as punctual as you can by that time ill have arranged for you to go and take whatever you need from your flat no one from the rote armee faktion will see you there no one do you understand there was fear in his eyes but he said very well then do the other things i told you about give the security guard a very good tip then go and hole up somewhere quiet for how long i cant tell you phone the security guard every week in case ive left a message for you and watch the newspapers now wait here for five minutes and trust me therell be no trouble the rain had almost stopped when helen and i went out to the street and the air was cool and fresh after the smoke wed been breathing we walked half a block and crossed the street and came back on the far side and i saw willi come out of die zwanziger and flag a taxi down and there was no one behind him when it drove away then i found one for ourselves hotel steglitz jawohl she sat close to me again helen huddled in her coat the scent of the cognac on her breath poor willi she said i think he feels responsible for what happened to george we turned into birkbuschstrasse the wet streets shimmered under the lights i think george was going to hell in his own handcart anyway wasnt he that could be he wanted so desperately to make an impression on himself more than other people he was quite a short man did you know almost as short as willi but not quite i think that was partly why he liked him in willis company he looked a little taller or thought he did i felt her shiver against me its suddenly begun to hit me all this in england the shock was distanced for me but now im back here its come into sort of close focus and theres this terrible thing about what theyre planning to do those people along sedanstrasse the leaves were spilled across the pavement from the park yellow and red and gold in the lamplight i didnt say anything i didnt think she wanted me to i had something to ask her but it could wait i have a friend she said who lost her husband in the lockerbie crash i mean they loved each other he wasnt just her husband she cried for days it was all that stuff in the papers all the beastly details they love to put in bodies strewn all over the place she still doesnt read a paper she cancelled it in a moment is there something you can do to stop those people shed asked me that before i said i could only try and then i asked her who was the man in the nightclub i was watching her reflection in the glass of the division she looked at me and then away what man the one you recognised the one who recognised you oh with a soft laugh she hadnt hesitated or at least not for very long it was rather embarrassing he was just someone i knew a friend of georges at the embassy i met him a few times at parties a bmw cut across our bows swung in too soon and our driver got the window down and shouted something schweinehundt i think what is his name helen turned her head against my shoulder kurt hes whats his surname oh muller i think im not sure i mean it was embarrassing because neither of us expected to see the other one in a place like that i let it go wed come away absolutely clean from the nightclub the taxi turned east along steglitzer damm and i said youll be home by this time tomorrow and you can leave berlin behind in a moment she said you still dont want me to see gerda or any of my friends no itd be too dangerous she shivered again but i wasnt sorry id said it she had to get the message she was too exposed here and i wanted to think of her safely back in reigate taking billy for long walks kicking up the leaves things had moved very fast since id got here only this morning holmes had said there was no actual mission on the board and already we had solitaire running and id got access to the opposition and there was something much bigger on my mind than making a private kill in the name of mccane at some time tomorrow unless we could stop it tomorrow or the next day any time at all thered be a flight taking off with three or four hundred people on board and it was going to make a sunburst in the sky samala it was gone midnight when we got back to the hotel and i saw helen up to her room she was still shivering and her face was haunted as she looked at me in the low light of the corridor her thin hands holding the fleece collar of her coat pressed against her cheeks do you want to come in for a little while i said no you need sleep just for a few minutes she leaned her head against me and i held her until the shivering stopped ive got to make some calls in a moment she said im cold and a bit frightened thats all i thought it would be all right to come back to berlin but it wasnt because this is where that beastly thing happened the plastic key was clutched in her hand and i pulled it gently from between her fingers and put it into the slot and opened the door didnt you bring any gloves i forgot them im always forgetting them phone room service i said for some hot milk horlicks if theyve got it not alcohol no more brandy i gave her a final hug and call me if you really cant cope going down in the lift i felt a touch of anger we shouldnt have brought her to berlin she was so bloody young for all this not so much in years but in her mind she wasnt much more than a schoolgirl got at by the men in her life by her father by george maitland perhaps by others until the personality that had been trying to grow had been crushed and thrown away whatever you say in my room i called london and found matthews at the signals board and asked him to get the tape running are you debriefing yes through the window the floodlit spire of st johans stood against the hazy dark one or two pigeons were still awake dipping from a parapet and circling and going back their shadows flitting across the stone all right matthews said at last were running i wondered what had taken him so long all youve got to do is push a button on the console he could have been helping out at one of the other boards some kind of panic going on executive debriefing i said hours berlin time november the subject has been questioned and this is the main content the red army faction is planning an operation codenamed nemesis repeat nemesis under the direction of a former east german national dieter klaus will you run a dossier on him for me you might be able to pick him up from whats left of the stasi files maybe get some help from grenzschutzgruppe london would have to notify gsg in any case they were the official german counterterrorist organisation and if they hadnt got wind of nemesis and the bomb threat wed certainly have to brief them the object of the klaus operation i said is to put a bomb on board a us airliner i filled it in for them told them everything that willi hartman had given me plus several assumptions because hed told me a lot more than he actually knew its always like that you learn to fit bits and pieces of information into the overall picture stuff that nobody tells us but we know must be there the way the astronomers discover dark stars i have a feeling i said that klaus might not actually be running the red army faction as such although thats what i was told i think that nemesis could be the codename not for an operation but for a group hes formed a separate cell possibly taking some of the faction people with him i dont think hes the kind of man whod take over a third generation outfit that hasnt done much lately but this is just my feeling there was a police car down there wailing through the streets i could see its coloured lights reflected in the windows below end of debriefing i said into the phone questions you want this to go to mr shatner right away to mr shatner chief of signals and bureau one they may want to alert the major us airlines theyll make a bigger impression than the subject over here theyll also want to keep a close watch on passenger lists for a heavy contingent of vips or a single prominent diplomat or financier or army general someone like that what weve got to think about is how to protect every next flight of a us airliner taking off from berlin shatner would alert the us embassy in london in any case and trigger a cia response in berlin long before daylight ive got that matthews said what else how soon can you get my dif here hes booked out on the noon plane british airways get him here sooner than that put him on the first plane in the morning i dont care which airline ive made contact with the opposition and ive got access and i need a director i want him to see the reigate subject out of berlin as soon as possible but she must not repeat not take a us plane when do i get my briefing on the arms dealer scene shatner had told me hed set it up for me bring me up to date ill call you back on that how soon do you want it done as soon as you can make it because now that ive got access to nemesis im going right in to the centre and its going to be very tricky and if im not fully briefed i could blow my cover priority matthews said yes i thought i could hear croders voice in the background yes there was some kind of panic going on or croder wouldnt be in the signals room at this hour hows stingray asked matthews i wasnt on the tape any more id finished the actual debriefing a few minutes ago theyd been having a problem with that one when id looked in at signals this morning the shadow had got himself holed up in a trap in thailand not all that good matthews said he shut down on us the trap must have closed and i felt a chill along the nerves mr croders looking after things yes in a moment i said all right thats all from here just control someone said and i recognised shatners voice look i was listening to your signal and what im going to do is get the raf to fly your director into the german airforce base at werneuchen as soon as i can get the right people out of bed because no one can go into tempelhof until morning because of nightflying regulations then well ask them to send him into tempelhof by helicopter and with any luck hell be on the ground by something like hours which is going to be much sooner than if we waited to use an airline will that suit your purposes very well there shouldnt be any problem because well do it through bonn at foreign secretary level i havent heard the whole tape but it sounds rather encouraging youve got access i believe yes well done anything else i can do for you i told him there was nothing else and he gave the mike back to matthews and we wound up the signal and i pressed the contact and dialled the first number on the list of local support people theyd given me this morning before i left there were five on the night shift ten on the day the name of this one was home there were only two rings and i liked that wer spricht bitte solitaire blackjack executive i said i need a car what have you got ive got an audi gt couple of mercs you need something fast no by fast he meant a lamborghini black low profile need a phone yes youd better take the audi then all right i had one of the maps on the bed and the wallet id taken from the man in the cafe brahms make it today at the tsection of einsteinufer and abbestrasse by the canal can you do that oh yes ill be in a taxi have you seen me before no sir one glove on one off got it but why dont i bring the car to you if because i dont want you to he wasnt too seasoned and it worried me if id wanted him to bring the car here i would have asked him and he should have known that whats the number of the audi he gave it to me and i said you can take over the taxi all right now listen whos your senior man kleiber is he there ill get him i just meant you know that if you wanted the car there i would have i appreciate it sat on the bed while i waited it was going to be good to get some sleep id only had three hours in the last forty after that id need food find an allnight hamburger stand there might be kleiber i switched to german you know the city i was born here theres a man named willi hartman heres his address got that therell be some surveillance on the building possibly more than one man hartman will phone your number at today i want you to take care of the surveillance while hartman goes into his apartment and fetches some things tell him hes got thirty minutes how many people can you use for this six seven it shouldnt take more than three when hartman leaves the building i want him tracked to make sure he gets absolutely clear i also want to know where he goes and what he does put him under surveillance for the next twentyfour hours ive guaranteed him total protection so make sure no one slips up i understand her scent was on me helens i kept catching a hint of it when i moved i want you to keep a complete record of anyone he meets get their names watch especially for a woman named inge described as very attractive i understand report to the dip if you feel its important im taking the audi and you know the phone number as soon as i know which room the dip will be in at the hotel steglitz ill call you he should arrive in berlin early this morning questions you want me to report to you too no only the dip hed screen information for me that was what he was for i didnt want to use the phone in the audi more than i had to there could be some tricky driving to do anything else nothing use discreet force if you have to but i dont want any drama i understand it was by the tv clock when i rang off and while i got ready for bed i went over the whole setup and couldnt find anything else that needed doing but it was a little while before i could sleep the stingray thing was on my mind even though it was someone elses mission and nothing to do with me but then its like that no man is an island so forth and when the bell tolls for some poor bastard out there with his karma running hot it tolls for all of us other thoughts drifted into my head some things shed said helen because her scent was still on my coat things shed said in the taxi those girls in the club do you think they were attractive touch anorexic i think id said and matthews at the board for solitaire itd been two or three seconds before hed switched the tape on was he always going to be slow do you think im attractive i suppose thats the very last thing a woman should ask a man isnt it as a matter of fact i used to be anorexic once like those girls in the club but i got over it that man home and the thing about bringing the car here if the shadow executive makes a precise rendezvous ten kilometres away it surely means he does not want to be met at his hotel id better report it to the dip because i wanted totally seasoned people in the field for this one there were lives in hazard too many lives i expect you think im just fishing for compliments but then i am i suppose its this awful selfimage im saddled with its why i let george do the things he did with me hows stingray not all that good he shut down onus for whom the bell the bell tolling as the dark came down and her scent followed me through the delta waves and the streets still wet with fog drifting from the canal and the diesel knocking as the taxi pulled up and i gave the driver twice the fare and told him to wait home met me on foot at least he knew that much and took me round the corner into abbestrasse and gave me the keys recent service fall tank phones already switched on is that all right tyres forty all round he was a short man in a duffle coat and a woollen hat his breath clouding on the air normals thirtyfive i thought youd like yes spare keys wed had a case where the shadow had been tracked back to his car and it was locked and hed lost the keys and had to smash the window to get in and it had taken him too long and theyd found him reaching inside to unlock the door and taken every vertebra out of his spine with a mm uzi carbine and it went straight into the book at norfolk the importance of providing spare keys theyre under the front bumper nearside i shouldnt have had to ask he should have told me right away how long have you been working in the field he almost flinched two days sir when did you graduate three days ago oh jesus those bloody people were out of their minds then youre doing well i told him and got into the audi and started up and took it as far as the next tsection and turned away from the canal and doubled back and found a bit of wasteground with a few cars and a rubbish dump on it and pulled in between a van and a brokendown pickup truck with a smashed window and the front bumper hanging off the house was five or six hundred yards distant the house where sorgenicht lived that was the name on the papers in the wallet id taken from him august sorgenicht id swung wide at the tsection to let the headlights play across the entrance and pick up the number the house was at the end of a row and i could sight it from here between the buildings at the end of the short deserted street at this angle i could see two of its walls five of its windows the windows were dark the inside of the audi smelled of stale smoke and i ran the drivingwindow down and pulled out the ashtray and emptied it the air was cold and very still traffic was moving on the far side of the canal but the wall deadened its sound for the next three hours id be able to hear things clearly in the environment i picked up the phone and got the signals board in london direct and gave matthews my exactposition and asked him to inform kleiber chief of support here in berlin ill be in the car for the next few hours i told him and this is the number i waited until hed repeated it this would have been going through my director in the field if id had one and we were wasting a lot of time give my number to the dif as soon as you can where is he now i heard the pitch of his voice alter a fraction as he raised his head to look up at the board he landed at werneuchen airforce base at local time and left there in a military helicopter at so hell still be airborne his eta berlin is a minute from now i felt a certain degree of relief you can sometimes push a lot of the way through a mission on your own if its low key and theres no hurry but with this one the deadline was any next flight of a us airliner and the first one of the day was due for takeoff in three hours from now destination new york via london id checked the schedules in the paper youve put him into the steglitz i asked matthews yes room on the same floor as helen maitland i felt reassured ask him to phone me as soon as he can will do is control at the board shatner i think hes resting up but hes in the building you want me to no but listen norfolks sent a support man out here name of home with absolutely no experience in the field hes just graduated hes quite good but he shouldnt be working on a major mission for at least twelve months and they should know that the sound of a vehicle was coming into the environment some kind of truck this isnt a complaint as far as hes concerned its not his fault but for gods sake tell norfolk to watch what theyre bloody well doing they can get people killed like that in a moment matthews said this is to go on record youre dead right its for cot norfolk control cos and bureau one chief of training norfolk shatner chief of signals and the head of the entire bureau host of hosts lifes cheap in this trade and on our way through the labyrinth of a mission theres often a dead spook left behind in the shadows when its all over but with solitaire wed got civilian lives to look after hundreds of them and if any one of us made a mistake somewhere along the line then yes indeed it should go on record ill see to it matthews said and i shut down and watched the flood of light sweeping across the front of the houses over there as the banging began garbage truck the ashtray still stank so i pulled it away from the dashboard and threw it out of the window there hadnt been time to eat anything because sleep had been more important so i was having to take the stink of someones nicotine fix on an empty stomach bang of the garbage truck i could see it now a humped silhouette against the wall that ran the length of the canal on the digital clock i was feeling all right at this time the nerves quiet theyd start tightening up a bit before long because of what we had to do but for the moment i felt relaxed the smell of the hotels sandalwood soap on my skin id had some sleep and i was clean and when you feel clean you feel in control again as im sure youve noticed at faint light began flooding from somewhere behind and i tilted the mirror and waited watching the things the light began picking up in the environment as it brightened a parked bakers van three bicycles chained together one with a pedal missing a wrecked brass bedstead leaning against a shed then a black vw came onto the wasteground and made a uturn and swept its lights across me and straightened up and stopped not far away and the headlamps went off and i watched the man get out watched him carefully he walked slowly across the littered ground a short fat man his arms hanging at his sides and held a little way out from his body the posture recognisably harmless and when he reached the audi i ran the window down on the passengers side solitaire he said his face dark bearded smiling sweetly as he peered into the car i could see him better than he could see me because of the street lights over there ahmad samala he said garlic on his breath i answered the parole im sorry they got you up so early mr samala it is of no importance here is what you want i reached for the cassette still watching him not looking at the cassette because if anyone is going to do anything inconvenient you see it coming in their eyes first before their hands move i was virtually sure of him because the bureau doesnt often send the wrong people to a night rendezvous with the executive but in this trade you cant take anything on trust look what those clods had done at norfolk thank you i said and put the cassette on the ledge below the windscreen i would have liked to talk to you about it all samala said but they told me this way was better he sounded infinitely sad hed wanted i suppose to go through the whole thing with me enjoying the role of tutor bringing his sweet smile to bear upon the business of trading a consignment of heckler and koch hks for a dozen bags of cocaine on the dockside in istanbul or of buying semtex by the square yard without blowing up the freighter it would have been amusing to hole up with him for an hour or two in some kind of safehouse he was obviously an interesting man i have been bathed in smiles as sweet as his before sometimes over the muzzle of a gun perhaps we can meet again i said when its more convenient i would enjoy that he offered his hand not knowing any better and i broke every rule in the book and shook it politely now i am going back to bed he said and backed away and went over to the vw and squeezed himself into it he made a uturn again this time with his lights off london had done well it had been this morning when id called signals to debrief and ask for an update on the arms dealing scene to secure my cover and they must have got onto samala in berlin not long afterwards and asked him to get it onto a cassette for me and then theyd had to phone him soon after to give him my precise location for the rendezvous even without my dif in the field signals and support services were running efficiently and it calmed the nerves the windows of the house beyond the end of the street were still dark one of them or more than one of them would show a light when august sorgenicht got up and began his day then i would move in a bit closer calmed the nerves but only a little they were starting to tighten now as the minutes went by because the opposition knew what had happened to him at the bottom of the flight of stairs at the cafe brahms last night it had looked like a simple mugging with the wallet gone i hadnt taken his keys because he would have had all his locks changed right away and in any case it would have been less interesting to look around his house than to track him to whatever contacts he would make during the day because one of them could lead me to nemesis right to the centre when id signalled london that id secured access this is what i had meant but nemesis would know it hadnt been a simple mugging because sorgenicht would have told them what id said to him youre to phone dieter klaus right away tell him that hartman has just got here hed assumed i was one of them a new recruit he hadnt seen before but when hed come to in the mens room he had known better the five distant windows were still dark traffic on the far side of the canal was on the move now as the citys longitude swung towards morning he would have known better yes sorgenicht he would have known that the opposition cell from london had now got his address and this was why the nerves were starting to tighten a little as the minutes went by because dieter klaus was a professional and he wouldnt leave me free to track sorgenicht through the city today it had been good news for london that i had access to nemesis the bad news was that when i began tracking sorgenicht nemesis would have access to me krenz despite the proliferation of sources of supply mainland china still remains important and i would place it about eighth on the list of the major world suppliers the five windows in the house over there were still dark august sorgenicht was not an early riser you should know that there are still over soviet troops stationed in former east germany waiting to be sent home and many of them are busy pilfering their arsenals and selling whatever they can get hold of to whoever will buy it a sweet smile you could hear it in his voice mr samala was showing me over his toyshop i kept the volume low barely audible because i needed to hear sounds from the greater environment both windows were down bang of a metal can somewhere bringing a frisson along the nerves there was a dog i thought rooting among the rubbish that had dropped from the truck along the edge of the wasteground i am speaking of ak assault rifles antitank weaponry small arms and mines the red army faction is known to have purchased a consignment of bombs and grenades another development in the phone was ringing and i picked it up and shut off the tape hallo dip thrower ive called in thrower from pakistan shatner had told me to direct you in the field i think youll like his style i gave him blackjack what can i do for you he asked me get helen maitland back to the uk in a moment he said of course i was told youre concerned about her shes at risk just get her home perhaps the implication wasnt really there that for some reason i shouldnt be concerned id been the only one in the field until now the only one who knew the risk she was running i didnt want it disputed of course he said again i didnt want humouring either ive got the ticket for her in my pocket according to your request to control what airliner alitalia is the first flight out what time faint light began flooding from behind the audi i want her escorted onto the plane of course since you say shes at risk ive laid that on his tone was soft a degree smooth he didnt sound like an experienced director in the field he sounded like a lawyer thats all i need i told him the light was spreading across the wasteground then it vanished what is your situation ill have to call you back i told him and shut down the light hadnt been switched off it had moved behind the buildings i heard a car turning and stopping this time the lights were cut dead i waited two minutes three no one got out of the car it was in the next street facing the house where sorgenicht lived the lights had been shining in that direction five five minutes no one got out of the car i would have heard the door slam so i took the cassette out of the slot and slipped it into my pocket and got out of the audi and left the door open and walked across the wasteground to the street at the top and turned right and kept on going and then turned right again and right again coming back on the street where the car had pulled up and cut its lights it was cold outside the audi i felt very cold he was there sitting in the car in the black mercedes e sitting at the wheel he wasnt reading anything there was no light inside the car his face was pale squarelooking in the light from the distant street lamps his head was against the padded rest i couldnt see where his hands were they werent on the steeringwheel he was watching the house the house where sorgenicht lived its always dangerous to assume things on simple appearances but this mans aspect and behaviour were a model of the archetypal surveillant and i decided to go to work accordingly he was here then as i had expected not to watch the house but to watch for anyone who set out to track sorgenicht when he left there he would then keep station in the traffic stream and use his phone and call in mobile support to cut off sorgenichts tracker and deal with him as they had dealt with george maitland and soon afterwards mccane that was what this man was doing here he was watching in effect for me there was deep shadow where i stood at the end of an alleyway joining the two adjacent streets i was perhaps fifty feet from him but if he turned his head he wouldnt see me he was a quiet man well in control of himself he didnt fidget hed got up early but he didnt yawn he wasnt smoking he hadnt got the radio on i would have heard it he was a good surveillant first class the kind they try to turn out of norfolk when theyre thinking straight if i hadnt seen him here and began tracking sorgenicht this man in his mercedes would become the equivalent of a shark fin in the water and i would be the swimmer i leaned my head back to rub the nape of my neck against the rough collar of my coat to ease the chill of the nerves he wasnt a young man i would have said close to fifty but his head was square and massive and he was thick in the shoulder he would not then be very fast but quite strong even if he were trained dangerously strong but soon it would be getting light and there would be people about and i didnt want to attract attention it could also be that sorgenicht would leave his house before dawn though the windows were still dark i had better do what i had to do as soon as i could there were soft echoes from the brick walls in the alleyway and i stepped lightly and broke the rhythm because the regularity of footsteps is extraordinarily perceptible the brain stem recognising the sound of another animal in the environment i turned right when i reached the street and right again at the tsection and as i turned i saw a light come on in a window of the house on the second floor it wasnt necessarily sorgenicht getting up it could be his wife or his girlfriend or someone else there but i would have to assume it was sorgenicht himself his car would be one of those parked in a line along the wall by the canal there were no garages here i turned again and began walking up the street to where the mercedes was standing the distance from here was a hundred yards or so and it was facing me i didnt walk quietly any more i walked quite fast towards the mercedes because id overslept and was late and had to hurry i blew into my hands it was a cold raw morning and i didnt relish it there was another dog over there towards the wasteground or perhaps the one id seen before scratching for scraps among some rubbish i gave it a whistle i was fond of dogs my breath clouded in front of me as i passed under a street lamp and i blew into my hands again quickening my step but there was a big notice in the window of an ironmongers shop and i slowed for a moment reading it as i went by there was a sale on with a per cent discount on tools well worth remembering i noticed the mercedes but paid no attention you see cars parked everywhere i looked at my watch then dug my hands into my coat pockets again leaning forward a little my head down as i breasted my way into the ratrace of another workaday morning the mercedes was quite close now and i gave it another glance and it was then that i noticed something wrong i stopped when i reached the car and tapped on the window pointing the man inside swung his massive head and looked at me taking his time i pointed to the rear of the car again and he opened the door youve got a flat tyre i told him and would have walked on but he had a gun in his right hand and his finger was in the triggerguard and it was pointing at me i was alarmed no please dont shoot backing away my hands spreading open i just wanted to tell you the tyre was flat please dont shoot me he watched me with a dead stare it hadnt looked good enough then natural enough whistling to the dog and reading the sale notice not a good enough act too late to clean it up now just kept my hands raised fingers open and then he moved the front tyre wouldnt have worked because id had to assume he was righthanded the chances of that were very high so it had to be the rear tyre and as he leaned out of the car to look at it he kept the gun trained on me and the nearest part of his body was his gunhand and i had something like two seconds while he looked at the tyre and i used enough force to paralyse the arm through the median nerve and deaden the triggerfinger because if id used more it would have caused a great deal of pain and i didnt want him vomiting i cant stand that it was a swordhand strike and its force brought the top part of his body down and left his neck exposed and i used the left hand before he could do anything and he sagged suddenly and i caught the mauser before it could hit the pavement there was no one in the street so i snapped the doorlocks open and pulled him out and dragged him round to the passengers side and got the door open and heaved him into the car and sat him with his head back against the rest and his hands on his lap they were cold to the touch and his face had lost colour but i didnt think id overdone the strike to the occipital area youre not going to kill anyone there unless you use enough force to break into the skull or snap the vertebrae hed be out for a while that was all and i used the ignition keys and got some jumpcables from the boot i was hoping for some rope but there wasnt any i lashed his wrists to his legs and shut the door and went round and got behind the wheel and saw two more lights come on in the house down there one of them on the ground floor i was worried now because it was possible id missed something sorgenichts bedroom and bathroom could be at the back of the house and i wouldnt have seen the windows light up it could have happened half an hour ago an hour he could be close to leaving i picked up the phone and touched the numbers it was very quiet inside the car but i couldnt hear the mans breathing that would be normal id pushed his blood pressure right down and his brain had shifted into a mode that in certain creatures would be hibernative i reached for his throat and found the pulse slow but still there that too was normal he was bitter solitaire blackjack how soon i asked thrower ban you get support here only need one man same location close the next street to the west of the wasteground ill contact kleiber and take it from there id say thirty minutes if theyre coming from his place the light in one of the windows had gone out all right but i might have to be mobile before then we can tail you yes i told him the car i was in now gave him the number relay that to the support will you and get someone to pick up the audi that home delivered to me its in the wasteground and the keys are in the ignition shall be done ill keep in touch i put the phone back thirty minutes was going to be too long by the look of things but there was nothing i could do about it i could have called in a whole support unit five or six people when id first come here but it wasnt a red sector and i didnt want a lot of movement going on i checked the man beside me his pulse was still slow and there was a sheen of sweat on his face his eyelids were parted slightly and i could see the glint of the conjunctiva i found his wallet and checked one of his credit cards a berliner bank visa his name was stefan krenz his business card said he was an electronics engineer but that could be his cover an electronics engineer would be wasting his time working as a tracker dog i made a note of his address and put the wallet back this was at and three minutes later i saw the front door of sorgenichts house open and a figure show up against the light inside i had the engine running by the time hed shut the door and i was rolling the mercedes with the headlights on as he walked out of sight beyond the building at the end of the street when i reached the corner he was fifty feet away and still walking but now he was digging into his pocket and as i closed the distance he found his keys and stopped by a dark blue volvo and glanced up when i went past but my lights would have dazzled him and he didnt take any notice in the mirror i saw him getting into the volvo and slamming the door i turned at the next street and made a square and found him a block ahead of me going west along einsteinufer id recognised him and that was the main thing but wed got problems now because this man krenz was in the car with me and hed surface before long and try to give trouble it would have been no good putting him in the boot of the car because at any time sorgenicht could park the volvo and id have to follow him on foot i was after contacts people hed be talking to and i wouldnt find them unless i kept close and if i left this man in the boot hed come to and start yelling and banging and someone would let him out and hed get straight on the phone and give his location and thered be a swarm of nemesis agents moving into the area before id had time to get results but i couldnt leave him sitting here on the front seat either i picked up the phone and got thrower wheres my support coming from kleistpark then its not going to work im mobile now and i need someone right away where are you moving southwest in cauerstrasse you dont know your destination no ill get back to you he said and we shut down i could have given him a lot more information but it wasnt necessary because when the shadow asks his dif to do something for him right away its understood that he doesnt want to delay things by protracting the signal we dont chat when were tracking traffic lights came up and i stopped between a vw and a delivery van i wasnt happy about the van because the cab was high and the driver could look down into the mercedes and might notice the jumpcables round krenzs wrists i angled my head and watched the drivers face but he was looking in front of him at the long blonde hair in the bmw krenz i said in german how are you feeling he didnt answer so i slotted the cassette in and turned the radio on as an example of how very dangerous the presentday arms market is becoming rumours have been circulating well below media level that the us army has either miscounted its stockpile of tactical nuclear missiles or has had one stolen from an unnamed military base the weapon is said to be the nk miniver a missile capable of being launched by one designated officer of high rank in the field at his personal discretion the nk has the capacity to knock out an entire division if these rumours have any substance the phone was ringing and i picked it up and touched for receive dip hear you location i gave it to him then were doing better ive got someone starting out from the siemensdamm ubahn area not far from you his name is roach and hes in a black saab with frankfurt plates he gave me their number and the number of the phone you can call him direct at this stage i said id do that wasser krenz shut up i told him and got onto the support man roach the line was scratchy but his voice was clear enough i told him where i was and he said hed try to intercept me somewhere near the autobahn wasser krenz thirsty not surprising and fidgeting with the jumpcables shut up and sit still i told him in german or ill blow the brains out of your bloody head on the phone i told roach the situation is that im tracking someone and ive got a prisoner on board and what i want you to do is take him over when theres a chance and put him underground somewhere for the duration check with the dif and ask for his instructions his name is stefan krenz youll also take over his gun questions is he for interrogation sir ask the dif we sometimes take prisoners during a mission but its usually forced on us as the only alternative to the extreme sanction thing and we do it when theyve got enough information about us to cause damage if we let them go and this man knew enough about me to bring me down do you know what im driving roach asked me yes where are you now northbound in tegeler weg just going under the sbahn and coming up on the autobahn ten minutes then sorgenicht was three vehicles ahead of me in the same lane he didnt know he was being tracked if hed suspected it he would have put the volvo through a series of turns to find out he hadnt done that the lights of a train crossed the morning sky as we passed under the sbahn it was between there and the autobahn that krenz heaved his weight off the passenger seat and hurled it against me and i took it on the right shoulder and the car swerved and i got it straight in time but the lexus on our left had swerved too and the driver hit the brakes and shouted something we were in a traffic flow of something like thirty miles an hour and i was in the middle lane and couldnt pull over and stop krenz had bounced back onto the seat and now he was coming at me again hands still tied to his thighs but with his massive head free to smash against mine if he could get it right so i swung a backfist to his forehead to stun the pineal gland and he lurched back onto the seat and sat with his bulk against the passenger door shaking his head like a boxer on the ropes animal sounds coming from him not quite words i think but just grunts of rage and i left him like that and touched the numbers for roach and spoke through the remote microphone still in tegeler weg approaching the autobahn from the south at fifty yards middle lane the dark green volvo is three vehicles ahead and thats the one im tracking got you five minutes i took the cassette out of the slot and put it into my pocket the volvo was changing lanes and i looked for a gap but there wasnt one the traffic on both sides was moving ahead i was in a slow lane and perhaps that was why the volvo had used a chance and changed to the lane on the right it was now four vehicles ahead and id have to do something because he could go through the next traffic lights just before they changed and leave me stuck i couldnt afford to crash a red because i could hit something and in any case there could be a patrol car in the area and that wouldnt do any good show me your licence please while the volvo pulled away into the distance and is this man sick and why are his wrists tied to his legs so forth krenz had gone quiet and i took a look at him his head was lolling but he wasnt out the gland was still in shock and he felt giddy that was all i couldnt be sure that he wasnt faking it or some of it while he got enough energy back to come at me again the pickup truck on my left was hanging back a little and i pressed into the gap and he used the horn but i stood a better chance now of pulling up on the volvo i called roach tinder the autobahn and going into jakob kaiserplatz okay two minutes but the traffic was heavier now as the rushhour got under way and it was getting more difficult to keep the volvo in sight aggressive driving could give me what i wanted but id got this man beside me waiting to go off like a bomb and i couldnt concentrate krenz i said you try that again and im going to kill you do you understand some kind of grunt krenz youre in our hands anyway and you know that were going to take you to our base and were going to fry your brains and if you come out of it alive youll finish up in a funny farm but i can make things a bit easier for you krenz just give me the airline and the flight number i didnt know if he was able to take it in but it was worth trying whats the flight number krenz where the bombs going to be the volvo was rounding the kaiserplatz now heading west and i called roach entering siemensdamm got you im in the kaiserplatz and coming up on you then a flashy red porsche cut across my bows and i had to brake and it put me back in fourth place behind the volvo and i looked for a gap and there wasnt one krenz what flight is it because if i was going to lose the volvo wed have to work this bastard over just as id told him he might not know the flight number because they might not have chosen it yet might be waiting for a really impressive passenger list but if krenz in fact had a number in his head then we were going to try getting it out of him and that meant contravening the bureaus strict interdiction covering what is known in the trade as implemented interrogation but wed have to do it anyway because there was a planeload of people moving in their daily lives towards an airport with their travelagents envelopes in their pockets with the tickets inside the tickets and the flight number on their way to the big bright sunburst in the sky krenz what is the flight number he didnt say anything i couldnt tell what state of consciousness he was in id worked on the occipital area and he probably couldnt focus very well and id worked on the pineal gland and hed be feeling disoriented but to what degree i didnt know id used more force than i would have used with a smaller man but it might not have been enough to get him below the beta waves where he couldnt do any constructive thinking the phone rang and i touched for receive listening im three cars behind roach said you want me to stay there no come right up on my tail will do there was a gap on my right and i moved in got some protest but i was in the same lane as the volvo now and three behind krenz you tell me the flight number and we shant have to do it to you are you listening krenz you know what im talking about we shant have to leave you outside a hospital with your brain gone you know the things we can do youve seen them done krenz so give me the flight number hed keeled over now with his head resting on the top of the dashboard and it wouldnt look very good from outside so i pulled him back and he came off the seat and smashed into me and i swerved and got straight again and he bounced back onto the seat and used the rebound and came at me again and the front tyres screamed as i corrected and used my left hand for a strike in the killingarea because it was the only thing that would stop him he slumped back onto the seat and i dragged him upright and he fell against the door and stayed there id made the strike in the killingarea but i hadnt used lethal force hadnt gone out to break through the cartilage but he was losing colour and i felt for the carotid pulse and couldnt detect any there was a sudden roar as a jet flew over a twa flight lowering into tegel airport leaving the air hazed with its exhaust lights flashed once in the mirror and i saw a black saab sitting there and raised my hand to acknowledge there wasnt anything i could do about the man sitting beside me so i stopped thinking about him and we kept heading west and then turned north and crossed saaltwinklerdamm and the canal and came up on the outskirts of the airport with a jet gunning up on the runway and the first light of the day breaking beyond the control tower the volvo was peeling off and taking a downramp into an underground car park and i held back to let a mazda move in between us and then followed it through the gate roach sized things up and chose a different lane as the volvo found a slot and sorgenicht got out and gave a brief look around him and slammed the door and started walking to the b exit steadily not hurrying roach came across from the saab and i got out of the mercedes and opened the passenger door and heaved krenz upright and felt for a pulse and still didnt get anything roach stood looking down at him no expression hands by his sides head tilted he gone i dont know give him mouthtomouth he had cool eyes roach voice was a flat monotone if you want to i said not in public get him out of sight no hospital i looked down at the heavy face no no hospital if hes gone dig a hole and chalk it up for mccane roach gave me the keys of the saab and i followed sorgenicht through b exit into the terminal inge this place was a trap he was sitting over there by the wall sorgenicht the man id tracked here karl sorgenicht there were two girls with him one of them had been sitting by herself when id come into the cafeteria id noticed her because she was striking in the nordic way iceblue eyes and ashblonde hair a wide sensual mouth she wore a crimson leather skijacket and crimson calflength boots her bag was to match and had steel studs as a decoration the whole outfit was berlinstyle bisexualchic sorgenicht had got himself a coffee at the service counter and hed been taking it across to the corner when the blonde had called out to him hed hesitated and then joined her the other girl at the table was dark slim elegant in pan am uniform she had joined the blonde just before sorgenicht the two girls were friends or acquaintances and theyd arranged to meet here that was ray impression i had a girlfriend inge willi hartman had told me in the nightclub she was very attractive helen had agreed yes i thought she was terribly goodlooking the girl over there wasnt necessarily inge there were a lot of goodlooking girls in berlin and she could be cabin crew out of uniform but shed called sorgenicht over to her table and he was a nemesis agent i poked at my eggs on toast eating very little although i was hungry this place was a trap and i might have to use muscle to get out of it and i didnt want the digestive process slowing the organism down it was a trap because that man krenz would normally have kept in touch with his cell by telephone from the mercedes nemesis had thought it important enough to send him to watch sorgenichts house to see if anyone tried to track him when he left and it would therefore be important for him to report on events he hadnt done that in terms of signals hed been missing ever since id taken over the mercedes and they wouldnt just assume the phone wasnt working they would check up they would know where sorgenicht was going and theyd send some people here to look for krenz and when anyone came in i paid attention flight to frankfurt will be leaving from gate in ten minutes passengers for flight to frankfurt should report to gate and board immediately there were four tables between my own and the table where sorgenicht sat with the two girls and the people in between provided reasonable but not perfect cover as some of them moved in their chairs leaning forward leaning back i moved my head so that i could keep observation and have tune to cover my image if sorgenicht looked in this direction if he did he would recognise me the lighting at the bottom of the stairs at the cafe brahms last night had been subdued but wed been facing each other and unless the strike had left him with any degree of retrogressive amnesia he would remember me if he saw me now they were speaking in english over there i havent been trained in lipreading but the difference between yes and ja is quite distinct and you can pick up the affirmative in most languages by watching for a nod of the head its the same with no and nein and the shaking of the head is often more emphatic than the nod the girl in the pan am uniform didnt speak german perhaps or not too well or the others were simply showing courtesy to a foreigner passengers for flight for london should go to gate immediately flight for london will be leaving in fifteen minutes it worried me the voice on the loudspeaker this is what it had sounded like in frankfurt that day flight will be leaving in ten minutes passengers for london on flight should report to gate immediately it was said later that few of them perhaps none of them had even heard of the remote scottish village with the name of lockerbie if that man krenz was dead that man with the massive skull in the mercedes if id gone too far put too much force into the strike i would have no conscience none i would have no conscience if in the urgent process of the mission others also died and at my hands three men came in and i watched them two were pilots i felt a resonance along the nerves it was not unpleasant if they found me here the people of nemesis if sorgenicht recognised me i would have a fair chance of getting clear its very difficult to attack and subdue and seize or kill a man in a place as public as a major airport without bringing security or the police on the scene the resonance along the nerves was due to excitement not fear because i had made access to nemesis and i would stay with the opposition now wherever they moved and if i got things right if i didnt lose them didnt slip didnt fall i would reach this man dieter klaus and reach him in time and bring him down before there was another hideous sunburst in the sky the man at the top now is dieter klaus and i hope to christ you never run into him hes inhuman his body shaking setting up a vibration in the wheelchair it would be well then if klaus were to follow krenz one of the pilots who had just come in had parted from the other two men moving between the tables until he came to the one where sorgenicht was sitting with the girls sorgenicht and the blonde knew him they shook hands perfunctorily then the blonde introduced the pilot to the pan am stewardess and he gave a slight bow id seen the winged flash on his uniform when hed passed closer to my table he flew for iran air it was twenty minutes before anyone at the table made a move during that time i picked up what i could of the conversation but it was difficult because i had to allow for german and iranian accents i gleaned more from their body language sorgenicht sat stolidly and said little listened a lot especially to the blonde who sometimes leaned towards the pan am stewardess touching her hand for emphasis the two girls smiled now and then the men did not the iranian pilot said almost nothing i thought the name of the stewardess was probably debbie the lingual combination of d and b was often formed when the blonde spoke to her the iranian was the first to move the pilot hed come in with passed close to the table looking at his watch and the iranian nodded and got up shaking hands with the blonde nodding to the others as they began leaving too as sorgenicht turned away from the table i picked up my cup of coffee and held it in both hands like a bowl as i drank masking the lower half of my face and keeping my eyes down but i think he hesitated as he passed my table not far away i couldnt be sure couldnt look up but the feeling was there that hed recognised me but had kept on going i waited long enough for him to leave the cafeteria and then took what would probably be the biggest calculated risk of the whole mission and put the cup down and got up and turned and went out sorgenicht was in the main hall going towards the telephones his back to me the two girls were near the elevators shaking hands debbie if that was her name began crossing the hall as the blonde took the down elevator and i followed keeping distance between us he could be telephoning sorgenicht calling for support he could be tracking me as i crossed the lower floor and followed the blonde girl out to the car parks and i used reflective surfaces where i could find them but didnt see him it didnt mean he wasnt there standing off at a distance there was good cover to be had as cars and shuttles pulled in to the departure hall there was a different vibration now along the nerves as i walked through the cold morning light she moved athletically the blonde the metalstudded bag slung at the shoulder the crimson calflength boots tapping the tarmac as she passed between the cars inge i called and she turned ja i caught up with her and asked in german how are you she studied me im very well do i know you im sorry hans mittag im a friend of willis willi hartmans yes i held out my hand and she took it but briefly he sends you his good wishes i said he misses you her eyes were cool really but i still dont remember you we met at one of his little parties but look i dont want to hold you up i stood back should i return his good wishes i think hes out of town oh really well it was good to see you my cars over there i moved past her and then turned to face her again bringing the airport terminal into the background ill remember you to willi when i see him he was telling me so many interesting things she watched me with the stillness of a cat about what about you i brought my voice down and your exciting plans people moved in the background against the facade of the terminal others were standing still but i could only see them in the outer vision field my eyes were on hers she said what kind of plans perhaps i can help you with them the people standing at the shuttle station would be unrecognisable at this distance even if i could look at them directly any one of them could be sorgenicht he would be the spotter if he were there at all he would show them where i was tell them to get inge away from me before i could do her any harm but perhaps you dont need any help she didnt move did you follow me here yes when i saw you leaving the terminal i called out to you but a taxi got in the way in a moment she said i think id like to hear what willis been saying about me he was very discreet i want you to understand that wed better talk in your car i needed cover my skin itched for it i was too exposed here in the open where is it she stood watching me her eyes luminous in the cold morning light then she said its over there and i followed her it was a crimson porsche recognisable ten blocks away in thick traffic she didnt make any concession to security didnt want to wanted to be seen to make an impression didnt know how appallingly dangerous it was in the game she was playing she sat behind the wheel her arm across it her body halfturned to me a heavy gold chain across the neck of her white polo sweater a gold bracelet on her wrist blonde hairs on her fingers catching the light one knee in a black stocking crooked against the gear lever so what did willi say that you were in dieter klaus organisation what organisation nemesis the pulse beat in her throat in a moment she said willi tends to fantasise as you probably know someone was getting into a car not far away and when the door slammed i used the excuse and looked through the windscreen and checked the background and saw two men standing there a hundred yards away talking i said willi wasnt fantasising this time and you know that she took a deep breath to deal with the tension looking away looking back do you live in berlin it sounded as if she were changing the subject she wasnt yes i said but i dont see much of it i travel a lot ive just got back from a meeting with the secretary of the general peoples committee of libya muhammad azzarruqu rajab second in command to colonel moammar gadhafi the deal was for two million us dollars her pupils grew larger for a moment are you talking about arms dont always deal in arms i deal in information military and paramilitary services mercenary personnel presidential security things like that my last actual arms deal which i made two weeks ago was with the ira it wasnt big money but i support people who make a genuine attempt to bring down the capitalistic and democratic establishments in particular those in london and washington she expressed very little with her eyes inge stoph they were liquid blue crystal set above the finely wrought cheekbones and under the thick blonde eyebrows a perfectlymatched pair of gemstones beautiful to contemplate but devoid of any real interest one would get bored with them i would think after a time i looked for other signs of reaction to what i was saying she looked wonderfully fit and i would have thought her heartrate would be something less than seventytwo but the gold bracelet was swinging against the squat black knob of the gear lever with a rhythm significantly faster than that in a moment she said you lead an exciting life i gave a shrug business of any sort is still only business but sometimes i make up little jokes to keep the boredom away the two men were still talking over there but i didnt think they were anything to worry about they wore coats with astrakhan collars and homburg hats and this wasnt a situation where the opposition would need to falsify the image if sorgenicht and his people wanted me they would simply close in you make up little jokes she was delightfully attentive inge stoph oh i said not often but this summer i was in africa in a state that shall be nameless and my assignment was to see that the minister of defence should be rendered incapable of launching an armed insurrection which was thought to be in his mind i was present at a state banquet three days after my arrival and the cuisine was french faisan roti a la bergere boeuf bourguignon and for dessert a compote of fresh strawberries in a sauce of creme de papaya but the piece de resistance was carried in on a silver platter and when the cover was lifted there was the head of the minister of defence on a bed of vine leaves with a glazed passionfruit in his mouth i touched her arm quickly i knew the president well of course and his particular sense of humour ive never been accused of questionable taste i caught a spark of interest in her eyes at last or possibly it was a trick of the light did you kill the man yourself some questions are more delicate than others arent they i looked at my watch let me leave you with this inge i realise that dieter klaus has substantial backing from colonel gadhafi the secretary of the general peoples committee happened to mention it when i was with him yesterday and this is why i was particularly glad to see you this morning klaus is a difficult man to reach and i respect that so you might like to suggest that i meet him as soon as convenient there was a microrecorder lying in the well between the seats may i use this if you wish i spoke a telephone number into it and put it back you can leave a message for me there at any time its an answering service tell klaus that i can offer him a missile with a nuclear warhead the americanmade miniver nk in case he feels like spelling out a really spectacular statement for the primetime news the increase in her saliva was triggered immediately and i saw her swallow im talking i said of taking out an entire international sports stadium during a worldclass match or a major airport on christmas eve or the houses of parliament in london with subsequent fallout megadeaths and mass evacuation and the closing down of the relevant city for the next hundred years a lasting monument if you like to nemesis i opened the door and got out of the car you know how to find me but you must tell klaus that time is of the essence if hed like a rendezvous i can only give him till midnight the sun had cleared the airport buildings and floated in the haze a pale membrane speared by the black antennae at the top of the control tower shadows had begun to form on the tarmac as i walked across the slip road to the underground car park where roach had left his saab i could see no one had seen no one since id left inge but the skin was crawling at the nape of the neck and the scrotum was tight because in the last hour i had taken appalling risks however calculated and if i were going to survive long enough to debrief to my director in the field he was going to blow my head off and send a report to london the roar of a jet came like a soft explosion as a british airways vc cleared the buildings and tilted into the haze something was moving at the rim of the vision field and i turned my head it was a radar scanner echoes began coming from the underground garage echoes of footsteps and i stopped listening id been making them myself i dont like the nerves pulling tight when theres no reason but i never ignore them there are vibrations in human affairs that have nothing to do with speech or contact they are there because the primitive brainstem still protects us in a world of technological sophistication analysing the environment interpreting data that the senses have picked up even without our knowing and on that level we dont understand the signals we just feel uneasy on edge the black saab was standing where roach had left it the mercedes had been too hot for me to use again and he would have dumped krenz somewhere in the field for support people to look after and then driven the car to the east section of the city and left it there the windows of the saab were up and the doors were locked hed given me the keys but i handled them gingerly slipping the doorkey in and waiting before i turned it there were other people down here and i listened to their footsteps and the echoes they made expecting a rush a closing in there was nothing of that sort and i opened the door and got in and sat behind the wheel and took a look at the instrument panel and waited again listening hearing the roar of another jet that was taking off the sound setting up a metallic hum in the lid of the ashtray then i put the ignition key in and sweat sprang instantly on my skin but i turned the key because there hadnt been time for them to rig a bang it was just nerves that was all and the engine started right away and i shifted the gears in and got rolling and the bmw that was parked three cars away in the same line started up too and the tyres whimpered a little as it pulled ahead of me and swerved inwards and the sl on the other side went into the same manoeuvre and i gave the saab the gun and the tyres shrilled and the left wing hit the mercedes and was ripped away as i kept going and felt a shudder from the rear as the bmw moved right in and tried to close the trap as a volkswagen came in from the next line and swung across my bows in a curve and i rammed it and broke through another car was moving past one of the concrete pillars and it braked hard and i saw a woman with a white face behind the windscreen and then the mercedes pulled alongside the saab with his tyres yelping under the acceleration and i swung the wheel and bounced off the pillar and heard the offside wing tearing away the windscreen snowed out as something glanced across it and i thought i heard the pop of a silenced gun and then it came again and the drivingmirror shattered and i kept low on the seat and swung the saab fullcircle across the dry concrete and looked for a gap and found one and went for it but the vw blocked me and i swung the other way ramming the front end of the mercedes and bringing a burst of water from the radiator and a lot of clatter from the fan they were shooting and they were using silencers and the clock on the dashboard took a ricochet and the bullet dropped into my lap and i left it there something moved in from the left side and the saab rocked and i dragged it straight and saw another gap and took it and hit a pillar and broke free but the mercedes was close and we rocked again and righted and then rolled over with the roofmetal screaming on the concrete and i hit the beltbuckle and got the door open and found the mercedes alongside with the driver slumped at the wheel with blood on his face so i smashed the window and found his gun and saw the bmw moving in and fired twice and rolled clear as it lost control and hit the mercedes and bounced back with the drivers foot still on the throttle and the engine screaming the volkswagen was coming in and i dropped the gun and waited and saw the drivingwindow coming down and a muzzle poking out and i dropped flat as he fired and fired again and i came up from under the window and hit the gun and felt the shock as it went off and then i found the mans throat and smashed the larynx and dragged him out of the car and got in and gunned up for the exit and went through with the man in the box there shouting because i hadnt paid and he wanted to ask me about all the noise hed heard i merged with the main traffic from the terminal and kept going until i found a telephone and got out and called thrower and he picked up on the second ring thrower i need all the information you can get me i told thrower on the nk miniver tactical nuclear missile ahmad samala should have all i want but ask london too tell them to fax it to you how soon now i felt blood creeping on the side of my face and got my handkerchief my head was throbbing just over the right temple and the cold air was sharp on the wound the shoulder on that side was burning but i could use my arm all right it had happened when the saab had rolled ill see to that thrower said where are you tegel airport i need to debrief all right ive moved you nearer there in point of fact youre at the hotel klinghof in the haselhorst district youre booked in and your things are on their way you can go there now he must have his reasons but i wanted to keep the call short i needed the information on the nk as soon as i could get it inge could phone kleibers number at any time to make a rendezvous and if i were going to talk to dieter klaus id have to be absolutely sure of what i was saving all right i told thrower what street eiderstrasse i shall be moving to the prinzen nearby when ill be leaving here in a few minutes i was hanging on in case you signalled there was something about his voice that was different i thought it was just as smooth but there was a note of frustration coming through it wasnt because of what had happened in the underground garage i hadnt told him about it yet because i didnt want to waste time i said ill wait for your call how long we should be able to debrief in about an hour where ill tell you when i phone all right on a thought have they got helen maitland to the airport yet in a moment he said in point of fact no shes missing the place smelt of leather and coconut matting and sweat come on in he said he was a big man with thick black hair on his bare arms and a round pink head with tiny blue eyes in it that looked as though they could bore through the steel door of a strong room thrower had told me his name was jim and that was all the battered sign outside said jims gym someone was bashing at a punchingbag thank you i said and he stood back for me wed exchanged paroles they were mostly boys in here some with black eyes i couldnt have shown anything on my face but jim said they didnt get them here they got beaten up by their fathers my jobs to stop it happening again his eyes shifted a little hes waiting for you up there he said he led me across to some stairs in the corner thrower was on the first floor in a room used for storing things mostly halfbroken furniture and a few car seats with the stuffing coming out it was freezing in here come along in thrower said is there any water around i was thirsty i dont think so downstairs perhaps and no bloody heating i didnt ask he looked as smooth as he sounded thrower what youd call wellgroomed almost as bad as that bastard loman although this mans shoes werent polished he was wearing furlined boots a long face pale eyes a tight mouth fresh cuts from shaving a short man thin hands in the pockets of his elegant black coat nothing i could see to like about him but then i wasnt in the mood what happened i asked him to helen maitland well get to that he said i was warned it sounded as though he was used to calling the shots what exactly do you mean i asked him shes missing he turned away impatiently i think he would have to improve this man thrower he would have to improve a great deal my hands were in my coat pockets too but it wasnt just to keep them warm they were still shaking from the reaction those bastards had come very close indeed to writing me off and it had been noisy down there and i hate loud noises i began calling her room thrower said carefully at seven oclock this morning to give her comfortable time to catch the plane there was no answer i called her twice more at intervals of ten minutes then i phoned security and told them i thought there could be something wrong they let me into her room she wasnt there and she hadnt packed not even her toilet things she leave any kind of note i couldnt find one i what about and he stopped and waited for me all right i said go on i talked to the doorman who said that mrs maitland had left the hotel at about saying that she didnt want a taxi she wanted to take some air she had a coat on that is all i can tell you my fists were clenched in my pockets to stop the shaking i said have you phoned the steglitz since you left there ten minutes ago from my hotel and shes not back no do you want to come in for a little while shed been shivering standing there outside her door her hands pressing the collar of her coat against her cheeks id said no she needed sleep just for a few minutes shed leaned her head against me and id held her until the shivering had stopped i had to make some calls id told her im cold and a bit frightened thats all and id told her to call room service ask for some hot milk and horlicks that is what i had told her thrower was watching me shed asked me to come in for a few minutes because she was cold and frightened jesus christ it wasnt much to ask was it ive informed london what thrower saying hed informed london id hope so i told him i would very much hope so something hooted down there outside the building a barge i suppose on the river fog still clung to the water but the sun was throwing a clear cold light across the buildings on the other side why dont we sit down thrower said and i looked at him and what did london say theyd do all thats necessary we brought her out here you know that the bureau brought her out here on my recommendation so theyd better bloody well find her again hadnt they he turned away turned back and i didnt like the way he did that he wanted me to see how very patient he was being with me look thrower if they dont find and i stopped in the silence i could hear the thumping of the punchbag downstairs it was freezing cold in here and id just come out of an action phase and id have to get some control back especially if this man thrower was going to run me in the field id need some patience too you dont have to feel any guilt he said about this i dont the recommendation to bring her out here was yours but the decision was londons you split hairs if you like you also blamed yourself im told for what happened to mccane he took a step towards me perhaps because id been raising my voice and he wanted to keep things quiet didnt you is this place all right is it a safehouse the safest in berlin mccane yes that was my and i stopped again i wasnt under control didnt sound under control he came closer still and touched my arm were going to sit down he said ive been on my feet a lot bloody lie hed been in bed all night and then got into a taxi i said there wasnt any sign of you know any kind of disturbance in her room none at all i was careful to look for that with george maitland theyd found blood all over the floor and i didnt want to think about it theyd have to find her london would have to find her i went over to one of the car seats he was right i suppose i looked as if itd do me a bit of good to sit down he took the other one brushing the dust away tell me whats been happening he said what to you oh i was got at you want to record we were suddenly into debriefing i dont use a recorder just tell me it didnt take long it was just an attack that was all but he wanted to know the casualty figures londons fussy about that im not sure i told him one of them had knocked his head against the windscreen i think blood all over his face the man i shot at was certainly hit but he could be still alive the one i pulled out of the car is dead i went for the larynx he was looking at the floor thrower one down he said for certain yes what happened to that man krenz the same thing that was an accident i went for the throat because he was trying to send the car off the road and we were in traffic but i didnt go deep i pulled it i just needed to incapacitate in a moment thrower said possible heart failure whatever i mean im not trying to get out of it if i killed him i killed him whatever records want to put it down as i could hear a jet gunning up at the end of the runway we were only two miles or so from the airport ive remembered something i said there was a man in the nightclub where i talked to willi hartman a man who recognised helen she knew him she told me his name was kurt muller thrower turned his head to look at me i suppose he thought i wasnt taking it seriously enough the fact that id killed at least two people since id got out of bed this morning shouldnt be thinking about helen look i said my job is to bring this mission home and prevent a couple of hundred perfectly innocent people from getting blown out of the sky at thirty thousand feet and if you want me to weep over any graves i dig as i go along youre clean out of luck punchbag thumping down there punchbag thumping i wouldnt mind having a go at that bloody thing myself punch the bloody stuffing out of it all i want i told thrower is a director in the field who understands these things of course i took it seriously taking human life i always have ive spent the dark hours huddled in the keening wind where the ghosts walk gone sleepless through the night often enough im not a clod im not made of bloody stone but i hadnt got time now to rake over the ashes of what id done today i wasnt finished with it yet and theres another thing its a minefield this trade were in a whole complex of boobytraps set up in the dark and i know ive always known that somewhere out there theres one with my name on it too he was still watching me thrower relax he said what relax youve had a busy time he pulled out a notebook kurt muller was it yes i couldnt sit still got up went across the bare splintered floor to look at the river the havel barges on it small boats a hulk rusting near the bank opposite the cold winter sunlight setting the scene in amber but god knows how many kurt mullers there are in the telephone book he hadnt followed us away from the nightclub no one had i knew that but he might have phoned her later or she might have phoned him description thrower had a gold pen ready a gold pen withal thirties pale face black hair fiveten on the thin side a bit roundshouldered eyes i dont remember but black or brown dark not blue thrower put his notebook away lets do some more debriefing yes i suppose i said you changed my hotel because of helen did you of course in case she talked in case she was made to talk why did you put me into the klinghof we know it weve used it before its small tucked away and the woman who runs it is discreet i saw a couple of tarts there thats why shes discreet i need krenzs address dont i i gave it to him he carries a berliner bank visa card and his covers an electronics engineer or he could even be one what did london say when you told them helen was missing in a moment thrower said theyre very concerned they feel responsible id like you to feel reassured there was a pan am plane coming into the approach path settling nose up through the haze the strobes flashing i turned away from the window as long as theyre doing something to find her i said he didnt answer he sat with his pen ready watching me all right that man sorgenicht went straight to the cafeteria when he reached the airport there were two girls at one of the tables and he sat down with them we were into the major phase of the debriefing and thrower made notes sometimes the gold pen flashing in the light from the window the only thing of beauty in this beleaguered hole the name of the german girl is inge stoph were you actually at the signals board when i debriefed to london last night i was you keep a lot in your head i used a recorder then i dont use one in the field some of the difs do ferris does pepperidge does but others wouldnt be seen dead with one halfway through a mission or even before then a tape has got a lot of hot information on it and when crenshaw was running jayson through the field in cyprus a few years ago he got exposed and the opposition got hold of his tape and blew the whole mission and jayson was found with his head off in the back of a garbage truck because hed had to write off three of their cell and they hadnt liked that a tape recorder doesnt carry a capsule my impression i told thrower was that inge stoph was trying to persuade the pan am stewardess to do something or agree to something i told him about the iranian and thrower looked up sharply a pilot yes he made a note and i said i think inge stoph and the pan am girl are friends sorgenicht and stoph are both in nemesis i couldnt fit the iranian in he listened a lot but didnt say much and i didnt pick up anything of a relationship between him and either stoph or the stewardess iran air thrower said doesnt normally fly into berlin they go into frankfurt but the iranians have an extensive network of sleepers and agentsinplace in europe what happened when you left the cafeteria i followed inge stoph i gave him a complete picture of the scene with her in the car park and then we wrapped it up and he put away his notebook and got off the car seat and looked at the river with his hands dug into his pockets and his eyes nowhere and i didnt disturb him when he was ready he asked me you think stoph went for your approach i got a lot of reaction when i mentioned the nuclear missile did you get any idea of her standing with dieter klaus no she could be a girlfriend possibly she could get any man into bed you no most men then she doesnt appeal to you shes got hair on her fingers i mean too much shes a lesbian id say a bi is she do you think a venus trap for nemesis if shes not she could be did you give her the impression she didnt appeal to you im not stupid thrower he looked down tilting on his toes and heels for a moment sorry i said it had sounded as if he wasnt sure whether i knew the value of a venus trap no experienced agent will ever give a venus the impression she doesnt appeal to him in case he wants to use her and walk into the trap and get out again with information thats all right thrower said were getting to understand each other thats all for the first time i wondered whether i should signal london and change him as my dif have him replaced by someone whod run me before but that would blow the board and solitaire was running flat out and i didnt want to slow it down i had to keep this one thing in my mind the whole time above all others it could be any next flight what i need to know thrower went on is whether you feel that if inge stoph comes through with a proposed rendezvous it will be in order to trap you i cant say because i dont know dieter klaus or the way his mind works if she comes through with a rendezvous itll be on his instructions either because he cant resist the temptation of blowing up the houses of parliament and getting his face on the front cover of the terrorists gazette or because he wants to find out who i am and what im doing in berlin thrower stood looking out of the window and he didnt turn round when he said of course you realise how very dangerous it is for you to agree to such a rendezvous for you to meet dieter klaus yes you know his refutation yes suppose you meet him and of course it will be on his own ground and in the presence of his bodyguards what will you rely on to get you away again still alive my cover i was getting impatient but hed got a right to ask me what my plans were he was my director in the field and his job was to support them your cover he said and turned round from the window now and looked at me is that all its all ive got it wont be enough if they suspect youre using a cover theyll try and break it and theyll succeed you know that you talked to that poor devil in the hospital in london they turned him into a im not saying its going to be easy im glad you appreciate that what would you hope to achieve in any case by meeting dieter klaus access to information which plane which flight thats all i want and hes got it what if you failed to get information would you try to take him out kill him he meant kill him of course itd blow nemesis in a moment he said if i let you do this i shall need time to call in as much support as i can it may take no support i realise showing much patience now much patience that you normally prefer working without support and i understand that but if you mean to walk right into the centre of an opposition network with a man like dieter klaus running it id have to insist on support im here to direct you in the field not stand by and see you take this mission deliberately into hazard and destroy it that isnt my plan a crack in one of the windows buzzed as a jet gunned up on takeoff and lifted across the skyline the pan am insignia on the tail and the last of my patience broke my plan is to stop those bastards putting a bomb on a plane full of people and i know the best way to do it and if i hang around waiting for you to call the bloody troops in and clutter up the rendezvous with enough people to start a bloody war then i wont get anywhere i wont get into the centre of nemesis and theyll rig that bomb and blow all those people out of the sky for christs sake dont you understand thrower dont you understand that it could be any next flight he watched me steadily with his pale expressionless eyes not saying anything yet letting me listen again in my mind to what id just said to how id just said it too forcefully too emotionally then he said youve just come through some action that almost cost you your life and your nerves are going to take their time to settle down when youve got your control back well talk again now let me drive you to your hotel he didnt understand he wasnt thinking thrower im going in to the centre of the opposition and ive got to do it alone because theyll have people deployed in the environment and if you put people in as well i shant know one from the other if its a night action and i could easily kill one of them one of ours but more important than that you cant put support in close enough to help me without exposing them and an arms dealer doesnt move around with a crowd of peons hes a businessman and he behaves like one so if you put support on the scene when i go in youll blow my cover before ive got a chance in a thousand to make it work can you hear what im saying youll blow my cover do you think thats what i want from my director in the field he turned away turned back hands in the pockets of his dark elegant coat his head tilted slightly his voice smooth placating well talk about it later i have my arguments too but i dont feel that at the present moment youre sufficiently receptive i took a step towards him my head was throbbing because of the wound and because of what was happening to the mission to solitaire just when id got access just when i was ready to move in on the opposition and destroy it if i could and if i couldnt get clear and try again try again until i found the way and went in for the kill thrower i said want you to tell me something if theres no time to talk if i dont have time to listen to your arguments if i have to go in to this rendezvous at a moments notice will you send in support anyway despite all ive said he didnt hesitate yes i would have to so i turned away and went down the stairs and found jim showing one of his kids a gedan kosauke and asked him if i could make a call and he showed me his little office in the corner of the gym and i picked up the phone and dialled the number and the code extension and blew the board for solitaire all over the signals room in london showdown executive get me control smell of sweat in this place jims office not much bigger than a cupboard control shatner i said i want a new director in the field there was a short silence and i wasnt surprised what is the problem he asked me incompatibility grounds for divorce the relationship between the dif and the executive is very much like a marriage trust is involved and above all else understanding shatner said i need to know more than that i think i heard quiet anger in his tone as ive told you hed said to me in his office yesterday youre not my favourite executive there isnt much time i said im going into a strictly red sector and hes insisting on sending in support shatner thought about that then he said i imagine he thinks you need it it could kill me there was another silence i could only wait only keep what patience i had because this was thin ice and i could crack it if i didnt take care how i walked is he there shatner asked yes ill talk to him shatner didnt understand any more than thrower understood id only come into the field last night and id secured access to the opposition and at any time the call could come through from inge stoph arranging the rendezvous and i was in a position to go right into the centre of nemesis and blow it apart and these two hidebound bloody bureaucrats were trying to stop me dead in my tracks you cant talk to him i told shatner you dont understand the situation the executive in the field is in a fully active phase of the mission and hes urgently requesting a change of the dif and hes got every right to do that and his control is expected to bear in mind that in these circumstances the executive makes the decisions not his dif in the silence i could hear the ice cracking the thing is that control picks the director in the field very carefully from those available making sure hes the right choice for the mission thrower knew berlin and was fluent in german so forth but what shatner hadnt done was make the right choice for the specific executive and thats even more critical but i was taking an appalling risk in asking for a new dif in the first twentyfour hours of the mission because those bloody people in london can come back at you like a boomerang and leave the director in the field and call the executive in and send a new one out in his place and you wont work for the bureau again and for me that would be the end of things finis finite i rather think i understand shatner said my responsibilities as your control i am asking you to put your dif on the line there was a mug a ceramic mug on jims desk in the middle of a mess of papers and bottles of ink and handgrips and rubber bands and paper clips and curled photographs of japanese martial artists and in the mug were some pens and pencils and one of them was vibrating as another jet was cleared for takeoff and thundered into the sky and i was glad to hear the small intimate sound of the pencil sending its message to me if i wanted to hear it in the complex chemistry of life there are always messages for us if we make time to listen and this one was perfectly clear any next flight i had to get the words exactly right i request the immediate attention of chief of signals the ice cracked again and i heard it ive talked to a lot of my own kind in the caff and other places but ive never heard of anyone telling control to his face that they wanted higher rank to talk to in the silence i could hear things going on in the underground signals room voices beepers the sharp clink of a teacup they were there under the floodlit signal boards hunched over the mikes or leaning back to check the progress of a mission reaching for the bit of chalk executive requires backup rendezvous established courier down red sector as the data went in the decisions would be made and chief of signals croder wed never got on well but i respected him above most others he wasnt a bureaucrat im asking for a new dip i told him why he was standing there at the board for solitaire he roves the room croder from board to board taking over in a crisis keeping the heat down bringing people back sometimes from the edge of a certain grave thrower is a very good man he told me he is very experienced standing there under the floodlight with his black reptilian eyes scanning the board his steel hand hanging like a hook i know your style he said and youre quite possibly misjudging things after going through a difficult actionphase am i correct i felt a shiver it sounded like clairvoyance thrower hadnt had time to send my debriefing to the board stuff on the underground garage croder was inside my mind i had to cut corners save time because of the pencil do you know throwers style i waited in a moment yes then youll know that he and i cant work together it meant a lot more than it sounded it meant that if a wheel came off we wouldnt be able to agree on a decision and the mission would crash it meant that if i went into a hot rendezvous with support i hadnt asked for people could get killed i need more information croder said there isnt time you will have to make time so i went in blind didnt think about it otherwise i couldnt have done it i request the immediate attention of bureau one shepley king of kings host of hosts head of london it was all i could have done and id had to do it some people would have called it professional suicide and i would have agreed bureau one is in washington his voice hadnt changed croders but he was now in what amounted to a towering rage thats one of the things i like about him hes a complete master of control but it can be deadly i said i need his immediate attention there were some voices in the background louder than before one of them could be coming over a speaker at the console some beleaguered shadow in extremis calling for help they would want croder at the board his voice came again give me your number i read it to him off the base of the telephone be available croder said and shut down the line on me i stood there with a sense of being in limbo cut off from the day and its affairs lost isolated disenfranchised the throbbing went on in my head with the rhythm of a slow drum beat i would have liked to sit down somewhere rest a little and then wash my face feel civilised for a few minutes before i went into the rendezvous with nemesis because once i was there it could turn out to be difficult not civilised at all it could turn out to be bloody murder there was a grimy bit of glass here next to the door call it a window and through it i could see thrower out there in the gym standing on the other side of the punchbag not watching anything that was going on watching the wall i opened the door and stood just outside it waiting for the phone to ring in washington it was three in the morning and shepley would almost certainly be in bed but theyd wake him the signals room in london can reach him within seconds wherever he is by calling direct to his pager and his pager is never switched off its the equivalent of a presidential hotline and croder wouldnt fail to signal him when the executive is in the field hes considered to be in hazard whether hes in a red sector or not and london undertakes to keep bureau one in constant touch with him its in our contract thrower was coming across the gym walking carefully his footprints on a sandy beach would make a straight line and this was my problem with him you can tell a lot about people by the way they walk and this mans mind like his footprints in the sand was unwilling to deviate when he reached me he asked you were signalling london hed seen me through the window known what i must be doing washington his expressionless eyes rested on me bureau one is in washington i believe yes youre signalling bureau one yes he looked away watching two of the kids struggling on the mat one of them trying to get out of a chokehold pulling and tugging i felt his frustration ive always heard thrower said that you are intractable i expect you have it is in my mind he said smoothly with no rancour no rancour at all in his tone to ask that you are replaced i assume that doesnt surprise you no i didnt want to talk to him we didnt speak the same language and it was so bloody cold in this place that my mouth felt clamped by it by the cold my jaws felt frozen but it was a consolation that with a bit of luck i would shortly be on my way to a hot rendezvous joke my good friend that is a little joke we must do what we can to keep cheerful must we not perhaps you would give him my respects thrower was saying what bureau one of course the kid on the mat got free suddenly and i felt a bit better yes weve just got a signal sir from the executive for solitaire he requests your attention its the correct term you see straight out of the book requests your attention means the poor bastard stuck out there in the field wants to talk to you for christs sake cant they speak the queens english cold i wanted to move my feet to get some warmth in them but i didnt because this bastard was here thrower sign of weakness cold feet wouldnt do is he in a red sector sitting up in bed in his pyjamas bureau one host of hosts just a touch difficult to imagine the godhead in pyjamas no sir but theres a problem with his dif shatner in the floodlit signals room standing there at the board with his arms folded looking at his shoes his cracked and rather ancient suede shoes the hole still in his sock standing there looking down at them because he didnt want to look at croder because controls responsibility had been passed on by the executive to the chief of signals and that was a little embarrassing hes in berlin yes sir croder in the signals room walking up and down like a bloody vulture with its wings folded behind it he looks like that actually croder hes got a thin neck and it tends to disappear into his collar and that hook hes got for a hand is so very like a claw walking up and down and looking at nobody because the chief of signals responsibility for the mission had been passed on by the executive to bureau one and that too was embarrassing hes talked to mr croder yes sir head throbbing my head was throbbing the pulserate would be a degree elevated say because epiphany was setting in and i was beginning to wonder whether it was a terribly good idea to bring the mission to a dead stop and risk crashing it over a difference of opinion there were so many lives in the balance all those people in the plane no i refuse that their lives would be at a greater risk if i let this dictatorial bureaucrat get in my way because knew what to do in the deep reaches of the psyche where everything is known i knew what to do then ill talk to him myself hed got to he was party to my contract but it was a long shot christ it was a long shot despite all the wonders of technology and telephones because it might not be like that at all in the signals room croder could have taken shatner outside to work out some kind of decision rather than disturb bureau one at three in the morning five thousand miles away they could very well be agreeing to hold things off wait until this infamously intractable executive had cooled down a little seen some sense because phone ringing jim looked up from the mat and i said i thought it was for me and he said go ahead and i went into the cluttered little office and picked up the phone yes bureau one what is the problem incompatibility in what way i couldnt say there wasnt time to tell him he was as high as i could go and if i couldnt make him understand that the mission was jeopardised id have to play the last card id got and i didnt want to do that it would make things infinitely more difficult more dangerous so i told him about the impasse wed reached thrower and i on the subject of sending in support when i went in to the rendezvous and told him also that my dif didnt seem to understand the way i worked the way i had to work if i was to bring the mission home then i waited play the last card yes if i had to if shepley called me in or if he told me id have to work out my differences with my dif i would go to ground cut myself off from the dif and from london and go it alone let them chalk it up on the board in signals executive withdraws a graceful way to put it typically euphemistic because what it would really mean was that i would have to find myself a burrow in the bowels of berlin and operate from there surface from there and do what i could to infiltrate nemesis penetrate to the centre blow it up on my own without any help without signals without franchise without authority infinitely more difficult more dangerous but i would do it if i had to ive done it before do you feel shepley was asking me that your dif has a case that hes thinking of your protection rather than of imposing his own will possibly you concede that yes but he doesnt understand whats involved im going to be on sensitive ground ultrasensitive and i dont want the opposition to pick up the vibrations it could be fatal i waited in the ceramic mug the pencil was buzzing again as a plane got airborne hold fast yes i must hold fast and if necessary go to ground they hate it in london if you do that they like to keep their puppets on the string they dont like to think theyve got a rogue shadow loose in the field you can see their point you realise shepley said that i might feel it best to have you recalled he had a calm voice bureau one calm measured and contemplative yes i said and you realise that your dif has a case to make on your own admission and that i might feel it best for you to settle your differences and proceed with the mission yes i said thrower had moved away from the door he was watching the wall again his feet neatly together i suppose hed thought it rather rude if hed stayed by the door listening he was a gentleman give him that but this is not a trade for gentlemen what would you do bureau one asked me from washington from his bed five thousand miles away through the night if i recalled you or if i instructed you to work with your present dif one of them was on the punchbag again thump thump thump and it gave me energy i think gave me strength gave me the feeling that it was my own fist pounding into the leather bag thump thump thump a good feeling sanguine confident id go to ground i said australian airlines came drifting across the skyline a winged kangaroo on the tail lowering to the runway with the pale winter sunshine flashing on the windows the soft scream of the jets pitching up a little as it reached for the surface of the earth shepley hadnt answered me i didnt mind id said all i wanted to say and hed have to take it from there if all went well i had a rendezvous to keep and nothing was going to stop me but id rather do it for the bureau stay on the signals board keep the lifeline open id have a better chance that way his voice came shepleys who do you want as your director in the field thump thump thump on the bag come on bust the bugger ferris ferris is directing stingray mayhew he is in morocco cone you can have cone ill instruct control the line went dead and i put the phone down and tucked the corner of a hundreddeutschemark note underneath it and went out of the office and across to where thrower was standing you can go home now i said cone it is contended legally that voestalpine of vienna licensed gerald bulls howitzer technology about some time before he dismantled his american operation and went to work with poudriere reunie beige who wanted to produce and market howitzer shells together with austrian gun sales crumbs dropped from the meat pie as i took bites at it and i held it over the greaseproof paper a jet took off leaving echoes among the buildings it was just gone hours by eleven i had got through the whole cassette made notes turned them face down making up questions answering them some of them right not all of them not enough terpil and korkala were convicted in absentia for conspiring to sell machine guns and million rounds of ammunition to a small unit of new york undercover police officers posing as south american revolutionaries several private people and agencies are now looking for these two in lebanon but their hideout is quite difficult to locate it was cold in here in this small oblong room at the top of the building there was an electric heater but it didnt do much more than warm the air within a few inches of it where i had my feet the cold was coming from inside me some of it i hoped cone would get into berlin before i needed him before inge stoph telephoned if she were going to telephone if klaus had told her hed see me a woman laughed lower in the building one of the tarts i suppose i didnt think the top floor rooms were used or at least not by the girls when id been shown along the passage most of the doors had been open with nothing in the rooms except for tin trunks mattresses a portable bidet some newspapers no beds or furniture but the room was all right because it was on the third floor and the one window wasnt overlooked and there was a metal fire escape and a courtyard with sixfoot walls on three sides when the woman with the huge mole on her neck had left me id stood outside on the fire escape and checked on the roof there wasnt easy access but it could be done if it didnt snow it surprised me that a man like thrower had chosen a place like this it should have offended his sensibilities perhaps hed just signalled kleibers support group and asked them where he should book me in the biggest dealer across the globe is sarkis soghanalian born a turkisharmenian christian and naturalised as a lebanese he lives most of the time in the usa the weaponry he has sold has been used in lebanon nicaragua angola ghana biafra you name it even against britain in the falklands miniwar though soghanalian claims he is friendly to the us and her allies in the west he spoke quietly ahmad samala leaving silences for notetaking sometimes i could hear his smile when he talked about new weapons the latest and shiniest of his toys terpil was after that particular model but i beat him to it and he was most upset there was a telephone in here theyd led an extension cable from the next room but there was a big enough gap under my door for it to shut i would be glad when the thing rang i didnt know the timing for the day inge could call kleiber and make a rendezvous an hour from now and it could take me an hour to reach there i would also be glad when cone rang to say he was in berlin the executive would have a director in the field and solitaire could start running again and those bloody people controlling the board in london could settle down and try and get things right in future shatner must have been out of his mind to pick someone like thrower to handle me my head was still throbbing i think because i was feeling under pressure with so much information to take in against the clock he deals in everything from brazilian tanks to helicopters and army uniforms sometimes legally but not always there are widespread thefts that go on at military bases all the time twelve noon hes rather touchy when people tell him hes a merchant of death he asks them how the big chemical manufacturers feel selling the stuff they do if they dont feel guilty why should he hours he couldnt have been in europe then cone when signals had called him in they dont have allegiance to any flag or organisation remember and they need wars in order to prosper it makes them different i wanted to phone kleiber and ask him if hed had instructions from london to mount a search for helen maitland but it would tie up the line and i had to stay open for cone for kleiber a twa jumbo dropped through the sky on its approach path trailing a skein of exhaust gas through the winter sunshine we must remember that because arms dealers meet so many people in government and military circles they pick up some very sensitive information and there are those who trade that information for as high a price as they can get and that is often very high indeed they the phone began ringing and the nervelight flashed behind my right eye the side where id banged my head i picked up the receiver bitter mr jones yes cone your place or mine i asked him does kleiber know youre here i phoned him from the plane youd better come to my place i told him it was kleiners number id given to inge and this was where hed call me bring anything cone asked no i shut down and switched on the tape again there was another incident in kansas usa during a propellent transfer for a recycling operation a pipe broke loose from the missile in the silo and there was a release of nitrogen tetroxide samala was talking about the availability of nerve gas from legitimate sources when cone arrived his footsteps picking their way across the bare boards of the corridor with deliberation i opened the door and he came in and took a quick look around economy class its good in terms of security oh yes he would have noticed the fire escape and the fact that the room was at the other end of the building from the stairs so that you could hear people coming sit down i said and he looked carefully at the iron bedstead and the two art deco chairs and sat down in one of them and pulled a manila envelope out of his coat and gave it to me stuff on the miniver missile you wanted it didnt you yes they gave it to me in london its also been faxed to throwers hotel and ill have it picked up there its nothing classified just the specifications mostly from janes bit of action was there i suppose my eyes were still a bit nervy yes nothing serious bump on the head doesnt show anything else bruised shoulder still use it yes i showed him how dyou feel first class he nodded and stopped talking hed been like this in moscow fussing about injuries part of his job one of the responsibilities of the director in the field is to make sure his executive doesnt go into any kind of action unless hes fit he sat watching me with his bright attentive eyes the window throwing light across his raw peeledlooking face the cheekbones sharp under the skin the ear nearer the window so thin that it was translucent cone wherever he is even in summer looks as if hes walking against a blizzard and more than that as if he created it for himself perhaps as a penance did you get any briefing in london i asked him the lot from shatner yes how was he pissed off he couldve got me killed giving me that clown what about debriefing on this side i was an hour with said clown at the airport london set it up he was told to wait for me to come in before he booked out i would have expected london to do that to have thrower go through the whole of the debriefing hed given me so that i wouldnt have to do it all over again for cone lets hope it was accurate i said it sounded all right hes got a good memory what about timing then im waiting for a call from inge stoph through kleiber whatever time she suggests ill have to be there so tell me whats got to be done before you leave as soon as you can tell kleiber to send someone along to the taxirank outside the steglitz hotel ask them if helen maitland got into one of their cabs and if so where she was taken the doorman offered to get her one but she said she felt like a walk description i gave it to him all right you trust her dont you we cant shes naive and shes totally subservient to men if anyone told her to walk into a trap thats what shed do and thats what you think shes done possibly and if anyone asked her the wrong questions thats why thrower moved me out of the steglitz right away cone got out of the chair moving around better not phone kleiber yet not until he phones us you can tell him then right i was going through the documents in the envelope they were a breakdown on the miniver specifications capability technical drawings disposition of all known models mostly in the usa some in the uk some in germany that what you wanted cone asked me its perfect thank goodness somethings perfect then i dropped the documents onto the bed i hope youre not worried i said he leaned one shoulder against the window frame looking down at me sometimes turning his head as a plane moved through the pale sunshine outside thrower said youre going to try getting into nemesis on your own and with no support and youll be relying on your cover and nothing else is that right yes in a moment he said you did this to me before in berlin then you should be used to it true he watched me steadily for a moment and then turned away and ive seen that look before when the missions running hot and theres no place for the shadow to go except into a red sector they wonder if its the last time theyre going to see you it used to worry me but it doesnt any more theres no other way i told him you couldnt stop anyone putting a bomb on a plane by relying on conventional security measures with forty or fifty thousand commercial flights a day going through the airports worldwide the hightech plastic explosive semtex was colourless and odourless and it could be moulded into any shape a shoe or a hairbrush or a teddy bear and at the moment there was no equipment in europe that could detect it in a suitcase or a handbag cone knew that the only way i told him is to get inside the organisation thats planning to plant a bomb and wipe it out in time he watched an air france nosing into the sky oh im not arguing so are you going to use any kind of base a car where i dont know until i know where the rendezvous is he came and sat down again facing me his arms across his knees you want somebody to watch the car no it could be a night action and i wouldnt be able to identify him nemesis could find out that the car was mine and put a watch on it too are you going in wired cone asked me no the idea was tempting but if they found a mike on me itd blow my cover and my cover was all id have the cold was getting into me into my bones you dont carry weapons cone said that right no a successful arms dealer is a businessman and he doesnt carry a gun and even if i had one on me when i went close enough to nemesis theyd look for itand find it and take it away you carry a capsule cone asked me no i wasnt infiltrating the regime of the host country and the only interest nemesis would take in the bureau was personal they didnt want us to get in their way that was all if they put me under implemented interrogation and blew my cover and found i was operating against them theyd simply finish things off and get a body bag you need a courier no i was taking the ultimate risk and it wasnt likely that i could make contact with a courier without exposing him what about a deadline cone asked me i cant give you one i dont know where ill be by hours or midnight or or noon in any case you cant send in anyone to look for me but for the board if you like call it noon tomorrow if i havent been able to make some kind of signal by then you can tell them to send out a new shadow cone studied his dry scaly hands theres not much he said i can do then for the moment not much no but if i can go in and get out youll have a lot to do thered be enough signals to light up the board in london because if i could blow nemesis from the centre thered be a lot of fallout and wed hand things over to the bundeskriminalamt to hunt down the survivors and make arrests questions cone asked me no hed had the london briefing and my own debriefing and he knew as much about the way the mission was running as i did there was nothing i needed to ask him then you better get on with your homework yes he got up and stood at the window for a moment watching a twa jumbo go sloping into the sky it must give you the willies he said as he turned round all those people yes you know where to find me he said and i opened the door and watched him picking his way along the passage his thin body angled forward a little against the blizzard in his soul hours the statistics relevant to the legitimate sale of ak assault rifles are as follows hours the us dollar is the standard currency in all arms deals of any importance hours and as the late winter sunshine changed from rose to purple across the roofs of the buildings opposite my window and the planes moved through the twilight with the stealth of phantoms before their sound came in i became prey to the feeling that the telephone standing on the lopsided bare wooden table was never after all going to ring that dieter klaus wasnt here in berlin or that inge stoph hadnt been able to contact him i couldnt assume that hed be interested in any case in a tactical nuclear missile his plans to put a bomb on board a pan am plane could be already advanced he might not even have time for a meeting with a strange arms dealer with hew toys to sell he might have all he needed singapore and israel both possess several hightech armaments that are not available anywhere else in the world at hours i sat in the semidarkness of the little room with the recorder shut off and my mind ranging across the data that id been feeding into it since this morning a big jet reached for altitude across the skyline with its strobes flashing and the thin line of its windows slanting through the dark so dieter klaus wasnt in berlin or inge stoph hadnt been able to contact him or she knew about the ambush theyd set for me in the underground garage knew my cover story was false was that why the telephone hadnt rung i didnt think so if sorgenicht had recognised me in the cafeteria and phoned for support they would have gone for me in the car park while i was talking to inge they wouldnt have waited it hadnt been sorgenicht whod got onto me when theyd started the search for krenz they must have intercepted some of the calls going out from the mercedes to the saab and traced them and found the saab in the garage and set the trap waiting for me to go back to it there was no connection between the unknown man who had taken over the mercedes from krenz and the man who had openly approached inge stoph in the car park she didnt know who i was or if she knew and telephoned with a rendezvous it would be fatal to keep it but i wouldnt know i walked about restless up and down the narrow room the floorboards creaking and the sound of the girls rising from the rooms below as they laughed for their money at the outset of the long nights parody of love a plane thundered into the dark and now the appalling idea came to me that id been wasting time trusting the whole of the mission to a hypothetical rendezvous while all those people were busy packing their bags and saying goodbye to friends and filing through the departure gate for their exciting ride with the little teddy bear id have to signal cone and tell him there was a change of plan id need to find another way in to nemesis if it wasnt already too late but the phone began ringing suddenly in the quiet room and i swung round and picked it up and kleiber told me that inge stoph had called to say that if i wanted to talk to dieter klaus i must be at the northwest corner of waldschulle alice and harbigstrasse at this evening and that i must go there alone klaus and now johan has the puck and hes leading with it all the way and hes going as if there just isnt anybody here to stop him this is only his second time out since the injury he sustained at frankfurt but thats obviously old history by the way hes moving floodlights roofed the night isnt he amazing inge asked me i said yes amazing would you like one waving a bratwurst thank you i hadnt eaten since this morning but we didnt expect tommy warnke to get across there so fast and it looks as if johans going to have his work cut out unless he can pile on that extra turn of speed hes so famous for the stadium was packed the colours of the sweaters and scarves and woollen hats turning it into a vast flower bed you like icehockey inge asked me very much id reached the northwest corner of waldschulle allee and harbigstrasse at the precise hour for the rendezvous and paid off the taxi and the crimson porsche had pulled in to the kerb with a squeal of tyres hans she waved from the car and i went across to it and got in its so nice to see you again showgirl smile the eyes icebright and observant she took the porsche away with a dash of expertise her right hand caressing the gearknob she was wearing the same crimson calflength boots but tonight she sported a russian fur hat with fur gloves to match a dark green jaguar was trailing us it had pulled up behind the porsche and started off again keeping close enough to make sure no one slipped in between later it overtook us and the woman at the wheel glanced across at inge and away then she held back and began trailing again inge knew the jaguar was with us but didnt say anything she drove steadily playing the lights and the traffic lanes without flash but with effectiveness dieter said he can only give you a few minutes she told me as we waited for a green but even so youre lucky so is he i said i assume you told him what ive got for him she looked at me you dont understand its very difficult to get dieter to see anyone at all its very difficult i said to keep me waiting so long for a meeting the lights changed to green and she shifted the gearlever so then why did you decide to wait i let my eyes move over her face for one thing i find you charming thank you she wasnt impressed she was a knockout and she knew it but she flashed me the dazzling sharptoothed feline smile and i was fairly sure now that dieter klaus had instructed her to spring a venus trap on me and i was going to walk right into it because i knew how to pick up information that way it would also be in keeping with my cover an international arms dealer passing through berlin wouldnt turn down the chance of a night with a girl like inge stoph and for another thing she asked me i confess to a certain admiration for dieter klaus she said rather quickly what do you know about him not very much but in my trade the word gets around that hes different from the kind of thugs you find say in the rote armee faktion thats exactly the word inge said dieter klaus is very different it was all she said and she drove in silence until we reached the stadium id telephoned cone before i left the hotel and told him what time the rendezvous was and where he said he already knew kleiber had signalled him i cancelled the car it was a mobile rdv with no fixed address and i didnt know the area didnt know where they could leave a car for me to reach if i needed one cone made a last try asking me if id changed my mind about using support i said i hadnt i dont think ive ever seen braun so quick with the passes i think the comeback johan has made is inspiring him and in fact the whole team i glanced sometimes at dieter klaus hes over there inge had told me when wed sat down there were two men and four women around him they were three rows down across the aisle in the best seats the ehrentribune my view of him wasnt obstructed but it was at an angle of ten or fifteen degrees from behind and i only saw his face when he turned to speak to the woman on his left his head was bare his hair was dressed in the prussian style brushcut and blond he wore a black overcoat with a dark sable collar no gloves a pair of designer sunglasses his entourage was fitted out with the same black padded track suit for each of them except for the woman on his left she wore a tourmaline mink coat and hat a flash of gold at her ears nothing on her wrists unless it was under a sleeve she was young oliveskinned a latin and she was giving more of her attention to the game than to dieter klaus even when he turned his head to say something inge watched him with a lot more interest she was sitting on my right so that when she moved her head to look across at klaus i couldnt see her eyes but the angle of her head and its stillness told me a great deal and when she turned to look at me for a moment to talk about him the expression in her eyes was clear enough dieter klaus was the subject of her adoration hes here in berlin tonight she told me for a special reason normally he stays in frankfurt he flew in an hour ago quite an aficionado she looked surprised for an instant yes but he didnt come to berlin tonight to watch ice hockey it sounds interesting i said something perhaps i can help him with she gave me a long look no everything is arranged teddy bear and lange takes the puck but hes not too well placed for a strike if he means to go for a goal at this distance and with those two quarterbacks moving in from the flank but hes got the speed if he wants to take it closer before he strikes just look at that teddy bear in the sky he was fifty feet away from where i was sitting dieter klaus and the thought was running through my mind that if i could get close enough to him when we were leaving the stadium i might go for a quick direct kill and take it from there keep the others off me if i could use the confusion and the crowd for cover they wouldnt use guns even if they had any it was illegal to carry arms in this city and the sound of shots would bring the police and security much faster than a brawl it was simply a thought running through my head i was not mad i knew the risks but the situation was so obviously attractive the executive for solitaire was within fifty feet of the target and if he could close that distance to within killing range he could complete the mission in a matter of seconds and two or three hundred people would board their flight and feel nothing worse than a touch of jet lag at the other end attractive such a very attractive situation with legs as long as that inge was calling above the sudden roar of the crowd im not surprised he can make that kind of speed i said no it wasnt surprising something like that there was another thought in my mind less attractive inge had been full of suspicion this morning at the airport when id told her wed met at one of willis parties and i couldnt tell how much id convinced her that it was true that she simply didnt remember me i might not have convinced her at all she could have brought me here tonight to have me killed do you smoke she had a packet of players in her hand im trying to quit she flashed her smile and lit a cigarette and the scent of marijuana came on the air to have me killed because i didnt know what shed said to dieter klaus when shed phoned him in frankfurt ive just met an arms dealer who says he respects you and what youre doing he supports people who try to bring down the capitalistic establishment and he says he can sell you a nuclear missile are you interested that would be all right that would be very nice but she might have said something quite different ive just met a man who says that he knows you and your organisation he even knows its name he says he knows that you have substantial backing from colonel gadhafi he pretended hed met me before but ive never seen him in my life and i think you should have him worked over to find out who he is if you like i can bring him to you that would not be all right it would not be very nice at all but that is what i thought shed probably said to klaus and those were the terms of the critical risk i was taking i hadnt walked in here with much hope of getting clear again if i wanted to if i had to i was committed now if i got up and tried to walk out of here i wouldnt get farther than the car park if they didnt want me to the people in the black track suits i didnt underestimate them because four of them were women ive trained too many women myself at norfolk in the lethal use of the hands the men would only be there in case they were needed and as johan gets through and shapes for the strike hes no more than two feet ahead of lieberman and hell need an awful lot of speed to bring this one off i was committed and that had been my intent from here i could only go in deeper all the way to the centre and i could only get out by destroying nemesis first shes one of his girls inge said yes whats her name dolores im one of his girls too one of his concubines we share him its an honour her eyes were shimmering how nice for him she drew on the cigarette deeply wed do anything for him she looked at me with her eyes narrowing we would kill for him i said he must have quite a lot of enemies of course they are dealt with one of the players made a goal and the crowd roared and i tried to think how to bring maitland into the conversation and helen this girl might know where helen was what had happened to her there was an englishman i remember killed in berlin last week may ford was it or mason was he one of dieters enemies but i couldnt risk it there were too many reasons for murder in a big city and there didnt have to be any connection with nemesis i must ask dieter i said why he flew in to berlin tonight youve got me interested she looked at me he might tell you he might not im a salesman inge and at the moment im selling something rather impressive as i told you he could take out an entire sports stadium like this one she looked around her that would be impressive yes that would be powerful her eyes had darkened the blue ice gathering shadows i like power thats why im with dieter klaus hes the most powerful man in europe itll be interesting to see what he thinks about you hans but i must tell you something i have a very good memory and ive never been to one of willi hartmans parties in my life please check to make sure you havent left any belongings on your seat and be patient with children and elderly people they may be a little slower than the rest of us wait inge said people moved past us and she slipped between them and went down the steps and spoke to klaus and for an instant he looked across at me then inge turned and came back her eyes bright as she said hell see you for a moment outside the stadium she put a hand on my arm and we waited until klaus and his bodyguards moved past us to the exit tunnel he didnt look in our direction none of them did it was a huge crowd but we kept up a good pace once wed started moving then it must have been somewhere else id told her and shed laughed lightly and said yes it must have been but i knew now that when shed phoned dieter klaus she might have told him that i was an arms dealer but shed also told him that id pretended wed met before and seemed suspect so perhaps he should have me worked over did you like the game she asked me very much her smile was different now it had secret amusement in it and her eyes were cold fire i didnt think it was the marijuana i thought that if she could consider the idea of destroying a packed sports stadium and find it impressive shed probably feel turned on by escorting a man to his execution we were held back at one of the gates to the car park by an old man with a ruff of silver hair below his black wool hat hed dropped something a glove i think and inge brushed past him with a quick laugh dont you think that when people get to a certain age they should be shot they were ahead of us klaus and his guards and the woman dolores then they slowed as they neared a black mercedes limousine with smoked windows and an array of antennae over the boot a uniformed driver opened a rear door and dolores got in then inge stopped me with her hand as dieter klaus swung round what do you want to see me about ill tell you in private why in private because i dont talk in the presence of hirelings he studied me his hands in the pockets of his black sabletrimmed coat his blunt head forward his mouth tight i couldnt see his eyes he spoke in jerks his whole body moving energised by his thoughts youve heard of bodyguards i dont talk to strangers except in the presence of my bodyguards i wont hurt you klaus i caught a soft sound from inge i suppose she thought i was being disrespectful to the fuhrer you say you are an arms dealer an arms dealer thats right if we why should that interest me i took a step forward as if to be closer so that i could lower my voice and the bodyguards came in very fast indeed and crossed in front of klaus in a protective shield with their hands coming up into the kenpo defence posture one of them was asian i thought mongol they stared at me with the indifference in their eyes of a predator before the kill i had needed to know how good they were i couldnt see klaus any more or at least not much of him just the left lens of his dark glasses i waited in a moment klaus said leave him they moved slowly backwards lowering their hands klaus i said youve been told what ive got to offer you that offer expires at midnight ive got an appointment tomorrow with the soviet foreign minister in geneva my plane answer my question why have you approached me with this offer because youre a professional in your field i like dealing with professionals we could what do you know about me i can see you in private i said for half an hour but what do you know about me i looked at my watch im afraid youre wasting my time ill give you another take him they wore soft shoes and were with me almost in silence locking my arms and then klaus said take him to the garage give him to geissler tell geissler to find out who he is and what he wants i saw inge her eyes bright as she called out to klaus can i be there too he swung to look at her yes strobe i was spinning on the wall of the vortex spinning very fast the vortex had been the sea itself and then the wind had come and the sea drew down in the centre and began whirling and i was in it whirling on the dark wall of the vortex a thing with its arms and legs flung out and its mouth open screaming but sometimes lucidity came like a shaft of brilliant light and i saw myself in the chair my wrists handcuffed to its arms my head held back by a strap so that i couldnt lower it couldnt look away from the light it was a strobe light then the vortex took me down again a huge dark wave leaping and roaring down and sweeping me with it and leaving me spinning on the wall of water the wall of the vortex and i began screaming again but the other sound was louder drowning my voice i was in terror of the sound it was a piezo electric siren it was filling the room the garage with such a volume of sound that the walls would belly outwards before long and the roof crash down surely it must happen with this monstrous volume of sound filling the room the garage the piezo had a faster beat than the strobe light the flashes of the strobe were hitting my closed eyes at something like fifty or sixty per minute but the rhythm of the siren was in the region of five oscillations a second slicing through my head and pinning me to the wall of dark water whirling and screaming in the huge dark vortex a black hole an otherworld death lucidity again and a degree of selfawareness enough to know that the sweat was crawling on my face and my pulse racing the saliva springing into my mouth so fast that i had to keep swallowing the whole of the nervous system had become galvanised flashflashflash any conception of time had been destroyed somewhere in the past i didnt know if id been here for three hours or three days the thing was to keep the integrity of the organism unbroken to hack out a pathway through this miasma and maintain orientation but my brain was in theta waves and it could only surface with an effort of will and in the theta region access to the will is diminished dangerously diminished flash flash flash as the mind rocked as the dark wall of the vortex reared and whirled then they shut off the sound silence exploded and i was left in the debris of the shock spinning among waves of colour powerless to reach any kind of shore where betawave thought could begin again until over the minutes the colours of the waves of silence drained away and i thought i heard a voice who are you my face was wet the whole organism was vibrating it felt like a bell vibrating what i heard someone say what but that was me who are you flashflashflash turn off that light i said who are you turn off that fucking light flash flash flash im going to ask you some questions when youve answered them turn off the light rage was beginning now as the natural reaction to shock and if i hadnt been handcuffed to the chair i might have got up and killed him killed someone killed as many of them as i could reach because there was more than one man in here more than one of them but then we must think we must do a little thinking because id come here with a cover and that was what i must use the only weapon i had the only one that could keep the mission running i hadnt got this close to nemesis in order to kill some people and get clear i was here to go in deeper right to the centre there was no place here for rage flashflashflash ignore i might decide i said to answer questions and i might not well see difficult what listen that things left my head buzzing you ought to know that youll have to speak up who are you hans mittag what business are you in armaments i buy and sell what were you doing at the airport this morning none of your bloody business i need to know i was seeing someone off but im not going to tell you his name hes a business associate tell klaus that if he wants what ive offered him hes got to pay for it youll never brainwash it out of me you understand that he didnt say anything for a moment i let my eyes come open a little and saw some shapes they were floating behind the flashing light because it had produced tears and they were still coming i think there were three men here and there was another face beautiful a womans inges what i thought hed spoken perhaps he hadnt i was still in an altered state of consciousness would be for a while that was the object of the exercise to disorientate before they started the questions how long have you been an arms dealer several years how many oh jesus christ havent you ever met an arms dealer before we dont start at any specific time its not like reporting for your first day at a bloody bank you dont just have to watch it i mustnt get cross it doesnt suit the cover my head was still full of the most appalling noises that was all and i wanted to kill someone for doing that to me kill one of these people kill klaus dieter klaus yes well thats on the cards isnt it hes the target for the mission kill that bloody you work in what tell me what main area you work in god what a vague question you mean what do i buy and sell or do you mean where do i go to do it i buy and sell anything i can make a profit on and i go all over the world is this the way klaus normally does business with arms dealers i thought he was an intelligent human being dont get cross i suppose shed asked klaus if she could come here inge in case they found i was some kind of spook and took me outside and tore me apart and then she could play with the giblets like cats do when theyve killed a mouse her beautiful iceblue eyes had been shining when shed called out to him can i be there too like a little girl asking daddy if she could go to the party bitch she was a bitch very thirsty now i was very thirsty but i wasnt going to ask these bastards for anything a pox on them steady now steady lad get the nerves back in the basket or youre a gonner youll blow the whole thing where do you go for instance go china for instance wouldnt you look theres been a tremendous proliferation of sources of materiel in the last few years because weve got all these lovely wars to keep going but chinas still very much in business id put it about eighth on the list of the major world suppliers where else he had a thin voice and i believe a thin face i could see it floating near the flash flash flash of that bloody strobe he was wearing black goggles welders goggles the bastard i could use a pair of those you dont have to go far surely you know that there are still over two hundred thousand soviet troops hanging around in this country waiting to be sent home and a lot of them are raiding their stores for anything they can carry they but you deal in bigger things than that dont you they steal tanks arent tanks big enough for you even soghanalian deals in them because when who sarkis soghanalian hes the biggest dealer there is an absolute pro a turkisharmenian christian with lebanese papers lives in the usa what other dealers do you know flashflashflash i told him about terpil korkala people like that what about the turkish border flash flash flash i told him about the traffic in semtex the traffic in drugs the strobe wasnt inducing hallucinations as the piezo siren had done but it was keeping me just below full betawave consciousness and that was what he wanted the man with the thin voice the thin face gestler no geissler take him to the garage give him to geissler yes he wanted me just below the surface uncritical unwary and id have to be very careful because go on what that bloody lights making me sleepy you were talking about the exchange of sensitive information thats right i mean we meet a lot of top people on government level and so we pick up some very valuable information get a high price for it if we work it right better than tanks sometimes flash flash flash asked me about the us scene told him asked me about a lot of other things and sometimes i felt myself smiling just as he had smiled little ahmad samala when he was talking about his toys the sweat drying on my face and the eyes still streaming their faces floating in the rhythmic pulsing of light and dark told him what he wanted to know where was that in the usa in arkansas an airman dropped a ninepound socket from a spanner inside a titan silo and it punched a hole in the skin of a fuel cell and started a leak and this is the funny bit there was a ton steel door on the silo and when that fuel went off it sent it two hundred feet straight into the air and dropped it a thousand feet away you were there if id been there i wouldnt be here no soghanalian told me about it these things happen flash flash flash do you ever deal in nuclear armaments or components i tried to look at him through the tears do i what do you ever deal in i heard what you said but what the hell are you talking about didnt they tell you tell me what he was testing me out that was all hed done a lot of that asking me to repeat things to see if i was consistent im offering to sell dieter klaus an nk miniver and what is that look if klaus wants to know the specifics im willing to tell him providing its in a civilised environment im not used to discussing an arms deal worth a million us dollars in a garage now youd better listen to this youre behaving like a gang of thugs and it surprises me because dieter klaus has got a reputation for running a really sophisticated organisation but if youll switch that thing off and get me out of this chair we can talk about things im still ready to do a deal with klaus but hell have to prove hes serious all hes done so far is make me very annoyed the tears streaming on my face nothing much more in my head now but the flash flash flash of the strobe and then it stopped not altogether it went on but only under my eyelids now not right through my head release him geissler said people moved about and someone came close smell of tobacco the handcuffs came off working he was working on the strap now the strap on my head i couldnt hear too well there was quite a degree of tinnitus these bastards had been wearing earprotectors must have been what is the miniver like geissler ive told you im not just a brief description nothing specific i opened my eyes got out a handkerchief the bodyguards whod brought me here had gone but there were two other people both men this time both with guns hanging from their hands inge was leaning against the redbrick wall one foot against it behind her arms folded i couldnt see the expression in her eyes things were still floating a bit geissler was quite tall not your usual mobster quite intelligentlooking but then his questions had been like that quite intelligent i could see him holding a violin or a baton except for his eyes which had as much soul in them as a steel trap he was waiting its a tactical nuclear missile i said capable of being launched by a designated officer of high rank in the field at his personal discretion or by anyone in his command presumably under his supervision im not sure of the niceties the miniver can knock out an entire division or as i told inge a sports stadium or the houses of parliament in london what you will thats all i can tell you i got out of the chair and no one stopped me they still looked like figures in some kind of netherworld and i wasnt too steady on my feet but that was to be expected presumably my cover had stood up or the stoph girl would be out there playing with my giblets by now my name is geissler the thin man said ignaz geissler he offered me his hand ill take you to see dieter klaus there was no one in the room ill tell him youve arrived geissler said and left me he didnt lock the door i would have heard it even though there was still some lingering tinnitus ringing in my head from that awful piezo thing the heavy silk curtains were drawn across the windows and i didnt part them to look out on principle i dont like to offer a blatant target though i didnt think anyone here was likely to shoot at me they could have done that in the garage if theyd wanted to geissler had ordered one of the men there to blindfold me again and had apologised in his dry way calling it an inconvenient measure of security then theyd put me into a car and geissler and another man had sat in the back with me and id smelled gun oil the garage had been somewhere south of tegel airport because we hadnt gone far from the eissporthalle and on our way here id monitored the sound of the planes along their flight paths and the hooting of the tugs and barges on the tegeler see and i would have said the house was northwest of the airport but not far away eight or nine kilometres perhaps in kreis oranienburg the room was spacious elegant whiteenamelled fluted mouldings shotsilk wall covering a twelvefoot ceiling the furniture mostly reproduction edwardian the carpeting heavy brocaded at the fringe the magazines neatly arranged on the low polished table near the hearth were mostly german stern quick brigitte and american life time newsweek with some newspapers lying on the chair nearby one of them arabic the farsilanguage jomhuri islami with a picture of the president of iran on the front page which i thought was interesting there were no flowers in the room and no bowls of potpourri anywhere that i could see but there was a faint perfume on the air as if a woman had been here recently or came often i assumed theyd brought me to the headquarters of nemesis it would please london give them something for the board pick up the bit of chalk then executive has maintained cover infiltrated opposition headquarters three cheers for the poor bloody ferret in the field thatd teach them to give me a clown like thrower for my dif but were getting petty arent we a touch spiteful thats the way it goes though in this trade theyve got so much raw naked power over us those bastards in london because the only way anyone can turn himself into a professional spook and work for an outfit as sacrosanct as the bureau is to sell them his soul and submit to a degree of discipline that would put a regimental sergeant major straight into shock were expected to so klaus i hadnt heard the door open perhaps he hadnt meant me to we must shake hands mustnt we herr mittag now that i know who you are sit down please sit down he wasnt wearing the smoked glasses now his eyes were very dark would look black in some lights i thought he might be using coloured contact lenses because his hair was so blond in contrast he sat on the edge of the settee leaving me one of the silkbrocade chairs he sat facing me directly leaning forward with his hands on his knees we must have dinner later and youll stay the night of course hans mittag im surprised i havent heard your name before if youre important enough to deal in the kind of armament inge mentioned we can speak freely here of course not really i said i use several names that explains it of course i expected it to be the case yes now tell me about the miniver nk are you in the market for it i didnt lean forward to face him it was a wing chair and comfortable and i felt like taking it easy after that garage thing i am in the market for it yes klaus said otherwise i wouldnt have had you brought here but i need details his face was open attentive but the bright obsidian eyes had an intensity that reminded me that although id come out of that garage with a whole skin my cover was still my only protection for as long as i stayed here at the centre of nemesis i was a fly on a web and one wrong word could send it trembling ill give you the most important detail first i told him my price for one fullyprimed miniver nk complete with electronic detonator is one million us dollars cash he lifted his square heavylooking hands from his knees and dropped them again i think it was a gesture of impatience you must know he said that the details im asking for concern the missile and its capability well discuss the price later surely i dont need to tell you herr klaus what a missile with a nuclear warhead will do ive already given stoph and your man geissler an adequate idea you could reduce the eissporthalle for instance where you were sitting tonight to radioactive ash if you wanted to and turn the entire district of charlottenburg into a wasteground for a century to come if not the whole of berlin the funds must be placed to a swiss account by the way within twentyfour hours of your decision to buy the miniver if thats the decision youre going to make he said nothing went on staring at me that was all right i wasnt in any hurry it was quiet in the room there were logs burning in the hearth but the flames were soundless at least to my ears i hoped the effects of the piezo siren werent going to last too long i needed the full use of my senses klaus said in a moment i should tell you that i dont actually require the complete missile i require only the warhead the price is the same his hands lifted again dropped i assume the warhead can be used by itself it would become in effect a bomb oh yes it could be detonated electronically in just the same way or by a conventional explosive charge or by remote control yes wed be talking about amegaton nuclear bomb and a first a real first for nemesis in the annals of international terrorism a nuclear lockerbie he had a sense of the dramatic dieter klaus you didnt need a miniver warhead to bring down a with two hundred and fifty people in it you could do it with a teddy bear but it would attract a lot more attention to have the rescue crews and investigators go into the scene wearing protective masks and clothing and armed with geiger counters you mean klaus said onetenth of a megaton yes that is a lot of power yes i waited for him to put the next question he hadnt moved since wed started talking just his hands he was still sitting forward right on the edge of the settee giving me all his attention the only difference i could sense as we watched each other now was an added vibration in him i could feel its waves hed begun to want the miniver with great intensity to lust after it but he still didnt put the question how could it be taken aboard a commercial jet and when could you deliver the warhead he asked me instead when do you want it delivered as soon as possible in a moment i said and with the greatest care you know of course that this kind of bomb has got its drawbacks you couldnt for instance get it through an inspection area it was as far as i could go its not like a bit of semtex it was as far as i could go because inge had told willi that these people were planning a lockerbie thing and inge knew that willi had talked to me id be lighting a shortburn fuse if i mentioned an airport thats no problem klaus said i didnt show any surprise the miniver warhead wasnt all that big itd go into a suitcase but you wouldnt get it through an xray unit it worried me a little klaus was deviating from the script and i didnt know why i asked him will you need a conventional explosive charge to provide detonation no hed got one already teddy bear you can deposit the funds in geneva within twentyfour hours yes he said and got up suddenly and walked about marched almost energised by his newfound lust for that bloody thing half down half on delivery here in berlin no in algiers oh really i havent any plans i told him to go to algiers so i wont be there at the delivery point he stopped his restless pacing and turned and faced me if we are to complete this deal herr mittag id prefer you to remain within my organisation as a respected guest until delivery is made then if there are any problems youll be there to take care of them and receive the final payment he was standing very still watching me i dont insist on it but i would prefer it what do you say i got out of the chair and turned away from him took a step or two turned back because itd seem natural for me to want a little time to give it a little thought but i didnt need any time and i didnt need to think it was a trap because he was giving me a choice and he didnt have to there was no good reason why i shouldnt stay with his organisation through the performance of the deal its often done in cases like this when the final payment is to be made at the delivery point i could refuse but if i refused hed know i was frightened of something or that i wasnt on the level and itd be tantamount to blowing my own cover and hed forget the miniver and tell geissler to put a bullet into the back of the head and take me across to the east side and leave me there for the garbage collectors to pick up but if i agreed to stay with his organisation until the warhead was delivered itd be the same thing as going to ground id be cutting myself off from my director in the field and from london and cone would assume id bought it and theyd put me down on the signals board as missing missing or deceased and it might not turn out to be a lot different from the truth because the strain of keeping to my cover in an organisation like this one even for another twentyfour hours would be critical get a word wrong or forget something id said and finis finite he was waiting for my answer klaus but i hadnt any choice if thats what youd prefer i said ill stay of course see the deal through volvo klaus went across to the door and pulled it open schwartz there were guards then within call it would be difficult difficult in the extreme for me to leave this house during the night if i wanted to at the moment i didnt want to klaus came back into the room energy almost shaking him he looked caged but it wasnt that i think id moved in on nemesis at a time when their operation was ready to run and had given it a sudden unexpected boost the promise of nuclear augmentation and klaus was getting impatient now wanted to press the button see it all happen certain things about him seemed familiar to me rang bells the man in the doorway fetched up short as if hed run here herr klaus schwartz i want a secure telephone line how long will it take you ten minutes when youve got it call me with the number then bring the car here the mans heels came together and he ducked his crewcut head as he swung the door shut will you drink klaus asked me dont let me stop you he went to the bureau and poured some schnaps tilting the glass towards me your health thank you i ought to tell you klaus that if youre going to drop the warhead from a plane you cant do it from less than five thousand feet without catching the flak no problem as long as you know i hadnt got any idea what the actual safety distance was i was trying to find out if he meant to drop the nuke on something from the air instead of bringing a plane down with it i imagine you also know that its not something you can put aboard a commercial aircraft in the normal way its bigger than a bit of semtex what gives you the idea that id want to do such a thing i shrugged ltd be trendy he gave a short laugh i dont follow trends herr mittag i got out of the wing chair and wandered about took a look at the bar in terms of weight i said were talking about fortytwo kilos i found some schweppes and poured some cheers you told me you wouldnt drink it was discourteous of me not to join you its fairly rugged but the detonators rather fragile have to watch bumps if youre going to take it overland across rough terrain no problem and not much headway it looked as if the plans hed already got on the board would accommodate a miniver warhead without any changes i suppose that was partly why hed begun lusting after it the project wouldnt be held up i gave him a few more statistics and he wanted to know about critical temperatures contamination zones halflife figures it was all in the faxed specifications id got from london he hadnt asked me to get on the phone yet because he wanted a secure line he was efficient klaus had been welltrained and the way he was talking the way hed handled me so far had that familiar ring to it id been handled like this before and it had been inside lubyanka the telephone rang and he went over to it hed worn a uniform once had wielded authority like the kgb colonel whod put me under intensive interrogation in moscow klaus had the same stamp i put him down now as a reasonably highranking exofficer of stasi the former east german secret police five or six hundred of them had gone to ground after unification and counterespionage were still looking for most of them yes he said at the telephone give it to me some of them the rabid communists had joined terrorist groups mostly in europe this one had joined the rote armee faktion and then broken away and set up on his own now bring the car here he said and rang off and i took in a slow breath because as soon as the stolen car reached here i would have to use the phone in it and it was going to be an appallingly sensitive call and the whole of the mission would pivot on the outcome and could easily crash so klaus said when can you deliver i took a slow swig of the schweppes you said you want it as soon as possible yes ill have to see what we can do a wash of headlights came sweeping across the curtains while we were still talking and klaus nodded well go down i saw three guards on the way one on the second floor and two below they watched us but didnt come close our coats were in the hall and we got into them and i told klaus my partners an englishman and he doesnt speak german none too well in good english klaus said that is perfectly all right it was cold outside and there were bright stars pricking the glow of the citys lights all i could see around us were trees some of them with the last of the autumn leaves still clinging trees and high walls and street lamps in the distance but a plane was settling on its approach path lined up with sirius and it confirmed what id thought before the house was somewhere northwest of tegel airport in or near kreis oranienburg the car was a volvo and schwartz had the door open for klaus and he got in and i followed there was a pale blue headscarf on the seat and i put it into the glove compartment the theft of the car was routine security procedure and i would have expected a probable former stasi colonel to practise it up to a point he trusted me but this house was his headquarters and any calls from it could be traced anyone trying to trace the call i was going to make wouldnt get any farther than a stolen volvo whereabouts unknown you dont object klaus said suddenly to my listening in of course not the man schwartz hadnt gone back to the house i could see part of him in the offside mirror silhouetted against the street lamps there would be other guards in the grounds it was fifty yards sixty from the volvo to the black iron gates id seen when wed come out of the house and they would possibly be locked certainly watched dieter klaus was young thirty or thereabouts younger than krenz the man who had died in the mercedes and he was athletic klaus walked with a spring turned quickly but that particular strike made with the requisite speed is close to instantaneous in its effect however young the target however athletic you have the number klaus asked me yes he switched the ignition key to arm the ancillaries and the telephone beeped and lit up and its true of course that we are obliged we the ferrets in the field are obliged to take life solely in the defence of our own and not shall we say in order to expedite the mission by removing the kingpin of the opposition in order to save other lives by so doing perhaps hundreds of other lives we are required by the strictest conceivable edicts of those who rule us never to play god but temptation sometimes comes our way and i sensed him beside me klaus the kingpin of the opposition the dark mind of nemesis could hear his breathing could smell with a certain distaste the rather cheap cologne he used would feel if i moved my hand an inch or so the pulse in his wrist could destroy if i moved my hand with the requisite speed the source of its pulsation life but then there were the guards and the gates and those pontifical bloody priests of the temple in far londinium and we mustnt play god must we but there are times my good friend when we stay our hand we the dirty little ferrets in the field only because we know we havent got a hope in hell of getting away with it klaus was waiting dial the number he watched me doing it and could memorise the number if he wanted to but it would have looked suspect if id shielded the grid with my hand the semblance of trust must be maintained was vital i held the receiver to my left ear the side where klaus was sitting i couldnt tell how much sound he could pick up from the earpiece how accurately he could make out words it wouldnt have to be important we would have to pick our way through this conversation the englishman and i as through a minefield hotel sachsen herr foster i said der englander we waited sound came into the sky and the strobes of a jet flashed across the drivingmirror through the rear window bitte i switched to english gave it an accent is that you charlie cone didnt hesitate yes whos that hans hows mary shes fine there are certain classic words and phrases in the bureaus prescribed speechcode that light up the board when they come in to signals and id just used two of them is that you charlie indicates that the caller is either being overheard or is an actual captive hows mary is a warning that the caller wants the conversation to be played according to the leads hell give or attempt to give i didnt need to throw in a signal for cone to move out of his hotel as soon as he put the phone down the charlie bit had told him there could have been someone watching the number id dialled hed get out straight away and my lifeline to london would be cut until he called me back the client i said is willing to deposit half the funds tomorrow into the swiss account and im to receive the other half on delivery which is to be in algiers is that all right with you charlie if youre willing to go there oh yes sign of good faith the thing is when can we deliver cone tried his first question how soon do we have to do it as soon as we can ill check with samala do that tell him were only contracted for the nuclear warhead not the whole nk missile same price warhead only yes hed be hunched over the telephone cone his back to the blizzard he lived in had probably lived in since childhood when hed been abandoned or orphaned or in one of a hundred ways cast out hunched over the telephone now in a small berlin hotel wondering what london would do with this wondering as i was what london would do they could wreck solitaire if they didnt get this thing absolutely right the figures on the dashboard clock flicked to it would be a few minutes before we rang off and cone hit the mast at cheltenham and his voice came over the speaker at the signals board and carey or matthews picked up the bit of chalk executive dip berlin time reporting either as captive or surveilled believed to have reached nemesis centre requests delivery of miniver nk warhead see printout of difs briefing croder would move in on a signal like this one or if he wasnt in the room then theyd page him and get him there find him wherever he was croder had the soul of a piranha but he could think well and thered be a chance of keeping the mission alive until i could work as a free agent again and signal cone and brief him thered be a chance but it was thin terribly thin because london might go for the obvious and decide to call in gsg in frankfurt and the counterespionage service in algiers and stake out the delivery point and risk exposure and blow the whole thing it could take a little time cone said i used the chance youll have to cut corners charlie im talking about wait a minute our clients here with me i turned to klaus and i didnt put my hand over the mouthpiece he says it can take a little time so give me your deadline he checked his watch hours tomorrow thats tight you offered me the missile his eyes were black now in the glow from the dashboard lights if you can deliver it in that time the deal is on not otherwise twentyone hours it suited me because every minute i spent at the centre of nemesis would be extending the risk of exposure but id told him the deadline was tight because god knew how long it would take to persuade army ordnance to part with even an unarmed miniver warhead casing i was having to play the breaks as they came and make what choices id got the longer i stayed with nemesis the greater the risk yes but i was prepared to face that if the alternative was not to have delivery of the warhead made at all i had to get it for klaus if i could i had to get closer to the deadline hed been working on before id moved in i had to know what he was planning to do before i could stop him charlie i said the whole deal depends on the time of delivery and thats our deadline twentyone fifteen hours in algiers in algiers so youll have to cut corners as i said do we want to lose a deal like this no if you put it that way cones german was fluent and hed heard klaus making the deadline but he couldnt tell whether i needed delivery as fast as that for my own sake or whether i was forced to let klaus pressure me like this because he could be sitting beside me holding a gun at my head in the cold night air i was beginning to sweat because all i wanted was the chance of sixty seconds on the phone with cone in private thirty seconds tell control hes got to make the deadline with a dummy nuke and tell him that if he alerts gsg or the algerian counterterrorist service hell risk exposing me and blowing the mission tell him that nd for gods sake make him understand it was all i wanted thirty seconds fifteen enough time to protect the delivery scene and make it worth my while to stay inside nemesis and talk to these people and get it right watching every word every gesture every reaction every expression so that they wouldnt sense a trembling on the web how long i asked cone will it take you to make the delivery i cant say it youve got twentyone hours charlie i can only do my best then its got to be good enough you want to work with me again youll have to meet the deadline its very short notice charlie are you listening to me get that item delivered on time or its the last deal we do together are you listening there was no speechcode involved but i was giving him private information id started to threaten him and hed picked up on it and started raising doubts to see what id do and id pressured him and given him an ultimatum and the message was clear enough now i wanted him to make the delivery for my own reasons because if klaus had had a gun at my head i would have started raising doubts of my own pointing out the difficulties to him and pleading for more time it had been all i could do to spell things out ill get moving on it then cone said where is the point of delivery i looked at klaus where do we deliver at darelbeida the airport for algiers who will receive the goods five men will be waiting in a black mercedes sel at the northeast corner of no maintenance hangar at the airport at exactly hours tomorrow he checked his watch again im giving your partner an extra two minutes which should please him could make all the difference i said he gave a short laugh we shall get on well together i like your sense of humour we need a name i told him when your people approach at that time one of i the men in the car will get out and meet them his name is muhammad ibrahimi the parole for exchange will be would you like to suggest something the parole for exchange that was the vernacular of the intelligence field hed been in stasi intelligence then perhaps under the control of the kgb in former east germany mushroom i said i like that the short laugh mushroom yes the freight will be put into the boot of the car and the cash will be handed over immediately afterwards what currency you asked for us dollars yes then you shall have us dollars there wasnt anything else so i talked to cone again and went over the whole thing twice and he said hed got it its just a simple exchange charlie i told him nothing we havent done a hundred times before give it all ive got call you back at the same number i checked with klaus and he nodded yesi told cone anything else no i said theres nothing else and he rang off and i put the telephone back and klaus snapped the drivingdoor open so we will go back into the house schwartz the mans feet grated over the gravel sit in the car here and when the telephone rings call me on my pager headlights flooded the driveway as we left the volvo and the gates began swinging open who is that klaus called out his name is khatami mein fuhrer he gave the password a black porsche came into the drive and cut its lights and the gates were swung back as a man got out and came across to the house klaus didnt break his stride but shook the mans hand and told him to go on ahead ill be there in a moment bijan the others are waiting he led me into the panelled hallway and touched my arm everything looks very fine my friend im sure your associate realises that delivery has to be made on time i could have given you a more comfortable deadline if it werent for the fact that my operation is running to a precise schedule and i cant afford delays his black eyes watched me steadily the next twentyfour hours you see constitute a countdown a man was stationed near the wide carpeted staircase and klaus called him over fogel show herr mittag to his room he turned away and said over his shoulder youll find everything there toilet necessities a choice of pyjamas a small bar turning round for a moment inge will entertain you if you wish just mention it to fogel here we shall meet again to receive the call from your associate i am very pleased you know that you have offered me this particular item at such a convenient time i am delighted his footsteps faded out along the corridor fogel showed me to a bedroom suite on the floor above and left me there and i began thinking about the man whod just arrived in the porsche khatami he hadnt been in uniform this time but id recognised him he was the iranian pilot id seen talking to inge stoph at the airport cafeteria cone telephoned just after three in the morning and we went down to the volvo we can meet the deadline he was in a public phone box hed got out of his hotel and into another one but he couldnt phone me from there and he couldnt give me his new number because he knew i wouldnt be alone he also knew that i couldnt call him back wouldnt know where he was couldnt hope to reach him again good for you charlie i said and put the phone down and watched the severed lifeline go snaking away in the dark sirocco the sun was a pale disc in the haze still low above the horizon its light glinted on metal and glass surfaces on the mascot of the mercedes limousine as it swung in a halfcircle by the vfwfokker and halted klaus got out first and we followed there were two other cars already here with people standing near them in a group waiting for dieter klaus watching him his bodyguards four women and two men closed in around him as he walked towards the plane with that implacable energy of his there was a small dog among the people who stood waiting the pilot came down the ramp and saluted klaus standing aside and waiting for him to board the company jet klaus spoke to him and got an answer i didnt hear any actual words but i suppose he was asking the pilot about the weather forecast the haze was thick towards the horizon i joined the group one of the male guards walking a little way behind me id been under what amounted to close escort since wed left the house and i didnt expect that to change geissler the man whod interrogated me in the garage had come with us in the limousine and went aboard the plane soon after klaus the rest of us were following now and the woman in the camelhair coat gave me a flashing smile and said in english hello im helen maitland and this is george my husband hans mittag delighted id caught sight of her earlier this morning getting into one of the cars at the house dieter told us about you maitland said most interesting then he hurried up the ramp a short man quick in his movements and with the same nervous tension in him that klaus had the focus of this operation shatner in london briefing is on a man named maitland or rather on his death a week ago he was murdered and his body taken away his flat was broken into with some violence and the police found evidence of massive blood loss there were marks on the floor indicating that his body had been dragged out of the flat to the lift the telephone was hanging by its cable hed been talking to a woman friend who came forward when the flat was entered she reported sounds of the door being smashed in an outbreak of voices and finally a cry helen kept close to me as we went up the ramp and i thought i heard her whisper im sorry maitland had sat down with klaus in one of the forward seats behind the flight deck the pilot had taken his place next to the navigator and a stewardess was greeting us as we came aboard her smile i thought was overbright as helens had been just now when shed greeted me no one was talking much they seemed to be taking their cue from dieter klaus from their fuhrer and this morning he was totally changed from last night in the limousine thered been none of his brief outbursts of laughter i took as long a look at maitland as i could when i went past his seat later i might need the ability to recognise some of the people here perhaps quickly and at a distance maitland willi hartman had told me in the nightclub had been interested in the red army faction he began asking me questions about them then later i realised he was how will we put it playing a kind of game with himself he had a master plan he told me once about how to assassinate moammar gadhafi a counterterrorist game then he fancied himself as an armchair counterterrorist i think yes george was a very unusual man very intense the twin jets began moaning he was neurotic willi had said with sudden force may i say that helen hadnt objected oh of course terribly so terribly neurotic yes he fascinated me the oliveskinned girl in the mink coat was the last to board shed been sitting next to klaus at the icehockey game and inge had said her name was dolores she was last to board i think because her little dog had been giving trouble scared by the noise of the jets and as she pulled it through the doorway by the leash i saw dieter klaus swing his head i told you i didnt want that thing on the plane and in the next second he was on his feet and the kick caught the dog in the flank and it went spinning through the doorway onto the tarmac with the leash whipping after it now shut that door the stewardess stood frozen for a moment with her mouth in an o as she stared out at the dog then she reached for the security lever and pulled the door shut and made it fast and came quickly along the aisle looking at no one her face white the dog wasnt yelping out there from my window i could see that its neck was broken would you please fasten your seatbelts ladies and gentlemen we are about to roll thank you no one was looking at anyone else helen sat with her head lowered picking at her nails the lacquer was already chipped it couldnt i thought have been an easy decision to join george maitland again when she found out he was still alive we listened to the exchange between the flight deck and the tower through the doorway as the wheels began rolling then the stewardess came back and slid the door shut and sat down on the single rearwardfacing seat with her head turned to the window her eyes glistening on the other side of the aisle i could see khatami the iranian pilot in a black bomber jacket and flying boots he was sitting alone his was the only face id seen when wed come aboard that hadnt looked tight nervous on the contrary hed looked in a strange way exalted we got the green from the tower and the full thrust of the twin jets came on and the runway lights began flicking past the windows blood from a butchers shop i suppose or theyd cut a dogs throat to give the scene realism but why had they gone to so much trouble couldnt he have just disappeared picking at her nails terribly neurotic yes he fascinated me that alone could have been why shed gone back to him had stayed with him even though shed seen what it would have to mean being absorbed into nemesis living among people like these perhaps she was easily fascinated by people like george maitland with his neurotic intensity by the girls in the nightclub by anything or anyone illicit by whatever dared to take its fill of the forbidden it would be consistent with her character as far as i knew it with her schoolgirl naivete when wed reached our ceiling and the power levelled off i asked her quietly was it kurt muller she turned her pale face to me what did you say was it kurt muller who told klaus you were in berlin hed been the man whod recognised her in the nightclub the one id asked her about in the taxi when wed left there she hadnt hesitated or not for long oh he was just someone i knew a friend of georges at the embassy im not sure she said it could have been i didnt ask muller must have been one of the few people whod known that george maitland was still alive and hed phoned him that night told him that hed seen his wife that she was here in berlin he didnt have to do that she said who dieter didnt have to kill the dog i said youre running with the wrong set how many hotels had klaus phoned before hed found her he would have started with the big ones so it wouldnt have taken him long it must have put her into shock a voice from the dead his voice but shed gone to him left her things behind just walked out of the hotel and down the street and found a taxi once she was out of sight he fascinated me well yes he must have and still did but there was something else shed said ive only just realised how much i hated him but then hate is as close to love as laughter is to tears five rows in front of us i could see maitland and klaus talking intently their heads close but i wasnt ready to believe that a neurotic embassy attache with a feverish sense of adventure had mounted a oneman counterespionage crusade against an organisation the size of nemesis and persuaded a former stasi colonel to put his trust in him i hadnt been able to do it myself not completely i knew that now arent you running helen said in a moment a terrible risk it depends on what you tell them she turned her head quickly to look at me i wont tell them anything of course then the risk im running isnt all that high not absolutely true klaus had got the whole thing worked out and i hadnt been able to stop him because id had to stick with my cover and go with him to algeria to darelbeida it was possible that he believed in me but it didnt make any difference one way or the other we believe in what we want the truth to be ignoring the evidence that would raise doubts deceiving ourselves and dieter klaus desperately wanted the truth to be that i was a bona fide arms dealer and could provide him with a miniver nk nuclear warhead but he was a seasoned stasi officer and hed covered himself if i made the rendezvous in algiers and the nk was delivered hed be as happy as a kid at a christmas tree i am very pleased you know that you have offered me this particular item at such a convenient time i am delighted but if there was no delivery he wouldnt be taking any risk hed still go ahead with his operation and he wouldnt let me walk away with all the information i had on him now he would simply have me silenced were serving breakfast soon the stewardess said would you like to choose something from the menu leaning over us the smile fixed fright behind it she wasnt with nemesis she was just flight crew that went with the fokker marlene the little brass tab on her uniform said new to the job hadnt any idea what her employer would be like there are eggs benedict if you care for them that way her heart still down there on the tarmac nursing a dog with a broken neck and well be serving champagne in just a few minutes she took our order and moved on but the warhead would be there and there on time i wasnt worried about that london would see to it he was quite adamant we have to meet the deadline cone to control he would have got into signals the moment wed rung off last night you feel that if we dont make this delivery its going to jeopardise the mission and the executive cone would have said that he had a sense of the humanities could be counted on to let them know theyd have a dead ferret on their doorstep if they didnt get it right very well then we shall do what is necessary there would have been a lot of phones ringing in the dead of last night at the bedside of the head of the armys quartermaster office and ordnance stores if necessary of the minister of defence if necessary of the prime minister to whom the bureau was directly responsible red tape would have been slashed through security units alerted at the ordnance hangars passes shown and metal doors rolled back the instructions presented and transport called in the crew of a civilian freightplane on her majestys service ordered to report for special duty their destination sealed in an envelope to be opened in flight so klaus would get his toy and i would be paid off if he kept to the deal unless london made the decision to stake out the scene and that was why i was sitting here with the feeling that time was running out for solitaire and that it was only a matter of hours because i knew london and i knew their way of thinking and their way of thinking was that if they could send in the sas and germanys gsg and algerias counterterrorist units they could do a better job of destroying dieter klaus and his whole organisation than one lonely ferret in the field and unless i could reach a telephone in time and persuade them to change their thinking then that was what theyd do finis finito looking down over the snows of the swiss alps i told helen feel responsible for you did that occur in surprise no why should you we brought you into berlin to help us it doesnt matter picking at her nails i could have gone home yesterday morning if id wanted to he just rang me up and asked me if i wanted to go to him i said i would she turned her head to look at me i cant help it you see with a note of bitterness you wouldnt think would you that there could be so much passion under such a placid exterior i offered the obvious cliche still waters yes very still and very deep sometimes i frighten myself but anyway you dont have to feel responsible for me any more im a free agent are you her smile was quick nervous all right im free to trap myself in this in this thing thats going on do you know what it is she didnt look away no i dont do you believe me of course they havent told me anything she said and i havent asked none of these people here know what dieters planning to do except for george a moment of hesitation then i think he sort of switched sides george yes i havent talked to him very much since i went back to him because dieters had meetings all the time and george has been kept busy but obviously i had to ask him what all that drama was about the murder scene at his flat and he said dieter had i must get it right had required it of him he wouldnt say any more perhaps it had been a blooding then a ritual act of faith of commitment george had become excited by nemesis and had wanted to go over switch sides from counterterrorism to terrorism and klaus had demanded that he go through a symbolic act of selfimmolation as his entree into the organisation it could have appealed to maitlands neurotic fancies he could even have revelled in the idea of such grand deception but he must also have brought something to nemesis something of value as i had he was already close to dieter klaus on equal terms i asked helen why did klaus accept him do you think i dont know he might have made some kind of proposal he was always playing around with outlandish schemes in his mind like assassinating gadhafi for instance possible scenario then klaus had been planning a terrorist operation and maitland had gone to him and said look do it this way its better or bigger so klaus had taken him up on it and there wasnt going to be another lockerbie there was going to be something bigger than that even more devastating the purpose after all of any terrorist act was to attract attention the snows drew out beneath us twenty thousand feet below i thought i could make out the matterhorn these meetings i said you werent invited to any oh no im just here to be with george but i heard him talking to someone on the phone about mittenaeht ein and mittenacht zwei and i heard dieter using the same phrases my germans not good at all but they stuck in my mind they were repeated so often they were obviously code names and possibly for deadlines and if one of them were for midnight tonight itd be only five hours after delivery of the miniver and theyd be running it very close she must have heard other things a word here and there things shed halfforgotten because they hadnt sounded important though i might see them as vital i could coax her memory as id done with willi hartman and conceivably bring out information i could use but it would be too dangerous for her if anything shed given me became the basis of my future actions and klaus suspected the source look i said i want you to forget everything youve told me forget youve seen what dieter klaus can do to a dog he can do that to a man or a woman to anyone whoever they are she was watching me with fright in her eyes and that was good she was paying attention if dieter klaus thought for one second that you were in his way dont imagine that george could save you he couldnt she looked down and said in a moment you must think im terribly naive letting myself get mixed up in all this i think youre playing with fire and you dont know how easy it is to get burned with a man like that turning to me she said id like to stop everything of course i mean theyre planning to do something quite terrible and i know that but what can i do should i walk down the next street and go up to a policeman and say my husband and his friends are going to kill a lot of people think of all the questions theyd ask me the statements id have to make before anyone could even lift a finger if they believed a word of it from a mere woman she felt strongly about this or suppose dont raise your voice i said leaning close to me suppose i phoned my mp or scotland yard or someone like that i dont know about these things and told them the same story theyd get on to my department i said and id be sent out here to do something and here i am so dont worry about it of course theres nothing you can do but be very careful dont show the slightest interest in what theyre doing not the slightest and in a minute or two im going to find a newspaper and sit across there with it if george asks you about me tell him ive been boring you to death with my stories of armament deals and you werent really listening she was watching me steadily fretting with her nails and if we run into each other again well simply follow the social graces mention the weather that sort of thing i got out of my seat and leaned over her for a moment what you have to do above all is to look after yourself the stewardess got me a copy of this mornings die welt and i sat down with it in a seat across the aisle and towards the rear so that i could watch people klaus was using the telephone again it was his third call since wed taken off from berlin maitland went into the forward toilet and came out again and spoke to the stewardess for a few minutes then looked along the cabin and saw helen sitting alone and came aft to join her and i caught the leap of excitement in her eyes id got a better look at him this time as hed walked along the aisle he was a short man as helen had told me lie hates being short but he was attractive in a chiselled sharpfeatured way with high cheekbones and imaginative eyes and a strong mouth and i suppose that for a woman hed pack a good deal of libido which might explain his svengalilike power over his wife the houndstoothcheck suit was perfectly cut and he showed plenty of linen he looked successful experienced one arm was round helens shoulders as he talked to her his head close to hers a sudden smile coming a look of reassurance this was my impression dieters not really a bad type perhaps its just that hes got a hell of a lot on his mind at the moment and its fraying his patience the same kind of thing hed been saying to the stewardess possibly a few minutes ago inge stoph was sitting two rows behind klaus and after a while she got up and looked through a window on the other side asking the stewardess something then she came along the cabin and talked to dolores three rows in front of me then moved on towards the rear and stopped to lean over me tautbodied in a white sweater and slacks her warm scent lacing the air her iceblue eyes reflecting the oval window and her brief smile brilliant theres a bunk in the rear she said if you want to rest a little it has curtains would you like me to go with you at any other time i said of course whenever you feel in the mood its part of dieters hospitality he has great style i said how long shall we be in algiers at the palace yes her eyes darkened i dont know certainly overnight because tomorrow we shall be celebrating has dieter told you anything about it no i wouldnt expect him to youll know she said tomorrow everyone will know she turned on her brilliant smile and went back along the cabin stopping to talk to khatami the iranian pilot but not for very long he seemed lost in his own world i thought it should be telling me something his trancelike preoccupation perhaps something very important but i couldnt get a fix on it we were over the mediterranean when marlene leaned over my seat pitching her light voice against the sound of the jets well be landing in less than an hour sir can i get you anything from the galley or the bar she watched me with her nerves still in her eyes as soon as she landed at her home base shed give in her resignation and apply for a different charter i told her i didnt need anything and she moved on down the aisle how was the champagne maitland this time excellent i hadnt tried it he stood watching me thoughtfully how much do you know herr mittag very little we were talking in german he was fluent but ive great faith in herr klaus im sure everything will go splendidly his eyes were flickering to the slightest degree but i didnt think it was nerves i thought he was holding back a great deal of excitement was only just managing to contain it it will indeed he said go splendidly and your faith in dieter klaus is not misplaced but the idea you know was mine congratulations i could smell the champagne on his breath but i didnt think hed overdone it i thought it would have had as much effect as perrier he was running on his own natural high youll understand what im talking about he said tomorrow were going to make the headlines you know theyll be interrupting television programmes all over the world im impressed and youve made quite a contribution yourself herr mittag the icing on the cake we appreciate that klaus did mention he was delighted in fact ive got a question for you am i to be offered shall we say a grandstand seat when the balloon goes up his mouth tightened well no actually theres only one man here whos going to have a grandstand seat he straightened up just came to chat thats all make sure youre all right civil of you one more question are we going straight to the palace from darelbeida the airport all of us except for you and geissler youll be stopping off at the banque dalgerie where hell make the necessary transfer of funds to switzerland touching my shoulder all is arranged have no fear i had none very good the price was fair i rather think you didnt ask too much and we didnt try to bargain the true value is in fact incalculable this is to be a major show i very much hope nothing happens to stop your bringing it off his eyes went cold and he waited a moment before he said quietly nothing will happen herr mittag no this operation has been planned with an attention to detail that will guarantee our complete success nothing will get in our way a ruff of white surf below us now a fringe of coastal palms and then white buildings as we turned for the approach a spread of white buildings and domes and minarets and beyond them the desert the sands of the sahara the undercarriage was down id felt the slight vibration a minute ago the noon sun flashed across the sea on the starboard side as we straightened lining up with the runway a degree or two of roll and then its correction as the flaps went down and we levelled off mittenacht ein mittenacht zwei why two midnights two deadlines if they were deadlines flareout and the nose came up a little the cabin tilting the first of the runway markers began flashing past the windows theres only one man here whos going to have a grandstand seat klaus why only klaus or someone else here on board this plane maitland himself khatami the pilot why only one man were going to make the headlines you know because they were going to use what they thought was a live nuclear warhead no and youve made quite a contribution yourself herr mittag the icing on the cake the miniver thing would be a dummy but theyd still have the cake and that alone was going to make the headlines for them somehow id have to reach a telephone signal london stop them sending in a whole army to the delivery point to the rendezvous because theyd never take dieter klaus that way he wouldnt be there he was a former stasi officer kgb trained and he knew that a rendezvous always carries a risk any rendezvous carries a risk of exposure can be a trap can turn out not to be a rendezvous after all but an ambush he knew that so he wouldnt be here tonight at maintenance hangar hed just send some people with me to make the exchange some people he could afford to lose if i werent just an arms dealer if i were there to blow nemesis and if the sas and gsg and the algerian counterterrorist units came out of the shadows and made the snatch then id be dead because those would be his orders the orders from klaus in the event of any surprise shoot mittag get him out of the way and the operation would proceed as planned exactly as planned and tomorrow there would be headlines because i wouldnt be there to prevent it first bump and the cabin flexed so i must somehow telephone london warn them off let me do it this is a job for one man on his own and right on the inside where klaus can be reached can be taken can if necessary be killed second bump and then the hot kiss of the tyres on the runway as we settled then a burst of sound as the jets were reversed and the brakes came on and we swung towards the terminal sand against our faces as we left the aircraft the sirocco was blowing someone said viper until the thing with the snake it had looked like a scene out of a travel brochure one of those poolside parties thered been a fountain here once i suppose in the middle of the shaded courtyard and then theyd put the pool in for tourists it was out of place it must have been charming before with the tall eucalyptuses brushing the sky above the white stucco walls and the olive trees framing the archways one of the smaller palaces that in europe would have been a country house klaus was in the pool i watched him sometimes from below the left lens of my sunglasses i was sitting in a deck chair not far from the edge of the pool at the deep end near the telephone it had rung three or four times since wed arrived here and klaus had always been the one to answer it if he werent near enough to hear the bell the girls were making a lot of noise in the water one of the guards would call him over hed answered in monosyllables every time but i had the impression that the calls were from different people that they were reporting in and he was coordinating things the sun was lowering through the afternoon hours still warm on the skin tangerines and black olives lay rotting under the trees and eucalyptus leaves floated on the surface of the pool inge and dolores were making all the noise diving from the board and giving little girlish screams as they splashed each other vying for attention from dieter klaus who wasnt interested helen stayed by herself turning on her back sometimes to float with the sun on her face and her eyes closed i watched her often trying to share the calm she brought to the scene my guard had been changed the new one was an arab not tall but slenderlooking in his kaftan there didnt look room for a gun but that was an illusion klauss bodyguards were dispersed around the courtyard still in their black tracksuits four women and two men they moved very little sometimes bouncing on the balls of their feet swinging their hands together never looking at one another looking only towards the archways and the big redwood gates that led to the palace grounds two of them had gone with us to the banque dalgerie on the way here from the airport where geissler had wired funds to intercomlondres in the amount of us i first noticed the snake soon after klaus took the third telephone call it was moving very slowly along the bottom of a wall halflost among the leaves and the fallen tangerines it wasnt very big i would have said it was a horned viper a native here are you asleep helen was watching me hanging onto the tiled rim of the pool her slim body rising and falling in the water i said i wasnt no isnt it nice here i said it was she was so different from the other two girls apart from her quietness inge sported her rich blonde bodyhair lifting her arms a lot and shaking the water from her head laughing into the sun as the models do in vogue and elle dolores was less active but swam with studied grace her long muscles moving under the dark skin her eyes sleepy as she looked across at dieter klaus but helen was just thin bobbing in the water with one shoulderstrap of her black costume hanging down and her slight breasts hardly noticeable it was her innocence even of this the loose shoulderstrap that glimmered with a sexuality the other girls could never hope to express and when she smiled it was heartbreaking or so i found what turns me on most in a woman is her unintended invitation to my tenderness i expect i look rather gawky she said in a bathing costume not really its something i shall always remember my father saying the sun was in her eyes and they were narrowed to slits of shimmering light as she watched me he was in the garden trying to bend a croquet hoop straight and i was going to tell them tea was ready in the summerhouse and i heard him say to my mother here comes that gawky girl of yours quite a lot of fathers are like that i said its a kind of birth defect you dont think i look gawky then i think you look rather like the goddess of willow trees though a bit younger perhaps a flush came to her pale face and this is what i mean she could still be moved by the clumsiest compliment and she looked down letting her long pale fingers slip from the tiles i think thats going rather far she said and swam away not meaning it hoping it might be just a little bit true beyond her i saw the snake move again servants brought us things during the long hours of the afternoon boys in kaftans and sandals bringing us trays of tangerines slices of ginger kab el ghzal mint tea whatever we fancied it was rather pleasant he was a man of style klaus regaling us with the fruits of the earth as the sun lowered towards the evening and the rendezvous and midnight one he couldnt do anything about the sand it was everywhere brought in by the light sirocco gritty under our feet and the deck chairs when we moved them and even between our i teeth forming a pink film across the copies of el moudjahid and the london times and the international herald tribune the telephone was getting on my nerves not because it rang sometimes but because it was there near the edge of the pool and almost within reach klaus had always answered it on the spot he hadnt taken it out of earshot or lowered his voice and i knew why it wasnt that he trusted me he knew i was safe because if i had any reason to report to anyone at any time on anything id overheard this afternoon id never be able to i looked like a guest here but i wasnt i was a captive if i could use that phone pick it up and call london and use speech code it could change the endphase of solitaire from certain disaster to the chance of survival even success tell charlie not to bring any friends this is strictly a private party in the signals vernacular of the bureau the word strictly has the same weight as fully urgent they both mean that everybody has got to listen including bureau one but it wasnt on because one of the bodyguards let out a shout in german when i picked the telephone up and klaus jerked his head round what are you doing everyone else froze watching me it looked like getting splashed i called across the pool to klaus id picked the whole thing up not just the receiver the receiver would have been next if no one had taken any notice the guard whod shouted had moved closer was watching klaus for any orders would you like klaus asked me to make a telephone call my friend he had a big chest a powerful voice he could put a silkiness into the tone even at this distance if i want to make a telephone call i ask you first isnt that the drill i am delighted you understand he turned away and went on talking to geissler inge stoph gave a quick laugh and stuck her tongue out at me i think she was peeved because i hadnt wanted to roll on the bunk with her on the plane she couldnt have been used to refusals it was quieter now in the courtyard the two girls concubines was the word inge had used at the eissporthalle had stopped splashing and playing for klauss attention the guards werent moving around any more or bouncing on their feet my own personal guard was closer to me now his red fez making a blob of colour against the white wall behind i could hear a donkey braying some way off and inge flashed me another look a silent laugh meaning perhaps that id been a donkey to try a trick like that with a man like dieter klaus the fuhrer the smell of woodsmoke was on the air as fires were lit for the evening it would be cool tonight in algiers a less attractive smell of chlorine came from the pool i watched klaus geissler and the guards simply to keep them surveilled as a routine the ferret doesnt often have the chance of surveilling the chief of the opposition in every movement he makes without attracting attention without attracting bullets for that matter on the board for solitaire the bit of chalk moves in the floodlight hrs local time executive maintaining close surveillance on opposition that ought to create a lot of interest in signals not to say a discreet degree of jubilation an occasion perhaps for another cup of tea providing the bit of chalk doesnt go on moving he is also their captive under guard and is liable to be shot dead tonight at the flashpoint in most missions theres a flashpoint its when the executive is to perform a distinctly hazardous operation to break into for instance the official intelligence headquarters of an unfriendly host country and try to get out again with something so classified that all the windows would blow out if anyone knew or to get a wanted subject away from a fullyarmed mantrap outside hong kong airport with the public and the police looking on or to make a lastditch break for the frontier ahead of a pack of wartrained doberman pinschers that sort of thing flashpoint is what it says and the one that was coming up for solitaire would be in two hours time at the airport at darelbeida when the man from london stopped his car and got out and came over to the black mercedes sel we were sitting in and the counterterrorist units closed in for the snatch with their floodlights and assault rifles and the shooting started and the executive for the mission went down first because those would be the orders from dieter klaus the prearranged orders the ones he would give before he left here this evening on his way to midnight one that was the flashpoint for solitaire unless i could reach a phone but they werent going to let me do that and i was starting to feel the familiar tingling at the nape of the neck as i sat here in my deck chair sipping hot mint tea because the organism was going to need the sugar sipping hot mint tea as the boys in their kaftans moved quietly around the pool in their sandals and the snake moved again and this time one of them saw it he was sixteen perhaps seventeen not one of the guards just one of the palace servants and he was young enough to enjoy playing a little prank now and then especially if there were foreign girls around to tease and he put down the tray and went over to the snake and grabbed it by the tail before it could coil and swung it around in the air and smashed its head against the wall and held it up for a moment and then threw it into the pool with a bright boyish laugh the girls screamed and klaus looked round and saw the dead snake on the surface of the water and got to his feet at once and went across to the arab boy and shouted at him in french bringing his big hand across and across his face until the boys hand vanished into his kaftan and the blade of a knife flashed in the sunlight and klaus parried it and tore the hilt free and slashed the boys throat and pushed him away as the blood came spurting the bodyguards had moved very fast when theyd seen the knife and were now forming a ring around klaus their guns out get ibrahimi one of them turned and ran into the building where were you then klaus asked the others was that as fast as you can move as fast as you can shoot an arab came through one of the archways with the bodyguard blackbearded his robes flowing and saw the boy sprawled across the tiles with his blood reaching the edge of the pool and trickling into the water its rosered colour spreading he attacked me klaus told the arab not shouting now but with the hoarseness of rage in his voice dolores had climbed out of the pool and was on all fours humpbacked retching inge was staring at klaus with her iceblue eyes shining as she absorbed the joy in the scene her fuhrer had killed as he would always kill any who dared oppose him helen had climbed out of the water and was lying on her back with her eyes closed her face ashen these people saw him attack me with his knife ibrahimi stared at klaus then at the boy again now get him out of here take him to his family tell them that if anyone breathes a word about this ill tell the police what happened and shame his memory he tried to murder me ibrahimi you understand me do you understand the guards stood waiting their guns at the hip they might have been hoping must have been hoping that ibrahimi would make some kind of move against klaus even a gesture of protest against the death of a fellow arab so that they could shoot him down and show this time how fast they could work they were out of luck yes he told klaus i understand he moved across to an archway clapping his hands and three or four boys appeared there listening to ibrahimi and then coming to the poolside lifting the limp body in the kaftan and bearing it away the mess klaus called the mess ibrahimi more servants came one of them an old man with gaps in his teeth his head shaking on its thin neck as he mopped at the blood with towels i think he was going to wash one of them out in the pool but caught a glance from klaus the surface was already clouded he stood watching them klaus in his goldtoned swimming trunks big hands on his hips until they went away with their towels and their buckets leaving the tiles clean and shining then klaus turned away and rose on his toes and made a flat racingdive into the shallow end of the pool where the blood of the boy still swirled i went over to helen and pulled a deck chair nearer the time was right now to tell her she might not have listened before how do you feel i asked her she didnt look up at me didnt open her eyes softly she said i must be mad i must be mad dolores her dark skin yellowed was telling a servant to wash the tiles near the divingboard where shed vomited no one else was moving except for klaus who climbed out of the pool and reached for a towel saying something to geissler that i didnt catch they were too far away wheres george i asked helen quietly he went into the casbah why needed to know what everyone was doing to take snapshots wheres the iranian the pilot he said he was going to the mosque to pray but to pray for what perhaps the blessing of allah on midnight one if i can i told helen im going to destroy nemesis you know that have you thought about how its going to leave you no i just want to go home now that surprised me youre willing to leave george thats what it would amount to wouldnt it yes shed been doing some thinking then i had to do some thinking myself as the sun lowered and sent shadows leaning across the courtyard from the eucalyptus trees i heard a car door slamming the forecourt of the little palace was on the other side of the wall george back from the casbah the pilot back from the mosque i might not have much time left i havent done anything wrong helen was saying with an innocence that would have touched me if she hadnt been in such appalling danger as gently as i could i told her you have been consorting with the most notorious group of leftwing terrorists in the world and this is what youve got to say if you get arrested when everything blows up youve got to say that when you went to berlin to join your husband you hadnt the slightest idea he was mixed up with dieter klaus and his operation and that by the time you found out there was nothing you could do about it youve been their captive and this is perfectly true they couldnt have risked your wandering off and giving them away intentionally or otherwise ibrahimi came through the archway at the far end of the courtyard he wasnt a tall man but his robes gave him height arid a certain grace and his black beard added a look of strength i needed to know all i could about him in the little time left before the flashpoint he would be going there with me to receive the miniver warhead helen i said im going to give you a couple of designations hows your memory she opened her eyes at last and sat up turning to look at me the shoulder strap still hanging down her eyes narrowed against the late sunlight my memorys very good she said that too surprised me and i felt a touch of admiration for her thats the first time i told her ive ever heard you say anything good about yourself do it again get into the habit itll work wonders for you now listen klaus and george will be leaving you behind when they complete this operation of theirs and back here the pressure will be off a little if you can get away from here safely take a taxi straight to the britishembassy and ask one of the staff there to pay the fare they get a lot of tourists running out of money and trying to get home so tell them this is prime ministerial business and ask them to put you on the line to the foreign office in london just keep on insisting when youre through to the foreign office ask for liaison if some new clerk says she doesnt know that department tell her to get her boss on the line and keep on telling them you want liaison but you shouldnt have any trouble liaison is known to all senior foreign office officials it was the bureau at the far end of the pool ibrahimi had begun talking earnestly to klaus he hadnt bowed when hed gone up to him from the archway but it had been close the german had total power over the members of his cell whoever they were hed even killed an arab and then told an arab to get the mess cleaned up the mess ibrahimi the mess when they put you through to liaison ask for desk youll be given access right away desk was holmes the man at desk will recognise your name ask him to get you on a plane for london priority now give me those designations liaison then desk i got out of the chair and looked down at her go into the palace as soon as you can and write them down keep them hidden away however good our memory is we can forget the most vital things in a crisis she watched me with that stillness of hers her eyes attentive and i would have liked to stay talking to her would like to think that one day one fine day beyond the dark and ominous horizons of midnight one i might pick up a telephone and dial the number in reigate and ask her if shed like me to go round there for a cup of tea that would be nice dont take any risks i said in a moment wait for the right chance and after all this is over for you tell yourself again that you have a very good memory just as you told me and tell yourself all the other things your fathers chosen to ignore that despite his attempted sabotage youve managed to grow into a beautiful woman poised and gracious and quite stunningly attractive its time to understand that now i turned away and left her going across to a chair nearer the deep end of the pool taking my time talking to one of the servants whod come back to stand near the walls asking him where i could buy the best souvenirs among the souks i was close enough to the group now klaus geissler and ibrabimi to hear snatches of french it was the second language here and ibrahimi was fluent the two germans were less at home with it id told klaus we needed a name for when the delivery of the miniver was made and hed given me one when your people approach at that time one of the men in the car will get out and meet them his name is muhammad ibrahimi he would be there with me at the flashpoint and what would happen the way things would go would depend critically on what kind of man he was and what i could do with him if i could do anything with him at all sand gritted softly under sandals and two more arabs came into the courtyard in plain white kaftans klaus went across to them straight away and they greeted one another in the moslem fashion which i hadnt seen the german do before so far he hadnt shown too much respect for arabs then i recognised one of them he was khatami the iranian pilot i hadnt seen him in native dress before perhaps theyd arrived in the car id heard just now he said he was going to the mosque helen had told me klaus spoke to them for a few moments in his halting french i caught only a word or two but it sounded like an exchange of courtesies or it could have been more than that he was asking them how they felt rather than how they were comment vous sentezvous and not the formal comment allezvous i thought this was interesting because nothing had happened to them as far as i could see but klaus wasnt necessarily asking them how they felt now after something had happened but how they were feeling at this time when something was going to happen as when we ask an athlete how hes feeling before a race i played with it in my mind because i thought it was important and might offer a clue but i was desperate now for clues as we neared the flashpoint and it could have been simply that i was reading too much into things klaus left them touching their arms in a gesture almost of affection and clapped his hands for servants two of them brought bowls and small muslin towels and as the pilot and his friend copilot sat at their ease below the leaves of an olive tree the boys knelt in front of them bathing their feet with an air of ceremony other servants brought fruit and a bottle of vichy water and pewter cups none of the europeans here took any notice but the arabs muhammad ibrahimi and the servants seemed interested glancing across now and then the pilot khatami had the same look of quiet exaltation id noticed on the plane and so did his friend i made another routine check around the environment in case there was anything to be picked up klaus wasnt talking to ibrahimi any more i assumed the arab had come to report on what hed been doing to keep the dead boys family quiet they would have been told to say his body had been found somewhere else victim of an unknown assassin something like that klaus would get away with it if the truth came out he had a perfect case for a plea of selfdefence in front of witnesses but he was a busy man today hed killed only a dog and an arab boy but there were more deaths than that on his agenda perhaps hundreds on the stroke of midnight one he was sitting alone now leaning forward with his big hands interlaced his eyes on the surface of the pool where the scimitar leaves of the eucalyptus floated his mind absent his fingers sliding together sliding away his whole body arched flexed like a bow he was in a form of meditation deep in the theta waves close to trance inge stoph watched him her bright eyes idolatrous geissler was talking in low tones to ibrahimi the guards werent moving werent bouncing cockily on the balls of their feet any more theyd been tested and found wanting and i suppose would be fired and replaced fired or left somewhere humped on the ground with an arm thrown out in mute testimony to their fuhrers displeasure id seen today that in this small sovereignty of terror dieter klaus considered himself and was considered to be omnipotent with the status of a god and the rights of a god over life and death it was the only way he could run this show the only way he could live dolores had gone into the building after the scene with the arab boy and hadnt come out helen was lying down again flat on her back a sheen on her white face i think shed have liked to go into the palace too or anywhere away from dieter klaus but was afraid that if she stood up and tried walking she might feel dizzy and be sick george maitland wasnt back yet from taking his photographs in the native quarter i expected him soon now hed be here with klaus as the time brought them close to midnight one from what helen had told me he was one of its architects one of the servants wasnt far away and i beckoned him over he was an older man with stubble on his dark thin face his eyes had a light in them a glint of inner fires he didnt look at me as he waited for me to speak i think if hed looked at me id have felt the heat of his ferocity i was a foreigner an infidel and it was a foreigner an infidel who had killed the arab boy i asked him in french why are they bathing the feet of those men over there he didnt turn his head it is holy water i see what does it signify he was looking down his dark head turned slightly away from me as if to hear me better but it wasnt that if hed looked at me he wouldnt have been able to resist the urge to spit in my face it signifies he said that they will die when before they sleep again suicide run ibrahimi it was almost six oclock and the air was turning cool the sirocco had died away from the south from the sahara the leaves of the tall eucalyptus trees were still beyond them in the west the sun was low the sky the colour of blood maitland had come into the courtyard a few minutes ago and spoken to dieter klaus then hed seen helen by the pool and had gone over to her they were talking now he was in a dark jumpsuit and carried a padded jacket he was talking seriously no smiles i could hear the pilots speaking to each other quietly in iranian a language i didnt know the boys had taken away the empty bowls and the muslin towels the water the holy water had made a puddle on the tiles a suicide run hence the ritual and the look of exaltation on the pilots faces there were talking with their heads close together klaus watched them from across the pool still crouched forward with his fingers interlaced he watched the iranians with a degree i thought of fascination from the nearest archway i too was being watched by my personal guard a suicide run but that didnt tell me the target the other iranian could be a pilot too or at least aircrew theyd both been through the ritual of their preparation for their ascent into heaven had possibly been taken through a more elaborate ritual at the mosque so it involved a big aircraft with a crew of at least two a bomber the evening prayer was being called by the muezzin from the minaret of the mosque the voice sounded tinny i think they use tapes these days in the bigger towns then the telephone began ringing again and klaus came over to it and picked it up two of his bodyguards had moved away from the wall closer to him this had become routine since the business with the knife out un instant he took the telephone to khatami pulling the long cable clear of a deck chair pour vous merci khatami spoke into the phone oui klaus stayed where he was on his haunches arms across his knees non cest pas bon vous avez un crayon alors ecoutez cest precisement au nord par a iouest repetez bon cest bon ecoutez il faut synchroniser les montres hein jai maintenant exactement heures cest ca a bientot oui he put the receiver down i turned a page of the tribune i was reading got it creased flattened it out began reading again tout va bien klaus oui tout va bien tout est en ordre khatami i wasnt all that far away a dozen yards or so and id heard them quite clearly but i dont think that klaus even realised i was there i dont think it mattered i was under close guard and i was going to remain under close guard until the flashpoint out there at the airport and whether the miniver was delivered on schedule or not whether london had sent forces in or not my expectations were that i would be silenced at that time and in that place klaus would have ordered it so it didnt matter what i overheard what information i might pick up it would remain safe for all time in the chill of the shrivelling brain but it was interesting academically i had the target north by west much good may it do me so forth that man muhammad ibrahimi had a bullet for me and he wouldnt leave anything to chance if he failed to carry out his orders he wouldnt survive the day i suppose it was the tinny ghostvoice of the muezzin wailing from the mosque that was giving me the creeps that and perhaps the killing of the dog and the boy the psyche was in despond and this was dangerous though difficult to change time had started to run short there was no the telephone rang again and klaus answered it at once jo jawohl george maitland came across from the edge of the pool and the pilots got onto their feet theyre ready klaus said and his voice was charged allonsy he went over to speak to geissler and then made for the building his bodyguards with him the iranians followed them hurrying their robes flying i noted the time it was im sorry youre going to miss this maitland said his bomber jacket was hanging across his shoulder from one finger he was smiling if you could call it that there seemed a kind of light on his face in his eyes and i thought hed lost colour a little yet id think he wasnt a man to get excited easily its going to be something quite spectacular klaus didnt invite me i said should i ask him he shook his head slowly he and i are the only ones going not even geissler some of the minions of course but theyre just monkeys and wont be coming back i sensed helen shiver and she turned away its getting cold she said i must go and get some clothes on did you talk to her much maitland asked he watched me with his eyes shining not a lot i said do you think shes attractive very attractive its that innocence of hers i find it extraordinarily seductive he turned looking across to the archway where she was just vanishing into the palace long pale legs among the gathering shadows god knows maitland said what shell think when she sees the media break shell know were responsible she likes power you see the kind of power she knows i can wield or enjoys her fear of it ive never thought of it that way he was dying to blurt things out in times of great emotion we say things we know we shouldnt cant possibly say i think if id had him alone with me for a bit longer i could have got enough out of him to give solitaire a final chance reach a phone bring london in but there wasnt time and it wouldnt get me anywhere klaus knew that as far as security was concerned i presented no risk was already silenced ibrahimi came across to us we shall be leaving in thirty minutes he said in french for darelbeida for the flashpoint i went in to change scorpion in my shoe and i tipped it out and it scuttled under the bed i held my hands out and watched the fingers they were perfectly steady the nerves were singing quietly in that flat inaudible monotone that is simply a vibration palpable but discernible to no other sense perhaps its what happens when a violinist tightens the string infinitesimally and hears knows that he has reached perfect pitch a woman was keening somewhere below and i could hear faint voices perhaps she was the boys mother the scent of jasmine came through the open window with its iron scrollwork and i saw two men in flying jackets standing in the forecourt near one of the cars they were the iranian pilots changed and ready and presumably waiting for klaus i put on the clothes id worn in berlin where it had been cold it would be cold here tonight though less so there might conceivably be a chance of preempting the flashpoint and getting clear turning the car over as id done once in moscow and taking advantage of the confusion but i couldnt do that its not what were for the ferrets in the field i could save my skin that way or by using some other crude but effective technique but that would mean abandoning the mission i had got to stay with nemesis for as long as i could in case there was the thousandth chance of blocking their operation if possible destroying it i couldnt simply bail out to abandon the mission is against the most sacrosanct edicts of the bureau the sacred bull if those bastards in london expect us to protect the mission with our lives and they do or they wouldnt give us capsules they wouldnt hand out capsules like bloody twinkies it follows that they also expect us to stay with the mission until death do us part in the natural course of events death from a bullet or a knife or a fiftyfoot drop from a rooftop or a headon smash or the last turning of the screw in the interrogation cell with the light blinding and the music blasting away at full volume brahms they usually go for brahms or beethoven death from whatever cause then it is in our contract you understand with the reaper at our side we have said i will i put on my shoes the scorpion was running inquisitively along the wainscoting and it was in my mind to go over there and step on it perhaps out of envy because it was liable otherwise to outlive me but i left it alone reminded of ferris that inestimable but sometimes revolting director in the field who takes dark and perverse pleasure in stepping on beetles with a fullblown algerian scorpion he would have had a ball the guard outside my door was on the move i heard his shoes squeaking on the marble floor they were gym shoes rubbersoled making him sound athletic impatient for me to do something wrong so that he could blow my head off and show the brains to klaus in atonement for letting that arab boy pull a knife there was another guard below in the courtyard watching the windows here i was beginning to sweat a little in the cool of the evening and this worried me and not only because sweat makes the hands slippery i had good reason to be frightened as the minutes ran out to the flashpoint i was almost certain by now that klaus suspected my cover beneath the lust in his breast to possess a real live nuke for the icing on his cake if there was no delivery made i would be shot but the same thing would happen if london hadnt laid a trap and the miniver was handed over after that id be worse than useless to klaus id be a danger knowing too much the scent of woodsmoke was richer now as night began falling and more fires were lit and the couscous went into the beaten copper pans i got my jacket it was the same kind as maitlands black padded berlin style i like them theyre good in cold climates and short hiplength you cant run in an overcoat you cant turn spin kick roll rebound dear god my brain was working like a chickens with its head cut off those buggers had guns it wouldnt matter what i was wearing how fast i could run theyd pick me off concerted fire power i left my bathroom stuff and the flight bag where they were and hung the swimming trunks a servant had lent me to dry on the window sill then i went to the door and jerked it open and the gun was in his hand before i took another step they were nervous these people didnt want to have klaus shouting at them again but i could have taken him this one little peon because i was alone with him and there are so many moves you can make if youve done it often enough his weak point was that the gun gave him confidence while i was barehanded and id work on that but i couldnt do it before hed got the first shot out and even though itd go wide of the mark it would make a noise and the others would come and klaus would have me wiped out because i would have blown my cover and hed know there wasnt a nuke waiting for him at darelbeida finito that way i was going down the arabesque staircase in front of him and took a wrong turn at the bottom and not by accident i wanted to rile the little bastard ease the resentment i turned the other way and went into the open courtyard it was quiet here deserted except for maitland he was standing at one end of the pool staring down into the water it was still now and no longer tinged with the blood of the arab boy the voice of the muezzin had stopped and the only sound beyond the high white walls were womens voices and the distant ring of cooking pots a ripe orange fell on the far side of the courtyard and burst among the dry scimitar leaves of the eucalyptus i felt for these few moments a profound peace settling like gossamer on my soul something close perhaps to what the two iranians were feeling and for the same reason we werent long for this world now hello maitlands voice came from across the courtyard and i remembered how it had been when id first found helen this mans wife standing as still as this on the frozen lawn in reigate the day before yesterday shed sensed my presence and turned and said hello wheres klaus i asked him coming well be taking off at seven i went over to him not hurrying looking into the pool watching his short dark reflection the deal i made i said is for the exchange to take place at were not taking the warhead on board maitlands eyes were still shining his excitement was burning in him like a fever its going on a later plane with the conventional explosive with the teddy bear fair enough i wouldnt want any lastminute complications this is quite an important deal for me he watched me for a moment his eyes bright and i wondered if he knew what the orders were that klaus had given muhammad ibrahimi that i was not to survive the rendezvous maitland would probably know yes had possibly advised it even insisted on it for the sake of absolute security and some of the unholy light in his eyes could be there because he knew he was talking to a dead man id seen a degree of fascination in klauss look when hed been watching the two iranians dieter klaus maitland said slowly hasnt planned this operation to include the risk of lastminute complications he didnt know i was english this man as english as he was itd be funny if wed been to prep school together he looked about my age not that it would have made any difference to our relationship kgb colonel kim philby had been an englishman too im reassured i said and then klaus came into the courtyard with his four bodyguards and an arab in a jumpsuit and a militarystyle jacket compact and blackbearded i dont think youve been formally introduced klaus said in french have you muhammad ibrahimi hans mittag i know youll get on very well youll be going to the airport with a driver and three guards for your own protection he was in a black flyingjacket with a fur collar had a pair of military fieldglasses slung round his neck im sure your associate has taken every precaution his black eyes were locked on mine and that he too has protected the rendezvous from unwanted attention or am i perhaps overconfident his french was stilted but i got the message the counterterrorist people i said in a moment are quick off the mark these days you know that it wouldnt be the first time an arms dealers come unstuck telephone it was all i wanted a telephone klaus said at once you think theres the chance of a security leak not really i run a tight show like you but nothing in this lifes ever certain is it i think youre right i ought to phone my contact he became very still i was running things terribly close but it was so tempting because if i could get london direct on the dial and use speechcode and warn them off the rendezvous theyd have time to signal whatever forces theyd sent into darelbeida and clear them out before i got there with ibrahimi id have a clear fieldwith no one to mess me up if i could do anything useful theres no time klaus said to phone anyone now he checked his watch youre leaving here in fifteen minutes and if your associate has left the rendezvous open to exposure it wont be my fault if you get shot you understand me i dont need fifteen minutes to do you understand he was standing in front of me with the look on his face id seen when hed killed the dog and when hed killed the arab boy and i was ready for him to blow had the angles worked out as a matter of routine the synapses flashing throughout the system and devouring data and sifting it and presenting the analysis for the motor nerves and if klaus had made any kind of move i would have gone straight into the killing area and he would have started choking on his own blood as the bullets went into me from the guards i dont know if he knew i was ready for him but i dont think so because it would have been a challenge and he would have accepted it and come for me just as a dog will do if you stare it down adrenalin running in the veins like strong red wine i could taste it in my mouth he went on staring at me yes i said i understand i want that warhead of course and i simply hate to sound tactless but does monsieur ibrahimi have the funds i looked at the arab i have the funds he said in cash in hundreddollar bills that is correct klaus stood back and maitland joined him i hope all goes well i said with the operation itll give me a certain sense of satisfaction in the morning when i read the headlines to think i played a minor part klaus left his eyes on me for a moment and then swung away didnt answer knew i wouldnt see any headlines in the morning maitland went with him through the archway that led to the forecourt where chrome glinted under the first faint light of the moon two of the guards followed them two stayed behind they were both men both european probably german they were flatfaced crewcut and had eyes with the indifference in them that we see in animals but i made them change moving my hand suddenly to tug the zip of my jacket higher and they became the eyes of the animal that sees the prey we shall make our way then muhammad ibrahimi said he walked beside me the guards behind no one else was in the courtyard now and as our feet rustled through the fallen eucalyptus leaves and we reached the archway i had the feeling that a curtain would come down behind us exhaust gas was on the air as we reached the forecourt the tail lights of a car showed among the trees where the driveway curved towards the road above the minarets of the palace the last of the daylight had gone from the sky and with the coming down of the sahara night a threequarter moon was already silvering the chrome and cellulose of the sel mercedes limousine that was waiting for us an arab driver and another european guard were standing beside it ibrahim gestured for me to get into the back of the car then followed two of the guards got in and pulled down the jump seats facing us the third sat next to the arab driver the last door was slammed and the hydraulic locks clicked home i felt for the seatbelt and buckled it ibrahimi folded his hands leaving providence to allah the funds i asked him are in the boot it was just to keep the polish on my cover two thousand five hundred bills would need a suitcase and i didnt see one here yes he said he would have a knife ibrahimi a knife rather than a gun the european clothes hed changed into hadnt altered his image very much with his beard and his hawkbeaked nose and his silences he was intensely arabian and would have been brought up with an affinity for the blade in time of need it would be the same for the driver the others would have guns be not sanguine my good friend upon this inauspicious night tis hardly meet we are not superferrets we the ferrets in the field we are but ferrets and subject to the laws of nature red in tooth and claw limousine south along the rue khelifa boukhalfa and across the plateau sauliere district with the scents of the evening coming through the ventilation system the smell of broiling lamb mechoui from the berbers openair kitchens of jasmine arid donkeys and incense and bruised oranges and the acrid reek of the leather tanneries in the souks our driver knew his job made detours around the congested areas where merchants lined the streets with their loaded carts and their rickety makeshift stalls what is his name i asked ibrahimi the drivers i do not know we spoke in french ibrahimi and i when we spoke at all i would have liked to know the name of the driver as a matter of routine tradecraft if you call a man by his name you establish immediate intimacy by however small a degree you are no longer a complete stranger and in a scene of confusion when other sounds are pervasive call a mans name and youll get his immediate attention i didnt expect there to be any scenes of confusion on this cool saharan night klaus had things running with the precision of a swiss watch but habit was ingrained in me and i let it work it could save solitaire at a pinch given the advent of a miracle to help things along i didnt expect miracles either from where i sat i could see the digital clock on the softlylit dashboard of the mercedes between the shoulders of the two hit men who sat facing me the time was now twentysix minutes to the rendezvous to the flashpoint the airport at darelbeida is kilometres from the city and we were now nearing the motorway since i could see the clock i wouldnt have to look at my watch i didnt want ibrahimi to know i was interested in the time the hit men sat watching my hands i didnt know if they spoke or even understood french but it was unlikely ibrahimi wouldnt need to give them any verbal instructions if i made a wrong move theyd go for me they were robots with guns kneejerk reflexive i didnt move my hands i left them folded on my lap if i were going to move them with malice aforethought id need to do it very quickly the limousine accelerated onto the motorway its headlights sweeping over the moonlit landscape there were twentyfour minutes to go one thought kept obtruding as i looked over the options that were left that fix id overheard couldnt be the target for midnight one north by west must be somewhere in the sahara desert because london was the zero eastwest meridian and almost due north of algiers and baghdad was somewhere about degrees latitude klaus hadnt mounted this operation to blow up a lot of sand it would be nice to look at a map one of the maps in the leather pocket at the back of the drivers seat but i couldnt think of any excuse to ask for one khatami the iranian pilot had been quite insistent on the telephone at the poolside making sure the caller got the fix correct and asking him to write it down and repeat it even telling him to synchronise watches but it couldnt be the target for midnight one then was it the location of midnight one in the middle of the sahara desert there was a telephone set into the walnut console between the jump seats it would also be nice to use the telephone as well as a map but i didnt think ibrahim would let me the only viable option i had left was to preempt the flashpoint move into some kind of action that could get me clear with a whole skin and leave solitaire running it would have to be calculated but it was going to be messy that was unavoidable one scenario seemed attractive there were five men with me in the limousine and they were armed three with guns and two i was going to assume with knives my immediate target would be ibrahimi and the technique would be an elbowstrike to the throat and lethal to do it effectively and with the certainty of a kill id need to work up the optimum degree of catapult tension in the arms to lend added momentum to the strike at the moment my hands were lying loosely on my lap and id have to move them a little and quite naturally settling them again with my left hand holding my right wrist i must then change the hold into an actual grip tightening it and pulling my arms against each other to the point where the maximum tension was reached before muscle fatigue set in then i would release my hands and the time it would take for my right elbow to reach the throat of muhammad ibrahimi would be in the region of onefifth of a second this is the figure weve recorded in practice at norfolk where a lot of work has been done on this particular technique because its quite often that an executive finds himself sitting captive in the back of a car through the windscreen i could see a big jet sloping towards darelbeida with its strobes flashing against the deep indigo sky by the clock on the dashboard we were now nineteen minutes to the flashpoint so at any given time ibrahimi could be sitting beside me with a smashed larynx and the blood flowing into his lungs this is a death oddly enough by drowning but the two hit men would also be fast their hands were resting on their thighs a matter of inches from their guns and id have to reach their eyes to blind them and inflict diversionary pain before they could fire and that would take time perhaps a full second a second and a half while my arms rebounded from the strike to ibrahimi and i turned my hands into a fourfinger eye shot as i drove them forward it wouldnt be difficult these men were facing me and even if they saw my hands coming and flinched or moved their heads i could change the eye shot into a claw hand with their eyes still the target and if they had time to reach their guns at all theyd have to fire blind and id be into a double outward rake to drive their hands away but there was a risk he was the man up front with the driver the big jet was flattening out for the approach floating above the black frieze of the date palms to the south have you known monsieur klaus i asked ibrahimi for very long i didnt expect him to tell me i wanted to know how far he was simply prepared to talk because soon i was going to talk to him and it would involve london he wouldnt know that i have known him ibrahimi said some time meant nothing the jet melted into the palm trees vanished the speedometer stood at a steady kilometres per hour the speed limit on this stretch at kph a lot of things would happen if the driver lost control he was no obstacle to me the arab at the wheel his hands were tied and he must watch the road but even supposing i could control the two hit men in the back of the limousine there was the third man sitting in front and he was a real hazard because id have to hit the seatbelt buckle release before i could reach him and in a car this size it was a long way from the back seat to the front and any initial momentum i could get from the upholstery wouldnt be enough to pitch me forward with the necessary speed to do anything effective there wasnt the leverage the third man would hear the action going on behind him the moment i started work and i wouldnt be halfway through what i needed to do with the other two before he span round with his gun drawn and fired at the skull to drop me with a single shot the timing as it concerned that man in the front there was brutal impossible rule out the idea then of preempting the flashpoint there was nothing i could do before we reached the airport at darelbeida before we reached the rendezvous i could feel the adrenalin flowing into the bloodstream again the resonance along the nerves as the digital clock flicked to at seventeen minutes to the flashpoint there wasnt a lot of time and i didnt see a single chance of doing anything even when we got there anything effective the most i could do would be to take ibrahimi with me ibrahimi and the two men in the rear of the car simply as a matter of principle but if i could do anything at all it would have to be in a clear field with no disturbance it was the only way i could work at the brink so id better phone london tell them to leave me alone get their ct units out of darelbeida before we arrived ive only known monsieur klaus i told ibrahimi a few hours i shifted on the seat a little halfturning to look at him and the hands of the two men jerked relax i told them in german im not going to hurt you theyd hate that did it for a giggle what did you tell them ibrahimi asked straight away i told them to relax theyre fidgety his face was turned towards me his black beard jutting his eyes on mine in the shadows a shimmer of black in the pale olive skin only a few hours i said i met him only last night as a matter of fact about this time but i know hes difficult to deal with as im sure youve discovered yourself he turned his face away from me stared through the windscreen again a glint coming into his eyes as headlights brightened from ahead of us in the opposite lane i wasnt waiting for an answer it hadnt really been a question i said you remember probably the difficulty i was having with monsieur klaus a little time ago at the palace you think theres a chance of a security leak klaus speaking in french ibrahimi had been there wed just been introduced not really i run a tight show like you but nothing in this lifes ever certain is it i think youre right i ought to phone my contact i expect you remember i told ibrahimi that all i was suggesting to monsieur klaus was that i should get on the telephone and make quite certain the rendezvous at darelbeida was uncompromised he would know the particular meaning of the word in this context i waited now but he said nothing do you in fact remember monsieur ibrahimi in a moment he said quietly yes of course he did monsieur klaus had been quite forthright theres no time to phone anyone now youre leaving here in fifteen minutes and if your associate has left the rendezvous open to exposure it wont be my fault if you get shot im afraid i told ibrahimi that monsieur klaus was perhaps a little overconfident when he refused to let me use a telephone but then hes like that isnt he i admire confidence in people but in this case he should have given a little more thought to what i told him i waited didnt expect an answer received none do you remember what i told him monsieur ibrahimi i told him that we can never be quite certain there hasnt been a security leak during the process of an illegal arms deal and i suggested i should telephone my contact you were there i remember monsieur ibrahimi i waited again just to give him time sat watching him the glint of headlights reflected in his eyes from the oncoming traffic i rather feel i said that youre a more patient man than monsieur klaus a more careful man i hope so because if there has indeed been a security leak since the miniver warhead left britain and if i cant telephone to find out this car could be surrounded by armed counterterrorist commandos the moment we reach the rendezvous and we shant have the fire power to shoot our way out i looked away from him swinging a glance past the flat expressionless faces of the two hit men to take in the clock on the dashboard behind them i had fourteen minutes left which didnt worry me because i could do all i needed to do on the telephone in that time but it worried me that london might not be able to call off whatever forces theyd sent in before we got to the rendezvous i looked back at muhammad ibrahimi and found his eyes on me but theres time i told him for me to make quite sure were not heading straight into an ambush you and i all i need is to use the telephone it would have been nice if i could have pressed him harder told him hed be a bloody fool if he didnt let me use the phone so forth it would have saved time but that wouldnt be the right approach for a man like ibrahimi he was infinitely more refined more subtle than dieter klaus and he was involved with nemesis perhaps not because he was in essence a violent man but because he had a violent antipathy like most arabs to the west and in this operation the west was probably the target why didnt monsieur klaus ibrahimi said at last permit you to use the telephone he didnt trust me why should i trust you you dont have to you would agree to speak to your contact in french of course and we can leave the receiver on the console and use the microphone doing it like that he could listen in to london i waited and through the windscreen watched a light aircraft making a turn on its way in to darelbeida the top of its wings flashing silver as it caught the moonlight on the clock we were running it terribly close but i couldnt hurry him ibrahimi then he said you may use the telephone may the wisdom of islam be praised the console was between the two jump seats and i told the guards in german im going to make a call dont get excited as i leaned towards them to touch out the number they went for their guns at much the same speed as a striking snake and held them against their thighs with their fingers inside the trigger guards a pair of walther ppks all right at close range but not manstoppers the number i touched out belonged to the signals link unit in london that we use if were being watched its untraceable even by british government agencies there was quite a bit of crackle going on possibly because we were near a major airport on the clock then the ringing tone began and someone picked up almost at once hello extension i said theres no extension i was simply telling them i had opposition company and they would pass it on when they made the link direct to the board for solitaire in the signals room it would be carey on the board at this hour he would have taken over from matthews at six this evening london time i didnt know carey but i wasnt worried hed be bright and fast or he wouldnt be in signals yes je voudrais parler a monsieur croder en francais hang on all the board crews knew a smattering of the european languages enough to know which was which croder as chief of signals was fluent in french and german and i needed to speak to him in any case because hed have the authority to do what i needed done croder hed got to the board very fast id been cut off from signals ever since id hung up last night after talking to cone in berlin and they didnt know whether i was still operational or blown out of existence or running loose like a mad dog in the dark with the opposition closing in on me id set up the miniver rendezvous with cone but when the executive is right in the heart of the opposition network anything can happen mr croder i said in french im within twelve minutes of the rendezvous and i need to know whether you feel its still secure it was an awful lot to hit him with because he knew i was with the opposition hed been given the extension bit and hed have to assume they were listening to every word he said id also spoken in what amounted to broad speechcode and what id just said had got to be decoded as have you sent counterterrorist forces there if he had the rendezvous wouldnt be secure and that was the key word in my question one can never be sure he said can one he was filling in asking for more data he knew i was with the opposition but he also knew that i wasnt talking under duress nobody was holding a gun to my head and telling me what to say i was saying exactly what i wanted to or i would have slipped in the prescribed warning straight off the bat mr croder im sorry to bother you but im within twelve minutes so forth i hadnt done that so he knew four things i was in the company of the opposition i was not speaking to him under duress i meant every word i was telling him and we were both being overheard this information was automatically going onto a tape and a printout sheet as we talked you understand i said that if theres been the slightest chance of a security leak with the risk of police or counterterrorist or other forces waiting for us at the rendezvous we cant keep it our client is concerned about it and so am i this is a rather important deal for us but im calling it off unless you feel the rendezvous is absolutely uncompromised he now had the whole thing and i waited clock eleven minutes ibrahimi was watching my face looking for any kind of giveaway as i talked the two hit men watched my hands which were on my lap again the limousine rolled smoothly under the african moon with the ruby marker lights on radio masts in the area winking against the sky croders voice came you shouldnt have anything to worry about i felt cold suddenly hed thought out precisely what he must say to give me the clearest signal he could hed sent people there hed told me i shouldnt have anything to worry about but that was very different from saying i had nothing to worry about he would have said exactly that if the rendezvous were clear he hadnt it wasnt his voice came again do you feel you should cancel everything then he was throwing the ball to me and i tossed it back do you i waited hed say yes or no if he said yes it would mean hed sent people there and couldnt get them out if he said no it would mean he could i watched the ruby lights through the windscreen letting them float through my mind relaxing because nothing must show in my eyes when croder answered me his voice came no the ruby lights floated all right i said well keep the rendezvous there was silence for a moment except for the crackle of interference on the line then croder said of course youll have to watch out for the airport police i cant give you any guarantees this deal is illegal it was a warning he was going to call off the people hed sent there sas gsg the algerian units whoever they were but he couldnt be responsible for local forces he could signal them that the rendezvous had been called off tell them to leave but he couldnt make it an order they werent under his authority well watch out i said for the police he said good luck and shut down the call and i reached forward to touch the end button and sat back again and looked at muhammad ibrahimi so what do you think i asked him in a moment he said monsieur klaus is eager to possess the warhead very eager and if ibrahimi didnt get it for him his life might not be worth very much then youre prepared to go in i asked him yes the clock on the dashboard flicked to we had ten minutes left i said ibrahimi id like to know something whether the exchange is made or not do you have plans for me i waited the hit men watched me beyond them i could see in the far distance the floodlit control tower at darelbeida ibrahimi turned to look at me my lips are sealed he said but you should make your peace with allah flashpoint a rose for moira through the windscreen i could see a twinengined jet taking off its splintersharp profile aslant against the brilliant haze of the starfields above the airport it looked very like the company jet wed flown from berlin this morning well be taking off at seven george maitland had told me at the palace he and dieter klaus destination unknown unknown at least to me you should make your peace with allah it would be delivered to moira as specified in my will a single rose so that she should know on the dashboard clock but what did it signify that i should make my peace with allah the driver took the mercedes in through the gates to the freight area showing the guard a piece of paper he waved us through a line of hangars made a black frieze against the horizon and five or six aircraft stood at angles big ones freight carriers i couldnt see any ground crews any vehicles on the move it was three minutes to the rendezvous ibrahimi was checking his jewelled wrist watch wait he told the driver in french the tyres whimpered on the tarmac as the big car was turned towards the wall of a freight shed and we stopped in its shadow the threequarter moon was twenty or thirty degrees high bright in a clear sky the sirocco had died away towards evening as the air had cooled there was traffic on the move near the main runway the strobes of small planes flashing as they rolled the two hit men watched me from their jump seats they hadnt put their guns away after id finished my call to london they were aimed at me now at the heart the two men werent watching my hands any more they were watching my eyes they were welltrained and i knew from this slight but significant shift in their observation that they were expecting me to make some sort of attack on them or on muhammad ibrahimi very soon now if at all so perhaps they understood a little french had heard what ibrahimi had told me and knew from experience that when the subject of an execution nears the moment of truth he tends to panic and strike out in a final attempt to save himself i havent seen moira for a long time several months she travels a lot making those terrible movies and of course i travel quite a bit too i hope she is well croder must have got his signals through extremely fast but then we expect it of him he has the attributes of a vampire and will draw blood in the instant if you cross him but when youre out in the field and hes in the signals room youve got infinitely more chance of bringing the mission home than with anyone else i didnt know what units hed sent in to the rendezvous or how many there were but hed cleared them out in nine minutes flat phoning them direct or phoning their coordination unit and telling them the rendezvous was cancelled cancelled or postponed or moved or whatever of course they could still be parked in one of the hangars over there or behind the freight shed nothing was certain hed done a good job croder and it looked as if i had an absolutely clear field for whatever lastditch attempt at salvation i might try this was what id wanted asked for and got but at that time id thought thered be something i could do at the flashpoint turn the car over or go for these people these monkeys these stinking monkeys steady youll have to watch it theres no room for emotion no room for panic here its too dangerous thought thered be something i could do at the flashpoint yes but in fact there wasnt take some of them with me of course but that was all an eye for an eye but what shall it profit a man when the mission is over before its time what precisely is the point in taking life out of spite pride yes but thats no answer the mission had ended when that plane had taken off just now my objective had been to infiltrate nemesis and stay within it until id learned enough to be able to destroy it and get clear but there hadnt been a chance and klaus was airborne for midnight one and tomorrow there would be headlines nothing would have changed if id let london spring their trap theyd have got ibrahimi that was all theyd hoped to get klaus thought hed be at the rendezvous nothing would have changed one minute adrenalin coursing through the veins through the heart where the bullets would go a feeling of lightness of time slowing down feelings that were familiar to me ibrahimi told the driver go to the hangar over there the second from the end hangar no we moved away leaving the shadow of the freight building i could see another vehicle on the move now a darkcoloured van it was going towards hangar no as we were london is very good with timing very reliable that will be the van i told ibrahimi with the warhead it is good he said the moonlight flashed on the star mascot as the big mercedes turned here ibrahimi told the driver stop just here we were at the northeast corner of the hangar not far from one of the big freight planes and a stack of crates with ropes across it the tyres whimpered again on the smooth tarmac and we stopped the clock flicked to fifty yards away in the shadow of the hangar the dark van halted silence came in you should make your peace with allah but i would rather stop the presses stop the headlines try one thing worried me i told ibrahimi when i was talking to my contact in london he warned us that wed have to watch out for the airport police do you remember he turned his face to me yes he said i think he had a point were still not certain we can get through this rendezvous successfully there could still be a trap i waited no one was getting out of the van over there tin thinking i said to ibrahimi of your personal welfare at this point theres no need for you to get out of the car yourself across the airport a commercial jet came in nose up and then flattening as the smoke rose in puffs from the tyres the sound hadnt reached us yet my hands were folded on my lap the two men could see them in the moonlight that struck obliquely through the window my hands were not folded with the left one holding the right wrist gripping it that technique couldnt work now because these two had their guns out didnt have to draw first if i went for the elbow strike to ibrahimis throat it wouldnt connect with the tissues before the bullets came they had their fingers inside the trigger guards and like me theyd be feeling the adrenalin and would be fast touchy the sound of the jet came in with a soft roar as it reversed thrust ibrahimi had done his thinking order the man in front he told me the german to go across to the van and receive the warhead id known it would be the man in front he would send out there not one of the men in the back of the car because they were watching me protecting him id wanted the man in front to leave the car for two reasons he was out of my reach unlike the two in the rear and ibrahimi could conceivably walk across there into a hail of shots if in fact there were some people still hanging around here despite the call from london and i wanted ibrahimi to stay alive in case allah was good to me and threw me a chance in a thousand and let me interrogate him he was the last link i had with nemesis and might give me some information i could work with he might speak a little french i told ibrahimi in which case you could give him the instructions yourself i called in german to the man in front asking him if he understood french he turned his head and stared into my face nein so i told him that ibrahimis instructions were for him to get out of the car and go across to the van when he was halfway there i said someone would come out of the van and deliver the consignment into his hands he looked several times at ibrahimi who nodded to confirm what i was saying when id finished he hit his seatbelt release and snapped the door open jawohl wait i said you will tell them you are here on behalf of herr ibrahimi mention his name ibrahimi you will also give the password which is in english it is the word mushroom pronounce it for me he tried no i said listen again mush room repeat that he frowned angered because he hadnt got his sums right would have liked to put a bullet straight into my head mush room good say it to yourself a few times as you walk across there now get moving he slammed the door and the echo came back from the mouth of the hangar like a gunshot we watched him walking across the tarmac his right arm not swinging not visible his gun like the others would be leftside bolstered under his coat he didnt trust the people in the darkcoloured van he didnt trust his own mother i slowed my breathing made it deeper bringing down the tension in the muscles because there was sweat coming and sweat is slippery on the hands can make a critical difference in any kind of action but there wouldnt be any the odds were too stacked and the timing was prohibitive i couldnt reach those guns from this distance and hope to smash them away before they fired not even with a double wave strike or downward blocks there were no options left then none the feeling of lightness came into me again a kind of floating ive known it before i think its when the conscious mind realises that death is inevitable and allows the psyche free rein to survey the data on a subconscious level where there may perhaps be insights inspiration where the spirit may redeem the flesh offering a means of survival i gave myself to it through the windscreen i saw a door of the darkcoloured van coming open and a man getting out then another between them they carried an oblong crate with rope handles it looked heavy the german approached them and when he was within a few feet of them they all stopped and seemed as if they were talking the german would be giving them the name of ibrahimi and the password mush room and i suppose they were pointing out to him that this thing was too heavy for one man to carry something like that but then the whole scene turned silver in a flood of blinding light and the figures of men came running from the mouth of the hangar and two jeeps came swerving into the foreground with their tyres screaming and ibrahimi shouted something in arabic and our driver hit the throttle and the mercedes began slewing under the wheelspin until the treads found traction and we grazed the nearest jeep and rocked and steadied and got under way with a surge of acceleration that took us clear of the hangar and across the tarmac with the rear tyres still whimpering under the acceleration lights in the mirrors bright lights dazzling ibrahimi was shouting to the driver again in arabic i didnt know what he was saying the two guards hadnt reacted very much were still watching me with their guns out perfectly trained ibrahimi was turning sometimes to look through the smoked rear window his face grey in the light coming through the tinted glass he looked at me once his eyes burning did you know of this no but i warned you it could happen and youre still a free man he looked away the lights in the mirrors were coloured now and flashing and sirens began sounding we kept a straight course until a fuel tanker came into view as a dark rectangle crawling across the taxiway then we swerved and hit gravel and tore a radar scanner away from its base and straightened again with the automatic shift kicking down and giving us another surge of acceleration from the huge litre engine the sirens behind us howling and shots coming now as we crossed the central apron in front of the terminus with the digital speedometer moving through kph and the lights from behind us losing their glare and the sound of the sirens fading by a degree but the shots were still coming and a rear tyre burst and we slewed badly and then corrected the huge shape of a commercial jet looming and swinging past as the tyre was torn away from the rim and we began settling on the offside like a ship taking on water the driver was doing what i would have done wed got superior speed but not too much manoeuvrability at over two tons so he was relying on putting all the distance he could behind us while the going was good and we were closing in on some hangars at the other end of the airport and could even reach them and get into shelter and ditch and run if that was what ibrahimi ordered another vehicle was coming in from the side with its coloured lights flashing and the siren going it had seen the mercedes and the speed it was doing and was coming across the tarmac to intercept but either our driver had lost too much steering because of the rear wheel or he decided to make an oblique attack because we swerved to the left and hit the vehicle at the front end and i saw it start rolling and the mirror on that side was lit up suddenly with an orange light and a second later we heard the dull thump of the explosion shots from somewhere from behind or from a new source of attention and another tyre burst and the tread began howling against the underneath of the wing and the stink of burning rubber came into the car and as we swerved again and hit something and span full circle the whole thing took off and i smashed my hand down on the gun to my left and it roared and i felt for the mans throat and made the kill as the other man brought his gun up and fired wild and i went in very close and used a heelpalm and drove the nose bone upwards into the brain as ibrahimi screamed something and i saw the flash of a blade and blocked it and started forming a tiger claw but the car was barrelling now and everything span across the visionfield and we smashed into something again and the doors burst open and i hit ground and rolled with ibrahimi on top of me forced him away and began dragging him clear as the tank went up and the whole of the night caught fire sahara where is it he began falling again and i jerked him upright twentysix degrees three minutes north i said by zero two degrees one minute west where is it he didnt answer the light of the burning limousine coloured the wall of the hangar smoke was rolling black smoke and the emergency vehicles were moving in it becoming lost in it the smell of burning rubber was on the air a sickening smell the limousine the mess wasnt close id run with this bastard for what had seemed a long time possibly minutes dragging him sometimes when he fell pulling him up again running again cursing him in french ibrahimi my last link with nemesis with the mission with any hope of doing something to stop the headlines what i thought hed said something wasnt sure there was a certain amount of dizziness coming and going pain everywhere understandable centre knuckle to the median nerve where is it the fix it was all i had left he reacted to the nerve strike opened his eyes and looked at me but didnt see me his eyes not focusing then i saw the blood it had started dripping from the edge of his padded jacket and when i pulled the zip down i saw it had been pooling inside black in the moonlight soaking i suppose it had been friendly fire the wild shot from the hit man on the right opened an artery i put my mouth close to his ear and asked him softly where is that position ibrahimi its in the desert somewhere isnt it in the sahara gunshot they hadnt been able to get one of the guards out of the mercedes then perhaps neither of them and their bullets were blowing up in the heat tell me ibrahimi where it is his head lolled as consciousness slipped then he jerked it up again and opened his eyes and looked at me with more focus with a lot of effort then he spoke but it was nothing to do with the fix help me to pray bastard he was dying knew where that position was perhaps knew something i could do to save a lot of other people from dying stop the headlines was he going to pray for them a night breeze was moving the smoke still rolling from the mercedes bringing it across the huge mouth of the hangar some of it clouding inside and bringing the sickening reek of rubber help me ibrahim said what i must pray so must we all but i got him by the shoulders and lowered his body until he was doubled over with his hands on the concrete in front of him and his brow resting between them i think he was too far gone to worry about facing east or west he began speaking in arabic while the blood formed a pool around his spread fingers making his peace with allah a luxury i will tell you this it was a luxury we dont all get the chance to make what peace we can before it comes i got my handkerchief and held it against my face but the stink of the smoke came through i wondered how long hed be ibrahimi i hadnt got all night there was blood on my hands i noticed but didnt know whether it was mine or his then ibrahimi rolled sideways and i got him onto his back and put his hands across his chest and went along to the end of the hangar where id seen some sort of office when wed come in here not with doors or windows or anything just some desks and a lot of paper and coffee mugs and a black plastic telephone on the wall i tried dialling direct but it didnt work god knows what the problem was but it took minutes and the girl got stuffy and i had to keep my patience and it wasnt easy because i didnt think i could do anything but i knew that if i could do anything it would have to be fast yes this was the board for solitaire i hadnt had to go through the link unit because i was alone give me control they knew who i was only the executive for the mission ever signals the board direct its his it belongs to him control shatner need i tried again straightening up getting things clear i need a dif it was the bang on the head id got in the underground garage at tegel airport i suppose plus coining out of the limousine like that pig out of a barrel left me dizzy hes in algiers shatner said cone yes it followed the only information london had had when id broken off communication with my dif last night in the stolen volvo was that id be at the rendezvous in algiers so that was where theyd sent him i got one of the plastic ballpoints and used the back of a lading bill printed in french number shatner gave it to me and i repeated it and wrote it down in big figures because there was only moonlight here coming in through the open doors moonlight and the glow of the fire from the other end of the hangar were still running i said and put the receiver back on the hook hed have liked to debrief me but i hadnt got time hed have to wait until cone signalled his report after id talked to him a yellowpainted jeep went hounding past the far end of the hangar with its emergency lights going i wouldnt have thought thered be any more need for rushing about there were some bodies to get out of the mercedes that was all but perhaps it was in the way or something and theyd have to shift it i wasnt worried that theyd start looking for me they hadnt known how many people thered been in the limousine and no one had seen me getting clear with ibrahimi or they would have followed us into the hangar before now local calls should work and i dialled the number direct again three rings yes executive he was at a safehouse then not a hotel we hadnt gone through a switchboard a safehouse or a sleepers place somewhere secure that would help debrief cone asked me no write this down i gave him the fix its somewhere in the sahara i want you to have me dropped there can you do that when as soon as you can its fully urgent it meant hed got to break every rule in the book if he had to just get me the plane cone would do that id been right id been so right to get rid of that clown thrower where are you i told him can i phone you there i gave him the number got it wrong not easy to read under the scratched plastic cover gave it to him again made sure because this was the lifeline now for solitaire ive got that cone said give me the picture its not a lockerbie thing its much bigger there are two iranian pilots involved i dont know what this fix means it could even be a target zone but i cant think why if it is youll know what happened to me be in the papers headlines have youll have to whats your condition cone cut in i pulled myself upright id been lolling all over the bloody desk papers on the floor everything swinging round i could not afford this im operational i said a few dizzy spells there was a car smash listen that fix could be totally remote i mean thats the sahara down there so so listen if swinging again and i had to wait listen i want a twoway radio you got that ill stay in contact as long as i can but if if you cant raise me by first light tomorrow youd better send a search plane over the zone i dont fancy dying of thirst out there i held on to the edge of the desk and waited again and the roof of the hangar swung down and tilted away again and i brought my weight underside and slowed the breathing deepened it and it helped give me water rations for twentyfour hours torch the radio hard tack flares the usual things for a desert drop gloves goggles all right yes have you lost any blood no you got a map there sahara yes im with an aip agentinplace hed know the territory use the map locate the bearing adduce the range wed need for the plane the fuel capacity then fix me up i said might take a bit of time ive got to reach that zone before midnight midnight one in a moment he said how long can you stay there by that phone as long as i have to do all i can he said but youd better know this im not sure whether its to do with a lockerbie thing or not theres a pan am flight reported missing berlin to new york mother of god what sorta girls they got there i said i didnt know so what you go there for he was a sicilian giovanni scalfaro spoke some kind of french some kind of english no german sucked on some kind of chewinggum which i suspected was laced he flew dope it was his living to meet friends i said we were talking about the safari club in tenerife where i sometimes go between missions you go there to meet friends giovanni scalfaro said and you dont know what sorta girls they got there our heading was degrees west of south with the moon high above the domed perspex cockpit cover and the sahara below the friends i meet there i said arent that sorta girls we were an hour from the dropping point then what sorta girls are they ive been given to understand that some sicilians are like this but he was my friend giovanni scalfaro he could help me to save solitaire stop the headlines if it wasnt too late id asked cone about pam am flight it took off from berlin at hed said and went off the screens twenty minutes later the flight plan was new york via london no radio contact since still nothing on the screens pan am have alerted their emergency procedures information centre and theyre waiting for reports of wreckage i didnt understand the object of this operation willi hartman had told me in berlin is to place a bomb on board an international flight scheduled by one of the major us airlines last night when it had looked as if nemesis had planned something bigger than a lockerbie id thought that inge stoph must have got it wrong when shed told willi about their plans she smoked grass and could have been high when shed said that wanted to shock him willi it didnt fit the two iranian pilots didnt fit into any plan for a lockerbie operation it signifies that they will die the arab at the palace had told me before they sleep again but it had been a pan am plane and they hadnt been flying it we hadnt left khatami behind in berlin he was here in algeria nothing else fitted midnight one the bearing the zone somewhere in the sahara nothing it could be a coincidence i dont believe in them when i looked at the clock on the instrument panel again it read hours pm i would be dropping in fifteen minutes its miles cone had told me when hed telephoned the hangar the aero l cruises at mph at feet the smoke had been rolling through the doorway tinged with the glow from the fire id thrown tarpaulins over ibrahimis body in case anyone came through there on a routine security check then id holed up in an empty crate until the phone rang hes using tiptanks and reserves so he can drop you over the zone and swing back and put down in adrar to refuel theres an airstrip there wed taken off at cone had been very fast hotting up all the telephone wires in algiers the agent in place would have known the territory where to find couriers interpreters weaponry locksmiths how to pull strings at the embassies where to find transport boats planes pilots how to hire them how much to pay ten minutes ago giovanni scalfaro had pointed downwards and to port adrar hed said thered been a few lights that was all now we were flying across darkness below into the wastes of the sahara it would be like dropping i thought into midocean did you hear i asked the sicilian about the pan am flight he swung his head to look at me yes and crossed himself theres nothing been found yet wait he said i ask rome and moved a hand to the radio rome said thered been some wreckage sighted in the north sea but it hadnt been identified pan am flight hadnt come back on the screens hadnt resumed radio contact we will pray scalfaro said we will pray for them youll understand what im talking about maitland had said tomorrow were going to make the headlines you know if that wreckage were identified as belonging to flight there would be headlines yes tomorrow but klaus had talked about conventional explosives had wanted a nuclear warhead it couldnt have been anything to do with flight at scalfaro looked at the ins reading im gonna use partial flaps to bring the speed down to okay gonna drop you off at feet okay with you i said it was well be over the drop zone in ten minutes you better get all that stuff hooked on i got the military knapsack and the waterbottles from behind the seat and buckled them to the chute harness will there be sand blowing down there maybe some he looked through the dome maybe a little sure we didnt see too many lights back there in adrar but then its a pretty small place couple of thousand people could be some blowing sand though i got the goggles out of the knapsack and slung them round my neck at scalfaro looked down through the dome again its none of my business but you know what youre doing not necessarily tell ya something my friend youre going to be lonely down there i looked through the perspex saw nothing below just a waste of darkness what about wind currents i asked him between here and the ground there shouldnt be any this time of the year and at night you wont be drifting much on the clock the roar of the titan turbofan was muted as scalfaro brought the throttle back another notch he had his head turned to watch me you feel okay hed noticed me lurch a bit on the tarmac at darelbeida wanted to know what the problem was told him my shoes were pinching none of his bloody business feel fine i said okay he slid the canopy back and the windrush slammed across our heads go for it drifting the sound of the plane had died away minutes ago and there was just the whisper of the shrouds above me the air was freezing against my face the starfields were brilliant in the dome of the night sky below me the darkness wasnt total the moon was spreading its light across a vast ochrecoloured haze the sahara i felt isolated minuscule tell ya something my friend youre going to be lonely down there and earlier scalfaro had said when wed boarded the plane maybe youre just crazy i dunno but i mean where youre going a hundred and sixty miles from adrar theres just desert theres just sand is all the sahara i mean thats all youll be too just another grain of sand down there i just hope you know what youre doing perhaps perhaps not it was all id got left of solitaire the fix north by west a point in the night in the desert and now i was there drifting i looked at the glow of my watchface again id dropped six minutes ago with a minute left before i hit ground the ochre colour was lighter now by a degree fine sand was pricking the left side of my face and i put my goggles on and took a quick look above me the moons rim had lost its sharpness there was sand blowing close to ground level i looked down waiting as the desert rose against me in the final seconds of the drop and i sensed zero and pulled on the lines to break the impact and saw shapes in the distance through the blowing sand and felt hard ground under my boots it was fifteen minutes since id come down and i had walked something like a mile across the violetred clay surface in the moonlight the fine sand blowing against my goggles and the scene ahead of me shifting as the wind came in gusts so that the shapes out there took on substance and vanished again sometimes i could hear voices calling id tried to signal cone on the radio but there was nothing but squelch there was a power generator running somewhere jamming the set i walked more slowly trying to identify the shapes ahead of me and heard another sound coming in now a faint whistling i stopped trying to identify it then without warning the generator was gunned up and the whole scene took on brilliance as a flarepath bloomed across the desert floor and lights flooded from the sky and i dropped into a crouch as the massive shape of an aircraft came drifting through the haze and settled onto the ground with a roar as it reversed thrust and i saw the blue and white pan am insignia on the tail flight figures moved through the haze i was in cover concealed by a stack of crates the time on my watch was i still had my goggles on others were wearing them too as they worked in the blowing sand the last of the passengers were coming off the pan am plane the nemesis team was herding them into a huge group two hundred of them perhaps more it looked a full complement their voices came thinly through the night the flarepath had blacked out as soon as the plane had come to a halt and then turned facing the way it had come the generator was idling now this was a dry lake bed not salt but clay with a fine powdering of sand on the surface it felt hard under my boots brick hard there were three other planes on the ground smaller than the pan am jet i recognised one of them as the company plane wed flown from berlin to algiers klaus would have landed here in that with maitland and some of the guards the second aircraft was a twinengined freighter with no insignia it would have brought these stores here the crates not quite stores they had markings on them and lettering in french with the skull and crossbones prominent on the cylinders where they showed through the slats most of them contained explosives some contained gas the third aircraft was a tanker and its generators were throbbing as the pan am plane took on the last of its fuel it was going to take off again and i knew when it would take off at midnight midnight one it was a time and a place midnight one there was another time and another place in the nemesis schedule midnight two that would be the target voices came on the wind the passengers complaining asking questions i could hear children crying six guards stood at intervals with assault rifles levelled at the hip floodlights washed over the crowd over their pale faces i saw klaus standing halfway between the pan am jet and its passengers fifty yards from where i was now he was shouting orders his arms waving with the precision of a traffic cops maitland was nearer the jet talking to the two iranians their figures floodlit by the lights of the tanker a camouflaged jeep was on the move providing liaison were going to make the headlines you know theyll be interrupting television programmes all over the world i tried the radio from time to time got nothing if i could raise cone he might be able to alert the algerian air force in time for them to intercept the pan am jet before midnight two before it reached the target it would be the final chance if i could reach him so i tried every few minutes but the generators were throwing out too much interference there wasnt quite clearly anything else i could do theres a pan am flight reported missing cone had told me it took off from berlin at and went off the screens twenty minutes later so it had been airborne for nearly four hours airborne and off the radar screens when it had landed here and the jets had whined into silence and the forward passenger door had come open dieter klaus himself had greeted the first two men off the plane throwing his arms around them they would be the hijackers who had gone on board in berlin there would have been no way to get flight off the screens except by losing altitude over water and getting below the radar and that was what the pilot had been ordered to do follow the english channel and turn south across the bay of biscay and then east across morocco into the sahara morocco would have picked up the jet on its screens but wouldnt have been able to identify it the sand blew against my goggles the air was cold against my face they would be coming across here very soon now to start loading the cylinders onto the pan am plane two men were standing near the company jet i think one of them was the pilot another man was crouching below the belly of the freighter checking the undercarriage perhaps it had been a bumpy landing the tanker had people around it watching the fuel going into the airliner if i could break cover without attracting attention and go across there and get into any one of the aircraft i could send a mayday call giving the position of flight and reporting it as hijacked alerting the algerian air force but they couldnt put any aircraft down here before midnight unless they had a base nearer than algiers tried the radio again and drew blank so i had successfully infiltrated nemesis the target opposition network and i had stayed with it all the way to the operation zone and i was there now watching the steadily running procedures as the time ran out towards zero but there was nothing i could do to stop them so solitaire was going to be the first mission i couldnt bring home couldnt follow right through to the end phase signal london and tell them to pick up that bit of chalk and put it on the board mission accomplished but id had to give it a try and id had to go it alone thered been no choice i hadnt known what i was going into but i know that in any ultrasensitive situation you cant send in support without risking confusion in the field and sometimes i can persuade london to understand this id got that clown thrower recalled on that very point in algiers my director in the field couldnt have given me more than half a dozen people at the most at such short notice and even if they hadnt been seen dropping out of the sky all over the place they couldnt have got this close as close as one man could come had come and even if london could have raised a whole bloody platoon and armed it to the teeth thered have been a war on down here the minute they landed and half those passengers over there would have been caught in the crossfire and there still wouldnt have been any guarantee that the pan am plane wouldnt take off on schedule at midnight one thered been no choice the wind blew cold penetrated my bomber jacket penetrated to the spine because there were going to be headlines yes after all the refuelling crew were hauling the flexible pipe away from the last pan am wing tank and stowing it on their plane and the jeep started up and drove across to where klaus was standing he must have been a touch pissed off herr klaus had been expecting a nuke to play with but it hadnt arrived he was answering a question from the driver of the jeep nodding emphatically and some of the guards piled aboard the jeep would turn i believed and head in this direction towards the stack of crates that were giving me cover it was time for the cargo to be loaded into the airliner i waited it seemed somewhere in the shadows of my mind that i had been waiting a long time for this moment to come longer than hours longer than days as if in the past id been given a glimpse of the shape of things to come i think this was because id just realised that there might be something after all that i could do to bring klaus down before he could reach his target midnight two wherever it was a woman screamed somewhere among the crowd of passengers having got to the point of hysteria i suppose and understandably the scream touched my nerves for an instant froze them because i knew quite well that if i started to do what had come into my mind thered be no calling it off no chance of getting back carpe diem i went on waiting seize yes indeed the day my cover was good here the crates were stacked higher than a man and i could move with freedom personal cover was also satisfactory most people here were in black bomber jackets like mine it had been the fashion of choice when wed set out from algiers for a winters night in the desert three or four of the men on the jeep wore goggles as i did against the discomfort of the blowing sand and we all wore padded gloves de rigueur i wouldnt have been noticed in the front row of the chorus someone would have to tell you i was the fourth from the left just above the baldheaded violinist in the distance the jeep turned and gunned up its headlights swinging towards the stack of crates i didnt move you wont get out of this alive shut up its a suicide run you know that christs sake shuddup then the jeep slid to a halt on the dry sand and the men dropped off it with a clatter of combat boots and started work on the crates with their jemmies breaking away the slats to get at the cylinders two of them moving around to the sides so i kicked at the slats of the nearest crate and prised them away and hauled one of the cylinders out and stooped and got it onto my shoulder and joined the chorus line lurching with it across to the jeep another man beside me the one just above the redhaired lady with the trombone the sweat running on me because i was committed now and beyond the point of no return because if i could get this far i stood a chance of bringing the mission home that or the other thing finis finito i slid the cylinder onto the back of the jeep and found a spare tyre lever and went back to the crates and worked on the slats and dragged another cylinder out there were two arabs here but the rest were german by their speech remember the orders one of them said and dont throw these bloody things around knock em together a bit too hard and were goners kerbooom so for christs sake be careful hes leaving it late someone said you know that he knows what hes doing shuddup and get the job done i checked my watch at when wed shifted more than half the cylinders making five trips with the jeep fully loaded the two arabian pilots had moved they were standing with klaus as we passed him on the final run one of them was laughing the sound carrying on the wind they looked at their ease hands on their hips and their heads thrown back as klaus slapped their arms telling them in his terrible french that they were heroes i caught snatches of it you will have streets named after you you will go down in history as the saviours of islam it was not good news this was not good news unless he was wildly exaggerating this concerned more than just a megadeath in a football stadium it concerned midnight two something big enough to earn them a place in history the mental sense of powerlessness is ennervating my legs felt weak my arms incapable i needed help with my last cylinder as i staggered with it onto the pan am plane you all right bloody things weigh a bit thats all the cabin was swinging across my eyes and i had to hold on to a bulkhead to steady myself the men were shouting at the entrance to the cabin behind the flight deck how many more three look sharp then i moved back to give them room okay that one on top of those two they moved about i could hear them i couldnt see them any more because id slid down on my haunches behind the stack of cylinders i think i was in one of the forward galleys because there was a curtain drawn half across and the smell of coffee it was comfortable here with my back against a panel and i closed my eyes voices came from outside the cabin speaking in french because of the curtain i couldnt hear them clearly theyre on a suicide run and now youre going with them shut up youre out of your fucking mind shuddup and leave me alone the wind blows across the desert across the clay of the dried lake bed flinging sand against the windows of the cabin i listen to it i look at my watch it is we have three minutes left then i can hear voices again this time speaking an arab tongue they come from inside the plane then there is the soft rushing of the jets and vibration comes into the airframe i can feel it against my back now there is a roaring the sound of huge power the big metal cylinders begin a discordant tintinnabulation as the cabin trembles and then it dies away as the wings lift and we are borne into the sky airborne it was the first thing i looked at took an interest in when i opened my eyes the watch on my wrist we had been airborne an hour and thirteen minutes i had slept the decision had been made for me by the subconscious when the betawave levels had been phased out by shock by the accumulated shock of the mission that we file under the simple name of mission fatigue it is not simple i felt quite good felt refreshed clearheaded again thought came easily now and i was becoming aware of what had happened but there were certain troubling aspects because the decision my subconscious had made for me was totally illogical i could hear them talking up there on the flight deck through the open door the two pilots they were speaking a language i didnt know presumably farsi i couldnt hear any specific words wouldnt have understood them in any case totally illogical then the decision that had been made that i was stuck with i could either have stayed where i was on the ground or i could have stayed on board the plane and taken off with it if id stayed on the ground i could have joined the tanker crew or the freighter crew and hitched a flight back to algiers they wouldnt have recognised me had never seen me before would have accepted me as one of the team once in algiers communication immediate communication telephone cone and tell him the situation let him signal london and tell them to alert and inform pan american airlines but there wouldnt have been anything they could do flight would by then have been airborne for more than two hours invisible in the night untraceable on its way to the unknown target midnight two if it hadnt already reached there if there werent already headlines running through the press it would have been an exercise in total futility calling up my director in the field and having him signal london and all that trala an exercise in total bloody futility all it would have done would be to put the matter down in the records mission unsuccessful executive safe so there wouldnt have been any point in staying on the ground in the desert it wouldnt have achieved anything but thered been no point in taking off on board this aeroplane either because i was in a strictly shutended situation i had no argument that would persuade the iranians to put this aircraft down somewhere and call the whole thing off and if i got control of them i couldnt put it down anywhere myself id had no training on anything half this size and itd have to be brought in like a feather on the breeze or wed blow up the airport teddy bear the subconscious then is not always reliable is not always so bloody clever you would do well to remember that my good friend it can send you to your bloody doom teddy bear on the floor dropped i suppose by one of the children when theyd all been herded through the exits or was it perhaps a naughty teddy bear that would blow my head off if i picked it up blow the whole plane to bits but it wasnt worth worrying about the stuff in these fortyeight cylinders wed stacked in here was measurable in megateddybear power there were two kinds of labels on them both in red and white and with the skullandcrossbones symbol at least four of the cylinders contained trinitrotoluene and carried another vignette an explosive flash in red there might be more of these in the stack i didnt know because the labels werent all visible the labels on the other cylinders read nitrogen tetraoxide and carried four symbols the skullandcrossbones the explosive flash a mans head with a gas mask on the face and a coat on a hanger symbolising protective clothing as an explosive nitrogen tetraoxide is dramatically potent when geissler had put me under the strobe in the garage last night id repeated the story samala had told me an airman dropped a ninepound socket from a spanner inside a titan silo and it punched a hole in the skin of a fuel cell and started a leak there was a ton steel door on the silo and when that fuel went off it sent it two hundred feet straight up in the air and dropped it a thousand feet away it was when i checked my watch again the time was important because i would very soon have to do something definitive the empty cabin made a soundbox for the soft rush of the jets the lights had been left on in here turned low on the rheostat something was rolling on the floor pinging against one of the cylinders and i picked it up it was a lipstick and i put it onto the counter of the galley and bent again to pick up the teddy bear freeze but it was all right nothing happened and i sat him on the counter too with a sense i suppose of restoring order while i sipped my coffee and thought things out and eventually reached conclusions deadly conclusions solitaire was in the endphase and if all went reasonably well i could bring it home though only metaphorically i would remain somewhere in the atlantic distributed piecemeal on its surface to be plucked at by fish and i say this without bitterness because id rather have them than the worms in the endphase of a mission when we realise the executives status is terminal its rather like drowning in that we look back over the events that led us here and at this particular moment i found myself thinking of that clown thrower and hoping that shatner would learn from his mistake and not send him out again unless it was to direct a shadow who could work comfortably with a bloody schoolmaster i also thought of helen maitland and hoped that one day she would shatter the selfimage shed been stuck with and start fresh again and as i considered these things i came to know what was happening i was putting off the moment when i must set in motion the necessary procedures because they would bring my death and the sweat was crawling on me and the adrenalin was firing the motor nerves as i drained the cup with the pan am crest on it and put it into the sink polaris had been high on the starboard side when id checked our heading through one of the windows and the time was now so we were somewhere west of morocco and over the atlantic procedures three of the nitrogen tetraoxide cylinders were stowed vertically just aft of the galley and secured with straps and i loosened a buckle by one notch and pulled a cylinder away from the others and let it fall back it had the deep musical sound of a bell did it again remember the orders dont knock these things around hed been the leader of the work group the jeeps driver knock two of these together a bit too hard and were goners kerbooom so for christs sake be careful did it again boom this was all right i wasnt knocking them about therewas a shipping label on the loose cylinder half torn away printed in french it had been shipped they had all then presumably been shipped out of libya its believed that dieter klaus has the substantial backing of col moammar gadhafi it had been in my berlin briefing boom the voice of one of the pilots cut through the rushing of the jets he was telling his friend i would have thought that he was going to take a look there was some cargo shifting so forth boom i saw his shadow now moving across the wall of the cabin on the other side i let the cylinder fall back again and backed away staying close to the galley bulkhead the iranian reached the three cylinders and saw what the trouble was i searched him and found a gun and emptied the chamber and dropped the bullets into the trash container in the galley and put the gun into the refrigerator the edge of my right hand was throbbing but that was normal the strike had needed great speed and great force so that he didnt have time to cry out hed started falling towards the cylinders and id steered him away and let his body down gently then dragged it behind the galley bulkhead then i straightened up and tightened the buckle on the strap securing the cylinders and went forward onto the flight deck the pilot said something asking what the problem was i suppose and i didnt answer so he looked up and his face opened in surprise and he brought his right arm across his body and i waited until the gun was in his hand and then broke his wrist and worked on the gun and threw the bullets into the cabin and shoved the gun into my coat bugger was throwing up for christs sake the bugger was lolling over the control column with his face white all right theres a lot of pain with a broken wrist but you dont have to go into histrionics do you and i told him in french get that control column watch what youre fucking well doing a lot of anger coming out it had been suppressed for a long time now and there was some fear in it i knew that because the chances of getting out of this thing alive were so terribly thin i pulled him upright slapped his face got him more or less conscious again i suppose hed got a low pain threshold some of us are like that its a matter of sensitive nerves but i didnt want him messing about when he was meant to be flying a jumbo load of explosives through the dark i said in english whats our destination he looked at me with his eyes trying to focus come on for christs sake whats your target there was north of west on the compass but that didnt tell me enough he shook his head it looked all right i was going to use a lot of english in a minute or two when i hit the radio and i didnt want him to understand in french where are we heading wipe your mouth for gods sake get a handkerchief what is our destination he wasnt quite with me yet kept looking behind him into the cabin where is hassan he asked me i reached and slid the door shut without taking my eyes off him if i told him id killed his friend hed go crazy and try something and i didnt want any milling about we could break an instrument kick a control out of whack i wanted in any case his cooperation i didnt think id get it what is our destination he glanced down and across wasnt fast enough mentally yet to stop himself and i saw the briefcase on the copilots seat and picked it up then i looked into his eyes and said quietly khatami if you give me any trouble im going to kill you do you understand that he watched me some anger of his own coming into him now as he thought of his friend did you kill hassan he asked me as long as you understand khatami you are a pilot yes you fly these planes yes otherwise i couldnt kill him and he knew that he wasnt a small man he looked strong fit probably did a lot of aerobics athletics to keep in shape doing a sedentary job but he was an airline pilot and hadnt undergone any special training or he wouldnt have let me take his gun away and the difference between any given athlete however strong and an agent who has been trained for years at norfolk and by exhaustive experience in the field is immeasurable when it comes to effective closecombat techniques this man was also in a lot of pain his face still bloodless and i didnt think id have to work on him again until he started feeling better he began wiping himself down with his handkerchief and i moved behind him and sank onto my haunches facing his seat with my back to the bulkhead where a cup of coffee had been spilled splashing against the vinyl the empty cup smashed on the floor this was when the two hijackers had pushed their way onto the flight deck past the stewardess shed been bringing a fresh cup for one of the crew a teddy bear on the floor a lipstick and a smashed cup the small signs of great crisis of the process of an act of inhumanity if khatami moved i would see it in the periphery of my vision field i took out the first sheet from the briefcase and let my eyes make leaps across the paragraphs to get the gist the first of them were in french and one pulled me up short you will insist that you have a fire in the cabin and that you cannot risk going on to dulles international remind air traffic control that you have a full complement of passengers and that you must get them onto the ground as soon as possible and regardless of all other considerations there were three more paragraphs in farsi and some figures that looked like radio call signs i took out the second sheet it was a map for airline pilots washington dc washington national river visual approach for runway i began taking slow breaths the image of khatamis seat had moved the whole silhouette had moved against the lights of the instrument panel i didnt want any more of that bloody dizziness at a time like this i couldnt afford the luxury nobody could afford it the president of the united states couldnt afford it i knew that now you will make your approach to runway from the northwest following the lights and landmarks of the potomac river you should pick up the river just after passing through dme at feet the american legion memorial bridge will be on your right you will pick up the lights of the chain bridge just after dme and you should now be down to feet i felt the vibration of the bulkhead against my shoulderblades could smell the stale coffee that had been spilled and khatamis vomit the lights and the leds shimmered below the darkness of the windscreen some of them steady some of them flashing red green amber white i had to look away from them they were starting to swing a little in front of my eyes never neglect concussion it was in the medical section of the manual at the bureau and doc dibenidetto can be trusted to know whereof he speaks it had happened in the underground garage at tegel airport and pitching out of the limousine in algiers had aggravated things slow breaths and make haste great haste now the georgetown reservoir will be coming up on your left and you should now be down to feet at this point you should request confirmation of your permission to make an emergency landing from atc so as to reassure them that your situation is genuine you should be through the dme and over key bridge at feet continue your approach above roosevelt bridge and arlington memorial bridge as scheduled with the washington monument now on your left at this point you will break off your approach path and make a turn to line up with the white house and complete your run in to the target the lights swinging at the edge of the vision field around the edges of the map the rush of the jets diminishing a little i waited had to wait until i thought i could get onto my feet and stay there i think it took only a few seconds and when i finally managed it i had the feeling i should have waited longer not rushed it khatami i said get on the floor he looked up at me down at the map in my hand there wasnt any point in talking to him about this i hadnt got a gun that i could have pressed to the back of his neck while i told him where to fly this thing where not to fly it but i had enough stamina left to kill him if i had to but he was beyond threats to his life hed already surrendered it to allah and nothing could touch him now this is the strongest weapon of the kamikaze hes got nothing to lose nothing you can threaten to take away from him he was still looking up at me khatami you killed hassan he said down on the floor face down on the floor mover he held my eyes for a moment and then dropped from his seat and lay prone i think because hed seen i was ready to kill him if he didnt obey and that would mean hed have no chances left of overcoming me if he could that was all he wanted to live for my death and his final run in to the target i put my foot on his neck so that id feel any movement any attempt to get up then i hit the speaker switch of the radio so that i wouldnt have to reach for the headset and raised the board for solitaire in the signals room in london can you hear me yesyes the voiceactivated tapes would be starting to roll i am on board pan american flight croder would be there chief of signals during the endphase of a mission he will never leave the signals room sometimes a camp bed is brought in there for him we have that i felt a chill id paused longer than id thought and they were having to prompt me the radio display was blurring clearing again blurring id got up too soon off the floor too soon pushing it this was pushing things no good this was dangerous said i said my position is west of the moroccan coast and south southeast of the azores we have that oh jesus christ this wasnt i wasnt doing this fast enough listen this aircraft must not be allowed must not be allowed lights went out the lights of the display went out dark now not the lights my eyelids closing that was it have to open them open them this aircraft must not be allowed the lights swung in an arc and a flash of pain shot into my right shoulder as i crashed down on it fireball in the dream i heard a voice it was screaming at me heat in my shoulder white heat it didnt bother me i listened to the dream because that was all it was a voice it was screaming at me but i didnt understand the words i went on pushing the lights were beautiful circling above my head red green amber white circling around the starfields in the windscreen went on pushing running down my arm there was something running down my arm oh mother of god this is screaming at me about hassan i could hear the name hassan i pushed harder i wasnt going to let him do this he had a knife a long knife with red on the blade come in please come in that was in english london hassan khatami was screaming then he seemed to remember and switched to french you killed hassan and went on screaming something about le grand satan he would die the great satan yes a turn from the river jesus christ ive got to pushed very hard but my hand was slipping because of the blood it was dripping against my face come in please come in london waiting i had things to tell london very important things this aircraft must not be allowed to approach the eastern seaboard of the united states it must not be allowed to approach land at all tried tried to shout it out so theyd hear nothing happened his face was above me khatamis dark enraged in the centre of the swirling vortex of lights one clear thought burning in my head one clear thought if i dont tell london this whole bloody thing is going to hit the target the one thought burning in my head come in please come in calm his voice sounded very calm but they knew what was going on they could hear this bastard screaming could understand his french come in please blood in one of my eyes you killed my brother hassan tried shouting again and got a word or two out but then the blood was in my mouth and i began choking on it and that was going to make things worse so i pushed very hard indeed and felt his arm swing away as i twisted from under him choking choking for breath and hanging there like a bloody dog but the adrenalin was firing the muscles and i reared and smashed my head into his face and the screaming stopped felt for his knife hand and reached it and got my feet braced against the bulkhead and lurched forward lunged forward and smashed my head into him again and did it again and turned the knife turned it pushing it through the dark the red roaring dark pushing it into the softness deeper and deeper pushed it as far as the hilt coughing up the blood that had got into my mouth choking for breath but it had stopped the screaming had stopped and i lurched forward again and hit the bulkhead near the radio console and heard something break a panel making a brittle sound but it seemed all right because they were talking again come in please come in choking still but i could breathe now things much things much better he wasnt moving i could see him with one eye the knife sticking up like a bloodied erection went on choking again and got the last of it out of my throat leaned against the console the sweetness of air in my lungs come in listen this is this is my situation no need to tell them now that this aircraft must not be allowed so forth because this aircraft wasnt going anywhere after all he was dead i believed khatami or if he wasnt dead he wouldnt be able to get at the controls again there was a lot of blood coming out of his groin creeping towards the smashed coffee cup that was lying there on the floor i did some more coughing and it helped this aircraft is loaded with explosive but i am in control odd an odd way to put things in control of what exactly a flying coffin yes what i mean is im going to have to ditch and blow it all up you got that have you got yes we have that then another voice came on and i recognised shatner control let me have your position my left eye was streaming with tears and the blood was getting washed away but i couldnt see the instrument display very clearly yet i cant tell you not accurately west of the moroccan coast southeast of the azores possibly more like due south by now broke off to do some more coughing but things were much better now and i could breathe quite well between bouts it was my wrist where the blood had come from hed sliced a vein the target was the white house but listen the passengers of flight are being held in the sahara desert and this is their position north by west need to get them out of there terrorists guarding them with assault rifles need to be careful gave myself a short rest needed more air in my lungs they felt constricted but the tapes were running in london and thered be signals going out already to alert people the british ambassador in algiers and through him the algerian air force and army desert reconnaissance gsg in germany because klaus was out there listen i said dieter klaus may still be there when the rescue aircraft reach those people or he may fly out before they arrive if hes still there i advise the use of utmost caution he is vicious ruthless and determined and i suggest they shoot him on sight have you got have you i have that shatner said that position you gave me is it an airfield i told him it was a dry lake bed had a flarepath told him its distance from the nearest town adrar gave him the whole thing while the starfields crept across the dark of the windscreen as we headed west through the night i was beginning to feel lonely are there other aircraft there in the desert said yes told him what kind they were i knew now from what id found in the briefcase why klaus hadnt used a cargo plane for this operation washington national wouldnt have let it land there they would have told it to go the extra distance into dulles but a pan am carrier with a full complement of passengers would make a difference the potential loss of life would have been far greater if the situation had been genuine beginning to feel lonely yes the nightblack ocean was below me its crests touched with silver by the moon this huge aircraft was like a mote of dust compared with the vastness of the atlantic id thought when id made the drop into the sahara that it was like going down into an ocean but that had been an illusion this time it was real when you can give us your exact position do that i leaned away from the console overdid things and lost my balance and had to throw out a hand to save myself i think i stayed like that swaying on my feet for a long time quite a few seconds what is your condition im trying to see give me a your condition how much strength have you got left oh enough to ditch this thing i mean it can do that for itself but ive got to get it off autopilot and then weve got to steer clear of the azores and the african landmass i dont have you lost blood it wasnt wholly telepathy in the final hours of the endphase theres often a bit of blood drawn by someone or other this place looked like an abattoir yes but i dont need long i worked my way round to the front of the lefthand seat and dropped into it and buckled the harness on and the instrument array swung into an arc and i blacked out gradually came back in terms of morale oh jesus christ they wanted to know about my bloody morale when all i needed was the strength left to hit the auto switch to manual and bring the control column back i did that listen i told control im going to bring her down and make a it was like hitting a wall stars whirling through the dark through the silence she watched me one shoulder strap hanging down her eyes innocent her skin cool with water droplets on it from the pool i hope well meet again she said i know where to find you i told her and brought my head away from the instrument panel with a jerk as the roar of the jets slammed back come in please come in the display lights swam and steadied and i looked for the altimeter and the shock went through me and i brought the control column back and locked my arms round it feeling the gforce as the huge mass of the aircraft pulled out of its dive asked london how long was i out seventeen minutes i lost altitude im down to feet what is your position north by west what is your heading you are approximately miles south of the azores and will pass them to the northwest if you maintain your heading what is your altitude now still id kept her steady at that level since id pulled her out of the dive youre well placed to put down in ponta delgada the airport in the azores it sounded comforting an island in the night in this vast sea but i was not in point of fact well placed to land there i cant put this thing down anywhere at all ive got to ditch it what have you flown before the nearest thing to this was a singleseat jet fighter then youre familiar with the basics the basics are i said that ive got enough explosive behind me to blow the azores out of the atlantic if i mess up the landing silence for a bit they were putting their heads together shatner croder perhaps loman i didnt know how many of them were in the signals room now but thered presumably be quite a few because it wouldnt go down terribly well with the portuguese government if i wrote off their seagirt real estate listen i said theres nothing oh jesus christ im ordering you to land your airplane in ponta delgada it wasnt london there was a us air force f i right alongside sleek and pointed and with the moonlight flashing on its wings this is major j f franklin of the united states air force if you wish to avoid attack you must land your airplane immediately there was another one sliding up on the port side i was flying in formation theyd picked up my radio call to london and theyd heard me say that the white house had been the target and theyd got off the ground in the azores or theyd been on nightflying exercise from spain and they were up here to start a war i cant do that i said ive had no training with this aircraft if i will give you one minute to alter your course for the azores your failure to do this will bring an immediate attack hadnt believed me thought i was playing for time major i said let me give you a little advice if you attack this aircraft youll blow yourself out of the sky im carrying the equivalent of a small nuclear bomb i could see his helmet through the cockpit cover his face was turned towards me you will alter course immediately for the azores had the white house on his mind i could quite understand he major franklin london this is the british foreign office goodmorning we can vouch for the identity of the person flying the pan american plane this is the flight that has been missing since early last evening from berlin flight the pilot has seized control from iranian terrorists but has not flown this type of plane before the british government would be most grateful for your assistance in any way possible i think he said a bit more but i went into another coughing fit clearing the last of the blood out of my throat it was nice to have company up here with me but there wasnt anything they could do they were pallbearers that was all please identify yourself what oh names locke i couldnt think how it would help could have said i was moses london was quiet waiting for some kind of answer from major franklin i watched the instrument panel we were still at feet airspeed heading unchanged shut my eyes for a bit i knew what id got to do and i wanted to do it and get it over the radio was quiet i suppose they were both thinking things out the us pilot and london then another voice came on this is walter j cummins the american ambassador in london can you hear me major franklin yes sir now that had been very fast work control had told someone at his elbow to get the ambassador on the phone as soon as hed started talking to the us pilot in case he refused to accept the authority of the british fo theyd got him on the phone at his bedside and told him the brief position and patched him in through the signals room amplifiers he sounded as if he was speaking into a bucket i can vouch for the authenticity of the gentleman speaking to you from the british foreign office you may therefore accept what he has just told you about the person at the controls of the pan american airplane im not completely clear about the situation apart from that is there any assistance you can give mr locke at this time the us pilot still had his head turned to watch me ok sir i guess its over to him what are your intentions mr locke i told him id got to ditch i understand youre not familiar with this type of airplane we could try talking you down into ponta delgada the display lights had begun swinging again and i braced the control column in my arms the sound of the jets had started to fade i said look youd better stand off a bit in case i let things slip we dont we dont want any collisions tell tell your friend too what kind of shape are you in bit snuffed listen then it started again and the whole thing blacked out mr locke can you hear me yes i think why are you losing altitude i looked at the instruments we were down to feet and the needle was still falling pulled the control column back overdid it felt the plane shuddering there was a ringing sound from the cabin behind me the cylinders had started shifting under the vibration knock two of these things together a bit too hard and were gonners kerbooom the us pilot had asked me something about altitude but it wasnt important the important thing was to stay conscious for long enough to put this thing down get it out of the air out of harms way look i said im going to ditch now youd better keep your distance i could talk you down into the azores i think we should do that mr locke its not all that tough if youve flown a jet before we this is air traffic control ponta delgada you are not permitted to land at this airport please acknowledge there was something i should be thinking about please acknowledge he had a thick accent would you repeat that yes you are not permitted to land at this airport please acknowledge theyd picked up the stuff about the explosives right i cant land at your airport i ought to be thinking about what major franklin had said not to be taken lightly perhaps about talking me down i mean if i was going to put this thing in the sea maybe we could do it gently take the thousandth chance we regret azores there is risk of damage because of the explosives but we have despatched two airsea rescue helicopters and we would like to know your present position altitude and heading i checked the panel and told them okay mr locke so well talk you down onto the sea the major i kept the control column braced in my arms the sound of the jets had faded again but i realised it was because the two air force planes had done what id said moved away a bit in case of accidents through the windscreen i watched the atlantic below me not far away black and endless glittering in the moonlight flecked with crests not hospitable mr locke can you hear me yes thinking the ringing from the cabin back there was still going on like the bells of a temple in tibet blood in the mouth i couldnt get the taste of it out black water below we were at feet id been letting the control column go i said yes all right much obliged okay this is going to be a gearup flapsdown landing leave look when i hit the sea youd better keep your distance id make it at least a couple of miles will do thank you for your concern now get your flaps down i saw the two fighters sliding away on both sides becoming small becoming silhouettes this is ponta delgada your position please gave it to them that is good heading altitude airspeed please gave it to them the sea was close now lines of white crests across black water the starfields dipped and rose in the windscreen i suppose there was a wind blowing perhaps a gale i couldnt find the instrument that would give me the windspeed okay now lets have your landing lights on i began looking for the switch there were hundreds we are still with you if you need us london shatners voice support i suppose moral support for the ferret in the field correction ferret in the sea we need those lights on there should be a group of switches maybe on your okay you found it great suddenly the sea was close floodlit the waves glittering the troughs running deep i used the controls moving into a turn bringing the aircraft into line with the swell thats great thats really great youre looking good now start checking your radioaltimeter the needle was at feet i could feel the weight of the aircraft under the controls the vibration in the seat as we lowered towards the waves the bulkheads creaking the bells sounding all the time from behind me a strap had broken somewhere and there were some cylinders loose sweat running on me suddenly a feeling of heat as the organism reacted chemically to what the mind knew how dyou feel fair to middling does this look all right okay get the nose up a little say five degrees can you do that feet on the radioaltimeter i pulled the control column back a bit felt the mass of the plane shift heard the bells loud now sounding the alarm not used to this aircraft the sea vanishing below the windscreen tilting back as i corrected jesus we were trim her back a little back a degree feet huge troughs in the black water the crests breaking foaming under the ashen light of the moon a big sea running nose up bring the nose up get it up now bring the whole aircraft slackening the crests breaking dead ahead through the windscreen the dark mouth of a trough opening and the screen going white as the foam was flung against it a shudder through the airframe and then a kind of silence a hole in the night where nothing happened then a second shudder and the bells ringing wildly back there as we hit water and the harness made a wall and i leaned into it and the sea broke over the screen and it blanked out and i stayed there with the deceleration forces clamping me against the straps nothing i could do if i moved couldnt move stayed there and waited the lights of the instrument panels swirling past my eyes and the sound of the jets dying and the sound of the sea taking over the waves rising under the cabin and dropping again and the wind bringing white water off the crests are you okay are you okay hit the harness release and got up got out of the seat the bells ringing back there the cylinders moving to the force of the waves now caught my foot on something the dead iranian tripped and crashed into the rear bulkhead and found the door and slid it open and heard a low screaming from the cabin gas escaping under pressure great pressure weve got to be quick very quick freezing water black and silver in the searchlight the blades above me chopping at the night as the machine lifted and the net cleared the sea and i swung free of its crests and darkness drew down across my eyes and i was aware only of a void that held me somewhere in it until i came to again and a mile away the black water broke to a blinding flash and a fireball rolled and billowed against the starfields blotting them out the end
