put them into this book for you as well as the friends you know so well the famous five chapter one easter holidays the nicest word in the english language is holidays said dick helping himself to a large spoonful of marmalade pass the toast anne mother do you feel downhearted to have us all tearing about the place again of course not said his mother the only thing that really worries me when holidays come is food food with a capital f we never seem to have enough in the house when all three of you are back and by the way does anyone know what has happened to the sausages that were in the larder sausages sausages let me think said julian frowning anne gave a sudden giggle she knew quite well what had happened well mother you said we could get our own meal last night as you were out said julian so we poked about and decided on sausages yes but julian two whole pounds of sausages said his mother i know georgina came over to spend the evening but even so she brought timmy said anne he rather likes sausages too mother well thats the last time i leave the larder door unlocked when i go out said her mother fancy cooking those lovely pork sausages for a dog especially timmy with his enormous appetite really anne i meant to have them for our lunch today well we rather thought wed go and spend the day at kirrin with george and timmy said dick thats if you dont want us for anything mother i do want you said his mother mrs layman is coming to tea and she said she wants to see you about something the three groaned and dick protested at once oh mother the first day of the holidays and we have to be in to tea its too bad a glorious spring day like this too oh well be in to tea all right said julian giving dick a sharp little kick under the table as he saw his mothers disappointed face mrs laymans a nice old thing she was always giving us little treats when we were little and she never forgets our birthdays said anne do you think we could ask george over too with timmy george will be awfully disappointed if we arent with her the first day of the hols yes of course you can said her mother go and ring her up now and arrange it and dont forget to put our old tibbycat into the shed with a saucer of milk shes scared stiff of timmy hes so enormous and please all of you try to look clean at teatime ill see to dick and anne said julian with a grin i must remember to find their overalls im going to phone george now this very minute said anne getting up from the table do you mind mother ive finished and id like to catch george before she takes tim for a walk or does some shopping for aunt fanny uncle quentin will be glad to be rid of george even for a meal said dick he fell over her lacrosse stick yesterday and wanted to know why she left her fishing net about george didnt know what he was talking about poor old georgina said his mother its a pity that both she and her father have exactly the same hot tempers her mother must find it dificult to keep the peace ah heres anne back again did you get george on the phone dear yes shes thrilled said anne she says its just as well were not going to spend the day with her because uncle quentin has lost some papers he was working on and hes turning the house upside down george said she will probably be mad as a hatter by the time she arrives this afternoon uncle quentin even made aunt fanny turn out her knitting bag to see if the papers were there dear old quentin said her mother such a truly brilliant scientist remembers every book hes ever read every paper hes ever written and has the finest brain i know and yet loses some valuable paper or other almost every week he loses something else every day of the week too said dick with a grin his temper poor old george shes always in some sort of trouble well anyway shes jolly glad to be coming over here said anne shes biking over with timmy shell be here for lunch is that all right mother of course said her mother now seeing that you had todays dinner for last nights supper youd better do a little shopping for me what shall we have sausages said everyone at once i should have thought you were quite literally fed up with sausages after last nights feast said their mother laughing all right sausages but timmy can have a bone a nice meaty bone i am not going to buy any more sausages for him thats quite certain and shall we get some nice cakes for tea as mrs layman is coming said anne or are you going to make some mother ill make a few buns said her mother and you can choose whatever else you like so long as you dont buy up the shop the three went off shopping cycling along the lane to the village it was a truly lovely spring day the celandines were golden in the ditches and daisies were scattered everywhere dick burst into song as they went and the cows in the nearby fields lifted their heads in surprise as dicks loud voice swept round them anne laughed it was good to be with her brothers again she missed them very much when she was at school and now they would have almost a whole month together with their cousin george too she was suddenly overwhelmed with joy and lifted up her voice and joined dick in his singing her brothers looked at her with affection and amusement good old anne said dick youre such a quiet little mouse its nice to hear you singing so loudly i am not a quiet little mouse said anne surprised and rather hurt whatever makes you say that you just wait you may get a surprise one day yes we may said julian but i doubt it a mouse cant suddenly turn into a tiger anyway one tigers enough george is the tiger of our family my word she can put out her claws all right and roar and ramp and rave everyone laughed at the picture of george as a tiger dick wobbled as he laughed and his front wheel touched annes back wheel she turned round fiercely look out idiot you nearly had me over cant you see where youre going be sensible cant you hey anne whatevers the matter said julian amazed to hear his gentle little sister lashing out so suddenly anne laughed its all right i was just being a tiger for a moment putting out my claws i thought dick and you might like to see them well well said dick riding beside her ive never heard you yell like that before surprising but quite pleasing what about you showing old george your claws sometime when she gets out of hand stop teasing said anne heres the butchers for goodness sake go and get the sausages and be sensible ill go and buy the cakes the bakers shop was full of newmade buns and cakes and smelt deliciously of homemade bread anne enjoyed herself choosing a vast selection after all she thought there will be eight of us counting timmy and if were all hungry cakes soon disappear the boys were very pleased to see all the paper bags looks like a good tea today said dick i hope the old lady whats her name now layman whos coming to tea today has a good appetite i wonder what shes going to tell us about did you buy a nice meaty bone for timmy asked anne hell like that for his tea we bought such a beauty that im pretty sure mother will say its good enough to make soup from said dick with a grin so ill keep it in my saddlebag till he comes dear old tim he deserves a jolly good bone best dog i ever knew hes been on a lot of adventures with us said anne bicycling beside the boys as the road was empty and he seemed to enjoy them all yes so did we said dick well who knows an adventure may be lying in wait for us these hols too i seem to smell one in the air you dont said anne youre just making that up id like a bit of peace after a hectic term at school i worked jolly hard this last term well you were top of your form and captain of games so you deserve to have the kind of holiday you like said julian proud of his young sister and so you shall adventures are out do you hear that dick we keep absolutely clear of them so thats that is it ju said anne laughing well well see chapter two a visitor to tea george and timmy were waiting for julian dick and anne when they arrived home timmy was standing in the road ears pricked long tail waving he went quite mad when he saw their bicycles rounding the corner and galloped towards them at top speed barking madly much to the horror of a bakers boy with a large basket the boy disappeared into the nearest garden at top speed yelling mad dog mad dog timmy tore past and forced the three to dismount for they were afraid of knocking him over dear timmy said anne patting the excited dog do put your tongue in im sure it will fall out some day timmy ran to each of them in turn woofing in delight licking everyone and altogether behaving as if he hadnt seen them for a year now thats enough old boy said dick pushing him away and trying to mount his bicycle once more after all we did see you yesterday wheres george george had heard timmy barking and had now run out into the road too the three cycled up to her and she grinned happily at them hallo youve been shopping i see shut up barking timmy you talk too much sorry you couldnt come over to kirrin cottage but im jolly glad you asked me to come to you my father still hasnt found the papers hes lost and honestly our place is like a madhouse cupboards being turned out even the kitchen storecupboard and i left poor mother up in the loft looking there though why father should think they might be there i dont know poor old george i can just see your father tearing his hair and shouting and all the time hes probably put the papers into the wastepaper basket by mistake said dick with a chuckle gracious we never thought of that said george id better phone mother at once and tell her to look bright idea of yours dick well you go and phone and well put our bikes away said julian take your nose away from that bag of sausages timmy youre in disgrace over sausages let me tell you youre suspected of eating too many last night he did eat rather a lot said george i took my eye off him and he wolfed quite a few i say whos this mrs layman whos coming to tea have we got to stay in and have tea with her i hoped we might be going off for a picnic this afternoon nothing doing old thing said dick mrs layman is apparently coming to talk to us about something so we have to be in with clean hands nice manners and everything so behave yourself george george gave him a friendly punch thats unfair said dick you know i cant punch you back my word you should have seen anne this morning george yelled at me like a tiger howling and showed her teeth and dont be an idiot dick said anne he called me a mouse george he said wed one tiger you and that was enough in the family so i went for him put out my claws for a moment and gave him such a surprise i rather liked it good old anne said george amused but youre not really cut out to be a tiger and rage and roar you know i could be if i had to said anne obstinately one of these days ill surprise you all you just wait all right we will said julian putting his arm round his sister come on now wed better get indoors before timmy gets some of the cakes out of the bags stop licking that bag tim youll make a hole in it he can smell the cherry buns inside said anne shall i give him one no said julian cherry buns are wasted on him you know that dont you remember how he chews the bun part and spits out the cherries woof said timmy exactly as if he agreed he went to sniff at the bag with his bone inside thats your dinner tim said anne plenty of meat on it too look theres mother at the window beckoning i expect she wants the sausages no timmy the sausages are not for you get down good gracious i never in my life knew such a hungry dog anybody would think you starved him george well theyd think wrong then said george timmy come to heel timmy came still looking round longingly at the various bags that the others were now taking from their saddlebags they all went indoors and deposited the goods on the kitchen table the cook opened the bags and looked inside keeping a sharp eye on timmy better take that dog of yours out of my kitchen she said funny how sausages always disappear when hes around get down now take your paws off my clean table timmy trotted out of the kitchen he thought it was a pity that cooks didnt like him he liked them very much indeed they always smelt so deliciously of cooking and there were always so many titbits around which he longed for but was seldom offered ah well hed trot into the kitchen again when cookie had gone upstairs for something he might perhaps find a few bits and pieces on the floor then hallo georgina dear said her aunt coming into the kitchen timmy following her in delight timmy go out of the kitchen i dont trust you within a mile of sausages go on shoo timmy shooed he liked annes mother but knew that when she said shoo she meant it he lay down on a rug in the livingroom with a heavy sigh wondering how long it would be before he had that lovely meaty bone he put his head on his paws and kept his ears pricked for george he thought it most unfair that george shouldnt be shooed out of the kitchen too now for goodness sake keep out of my way while i cook the lunch said cook to the children milling round her kitchen and shut the door please i dont want that great hungry dog sniffing round me all the time making out hes starving when hes as fat as butter hes not said george indignantly timmy has never been fat in his life hes not that kind of dog hes never greedy well he must be the first dog ever born that wasnt greedy said cookie cant trust any of them there was that pugdog of mrs lanes crunched up lumps of sugar whenever it could reach a sugarbowl and that fat poodle next door came and knocked over the cream that the milkman left outside the back door deliberated knocked it over mark you and then licked up every drop ha his mistress tried to make out he didnt like cream but you should have seen his nose covered in cream up to his eyes timmy looked in at the kitchen door his nose in the air for all the world as if he were deeply offended at cookies remarks julian laughed youve wounded his pride cookie he said ill wound him somewhere else too if he comes sniffing round me when im cooking said cookie that made george give one of her scowls but the others couldnt help laughing the morning went very pleasantly the five went down to the beach and walked round the high cliffs enjoying the stiff breeze that blew in their faces timmy raced after every seagull that dared to sit on the smooth sand annoyed that each one rose up lazily on great wings as soon as he almost reached it they were all hungry for their dinner and not one single morsel was left when they had finished cookie had made a tremendous steamed pudding with lashings of treacle which was as usual a huge success wish i had a tongue like timmys and could lick up the lovely treacle left on the bottom of the dish said george such a waste you certainly wont be able to eat any tea im sure of that said her aunt but of course she was wrong when teatime came they all felt quite ready for it and were most impatient when mrs layman was late the tea looked lovely laid on a big table over a white lace cloth the children sat and looked at it longingly when would mrs layman arrive i begin to feel im not going to like mrs layman said george at last i cant bear looking at those cream cakes when im hungry the front door bell rang hurrah then in came a cheerful smiling old lady nodding to everyone very pleased to see such a nice little party waiting for her this is mrs layman children said julians mother sit down mrs layman were delighted to have you well ive come to ask the children something said mrs layman but well have tea first and then ill say what ive come to say my my what a wonderful tea im glad i feel hungry everyone else was hungry too and soon the bread and butter the sandwiches the buns the cakes and everything else disappeared timmy sat quietly by george who slipped him a titbit now and again when no one was looking mrs layman chatted away she was a most interesting person and the children liked her very much well now she said when tea was finished im sure you must be wanting to know why i asked to come to tea today i wanted to ask your mother julian if there was any chance of you three and this other boy here whats his name george would you like to help me out of a difficulty nobody pointed out that george was a girl not a boy and that george was short for georgina george as usual was pleased to be taken for a boy they all looked at mrs layman listening to her with interest its like this she said ive a dear little house up on the hills overlooking the harbour and ive a grandson staying with me there wilfrid well i have to go to look after a cousin of mine whos ill and wilfrid cant bear to be left alone i just wondered if your mother would allow you children to share the little house with wilfrid and well keep him company he feels a bit scary being on his own ive a good woman there who comes in to cook and clean but poor wilfrids really scared of being in such a lonely place high up on the hill you mean that lovely little house with the wonderful view said julians mother yes its rather primitive in some ways no water laid on only just a well to use and no electricity or gas just candles or an oil lamp maybe it sounds too oldfashioned for words but honestly the view makes up for it perhaps the children would like to come over and see it before they decide mrs layman looked earnestly round at everyone and nobody knew quite what to say well well certainly come and see it said julians mother and if the children feel like it well they can stay there they do like being on their own of course yes said julian well come and see it mrs layman mothers going to be busy with a bazaar soon shell be glad to get us out of the way and of course we do like being on our own mrs layman looked extremely pleased tomorrow then she said about ten oclock youll love the view wonderful wonderful you can see right over the great harbour and for miles around well i must be going now ill tell wilfrid you children may be keeping him company hes such a nice lad so helpful youll love him julian had his doubts about the nice helpful wilfrid he even wondered if mrs layman wanted to get away from wilfrid and leave him to himself no that was too silly anyway theyd soon see what the place was like tomorrow it would be fun to be on our own again said george when mrs layman had gone i dont expect this wilfrid would be any bother hes probably just a silly kid scared of being left alone though apparently there is a woman there well well go tomorrow maybe the view will make up for dear wilfrid chapter three the cottage on the hill and wilfrid next day the children prepared to go and see the cottage belonging to mrs layman you coming too mother asked julian wed like your advice well no dear said his mother ive rather a lot to do theres a meeting on at the village hall and i promised to go to it youre full of good works mother said julian giving her a hug all right well go by ourselves i daresay we shall know at once whether wed like to stay in the cottage or not also we must know what this wilfrid is like its a quarter to ten and george is already here with timmy ill call the others and well get our bikes soon the four were on their bicycles with timmy as usual running alongside his long tongue out his eyes bright and happy this was timmys idea of perfect happiness to be with the four children all day long they went along a road that ran on the top of a hill they swung round a corner and there spread far below them was a great seavista that included a wonderful harbour filled with big and little ships the sea was as blue as the mediterranean quite breathtaking anne jumped off her bicycle at once i must just feast my eyes on all this before i go a yard further she said what a panorama what miles of sea and sky she put her bicycle against a gate and then climbed over and stood by herself gazing down at the view dick joined her then suddenly a voice shouted loudly fore fore a small white thing came whizzing through the air and landed just by annes foot she jumped in surprise its a golfball said dick no dont pick it up whoevers playing with it has to come and hit it from exactly where it fell good thing you werent hit anne i didnt realize that this gate led on to a golfcourse we ought to have a walk over it said anne just look at those gorse bushes over there absolutely flaming with yellow blossom and all the tiny flowers springing up everywhere speedwell and coltsfoot and daisies and celandines beautiful and oh what a view yes and if mrs laymans cottage has a view anything like this id certainly like to stay there said dick think of getting out of bed in the morning and seeing this enormous view out of the window the harbour the sea beyond the hills all round the great spread of sky you ought to be a poet dick said anne in surprise the golfers came up at that moment and the children stood aside and watched one of them address the ball and then strike it easily and strongly the ball soared through the air and landed far away on a smooth green fairway good shot said the mans partner and the two sauntered off together funny game really said anne just hitting a ball all round the course wish i had some clubs said dick im sure i could hit some smashing shots well if that cottage is anywhere near the golfcourse perhaps you could pay to have a lesson said anne i bet you could hit a ball as far as that man the others were now yelling for them to come back so they went to fetch their bicycles soon they were all riding along the road again we have to look for a small white gate with hill cottage painted on it said george on the hillside facing the sea there it is cried anne well pile our bicycles together against the hedge and go in at the gate they left their bicycles in a heap and went through the gate not far to their left stood a funny old cottage its back to them its front looking down the steep hill that ran towards the great harbour and the sea beyond its like a cottage out of an old fairytale said anne funny little chimneys rather crooked walls a thatched roof all uneven and what tiny windows they walked down a little winding path that led to the cottage they soon came to a well and leaned over it to see the water deep down so thats the water wed have to drink said anne wrinkling up her nose and wed have to let down the bucket by winding this handle and down it would go on the rope do you suppose the water is pure well seeing that people must have drunk it for years on end the ones living in that cottage anyway i should imagine its all right said julian come on lets find the front door of the cottage if it has one it had one wooden door hung rather crooked with an old brass knocker it faced down the hill and was flanked on each side by small windows two other small windows were above julian looked at them the bedrooms would be very small he thought would there really be room for them all he knocked at the door nobody came to open it he knocked again and then looked for a bell but there wasnt one see if the door is unlocked said anne so julian turned the handle and at once the door gave under his hand it opened straight into a room that looked like a kitchenlivingroom julian gave a shout anyone at home there was no answer well as this is obviously the cottage we were meant to see wed better go in said julian and in they all went it was old very old the carved wooden furniture was old too ancient oil lamps stood on two tables in the room and in a recess there was an oilstove with a saucepan on top a narrow crooked stairway made of wood curved up to the floor above julian went up and found himself in a long darkish room its roof thatched with reed and held up by black beams this place must be hundreds of years old he called down to the others i dont think its big enough for us four and the others too the cook and that boy called wilfrid just as he finished calling down the stairs the front door was flung open and someone came in what are you doing here he shouted this is my cottage julian went quickly down the stairs and there facing them all stood a boy of about ten a scowl on his brown face er are you wilfrid by any chance asked dick politely yes i am and who are you and wheres my aunt shell soon chuck you out said the boy is your aunt mrs layman asked julian if so she asked us to come and see her cottage and decide if wed like to keep you company she said she had to go away and look after a sick friend well i dont want you said the boy so clear off im all right here alone my aunts a nuisance always fussing round i thought there was a cook too said julian where is she she only comes in the morning and i sent her off said wilfrid she left me some food i want to be alone i dont want you so clear off dont be a fathead wilfrid said julian you cant live all alone here youre just a kid i shant be living all alone ive plenty of friends said wilfrid defiantly you cant have plenty of friends here in this lonely place with only the hills and sky around you said dick well i have said wilfrid and heres one so look out and to the horror of the two girls he put his hand into his pocket and brought out a snake anne screamed and tried to hide behind julian wilfrid saw her fright and came towards her holding the snake by its middle so that it swayed to and fro its bright little eyes gleaming dont be scared anne said julian its only a harmless grasssnake put the creature back into your pocket wilfrid and dont play the fool if that snake is the only friend you have youll be pretty lonely here by yourself ive plenty of friends i tell you shouted wilfrid stuffing the snake back into his pocket ill hit you if you dont believe me oh no you wont said dick just show us your other friends if theyre kids like you its just too bad kids i dont make friends with kids said wilfrid scornfully ill show you im speaking the truth come out here on the hillside and see some of my other friends they all trooped out of the little cottage on to the hillside amazed at this fierce strange boy when they were in the open they saw that he had eyes as bright blue as the speedwell in the grass and hair almost as yellow as the celandines sit down and keep quiet he ordered over there by that bush and dont move a finger ill soon make you believe in my friends how dare you come here doubting my word they all sat down obediently beside the gorsebush puzzled and rather amused the boy sat down too and drew something out of his pocket what was it george tried to see but it was halfhidden in his right hand he put it to his mouth and began to whistle it was a soft weird whistle that grew loud and then died away again there was no tune no melody just a kind of beautiful dirge that pulled at the heart sad thought anne such a sad little tune if you could call it a tune something stirred a little way down the hill and then to everyones astonishment an animal appeared a hare its great ears stood upright its big eyes stared straight at the boy with the curious little pipe then the hare lollopped right up to wilfrid and began to dance soon another came but this one only watched the first one then seemed to go mad and leapt about wildly utterly unafraid the tune changed a little and a rabbit appeared then another and another one came to wilfrids feet and sniffed at them its whiskers quivering then it lay down against the boys foot a bird fiew down a beautiful magpie it stood nearby watching the hare fascinated it took no notice of the children at all they all held their breath amazed and delighted and then timmy gave a little growl deep down in his throat he didnt really mean to but he just couldnt help it at once the hares the rabbits and the magpie fled the magpie squawking in fright wilfrid faced round at once his eyes blazing he lifted his hand to strike timmy but george caught his fist at once let go yelled wilfrid that dog scared my friends ill get a stick and whip him hes the worst dog in the world hes and then something strange happened timmy came gently over to wilfrid lay down and put his head on the angry boys knee looking up at him lovingly the boy his hand still raised to strike lowered it and fondled timmys head making a curious crooning noise timmy come here ordered george amazed and angry to think that her dog her very own dog should go to a boy who had been about to strike him timmy stood up gave wilfrid a lick and went to george the boy watched him and then spoke to them all you can come and stay in my cottage he said if youll bring that dog too there arent many dogs like him hes a wonderful dog id like him for one of my friends then without another word wilfrid sprang up and ran away down the hill leaving four most astonished people and a dog who whined dismally because the boy had gone well well timmy there must indeed by something about that boy if you stand looking after him as if you had lost one of your very best friends chapter four settling in the five stared after wilfrid in silence timmy wagged his tail and whined he wanted the boy to come back well thank you timmy old thing said anne patting the big dog on the head we certainly wouldnt have had this lovely little cottage with its incredible view if you hadnt made friends with wilfrid what a funny boy he is jolly queer i think said george still amazed at the way that timmy had gone to wilfrid when the boy had been about to strike him im not sure that i like him dont be an ass george said dick who had been very much impressed by the boys handling of the hares the rabbits and the magpie that boy must have a wonderful love for animals they would never come to him as they did if they didnt trust him absolutely anyone who loves animals as he does must be pretty decent i bet i could make them come to me if i had that pipe said george making up her mind to borrow it if she could anne went back into the cottage she was delighted with it it must be very very old she thought it stands dreaming here all day long full of memories of the people who have lived here and loved it and how they must all have loved this view miles and miles of heather great stretches of sea and the biggest highest widest sky ive ever seen its a happy place even the clouds seem happy theyre scurrying along so white against the blue she explored the cottage thoroughly she decided that the room above under the thatch should be for the three boys there were two mattresses one small one larger the little one for wilfrid the big one for dick and julian she thought and i and george can sleep down in the livingroom with tim on guard i wonder if there are any rugs we could sleep on ah wait a bit this couch is a pullout bed just right for us two girls good anne enjoyed herself thoroughly this was the kind of problem she liked fixing up this and that for the others she found a little larder facing north it had a few tins in it and a jug of milk slightly sour it also had two loaves of extremely stale bread and a tin of rather hard cakes mrs layman doesnt seem to be a very good housekeeper for herself and wilfrid thought anne seriously well have to go down to the village and put in a stock of decent food i might get a small ham the boys would like that goodness this is going to be fun julian came to the door to see what she was doing when he saw her happy serious face he chuckled acting mother to us as usual he said deciding whos going to sleep where and which of us is to do the shopping and which the washingup dear old anne what should we do without you when we go off on our own i love it said anne happily julian we need another rug or two and a pillow and some food and well well have to go back home and collect a few clothes and other things said julian we can shop on the way back and get whatever we want i wonder if that woman that mrs layman spoke about will be coming in to help well wilfrid said he sent her off said anne and i think perhaps as the cottage is so small it might be better if we managed it ourselves i think i could do a bit of cooking on that oilstove in the corner and anyway we can pretty well live on cold stuff you know ham and salad and potted meat and fruit it would be easy enough for any of us to pop down to the village on our bikes to fetch anything we needed listen said julian cocking his head to one side is that somebody calling us yes it was when julian went outside he saw mrs layman at the gate that led on to the hillside where the cottage stood he went over to her we love the cottage he said and if its all right wed like to move in today we can easily pop home and bring back anything we want its a glorious old place isnt it and the view must be the finest anywhere well that harbour is the second biggest stretch of water in the whole world said mrs layman the only stretch that is any bigger is sydney harbour so you have something to feast your eyes on julian my word yes said julian its amazing and so very blue i only wish i could paint but i cant at least not very well what about wilfrid said mrs layman anxiously is he behaving himself hes well hes rather a dificult boy at times and he can be very rude he hasnt any brothers to rub off his awkward corners you see oh dont you worry about wilfrid said julian cheerfully hell have to toe the line and do as hes told we all do our bit when were away together hes a wonder with animals isnt he well yes i suppose he is said mrs layman though i cant say i like pet snakes or pet beetles and owls that come and hoot down the chimney at night to find out if wilfrid will go out and hoot back to them julian laughed we shant mind that he said and hes managed to get over what might have been our biggest difficulty he has made friends with our dog timmy in fact he informed us that if timmy stayed we could all stay but only if timmy stayed mrs layman laughed thats so like wilfrid she said hes an odd boy dont stand any nonsense from him we shant said julian cheerfully im surprised he wants to stay on with us actually i should have thought he would rather go home than be with a lot of strangers he cant go home said mrs layman his sister has measles and his mother doesnt want wilfrid to catch it so youll have to put up with him i fear and hell have to put up with us said julian thanks very much for letting us have the cottage mrs layman well take great care of everything i know you will said the old lady well goodbye julian have a good time ill get back to my car now give wilfrid my love i hope he doesnt fill the cottage with animals of all kinds we shant mind if he does said julian and waited politely until mrs layman had disappeared and he could hear the noise of a car starting up he went back to the cottage and stood outside looking down at the amazing view the harbour was full of boats big and little a steamer went busily along making for a great seaside town far away on the other side anne came to join julian glorious isnt it she said were so very high up here that it seems as if we can see half the world at our feet is that an island in the middle of the harbour ju yes and a wellwooded one too said julian i wonder what its called and who lives there i cant see a single house there can you dick called to anne anne george and i are going to fetch our bikes and ride down to the village give us your shopping list will you julian is there anything special you want us to pack for you at home and bring back besides your nightthings and a change of clothes yes dont go off yet called julian hurrying into the cottage ive made a list somewhere i think id better go with you there will be food and other things to bring back unless mother would bring everything up by car this afternoon yes thats a good idea said dick well go to kirrin cottage first and get georges things and then home to get ours ill leave all the shopping with mother and all our luggage so that she can pop up here in the car with it shell love the view ill stay behind and tidy up the cottage and find out how the stove works said anne happily ill have everything neat and tidy by the time mother comes this afternoon dick oh heres julian with the list why dont you go off on your bike with george and dick julian ill be quite happy here messing about yes im going to said julian putting his list into his pocket look after yourself anne well take timmy with us to give him a run off went the three timmy loping behind very glad of the run anne waited till they were out of sight then went happily back to the cottage she was almost there when she heard someone calling her she turned and saw a freshfaced woman waving im sally she called do you want any help with the cooking and cleaning wilfrid told me not to come any more but if you want me i will oh i think we can manage sally said anne theres so many of us now we can do all the jobs did you sleep here oh no miss said sally coming up i just came in to help and then went back home you tell me if you want me any time and ill gladly come wheres that monkey of a wilfrid he spoke to me very rudely this morning the young varmint ill tell his grandmother of him not that thats much good he just laughs at her dont you stand any nonsense from him i wont said anne smiling where do you live in case we do want you just the other side of the road in the small wood there said sally youll see my tiny cottage when you go by the wood on your bikes she disappeared up the hill and across the road there anne went back happily to her household tasks she cleaned out the little larder and then found a pail and went to the well she hung the pail on the hook at the end of the rope and then worked the old handle that let the pail down to the water swinging on the rope splash it was soon full and anne wound it up again the water looked crystal clear and was as cold as ice but all the same anne wondered if she ought to boil it someone came quietly behind her and jumped at her with a loud howl anne dropped the pail of water and gave a scream then she saw it was wilfrid dancing round her grinning idiot she said now you just go and get me some more water wheres that big dog demanded wilfrid looking all round i cant see him you cant any of you stay here unless you have that dog i like him hes a wonderful dog hes gone down to the village with the others said anne now will you please pick up that pail and get more water no i wont said wilfrid im not your servant get it yourself very well i will but ill tell george who owns timmy how rude you are and you may be quite sure that timmy wont be friends with you said anne picking up the pail ill get the water ill get the water shouted wilfrid and snatched the pail dont you dare to tell george or timmy tales of me dont you dare and off he went to the well and filled the pail well what a time they were all going to have with such a very peculiar boy anne didnt like him at all chapter five wilfrid is most annoying and anne is most surprising wilfrid brought back the pail to anne and dumped it down like to see my pet beetles he said no thank you said anne i dont like beetles very much well you ought to said wilfrid ive two very beautiful ones you can hold them if you like their tiny feet feel very queer when they walk all over your hand i dont mind beetles but i dont want them walking over my hand said poor anne who really was a bit afraid of what she called creepycrawly things do get out of my way wilfrid if you had any manners youd carry that pail indoors for me i havent any manners said wilfrid everybody tells me that anyway i dont want to carry your pail if you dont want to see my beetles oh go away said anne exasperated picking up the pail herself wilfrid went to a little thick bush and sat down by it he put his face almost on the grass and looked under the bush anne felt uncomfortable was he going to call his beetles out she couldnt help putting down her pail and standing still to watch no beetles came out from under the bush but something else did a very large awkwardlooking toad came crawling out and sat there looking up at wilfrid with the greatest friendliness anne was amazed how did wilfrid know the toad was there and why in the world should it come out to see him she stood and stared and shivered because she really did not like toads i know they have beautiful eyes and are intelligent and eat all kinds of harmful insects but i just cant go near one she thought oh goodness wilfrids tickling its back and its scratching where hes tickled it just like we would come and say how do you do to my pet toad called wilfrid ill carry your pail for you then anne picked up her pail in a hurry afraid that wilfrid might whistle up a few snakes next what a boy how she wished the others would come back why wilfrid might own a boa constrictor or have a small crocodile somewhere or but no she was being silly if only the others would come back to her horror the toad crawled right on to wilfrids hand and looked up at him out of its really beautiful eyes that was too much for anne she fied into the cottage spilling half the water as she went i wish i was like george she thought she wouldnt really mind that toad im silly i ought to try and like all creatures oh my goodness look at that enormous spider in the corner of the sink its sitting there looking at me out of its eight eyes wilfrid wilfrid please come and get this spider out of the sink for me wilfrid sauntered in fortunately without the toad he held his hand out to the spider and made a curious clicking ticking noise the spider perked up at once waved two curious little antennae about and crawled across the sink to wilfrids hand anne shuddered she simply couldnt help it she shut her eyes and when she opened them the spider had gone and so had wilfrid i suppose hes now teaching it to dance or something she thought trying to make herself smile i cant think how insects and animals and birds like him i simply cant bear him if i were a rabbit or bird or beetle id run miles away from him whats this curious attraction he has for creatures of all kinds wilfrid had completely disappeared and anne thankfully went on with her little jobs ill tidy up the loft where the boys will sleep she thought ill wash this livingroom floor ill make a list of the things in the larder ill clean that dirty window over there ill good gracious whats that noise it was the sound of magpies chattering noisily a harsh but pleasant noise anne peered out of the little cottage window well what a sight there stood wilfrid in front of the window a magpie on each outstretched hand and one on the top of his head it stood there chattering loudly and then turned round and round getting its feet mixed up in the boys thick hair come out here and ill tell one of my magpies to sit on your head too shouted wilfrid its such a nice feeling or would you like a young rabbit to cuddle i can call one for you with my little pipe i dont want a magpie on my head said anne desperately for goodness sake get a nice little baby rabbit id like that wilfrid jerked the magpies off his hands and shook his head violently so that the third one flew up squawking cheerfully he then sat down and pulled out his queer little whistlepipe as anne called it she watched fascinated as the strange little dirgelike tune came to her ears she found her feet walking to the door good gracious could there be some peculiar kind of magic in that pipe that made her go to wilfrid just as the other creatures did she stopped at the door just as a baby rabbit came lollopping round a tall clump of grass it was the funniest roundest dearest little thing with a tiny bobtail and big ears it went straight to wilfrid and nestled against him the boy stroked it and murmured to it then he called to anne softly well heres the baby rabbit you asked for like to come and stroke it anne went softly over the grass expecting the rabbit to bolt at once wilfrid continued to fondle it and the little thing looked at him with big unwinking eyes anne bent down to stroke it but immediately it leapt in fright and fled into the grass oh dear why did it do that said anne disappointed it was quite all right with you wilfrid how do you get all these creatures to come to you shant tell you said wilfrid getting up is there anything to eat in the cottage im hungry he pushed anne aside and went into the cottage he opened the larder door and took down a tin there was a cake inside and he cut off a huge piece he didnt offer anne any couldnt you have cut me a piece too said anne you really are a rude boy i like being rude said wilfrid munching his cake especially to people who come to my cottage when i dont want them oh dont be so silly said anne exasperated it isnt your cottage it belongs to your grandmother she told us so anyway you said we could stay if timmy stayed too ill soon make timmy my dog said wilfrid taking another bite youll see soon he wont want that girl george any more and hell follow at my heels all day and night youll see anne laughed scornfully timmy following at this boys heels that could never happen timmy loved george with all his doggy heart he would never desert her for wilfrid no matter how much he whistled on pipes or put on his special croony voice anne was absolutely certain of that if you laugh at me ill call up my grass snake and my adder said wilfrid fiercely then youll run for miles oh no i wont said anne hurrying into the cottage just watch yourself run she picked up the pail of water went out with it and threw it all over the astonished wilfrid somebody else was most astonished too and that was julian who had arrived back before the others anxious not to leave anne alone in the cottage for too long he came just in time to see anne drenching wilfrid and stared in the utmost amazement anne behaving like that anne looking really fierce quiet peaceful anne what in the world had happened anne he called whats the matter whats wilfrid been doing oh julian said anne glad to see him but horrified that he had come just then wilfrid was drenched from head to foot he stood there gasping takenaback bewildered why anne had seemed such a quiet frightened little thing scared even of a spider that girl said wilfrid halfchoking shaking the water off himself that bad wicked girl shes like a tiger she sprang at me and threw the water all over me i wont let her stay in my cottage the boy was so angry so wet so takenaback that julian had to laugh he roared in delight and clapped anne on the back the mouse has turned into a tiger well you said you might one day anne and you havent lost much time let me see if youve grown claws he took annes hands and pretended to examine her nails anne was halflaughing halfcrying now and pulled her hand away oh julian i shouldnt have soaked wilfrid but he was so irritating i lost my temper and all right all right its quite a good thing to do sometimes said julian and i bet young wilfrid deserved all he got i only hope the water was icy cold have you a change of clothes here wilfrid go and get into them then the boy stood there dripping wet and made no effort to obey julian spoke again you heard what i said wilfrid jump to it go and change the boy looked so wet and miserable that anne felt suddenly sorry for what she had done she ran to him and felt his wet shoulders oh im sorry she said i truly am i dont know why i turned into a tiger so suddenly wilfrid gave a little halflaugh halfsob im sorry too he mumbled youre nice and your nose is like that baby rabbits its its a bit woffly he ran into the cottage and slammed the door let him be for a while said julian seeing that anne made a move to go after him this will do him good nothing like having a pail of cold water flung over you to make you see things as they really are he was really touched when you said you were sorry hes probably never apologized to anyone in his life is my nose like a rabbits said anne worried well yes just a bit said julian giving his sister an affectionate pat but a rabbits nose is very nice you know very nice indeed i dont think youll have much trouble with wilfrid after this little episode he didnt know that you had the heart of a tiger as well as a nose like a rabbits wilfrid came out of the cottage in about ten minutes dressed in dry clothes carrying his wet ones in a bundle ill hang those out on the bushes for you to dry in the sun said anne and took them from him smiling he suddenly smiled back thanks he said i dont know how they got so wet must have been pouring with rain julian chuckled and smacked him gently on the back rain can do an awful lot of good at times he said well anne weve brought you back a whole lot of goods for your larder here come the others well carry everything in for you with wilfrids help too chapter six lucas and his tale it was fun storing all the shopping away anne enjoyed it more than anyone for she really was a most domesticated little person a real homemaker said dick appreciatively when he saw how neat and comfortable she had made the loft where the three boys were to sleep just about room for the three of us plus all the baggage in the corner and how good the larder looks anne looked at her wellstored larder and smiled now she could give her little family really nice meals all those tins she read the names on them fruit salad tinned pears tinned peaches sardines ham tongue a new cake in that round tin big enough to last for at least three days biscuits chocolate wafers good old julian he knew how much she loved those and george did too anne felt very happy as she arranged all her goods she no longer felt guilty at drenching poor wilfrid indeed she couldnt help feeling a little thrill when she remembered how she had suddenly turned into a tiger for a minute or two it was fun to be a tiger for once i might even be one again if the chance arose thought anne how surprised wilfrid was and julian too oh dear poor wilfrid still hes much nicer now and indeed he was he was most polite to both the girls and as dick said he didnt throw his weight about nearly so much they all settled down very well together in the little cottage they had most of their meals outofdoors sitting on the warm grass it was rather a squeeze indoors for the cottage really was very small anne enjoyed herself preparing the meals with sometimes a little help from george and the boys carried everything out wilfrid did his share and was pleased when he had a clap on the back from julian it was glorious sitting out in the sun high up on their hill they could look down on the harbour watch the yachts and the busy little boats and enjoy the wonderful views all round george was very curious about the island that lay in the middle of the harbour whats it called she asked wilfrid but he didnt know he did know however that there was a queer story about it it belonged to a lonely old man he said he lived in a big house in the very middle of the wood the island was given to his family by a king james the second i think this old man was the very very last one of his family people kept wanting to buy his island and he had some kind of watchmen to keep people from landing on it these watchmen were pretty fierce they had guns gosh did they shoot people who tried to land then asked dick well they shot just to frighten them off not to hurt them i suppose said wilfrid anyway a lot of sightseers had an awful fright when they tried to land bangbang shooting all round them my granny told me that someone she knew who had a lot of money wanted to buy part of the island and he had his hat shot right off when his boat tried to land is there anyone there now asked julian i suppose the old fellow is dead has he a son or anyone to follow him i dont think so said wilfrid but i dont know an awful lot about it i tell you who does though one of the groundsmen on the golfcourse called lucas he was once one of the watchmen who kept visitors away from the island it might be rather interesting to talk to him said dick id rather like to walk over the golfcourse too my father plays a good game of golf and i know something about it well lets go now said george timmy is longing for a good long walk even though he ran all the way down to the village and back today walk timmy walk woofwoof said timmy and leapt up at once walk of course he was ready for a walk he leapt all round george pretending to pounce at her feet wilfrid tried to catch hold of him but couldnt i wish you were my dog he told timmy id never let you out of my sight timmy ran up to him then and gave him a loving lick it was astonishing how he seemed to like wilfrid nobody could understand it as george said timmy is usually so particular about making friends still wilfrid is nicer than he was the five with wilfrid too went up the hill crossed over the road that ran along the top and climbed over a stile they found themselves on one of the fairways of the golfcourse not far from a green in which stood a pole with a bright red flag waving at the top wilfrid knew very little about the game of golf but the others had watched their parents play many a time look out someones going to pitch his ball on this green said julian and they stood by the hedge to watch the man play his ball he struck it beautifully with his club and the ball rose and fell right on to the green it rolled to within about a foot of the hole in which the flagpole stood timmy ran forward a few steps as he always did when a ball rolled near him then he remembered that this was golf and he must never never touch a ball on the fairway or on the green the players passed by and went on with their game then they disappeared to play off another tee well lets see if we can find lucas now said wilfrid crossing the fairway to where he could get a good look over the course youll like him theres not much he doesnt know about the animals and birds here i think hes a wonderful man wilfrid stood on the slope of a hill and looked all round there he is he said pointing to where a man was trimming up a ditch see down there hes using his billhook to make things tidy they went down the hill towards the ditch at the bottom i bet theres an awful lot of balls in that ditch said wilfrid hey lucas how are you afternoon young sir said the groundsman turning towards them his face was as brown as a wellripened nut and his arms and shoulders were even browner he wore no shirt or vest and his dark deepset eyes twinkled as they took in the five children and the dog he held out a brown hand to timmy who licked it gravely wagging his tail then timmy smelt lucas all over and finally lay down with his head on the mans feet ha said lucas to timmy and gave a loud hearty laugh think im agoing to stand here all afternoon do you well i arent i got work to do ole dog so git up youre a right goodun you are alaying on my foot sos i cant move a step want me to stop and have a rest dont you lucas we came to ask you something said wilfrid about the island in the harbour whats its name and does anyone live there now we can see it from that little cottage almost at the top of the hill on the other side of the road said dick it looks awfully quiet and lonely and so it is said lucas sitting down on the bank of the ditch timmy at once sat up beside him sniffing him with pleasure he put his arm round the dog and began to talk his bright eyes going from one to other of the children he was so friendly and so completely natural that the children felt he was an old old friend they sat down too sniffing the smell of the gorse bushes nearby they smell like coconut thought anne yes just like coconut well now said lucas that islands always been a mysteryplace its called wailing island by some folks because the wind makes a right queer wailing noise round some of its high cliffs and others call it whispering island because its full of trees that whisper in the strong winds that always blow across it but most of us call it keepaway island and thats the best name of all for theres never been any welcome there what with the dark cliffs the cruel rocks and the dense woods lucas paused and looked at the listening faces around him he was a born storyteller and knew it how often wilfrid had listened to his tales of the birds and animals he met during his work on the course lucas was one of the few people that the boy admired and loved do go on lucas said wilfrid touching the mans bare warm arm tell us about the rich old man who hated everyone and bought the island years ago im telling the story my own way said lucas with great dignity you sit patient now or ill start my ditching again sit like this dog see he dont even twitch a muscle good dog that he is well now about this rich old man he was so afraid of being robbed that he bought that lonely island he built himself a great castle right in the middle of the thick woods cut down about a hundred trees to make room for it so the story goes and brought every single stick and stone from the mainland did you see the old quarry on this here golfcourse as you came along to me yes we did said julian remembering i felt sorry for anyone who sent a golfball there well young sir out of that quarry came the great stones that the old man used for his castle said lucas tis said that big hatbottomed boats had to be made to ferry the stones across to the island and to this day the road through this golfcourse is the one made by horses dragging the great stones down to the watersedge were you alive then said wilfrid bless you boy no of course not said lucas with a great chuckle of a laugh long afore my time that was well the stone house or castle whatever you like to call it was built and the old man brought to it all kinds of treasures beautiful statues some of gold it was said but that i disbelieve ah manys the queer tale ive heard of what that rich old man took over to whispering island a great bed made of pure gold and set with precious stones a necklace of rubies as big as pigeons eggs a wonderful sword with a jewelled handle worth a kings fortune and other things i disremember he paused and looked round julian asked him a quick question what happened to all these things well now he fell foul of the king of the land and one morning what did he see landing on the shores of his island but ships of all kinds said lucas enjoying the rapt attention of his audience a lot of them were sunk by the wicked rocks but enough men were left to storm the queer stone castle in the wood and they killed the old man and all his servants did they find the treasures the old fellow had collected asked dick never a one said lucas never a one some say it was all a tale the old man never did bring any wonders there and some say theyre still there on whispering island meself i think its all a yarn but a good yarn at that who owns the island now asked dick well an old fellow and his wife went to live theremaybe they paid rent to the crown for it maybe they bought it but they didnt care for anything except for the birds and the animals there said lucas picking up his curved billhook again and hacking lightly at some briars they wouldnt allow nobody there and it was they who kept the gamekeepers with guns to frighten away sightseers they wanted peace and quiet for themselves and for all the wildlife on the island and a fine idea too many a time when i was there with the other keepers three of us there were many a time ive had rabbits gambolling over my feet and snakes gliding by me and the birds as tame as canaries id love to go there said wilfrid his eyes shining id have a good time with all the wild creatures can anyone go there now no said lucas getting up not a soul has lived in the old stone castle since the old man and his wife fell ill and died the place is empty the island belongs to a greatnephew of the old couple now but he never goes there just keeps a couple of men on the island to frighten off visitors pretty fierce they are so ive been told well there you are thats the story of whispering island not very pleasant a bit grim and ugly it belongs to the birds and the beasts now and good luck to them thank you for telling us the story said anne and the old countryman smiled down at her his eyes wrinkling and his brown hand patting her cheek ill be off to my hedging and ditching again he said and ill feel the sun warm on my bare back and hear the birds asinging to me from the bushes thats happiness enough for anyone and pity it is that more folks dont know it chapter seven up on the golfcourse the children walked round the golfcourse together after talking to old lucas we must keep out of the way of anyone playing said dick or we might get hit on the head with a ball hey timmy what are you doing in the bracken timmy came out with something in his mouth he dropped it at georges feet it was a golfball fairly new george picked it up what do we do with this she said theres no golfer near us it must be a lost ball well all balls lost on golfcourses should be taken in to the pro said julian by right they belong to him if found on the course whats a pro asked anne a professional golfer a man whos very very good at the game and is in charge of a golfcourse explained julian well im blessed here comes old tim again with another ball timmy we ought to hire you out to golfers who keep losing their balls youd save them no end of trouble timmy was pleased to be patted and praised he set off into the rough again at once sniping here and there anyone would think that golfballs smelt like rabbits or something the way timmy sniffs them out said anne as timmy ran up with yet another ball my word golfers must be jolly careless losing so many balls they went on round the course which was set with great stretches of gorse full of brilliant blossom a baby rabbit fled from the bracken as timmy nosed there for balls timmy chased it and the frightened little creature dodged this way and that trying to escape let it go tim let it go yelled george but timmy was much too excited to pay any attention wilfrid suddenly bent down as the rabbit raced near him and gave a curious low whistle the rabbit swerved came straight towards him and leapt into his arms lying there trembling timmy jumped up to it at once but george dragged him away no timmy sorry but no you cant have the little thing down down i say timmy gave george a disgusted look and pattered off into the bracken nosing for balls again he was very cross with george rabbits were meant to be chased werent they why did george have to spoil his fun george stared at wilfrid the rabbit was still nestling in his arms and he was making a curious noise to it the tiny thing was trembling from head to tail everyone watched it glad that it was safe they were all silent astonished at the way that wilfrid had rescued the little creature how had the rabbit known that wilfrids arms were ready to save it he took it to the bracken dropped it gently and watched it race like lightning to the nearest burrow then he turned and patted timmy who stood silently by watching sorry tim he said its so little and youre so big woof said tim exactly as if he understood and he gave wilfrids hand a quick lick then he pranced round the boy barking as if he wanted a game and wilfrid raced off with him at top speed the others followed impressed once again by wilfrids uncanny way with animals he was such a horrid little boy in some ways so rude so mannerless so selfish then how was it that animals liked him so much george frowned she thought it was all wrong that animals should love wilfrid and go to him why even timmy was all over him if she wasnt careful he would spend more time with wilfrid than with her that would never do timmy found five more balls and soon julians pockets were heavy with them they made their way to the small clubhouse in the distance meaning to give in the balls it was set in a little dip and looked friendly and welcoming they all went in at the door and julian walked over to the pro who was checking some scorecards he emptied his pockets of balls and grinned a present from our dog he said my word did he find all those said the pro pleased not bad ones either ill stand you all some lemonade or orangeade which will you have they all had orangeade and the pro sent a packet of biscuits to timmy who was waiting patiently outside he was delighted were staying in that little cottage up on the hillside said dick do you know it course i do said the pro my grandmother lived there once upon a time youve a wonderful view there havent you one of the finest in the world i reckon you can see whispering island from there too ought to be called mystery island its said that folks have gone there and never come back what happened to them asked anne oh well maybe its all a tale said the pro theres supposed to be priceless things there packed away somewhere and collectors from all over the world have come here and tried to get over to that island not to steal you understand but just to see if they could find anything worthwhile and buy it for museums or maybe for their own collections its said there are statues in the wood white as snow but that i never did believe and didnt the collectors ever come back asked julian its said that a lot of them didnt said the pro but that may be all silly tales but i do know that two men came down here from some museum in london and hired a boat to go across they took a white flag with them so that the two keepers wouldnt shoot at them and after that nobody heard a word about them they just disappeared well what could have happened to them asked julian nobody knows said the pro their boat was found miles out to sea drifting and empty so the police reckoned a mist came down they lost direction and ended by drifting way out to sea but did they jump out of their boat and try to swim back and get drowned asked dick or did a passing steamer or yacht save them they werent picked up thats certain said the pro else theyd have arrived safely back at their homes sometime or other but they didnt no i reckon the poor fellows were drowned of course maybe they were shot by the keepers when they tried to land and their boat was set adrift didnt the police do anything asked julian puzzled oh yes they went across to the island in the coastguard patrol boat said the pro but the keepers swore theyd seen nobody arriving and that they were the only people on the place the police landed and searched everywhere and they found nothing except the great white castlelike house in the woods and hundreds of wild animals so tame that theyd sit and watch you as you walked by all very mysterious said julian getting up well thanks for the welcome orangeade and for your information wed already heard a bit from a groundsman of yours lucas a real old countryman and a born storyteller ah lucas yes he knows that island well said the pro he was once one of the keepers i believe well come and see me again some time thanks for the balls it isnt everyone whos honest enough to come and give them in when they find them they all said goodbye and went out timmy pranced along in joy sitting down outside the clubhouse didnt suit him at all did you enjoy your biscuits tim asked george and he ran up and gave her hand a quick lick what a question he always enjoyed biscuits he ran off into the bracken and began to nose about there again hunting for balls the others went to walk up the hill talking about the island i wonder what really did happen to those two collector men who were never heard of again said anne funny that their boat was found adrift and empty they must have been drowned of course said dick i wonder if anything is left of the old treasures that were once taken there no there wouldnt be the police would have made a very thorough search i wish we could go to the island said george i dont expect the keepers would shoot at us would they they might even let us on to make a change for them they must be so bored with only themselves to talk to thats very wishful thinking george said julian we are certainly not going near the island so put that right out of your head well i knew it was impossible really said george but wouldnt it be a grand adventure if we managed to get on the mysterious whispering island and explore it without the keepers knowing not such a grand adventure if we were all peppered with shot from the keepers guns said dick anyway we wouldnt find anything of interest the treasures must have been removed long ago the only possible things of interest would be the very tame wild creatures there wilfrid would go mad with joy wouldnt you wilfrid id like it very much said the boy his eyes shining whats more i might hire a boat myself and row round the island to see if i could spot any animals there youll do nothing of the sort said julian at once so dont try any silly tricks see i shant promise said wilfrid irritatingly you just never know oh yes i do know youre just trying to sound big said julian come along quickly everyone its past our dinnertime and im ravenous whats for lunch anne well open a tin of tongue said anne and theres plenty of bread left and lettuce which i left in water and tomatoes and heaps of fruit sounds good said george dinner timmy dinner and hearing that welcome word timmy shot up the steep hill at top speed his tail waving joyously wish i was a dog and could tear up a hill like that said anne panting give me a push julian ill never get to the top chapter eight mostly about wilfrid timmy was waiting for the children at the top of the hill his tail waving his mouth open as he panted he picked something up as the children came threw it into the air and caught it another golfball timmy said dick as timmy threw the ball into the air again with a toss of his big head no its too big for that said george drop it timmy what have you found timmy dropped the ball at georges feet it was bigger than a golfball and had a hole right through it oh its one of those balls that children throw up and try to catch on a stick said george somebody must have dropped it all right tim you can have it he wont swallow it will he said wilfrid anxiously its not awfully big and i once saw a dog swallow something by mistake that he threw into the air to catch timmys much too sensible to swallow any ball said george you neednt worry about him anyway i can do any worrying necessary hes my dog all right all right all right said wilfrid miss highandmighty can look after her own dog fine george looked round at him furiously and he made a face at her then he whistled to timmy yes he actually dared to whistle to him nobody whistles for my dog except me said george and anyway he wont come to you but to her surprise and horror timmy did go to wilfrid and pranced all round him expecting a game george called him sternly and he looked at her in surprise he began to trot over to her when wilfrid whistled again and obediently timmy turned as if to go to him george caught hold of the dogs collar and aimed a punch at the whistling boy it missed him and he danced round laughing stop it now you two said julian seeing georges look of fury i said stop it wilfrid go on ahead and keep going george dont be an ass hes only teasing you to make you lose your temper dont please him by losing it george said nothing more but her eyes blazed oh dear thought anne now we shant have any peace she wont forgive wilfrid for making timmy go to him blow wilfrid he really is a little pest at times they were all very hungry for their lunch and very pleased with everything that anne provided dick went into the little cottage to help her because george insisted on keeping her hand on timmys collar all the time in case wilfrid should entice him to his side hes making some of his peculiar noises now said dick to anne noises that animals cant seem to resist i dont wonder that george has got timmy tightly by the collar im not a dog but i find those little whiny noises wilfrid is making very curious indeed and id love to go nearer well i hope were not going to have black looks from george from now on said anne wilfrids an awful little idiot at times and most irritating but hes not bad underneath if you know what i mean well i dont really said dick cutting some tomatoes in half i think hes a badly broughtup little pest and if i were a dog id bite him not fawn on him have i cut up enough tomatoes anne good gracious yes said anne however many do you think were going to eat forty or fifty look you open this tin for me dick i do so hate opening tins i nearly always cut myself dont you ever open one again then said dick im the official tinopener from now on dear old anne whatever should we do without you you take everything on your shoulders and we just let you george ought to help more shes a girl like you but she never gets the meals or anything ill tick her off one of these days no dont said anne in alarm i like doing things on my own george would only break things or upset them shes as hamhanded as a boy when it comes to washing up or setting out crockery though she means well so boys are hamhanded are they said dick pretending to be offended when have i ever broken anything id like to know im as careful as any girl when i handle crockery alas for dick the glass he was holding suddenly slipped from his hand fell to the floor and broke anne looked at him and gave a sudden delighted giggle old hamhand she said cant pick up a glass without dropping it look take out this tray for me and for goodness sake dont drop that they all had a delicious lunch and ate practically everything wilfrid sat a little away from everyone scattering crumbs around as he ate birds of all kinds were soon round him even hopping on to his hands a magpie flew down to his left shoulder wilfrid greeted it like an old friend hallo maggie pie hows the family i hope polly pie has recovered from her cold and is peter pies bad leg better and what about old granpa pie does he still chase you young ones the magpie put its glossy head on one side and chattered back to him in birdlanguage which wilfrid appeared to understand he stroked the birds gleaming breast and fondled it lovingly george deliberately didnt watch she turned her back on wilfrid and the magpie and talked to timmy the others couldnt help being amused the magpie put wilfrids conversation to an end very suddenly the boy was about to put half a tomato into his mouth when the bird bent down its head and snatched away the tomato with its powerful beak then it rose quickly into the air on its big wings making a noise exactly as if it were laughing everyone roared with laughter except the surprised wilfrid hes gone to take your tomato to polly pie i should think said anne and that made everyone laugh again ill have another tomato now please said wilfrid sorry youre unlucky theyre all gone said dick it was lovely sitting up on the hillside watching the boats in the harbour and seeing the beautiful whitesailed yachts bending to and fro in the strong wind that blew there they could all see whispering island quite clearly and noticed that no boats went anywhere near it clearly everyone knew that men might be there watching for intruders there might be badgers there said wilfrid suddenly ive never been really close to a badger i shouldnt think anyone but you would want to be said george smelly things theres one thing you cant call one with your whistlepipe there arent any here wilfrid get out your pipe and make the little rabbits come again said anne suddenly while were all sitting here quietly would they come yes i think so said wilfrid and felt in his pocket he felt in another pocket and looked worried then he stood up and patted himself all over looking really distressed he stared round at the others anguish on his face its gone he said i must have lost it its gone ill never have another like it never oh it must be in one of your pockets said dick touched by the look on the boys face here let me feel but no the pipe wasnt there wilfrid looked as if he were about to burst into tears he began to hunt all round and everyone helped him no not quite everyone george didnt dick glanced at her and frowned george was pleased that the precious pipe was lost how she must dislike poor wilfrid well he was dislikeable at times no doubt about it but he was so distressed now that surely nobody could help feeling sorry for him george got up and began to clear away the remains of the meal she carried plates and glasses to the hut and after a while anne followed her im sorry for poor old wilfrid arent you she said no im not said george shortly serves him right i hope he never finds his silly pipe that will teach him not to try and get timmy away from me oh dont be silly he only does it for fun said anne shocked why do you take things so seriously george you know timmy loves you better than anyone in the world and always will hes your dog and nobody nobody elses wilfrids only teasing you when he tries to get timmy to go to him timmy goes though said george desperately and he shouldnt he shouldnt he cant help it i think said anne wilfrid has some peculiar attraction for animals and that little whistlepipe of his is like a magic call to them im glad its gone said george glad glad glad then i think youre silly and unkind said anne and walked off knowing that she could do nothing with george in this mood she worried a little as she went did george know where the pipe was had she found it and hidden it or destroyed it no no george could be difficult and unkind at times but she wasnt mean and what a mean thing it would be to destroy the beautiful little pipe with its magic trills anne went back to the others meaning to try and comfort wilfrid but he wasnt there wheres he gone asked anne to look for his precious whistlepipe said dick hes really heartbroken about it i think he says hes going to walk back the way we came from the golfcourse and then hes going to walk everywhere there that we walked this morning and hunt and hunt hes even going down to the clubhouse to see if he dropped it there hell never find it poor old wilfrid said anne tenderhearted as ever i wish hed waited for me id have gone with him hes awfully upset isnt he wont he be able to call the wild animals to him any more ive no idea said dick er i suppose old george doesnt know anything about it perhaps thats a mean thing to say but george might have found it and kept it just for a joke no no i dont think shed do that said anne it would be a very poor joke well well just have to hope wilfrid finds it what are you going to do this afternoon sleep by the look of you yes sleep out in the warm sun here till three oclock said julian then im going for a walk down to the harbour i might even have a bathe well all go said dick sleepily oh how lovely it is to feel lazy and warm and wellfed and sleeeeeeeepy so long everyone im asleep chapter nine off to whispering island the two boys and anne and george slept soundly in the sun until just past three oclock then a large fly buzzed around annes head and awoke her she sat up and looked at her watch gracious its ten past three she said in surprise wake up julian dick stir yourself dont you want to go and bathe yawning loudly the two boys sat up and looked all round george was still asleep wilfrid hadnt yet come back still hunting for his precious pipe i suppose said anne get up you two boys dick youre not to lie down youll only go to sleep again where are your bathingthings ill get them and does anyone know where our bathing towels are well probably have to dress and undress with them round us theyre up in our room chucked into a corner said dick sleepily gosh i was sound asleep i really thought i was in my bed when i awoke anne went to fetch the bathtowels and the bathing things she called back to the boys ive got everything buck up julian dont go to sleep again right said julian sitting up and stretching himself oh this sun its glorious he poked dick with his toe get up well leave you behind if you snore again george goodbye were going george sat up yawning and timmy stood over her and licked her cheek she patted him all right timmy im ready its so warm that im longing for a dip and youll love it too tim carrying their bathingthings they made their way down the hill and across a stretch of moorland to the edge of the sea timmy running joyously behind them beyond lay whispering island a great treeclad mass and all around and about little boats plied and yachts sailed in the wind enjoying themselves in the great harbour which stretched far beyond the island to a big seaside town on the opposite coast the four went behind some rocks and stripped off their clothes emerging three minutes later in their scanty bathing things anne raced to the edge of the water and let it lap over her toes lovely she said its not a bit cold i shall enjoy my swim woof said timmy and plunged into the water he loved the sea too and was a fine swimmer he waited for george to come in and then swam to her she put her arms round his neck and let him drag her along with him dear timmy how strong he was thought george they had a wonderful time in the water further out the waves were big and curled over like miniature waterfalls sweeping the children along with them they yelled in joy and choked when the water splashed into their mouths it was an ideal day for bathing when they came out they lay on the sand in the sun timmy beside george keeping guard as usual it was really warm george sat up and looked longingly out to sea where the wind was whipping up the waves tremendously wish we had a boat she said if we were back home i could get out my own boat and we could go out in the cool breeze and get dry julian pointed lazily to a big notice not far off it said boats for hire inquire at hut oh good said george ill go and inquire id love a good row she slipped on her sandals and went to the hut to which the sign pointed a boy of about fifteen sat there staring out to sea he looked round as george came along want a boat he said yes please how much asked george for four of us and a dog fifty pence an hour said the boy or a pound a day or three pounds a week better to take it by the week if youre staying here it works out very cheap then george went back to the boys and anne shall we take the boat by the week she said itll cost three pounds we could do lots of rowing about and it would be fun right said dick anyone got any money theres some in my pocket but not enough im afraid said julian ill go and fix up the boat for us to have tomorrow well take it for a whole week i can easily bring the money with me in the morning the boatboy was very obliging you can have the boat today and onwards if you like you neednt wait till tomorrow he said i know youll bring me the money all right so if youd like to have it this afternoon its up to you choose which boat you like theyre all the same if you want to take it out at night too and do some fishing you can but tie it up safe wont you of course said julian going to look at the boats he beckoned to the others and they all came over any boat we like day or night said julian which do you fancy starfish splasho adventure seagull rockabye they all look good sound little boats to me id like adventure i think said george thinking that that particular little boat looked sturdy deari and sound nice name and nice little boat so adventure it was and a jolly good name for any boat of ours said dick pushing it down to the sea with julian whooooosh there she goes steady my beauty we want to get in chuck in all our clothes george we can dress when we feel cold soon they were all in the boat bobbing about on the waves julian took the oars and pulled out to sea now they were in the full breeze and a spanking one it was too im certainly not hot any more said george pulling her bathingtowel round her shoulders the tide was running out and pulled the boat strongly out to sea whispering island suddenly seemed very much nearer better look out said george suddenly we dont know if a keepers on guard somewhere on the shore of the island were getting pretty near but the outgoing tide swept the boat on and on towards the island so that very soon they could see a sandy shore dick then took one oar and julian the other and they tried to row against the tide and take the boat back into calmer water it was no good the tide was far too strong very soon the boat was quite near the shore of the island and then an enormous wave flung them right up the sand and left the boat grounded as it went back again it slid over to one side and they all promptly fell out whew said julian what a tide id no idea it ran so strongly or id never have brought the boat out so far what shall we do said anne rather scared she kept looking all round for a keeper with a gun suppose they got into real trouble through coming right on to the island i think well have to stay on the island till the tide turns and we can row back on it said julian i cant think why that boatboy didnt warn us about the tide i suppose he thought we knew they pulled the boat a little further up on the firm sand took out their bundle of clothes and hid them under a bush they walked up the beach towards a wood thick with great trees as they neared them they heard a strange mysterious sound whispering said george stopping the trees are really whispering listen its just as if they were talking to one another under their breath no wonder its called whispering island i dont like it much said anne it almost sounds as if theyre saying nasty things about us shooey shooey shooey shooey said the trees nodding towards one another as the wind shook them shooey shooey just the noise of whispering said george well what do we do now well have to wait an hour or two till the tide turns again shall we explore said dick after all weve got timmy with us no one is likely to attack us if they see him they can shoot him cant they if they have guns said george if he growled one of his terrifying growls and ran at them showing his teeth theyd be scared to bits and fire at him i think youre right said julian angry with himself for landing them all into what might be serious trouble keep your hand on timmys collar george you know what i think said dick suddenly i think we ought to try and find the guards and tell them the tide swept us on to the island quite by accident we couldnt stop the boat surging on were not grownups come to snoop around so theyre sure to believe us and wed be safe from any chasing or shooting then they all looked at julian he nodded yes good idea give ourselves up and ask for help after all we hadnt any real intention of actually landing the tide simply threw the boat into that sandy cove so they walked up to the back of the cove and into the wood whose whispering was very loud indeed once they were actually among the trees no one was to be seen the wood was so thick that it was in parts quite difficult to clamber through after about ten minutes very hard walking and clambering julian came to a stop he had seen something through the trees the others pressed behind him julian pointed in front and the others saw what looked like a great grey wall made of stone the old castle i imagine julian whispered and at once the trees themselves seemed to whisper even more loudly they all made their way to the wall and walked alongside it it was a very high wall indeed and they could hardly see the top they came to a corner and peeped round a great courtyard lay there quite empty better shout i think said dick beginning to feel rather creepy but before they could do that two enormous men suddenly came down a flight of great stone steps they looked so fierce that timmy couldnt help giving a bloodcurdling growl they stopped short at once and looked all round startled the noise came from over there said one of the men pointing to his left and to the childrens great relief both swung off in the wrong direction wed better get back to the cove whispered julian i dont at all like the look of those men they look proper thugs quiet as you can now george dont let timmy bark they made their way back beside the stone wall through the whispering trees and there they were at the cove wed better row back as quickly as we can said julian i think somethings wrong here those men looked like foreigners they certainly werent gamekeepers i wish we hadnt come ju wheres our boat said dick in a shocked voice its gone this cant be the right cove the others stared round certainly there was no boat they must have come to the wrong cove it looks the same cove to me said george except that the sea has come in a bit more do you think it took our boat away gosh look at that big wave sweeping right in and sucking back my word yes our boat could easily have been dragged out on a wave like that said julian very worried look out here comes another it is the same cove said anne looking under a bush at the back here are our clothes look we hid them here take them out quickly called julian as another big wave swept right in what an idiot i am we should have pulled our boat as far up as we could im cold now said anne im going to dress it will be easier to carry a bathingsuit than a heap of clothes good idea said dick and they all promptly dressed feeling warmer at once we might as well leave our bathingthings under the bush where we left our clothes said george at least well know its the same cove if we find them there the thing is what are we going to do now said julian worried no boat to get back in and why on earth did we choose one called adventure we might have known something would happen chapter ten the five are in a fix julian went to the mouth of the cove and looked out over the waves hoping that he might see their boat bobbing somewhere i could swim out to it if so he thought and bring it in no theres not a sign of a boat i could kick myself for being so careless dick came up looking worried i suppose its too far to swim back to the mainland isnt it he said i could have a shot and get another boat and come back for everyone no too far said julian the tides too strong for any swimmer at the moment were certainly in a fix we cant signal i suppose said dick what with asked julian you could wave a shirt for an hour and it wouldnt be seen from the mainland well we must think of something said dick exasperated what about trying to find a boat here surely those men must have one to get to and fro of course said julian clapping dick on the back where are my brains they seem to be going soft or something we could snoop round and about tonight to see if theres a boat anywhere they may have two or three theyd have to get food from the mainland at times the two girls and timmy came up then and timmy whined he doesnt seem to like this island said george i think he smells danger i bet he does said dick putting his hand on timmys firm head im jolly glad hes with us can you girls think of any good ideas we cant we could signal said george no good a signal from here couldnt be seen said dick weve already thought of that well if we lighted a fire here on the beach tonight when the tides out surely that would be seen said anne dick and julian looked at one another yes said julian if we lighted it on a hilly bit it would be better still on that cliff up there for instance wouldnt the guards see it asked dick wed have to chance that said julian yes we could do that good idea anne i say were going to get jolly hungry arent we anyone got anything to eat ive two bars of chocolate a bit soft now though said george digging into the pocket of her shorts and ive some peppermints said anne what about you boys you always take barleysugars about with you dick dont say you havent any just when we could all do with them ive a new packet said dick lets all have one now he pulled the packet from his pocket and handed it round soon they were all sucking barleysugars timmy was given one too but his was gone in a flash wasted on you tim absolutely wasted said anne crickcrack swallow thats all a barleysugar means to you why cant dogs suck a sweet as we do they never seem to suck anything no timmy dont go sniffing into dicks pocket for another timmy was disappointed he went snuffling round the cove and then scenting a rabbit smell he followed it with his nose to the ground the children didnt notice that he had disappeared but went on talking trying to solve their very real difficulty no boat no food no way of getting help except by signalling in some way not very funny thought dick and then very suddenly a loud sound broke the silence crack everyone jumped up at once that was a gunshot said dick the keepers but what were they shooting at wheres timmy cried george looking all round tim tim where are you tim everyones heart went cold timmy no the shot couldnt have been meant for old timmy surely the keepers wouldnt shoot a dog george was nearly mad with dread she clutched at dick tears streaming down her cheeks dick it couldnt be timmy could it oh timmy where are you timmy come to me listen listen a minute george said dick as shouts came from the distance i thought i heard tim whine then isnt that him coming through the bushes there was the noise of rustling as some creature pressed through the last years old bracken fronds and then timmys head appeared his bright eyes looking for them oh timmy darling timmy i thought youd been shot cried george hugging the big dog did they shoot at you are you hurt anywhere i bet i know why he was shot at said dick look what hes got in his mouth half a ham drop it you robber you timmy stood there the ham in his mouth wagging his tail joyously he had felt hungry and was sure the others did too so he had gone a hunting where did you get that you bad dog said julian timmy wished he could tell him he would have said well i went sniffing after a rabbit and i came to a shed stored with tins of food and one was open with this piece of ham inside waiting for me and here it is he dropped the ham at georges feet it smelt extremely good well thanks old fellow said julian we could do with some of that though well have to pay for it when we meet the owner whoever he is julian he has been shot at said george in a trembling voice look his tails bleeding and some fur is gone my word yes said julian examining timmys tail good gracious those fellows mean business i really think id better find them and tell them were here in case they take a potshot at us too well lets go now all of us said dick they probably thought timmy was a wolf or a fox or something slinking through the trees poor old fellow timmy was not at all disturbed he was so proud of finding and bringing back the ham that he even wagged his wounded tail its quite certain that no animals or birds will be tame and friendly on this island now said anne theyll have been scared stiff by the gamekeepers potting at this and that youre right said julian it rather makes me think that the fellows on the island are no longer merely gamekeepers put in to preserve the wild life and to frighten sightseers away but real fierce guards of some kind like those two horrible men we saw in the courtyard well what are they guarding then said george thats what id very much like to find out said julian and i think perhaps ill snoop round a bit and see what i can discover when its getting dark though not now i wish we hadnt come said anne i wish we were safe in our cottage with wilfrid i wonder if hes found his whistlepipe goodness it seems ages since we hired that boat cant we go quietly through the woods and explore a bit asked george or walk round the shore to see if theres a boat anywhere im getting bored sitting here talking well i suppose old tim would give us warning at once if he heard anyone near said julian who was also longing to stretch his legs well go in single file like indians and make as little noise as we can timmy can go ahead hell give us instant warning if we come near any of the keepers they all stood up and timmy looked at them wagging his nicked tail ill look after you said his two bright eyes dont be afraid they made their way carefully and quietly through the whispering trees sh sh sh shoo shooey said the leaves above their heads as if warning everyone to go as quietly as possible and then suddenly timmy stopped and gave a low warning growl they all stood still at once listening they could hear nothing they were in a dense part of the wood and it was dark and sunless what was timmy growling at he took a step forward and growled softly again julian went forward too as silently as he could he stopped suddenly and stared what in the world was that strange figure gleaming out of the shadows his heart began to beat loudly the figure stood there silently an arm outstretched as if pointing at him he thought it moved and he took a step backwards in fear was it a ghost or something it was so very very white and shone so queerly the others coming up behind suddenly saw it too and stopped in fright timmy growled again and all the hackles on his neck rose up what was this everyone stood absolutely still and anne gave a gulp she took hold of dicks arm and he held it tightly against him and then george gave a very small laugh to everyones horror she went forward and touched the hand of the gleaming figure how do you do she said it is so nice to meet a wellmannered statue well a statue only a statue it had looked so real standing there and yet so ghostly everyone heaved a sigh of relief and timmy ran forward and sniffed at the statues flowing robes look around you said julian the woods full of statues just here and arent they beautiful i hope they dont suddenly come alive they really look as if they might chapter eleven a strange discovery the children were astonished to see so many gleaming statues standing in the darkness of the wood they wandered round them and then came to a large shed they peeped inside look here said dick excited long deep boxes strong as iron and see whats in these two they all came to look in the first packed in what looked like sawdust was a beautifully carved statue of a boy the next box seemed to be entirely full of sawdust and anne had to scrape quite a lot away to see if anything was packed there too its a little stone angel she said scraping sawdust from a quaint little face a small crown and the tips of small wings lovely why are these statues being packed away like this use your brain said dick its obvious that theyre works of art and are probably very old theyre being packed to send away in some boat or ship to be transported somewhere where theyll fetch a lot of money america probably did they come from the old castle do you think asked george its quite near i expect this shed belongs to it but how was it that the police didnt find them in the castle when they searched they must have gone there and looked into every corner and what about the statues in the wood outside why havent they been packed away too big probably said julian and too heavy a small boat wouldnt be strong enough to take great things like that but those little statues are quite perfect for transporting they dont weigh as much as the big ones and they arent marked by the weather through standing in rain sun and snow not a mark on them youre right said anne i noticed that those big ones outside were green here and there and some had bits knocked off them i wish we could get inside the castle and see the things there the man at the golfclub the one we took those lost balls to he said something about statues as white as snow standing in this wood do you remember said dick yes they must have stood there for some time said julian i dont feel they can be very valuable else they would be put carefully indoors under cover but these little beauties i guess theyre worth a lot of money who do you suppose packed them in here said anne maybe those big men we saw said julian even small statues like these need someone very strong indeed to carry them here to this shed and pack them like this then of course they would have to be carried to some boat or ship probably to a boat first and then rowed out to a waiting ship but i dont think those guards are the men behind all this someone with great knowledge of old things must be the ringleader he probably heard the old legend of the island came to have a look round and made quite a lot of interesting discoveries where asked george in the castle probably though carefully hidden away said julian for all we know there may be scores of really valuable old treasures hidden there still that sword with a jewelled handle for instance and the bed made of gold and to think they might all be quite near us somewhere on whispering island said anne wouldnt i love to be able to say id slept on a bed of pure gold well i think youd find it jolly hard said dick timmy suddenly gave a small whine and licked georges hand what is it she said what do you want timmy perhaps hes hungry said anne thirsty more likely said julian look at his tongue hanging out oh poor tim you havent had a drink for hours said george well where on earth can we get you one well have to look for a puddle im afraid come on they left the shed where the beautiful little statues were lying in their sawdust and went out into the sunshine everywhere was dry julian felt worried we shall all be thirsty soon he said i wonder where we can get some water would it be too dangerous to go near the castle and see if theres a tap anywhere asked george ready to face almost anything to get her dog a drink yes it would said julian in a very decided voice were not going near any of those men with guns they might have been told to shoot on sight and that wouldnt be very pleasant wed be peppered all over with shot look whats that round thing over there like a little circular wall said dick pointing to something behind the shed where the statues lay in their boxes they all went over to it and anne guessed what it was at once a well an old well she said look it has an old wooden beam over the top with a pulley to wind and unwind a bucket s there a bucket lets hope so we can let it down to the water and fill it for timmy then timmy put his paws on the rim of the wall and sniffed water that was what he wanted more than anything he began to whine all right timmy well send the bucket down said george its still on the hook julian this handles awfully stiff can you turn it to let down the bucket julian tried with all his strength and quite suddenly the rope loosened and the bucket gave a sudden jerk and jump alas it jerked right off the hook and with a weird echoing jangling sound fell from the top to the bottom of the well landing in the water with a terrific splash blow blow blow said julian and timmy gave an anguished howl he peered down at the lost bucket now on its side in the water at the bottom of the well gradually filling itself itll probably sink below the water now said julian with a groan is there a ladder down the well if so i could shin down and get the bucket but there wasnt though it looked as if there had been at some time for here and there were staples in the brick side of the wellwall what can we do asked anne can we possibly pull up the bucket no im afraid we cant said dick but wait a minute i could shin down the rope couldnt i and pick the bucket out of the water and easily get up again because george and julian could turn the wellhandle and pull me up that way righto down you go then said julian the ropes good and strong not frayed or rotten well wind you and the bucket up all right the boy sat on the side of the wellwall and reached out for the rope he swung himself on to it and swayed there a moment or two looking down the long dark hole below him with the water at the bottom then down he went handoverhand just as he so often did at school in the gym he came to the bottom reached down took hold of the buckethandle and filled the bucket full the water felt as cold as ice to his hand all right pull me up he shouted his voice sounding very hollow and strange as it rose up through the wellwalls dick was heavy to pull up julian and george turned the handle valiantly but it was slow work gradually dick came up nearer and nearer to the top when he was halfway they heard him give an exclamation and call out something but they couldnt make out what it was and went on winding the groaning rope slowly but surely they reached down and took the bucket from dick as soon as his head appeared at the top timmy fell on it with excited barks and began to lap vigorously didnt you hear me yelling to you to stop when i was halfway up demanded dick still swinging on the rope dont let go that handle hang on to it for a minute whats the excitement asked julian in surprise why did you yell to us we couldnt make out what you said dick swung himself to one side caught hold of the welltop and hauled himself up so that he could sit on the wellwall i shouted because i suddenly saw something jolly peculiar as i came up the well he said and i wanted to stop and see what it was well what was it asked julian i dont quite know it looked awfully like a little door an iron door said dick i say dont let timmy drink all that waterhell be ill well let the pail down again in a minute and get some more for ourselves go on about what you saw said george how could there be a door in the side of a well going deep down into the earth well i tell you there was one said dick look timmys gone and upset the pail now lets send it down on the pulley to be filled again and ill go down on the rope again too but when i come up and you hear me shout stop just stop winding see heres the bucket for the hook said julian ill be careful not to jerk it off this time ready down went dick and the bucket again splash went the bucket and filled with water once more then up came dick again wound up by julian and george as before as soon as they heard him shout stop they stopped their winding and peered down they saw dick peering hard at the side of the wellwall and pulling at it with his fingers then he shouted again all right up we go they hauled him up to the top and he clambered off the rope swung himself on to the wellwall and sat there yes it is some kind of opening in the wellwall it is a door and it has a bolt this side to undo but it was too stiff for my fingers id have to go down and jiggle it about with my knife before i could loosen it a door in a well but where on earth would it lead to said julian astonished thats what were going to find out grinned dick rather pleased with himself who would ever think of putting a door in the side of a well somebody did but why very cunning and mysterious and unguessable i rather think ill go straight down again and see if i cant open that door and discover what it leads to oh do dick do said george if you dont i will hang on to the rope down i go again said dick and down he went much to timmys surprise the others looked down anxiously gould dick open the welldoor what would he find behind it quick dick quick everybodys waiting for you chapter twelve a great surprise and a shock for george as soon as dick shouted stop julian and george hung on to the rope to stop it going down any further dick was swinging just opposite the strange door he began to feel round it and to jiggle it it had no lock apparently but there was a bolt on his side he tried to push back the bolt and suddenly it came away from the door and dropped down into the well it had rusted so much that it could not even hold to the door once it was handled the door felt loose now the bolt was gone dick ran his hands round it trying to loosen it further and banged it with his fist rust fell off it and dicks hands were soon brown with the old old rust he saw a little knob at the top of the door and gave it a tug ah the door felt looser now he ran his knife all round the edges scraping away all the rust he could find then he managed to get his strongest knifeblade in between the dooredge and the wellwall and used it as a lever to force the door open it opened slowly and painfully with creaks and groans it was about eighteen inches high and not quite so much wide dick pulled it back with difficulty and then peered through the hole he could see nothing at all but black darkness how very disappointing he fumbled in his pocket to see if he had a torch yes good he shone it through the little door his hand trembling with excitement what would he see his torch was small and not very powerful the light fell first of all on a face with gleaming eyes and dick had such a shock that he almost fell down the well the eyes seemed to glare up at him in a very threatening manner he switched his torch to the right and yet another face gleamed up at him a queer face thought dick yellow as can be yellow yellow i believe that face is made of gold his hand was trembling even more he shone his torch here and there through the opening catching first one yellow face in its light and then another the faces had yellow bodies too and their eyes glinted very queerly i believe yes i really do believe that ive found the hidingplace of the golden statues thought dick and those gleaming eyes must be precious jewels my word i did have a shock when i saw them all looking at me whatever is this place theyre in dick what can you see do tell us yelled julian and poor dick almost fell off the rope when the shouts echoed round him pull me up he shouted its too extraordinary for words pull me up and ill tell you and before a minute had passed he was standing by the others his eyes gleaming almost as brightly as the eyes of the golden statues his words tumbling over one another that door leads into the place where all the treasures are hidden the first thing i saw was a golden statue staring at me brilliant eyes in a yellow face a golden face real gold there are dozens of them i dont think they liked me much they glared so thank goodness they didnt say a word though i half expected them to my word what a hidingplace right down under the earth there must be another entrance to it said julian thrilled to hear such extraordinary news the well door must be a secret one statues couldnt be pushed through it my word what a find dick lets all go down in turn and look through the door said george i cant believe it i think i must be dreaming it quick let me go down one by one they all went down on the rope and looked through the door anne came back rather scared she had felt very queer when she had seen the silent statues looking at her i know theyre not really looking its only that their eyes gleam she said but i kept expecting one or other to take a step forward and speak to me well the next thing to do is to climb down through the door and see exactly where the statues are underground said julian and find out the opening they were brought in by there must be a door the other end of their room through which they were brought what a hidingplace though no wonder the police could find nothing in the way of statues or other treasures we might find the golden sword there with the jewelled handle said anne and the golden bed she had hardly finished speaking when there came a loud noise from behind them timmy was barking his head off whatever was the matter sh said george fiercely youll bring the guards here you idiot stop it timmy stopped barking and whined instead then he ran off towards the wood his tail waving happily who in the world is he going to meet said george amazed someone he knows by the look of his tail the others all followed timmy who raced along towards the cove where they had landed and lost their boat and there in the cove was another boat a small one to be sure but still a boat and by it fondling timmy was wilfrid wilfrid what an amazing thing wilfrid how did you get here did you hire that boat did you come all by yourself did you wilfrid grinned round in delight thrilled at the surprise he was giving everyone timmy licked him without stopping and george didnt even seem to notice well he said you didnt come back so i guessed something was wrong and when the boat boy told me youd taken one of his boats and it had been reported tossing about empty on the water near the island i guessed what had happened i said aha they didnt make the boat fast when they got to the island and now theyre marooned there you were pretty mean to go without me but i guessed youd be pleased to see me if i borrowed a boat and came over anne was so pleased that she gave the boy a hug now we can go back whenever we want to she said but we dont want to at the moment said dick weve made some startling discoveries wilfrid and im jolly pleased youll be able to share in them er what have you got in your pocket something keeps poking its head out at me oh thats only a baby hedgehog said wilfrid taking it out gently it got trodden on by a horse i think so im just caring for it for a day or two he put it back into his pocket but i say go on tell me what youve found not the lost treasures surely yes said anne we saw them when we went down a well near the castle gracious did somebody throw them into the water there said wilfrid amazed no said dick and told him about the curious door in the side of the wellwall wilfrids eyes nearly fell out of his head i am glad i came he said i nearly didnt i thought you wouldnt really want me and i knew george wouldnt be pleased because of timmy i cant help him coming round me and anyway hed feel hurt if i pushed him off timmy came nosing round him at that moment with his ball he wanted wilfrid to throw it for him but wilfrid didnt notice the ball he just patted the soft head and went on talking the boat boy wasnt very pleased when he heard that the boat you hired was loose on the sea he said youd hired it for a week and there it was back the same day wet and empty his cousin brought it in no damage done ill make it up to him when i see him said julian i havent paid him for the hire of it either but he knows i will when i get back i had no idea that the sea would throw up waves here whose backwash would drag out an unmoored boat you ought to have taken me with you said wilfrid grinning timmy tired of trying to make him throw his ball went off to george who was only too pleased to she threw it into the air and timmy leapt up and caught it then very suddenly he made a horrible noise and rolled over kicking as if he were in great pain whats the matter timmy cried george and rushed to him wilfrid ran too the dog was choking and his eyes were almost starting out of his head that balls stuck in his throat cried wilfrid i knew it was dangerous i told you it was cough it up timmy cough it up oh you poor choking thing oh timmy timmy the boy was beside himself with fear that the dog would choke as he had once seen another dog do and as for george she was wild with terror poor timmys eyes looked terrible as he choked and choked trying to get the ball out of his throat hell choke to death cried wilfrid julian force his mouth open and hold it i must try to get out the ball quick timmy was growing weaker and it was not too difficult to force his mouth wide open wilfrid could see the ball down the dogs throat the ball with the hole in the middle he put his small hand into the dogs big mouth and forced his forefinger into the hole in the ball his fingerjoint stuck there wilfrid gently drew back his hand and the ball came too on his finger there it was with his finger still stuck in the hole timmy began to breathe again great panting breaths while george stroked his head and cried for joy that he was all right i shouldnt have given you that ball i shouldnt she said it was too small for a big dog like you and you will throw them up into the air and catch them oh timmy timmy im very very sorry timmy are you all right wilfrid had gone off but now came back with some water from the pail he dipped his hand in it and let drops of water drip into the dogs mouth timmy swallowed it gratefully his throat was sore but the water was cool and soothing george let wilfrid do this without a word she looked rather white and shaken why timmy might be dead by now if wilfrid hadnt put his finger into that hole in the ball and drawn it out thank you wilfrid she said in a low voice you were very clever thank goodness the ball had a hole through it said wilfrid and he put his arms round timmys neck the dog licked him gratefully then he turned and licked george too he says he belongs to both of us now said george ill share him with you you saved his life thanks said wilfrid id love to have just a bit of him hes the nicest dog i know chapter thirteen a meal a sleep and a disappearance i feel hungry again said george who always had a very good appetite indeed weve finished all that ham havent we i had to give old timmy some what about a barley sugar dick two more left for each of us just ten said dick counting sorry timmy old thing none for you this time have one everybody well have five left then oh i quite forgot to tell you said wilfrid taking a barley sugar i brought some food in my boat i didnt think youd taken any and i guessed youd soon be jolly hungry youre a marvel wilfrid said julian wondering why he had ever disliked the boy what have you brought come and see said wilfrid and they all went over to the boat timmy walking as close to the boy as he could higgledypiggledy in the boat was a pile of tins a large loaf of bread and a pound package of butter looking rather soft gracious said anne in delight how in the world did you carry all these from the cottage to your boat look everyone wilfrid has even brought some plates and spoons i put everything into a sack and carried them over my shoulder said wilfrid enjoying everyones delighted surprise i fell over going down the hill to the shore and all the tins rolled out and simply shot down the slope everyone laughed at the thought of the tins rolling at top speed down the hill anne slipped her arm through wilfrids and gave it a squeeze you did jolly well she said and wilfrid beamed at her astonished and pleased at everyones warm friendliness timmy went up to the boat and began sniffing at the bread then he turned and barked as if to say is there anything here for me wilfrid understood at once oh yes timmy he said i brought a special tin of dogmeat for you here you are a large tin of waggomeat timmy recognized the tin at once and barked joyfully he pawed wilfrid as if to say come on then open it im hungry anyone got a tinopener said george it would be too dreadful if we couldnt open the tins gosh i never even thought about that said wilfrid what an ass i am its all right ive a thing on my pocketknife thats supposed to open tins said dick taking out a very large closed knife ive never bothered to use it so lets hope it will work the trick chuck me a tin wilfrid wilfrid threw him the tin of waggomeat with everyone watching very anxiously indeed dick opened a peculiarlooking tool in his knife and gashed the point into the top of the tin it worked first time ive ever used it said dick running the gadget round the tintop three cheers for the man who thought of including it in a knife will timmy be able to swallow yet asked george anxiously his throat must still be hurting him where that wooden ball choked him oh timmy will be able to judge that for himself said julian if i know anything about him not even a sore throat will stop him from wolfing half that tin julian was right as soon as wilfrid scraped out a third of the meat with his knife on to a flat stone nearby timmy was wolfing it in great gulps nothing much the matter with your throat now tim said anne patting him dear old tim dont ever choke again i simply couldnt bear it lets have a meal ourselves now said george well open more of those tins we dont need to be stingy about them because we can leave in wilfrids boat at any time and get back to the mainland soon they had opened a tin of tongue two tins of fruit and a large tin of baked beans they cut the big loaf into six pieces and then sat down at the back of the cove to feast best meal i ever had in my life said dick enjoying himself tasty food fresh air sea nearby sun on our heads and friends sitting all round me woof said timmy at once and gave dick a very wet lick he says he couldnt agree more said anne with a laugh the suns going down said george what are we going to do go back to the mainland in wilfrids boat or stay here for the night stay here said julian nobody knows were here and i want to snoop round a bit tonight when those men cant see me theres a lot of things that puzzle me for instance how on earth do they send away the things from here such as those packed statues we saw it must mean that a fairly big vessel comes along to collect them i suppose and id like to know how many men there are on the island presumably the guards we saw with guns and the men who have found that underground cave where everything was hidden then well go back tell the police and leave things to them couldnt wilfrid take the two girls back to the mainland then come back with the boat said dick i dont think we ought to let them run any risk before julian could reply george spoke quickly and crossly were staying here though anne can go back if she wants to but timmy and i are staying with you boys so thats that all right all right no need to shout said dick pretending to cover his ears what about you though anne youre the youngest and im staying said anne id be worried stiff all night if i left you on the island and i certainly dont want to miss any excitement right said julian we all stay then wilfrid did you know that timmy has his nose in the pocket where you keep your hedgehog yes theyre just making friends said wilfrid anyway the hedgehogs only a baby his quills wont prick timmys nose theyre still too soft hes a dear little thing i thought id call him spiky wuff said timmy quite agreeing he was sitting between george and wilfrid very happy indeed for both fondled him and patted him at the same time i think ill take a walk round the island suddenly announced wilfrid timmy like to come with me timmy got up at once but george pulled him down dont be an ass wilfrid she said timmys been shot at once by the men here and im not going to risk it again besides we dont want them to know were here id be very careful persisted wilfrid i wouldnt let them spot me they didnt spot me coming over in the boat julian sat up very suddenly how do we know they didnt he said i never thought of that they might have a telescope they might keep watch all the time they might even have seen us in our boat after all they cant risk being spied on i dont think they could have seen us said dick they would have made a search im jolly sure they didnt see me boasted wilfrid theyd have been waiting for me on the shore if they had he got up and looked all round i think ill go for my walk now he said no you are definitely not to go for a walk wilfrid said julian and lay back in the sun again it was sinking now but still very bright dick began to think of the night and how he and julian would snoop round and find the way into that strange place underground where those golden statues stood silently in the darkness then he fell fast asleep and only awoke when anne gave him a friendly punch he sat up and began a long and leisurely conversation with his sister and then anne suddenly looked all round wheres wilfrid she said they all sat up then and looked startled wilfrid was nowhere to be seen he must have slipped away without a sound said dick angrily the little idiot hes been gone quite a long time hell get caught as sure as can be good thing timmy didnt go with him he might have been caught too and shot george put her arms round timmy in feartimmy would never go with wilfrid if i wasnt there too she said what a little fathead he is i say those men will guess theres someone else on the island with wilfrid wont they they might even make him tell all he knew and where the boat is and everything what shall we do said anne wed better go after him timmy will track him for us said george getting up come on tim find wilfrid find that silly disobedient boy wilfrid timmy understood at once he put his nose to the ground found wilfrids scent and began to walk away not too fast timmy said george and he at once slowed down george looked round at the little place among the bushes where they had been sitting had we better take a tin or two with us she said yes good idea said julian you just never know he and dick took a couple of tins each stuffed uncomfortably into their pockets blow wilfrid he must have gone in this direction said dick i never spotted him slinking away the little nuisance im surprised timmy didnt make a sound track him tim track him listen said anne suddenly and she stopped listen they all listened and didnt at all like what they heard it was wilfrids voice yelling in fright let me go let me go and then a stern loud and threatening voice came who are you with where are they youre not alone were certain of that quick we must hide said julian angry and worried dick look about for a good place and i will too no good said dick theyll beat everywhere for us better climb trees good idea said julian anne come with me ill give you a shove up hurry everybody hurry chapter fourteen wilfrid has an adventure on his own what about timmy he cant climb said george fearfully he might be shot put him under a bush and tell him to sit sit sit said julian urgently he knows perfectly well what that means go on george quick george took timmy by the collar and led him to a very thick bush she pushed him under it he turned himself round poked his nose out of the leaves and looked at her in surprise sit timmy sit and keep quiet said george sit sit sit and keep quiet understand woof said timmy very quietly and withdrew his nose so that nothing of him could be seen at all he knew perfectly well what george meant clever old timmy dick was giving anne a shove up a tree with drooping branches thick with leaves get as high as you can he said in a low voice and then stay put till you hear me call you dont be afraid old timmys down here to protect you anne gave him rather a small smile she was not like george fearless and always ready to rush into trouble anne was all for a peaceful life but how could she have that if she was one of the five the boys and george were now high up in trees listening to the shouting going on apparently wilfrid was not going to give away his friends one up to him how did you get here a man was shouting in a boat said wilfrid who was with you shouted another man nobody i came alone said wilfrid perfectly truthfully i wanted to visit the island im an animallover and i heard that all the wild creatures here were tame a likely story that sneered a mans voice huh animallover all right then look what ive got here in my pocket said wilfrid and apparently showed the man his baby hedgehog he was trodden on by a horse and ive been looking after him very well you can go back to your boat and row away said the man at once mind and dont look so scared we shant hurt you weve business of our own here and we dont want strangers round not even silly little kids with hedgehogs in their pockets wilfrid took to his heels and fled he felt lost now he would never find the others or the cove where his boat was why had he disobeyed julian had the others heard the men shouting at him which way should he go he had entirely lost his sense of direction and had no idea whether to go to the left or the right he began to panic where could the others be he must find them he must he ran through the trees wishing that timmy was with him then he stopped surely this was quite the wrong way he turned and went in a different direction no this couldnt be right either he didnt recognize a thing he thought he heard voices in the distance he stood and listened could it be the others if only george would tell timmy to find him but she wouldnt in case he was shot at was that noise voices or was it just the wind perhaps it was the others looking for him wilfrid rushed off towards the distant sound but alas it died down it was only the wind the trees thinned out into bushes and then wilfrid suddenly saw the sea in the distance good if he could get to it he could walk round the shore till he came to his cove he would know where he was then he began to run towards the blue sea through the bushes he went and came out at last on to what seemed to be a very high cliff yes there was the sea below and beyond if only he could scramble down the cliff he could bear to the right and at last come to his cove he came to the edge of the cliff and looked down and then he started back in fear what was that noise that awful dreadful noise it was like a giant wailing and wailing at the top of his voice the wailing going up and down in the wind wilfrid found his knees were shaking he simply didnt dare to go on he sat down and tried to get his breath putting his hands over his ears to keep out the horrible wailing and then he suddenly remembered something and heaved a sigh of heartfelt relief of course these must be the wailing cliffs we were told about he thought thankfully we heard about the whispering wood and it does whisper and the wailing cliffs and they do wail at least its really the wind of course but goodness what a queer strange sound he sat for a while longer then feeling much bolder he went to the edge of the great cliff and looked over he stared down in surprise theres somebody down there three or four people mustnt let them see me they must belong to the men on the island what are they doing down there he lay down and peered over four men were there but as wilfrid watched they disappeared where had they gone he craned over the cliff to see there must be caves in the cliff i suppose he said to himself thats where theyve gone gosh i wish this wailing would stop i shall start wailing myself in a minute after some time voices came faintly up to him as he lay watching and he saw two men coming out on to the rocks below again what were they carrying a long deep box why it looked exactly like one of the boxes in which the others had seen those beautiful little statues packed in sawdust so thats how they get them away from here take them down through some passage in the cliffs to a waiting boat wheres the boat thought i cant see one not arrived yet perhaps he watched with intense interest as the men carried out box after box and piled them on a great flat rock that abutted on a stretch of fairly calm water big boxes little ones my word those men have been busy lately thought wilfrid wishing and wishing and wishing that the others were with him i wonder whats in them not the bed of gold thats certain i bet it would be far too big to put into a boat have to be pulled to pieces first hallo here comes another box a small one this time good gracious theyll soon need a steamer to take all these almost as he said the words he saw a small steamer in the far distance well theres the steamer just as i said i bet the boat will appear soon and be loaded and then chug off to the waiting steamer but the steamer came no nearer and no boats appeared waiting for the tide i expect thought wilfrid goodness what will the others say when i tell them all this they wont believe me and i bet they wont scold me for going off by myself he decided to go back and find the others and tell them what he had seen he set off trying to remember the way surely he must be near the place where he had left them and then quite suddenly someone leapt out from behind a tree and caught hold of him let me go let me go shouted wilfrid in a panic and then he gave a cry of relief as he suddenly saw timmy running towards him timmy save me but timmy didnt come running to save him he stood there looking up at him rather puzzled while poor wilfrid went on struggling really frightened then wilfrid heard a giggle a giggle who in the world could be giggling just then he forced himself to look round and saw dick and anne doing their best not to laugh and george holding her sides his captor let go of him and began to laugh too it was julian i say this is too bad you gave me a most awful fright said wilfrid ive already been captured once this afternoon whatever do you think youre doing where have you been wilfrid said julian rather sternly i forbade you to go for a walk and you went i know i went off by myself and a man caught me and scared me then i ran away and lost myself i couldnt find any of you said poor wilfrid but my word i saw something very very interesting on that walk of mine what asked julian at once lets sit down and ill tell you said wilfrid i feel quite shaky you really were beasts to jump on me like that never mind wilfrid said anne feeling sorry for the boy who really did look rather shaken now go on tell us everything that happened wilfrid sat down he was still trembling a little everything seemed to have happened at once he began to tell the others about the wailing cliffs and all he had seen they all listened with intense interest so thats the other way to the underground treasurechamber through a passage in the clips said julian i never thought of that my word thats something to know i vote we go and explore the cliffs ourselves when theres nobody about well it had better be in the evening said wilfrid just in case we were spotted climbing down the cliffs to find the passage if there is one and i think there must be those men might be on the watch now they know theres someone on the island i bet they guess im not the only one even though i told them i came alone i vote we have something to eat said george we can talk over everything then its ages since we had a meal lets go and open some more tins and plan what were going to do tonight this is getting too exciting for words isnt it timmy woof agreed timmy too exciting he thought yes and dangerous too hed keep close to george that evening as close as ever he could if she went into danger timmy would be close by her side chapter fifteen julian has an exciting plan the five children talked and talked as they opened more tins and had a most peculiar meal of ham spread with fruit salad and beans they finished up with another barley sugar each george gave hers to timmy who disposed of it with a crickcrackswallow have we all got torches asked julian i know it will be bright moonlight tonight but as we shall presumably be getting down or up dark caves we shall want torches yes they each had a torch wilfrid for some reason had two rather small but quite efficient whats the plan going to be ju asked george and timmy gave a little whine as if to say yes tell us he sat by george listening earnestly with wilfrid on the other side of him at times he sniffed at the baby hedgehog still in the boys pocket and apparently quite happy there wilfrid had been busy catching insects for it much to timmys interest i propose that we go to the cliffs the wailing cliffs as soon as its twilight and make our way down said julian there is probably some kind of pathway down i should think even if only a rabbitpath ill lead the way down of course anne and wilfrid are to come between me and dick with george and timmy behind right said everyone we are of course to make as little noise as possible said julian and do try not to send stones hurtling down the path or cliff just in case anyones about when we get down to the rocks well let wilfrid go ahead because he saw where the men went in and out earlier on wilfrid felt suddenly important my word it was like planning an exploration he suddenly remembered something the wailing noise i hope the girls wont be scared when they hear the awful wailing noise he said its only the wind screaming in and out of the holes and corners of the great cliffs george made a scornful noise whos scared of the wind she said timmy might be said julian smiling we know what makes the wailing he doesnt you may have to hold him when it begins george hell be a bit restive he wont said george timmys not afraid of anything in the world oh yes he is said dick at once i know something that scares him dreadfully makes him put his tail down and flop his ears you do not said george angrily well havent you seen him when you speak sharply to him said dick with a chuckle he goes all shaky in the legs everyone laughed except george he does not she said nothing scares timmy not even me so shut up dick it may be that it would be best for only one or two of us to go right into the depths of the caves went on julian if so the rest must wait in hiding just keep on the lookout for any signal from me i dont expect we shall see a soul down there tonight but you never know if there is a way through the cliffs to that underground chamber where we saw the golden statues we shall be in real luck we shall then be absolutely certain how things can be taken in and out taken in but i thought they had been there for ages said dick and were probably only taken out to sell smuggled out well i think it may be more than that said julian it might even be a central clearingground for a great gang of highclass thieves who would hide valuable stolen goods there till it was safe to sell them however thats only guessing i think somebodys discovered the underground chamber full of that rich old mans treasures and is taking them out bit by bit said dick anyway whatever it is its awfully exciting to think we know so much all because we went down the well to get some water said anne put on your sweaters said julian it may be freezing cold in the wind that rages round those cliffs im longing to start said george its an adventure this do you hear that timmy an adventure anything more julian asked anne julian always sounded so very grownup when he gave them a plan of campaign she felt very proud of him thats the lot said julian except that well have some sort of a meal before we go this evening wilfrid will have to lead the way for us as hes the only one who knows it but when we come to the cliff ill lead you down cant have anyone missing a footstep and rolling headlong frightening any robber or smuggler do you hear that timmy said george and timmy whined and put a paw on georges knee as if to say its a pity you havent sure feet like mine with rubber pads beneath so that your footing is always sure george patted his paw yes youve fine sure feet tim i wish i could buy some like them the time seemed to go very very slowly after that everyone was eager to start and kept looking at their watches the sun left a bright glow in the sky so they would probably start more or less in daylight which would however soon fade into twilight they had another meal but strangely enough nobody felt very hungry were too excited said julian giving timmy a biscuit timmy was the only one who didnt seem at all excited as for george she fidgeted and fidgeted until everyone was quite tired of her at last they started off wilfrid led them at first as he knew the way actually he found that he didnt really know it it was the loud wind that guided him just as it had done before awfully like faroff voices shouting to one another he said and everyone at once agreed when they came near to the cliff the sound gradually changed into the mournful wailing noise that gave the cliffs their name eeeeeeoooooooeeeeeeeeahooo not very nice said anne shivering a little it sounds as if someone is crying and sobbing and howling good name for this place wailing cliff said dick i say what a wind up here im glad my hairs my own it would certainly be blown off if it werent hang on to old timmy george hes more blowable than we are not so heavy george put her hand on timmys collar at once how dreadful if timmy were to be blown over the cliff he gave her a grateful lick he didnt like the wind here very much it had a truly miserable voice they came to the edge of the cliff and looked down cautiously in case anyone should be on the rocks below but except for some big gulls preening their feathers there there was no sign of life no boats about no steamer nothing said dick all clear julian julian had been looking for a good path down the cliff there didnt seem to be a continuous one well have to go so far then climb down a bit then walk along that ledgy bit see then climb down that slanting rock the great big one and get down on to the more level rocks ok everyone ill let timmy go first said george he is so surefooted and will know the best way go on timmy lead us down timmy understood at once and went in front of julian he took the first little path down the cliff slid down the next bit walked along the ledge that julian had pointed out and then stood and waited for everyone he gave a little bark as if to say come along its easy follow me they all followed some more carefully than others george and wilfrid were least careful and poor wilfrid lost his footing and slid quite a long way on his behind he didnt like it at all and looked quite scared watch your feet now wilfrid said julian its getting a bit dark so dont try any funny tricks you tried to jump over that big stone instead of stepping over carefully i really dont want to send timmy down to the bottom of the cliff to pick up your pieces at last they were all down the cliff and on the rocks below the tide was out so that waves did not splash up and soak them anne suddenly slipped into a pool and made her shoes wet but that didnt matter they were only rubber ones now exactly where did you see those men wilfrid asked julian stopping on a big flat rock wilfrid jumped beside him and pointed see the cliff over there see that funny rock shaped rather like a bear well thats where i saw the men they went by that rock and disappeared right said julian now no more talking please though this wailing sound would drown almost anything follow me he went over the rocks towards the big bearlike one that wilfrid had pointed to the others followed a little tide of excitement welling up inside them anne caught hold of wilfrids hand and squeezed it exciting isnt it she said and wilfrid nodded eagerly he knew he would have been scared stiff by himself but with the others it was an adventure a really exciting adventure they came to the bearlike rock near it was a dark place in the cliff a way in thats where the men came out julian said wilfrid keeping his voice low do we go in there we do said julian im going in first and im going to stand quite still and listen as soon as i get the sound of the wind and sea out of my ears if i hear nothing ill whistle see then you can all come in too right said everyone thrilled they watched as julian went to the dark slitlike opening he paused and looked inside it was so dark that he knew they would all need their torches he switched on his powerful one and shone it into the passage he saw a ditch that ran slanting upwards for some way and on either side a rocky ledge not too rough water ran down the rocky ditch and bubbled out beside him to join the sea over the rocks im just going into the cliff tunnel a little way to see if i can hear anything or anyone he said wait here he disappeared inside the dark opening and everyone waited in impatient excitement a gull suddenly swooped down close to their heads eeooo eeooo eeeooo it screeched and made them all jump violently wilfrid almost fell off his rock and clutched at george timmy growled and looked up angrily at the seagull silly bird frightening everyone like that there came a low whistle and julian appeared again his torch switched on all clear he said i cant hear a sound inside the opening and ive been some way along its not hard going theres a funny little stream flowing down and a ledge either side we can walk on very convenient now no talking please and be careful even of your whispers every sound seems to be magnified in here keep hold of timmy george in the steepest places timmy gave a little whine of surprise when george took him inside the cliff at once his whine was magnified all round them and everyone jumped timmy didnt like it at all george took firm hold of timmys collar youre to keep close by me she whispered and youre not to make a sound this is an adventure timmy a big adventure and youre in it as much as any of us come along and there they go all of them climbing up the dark passage into the cliff what will they find what will they see no wonder their hearts beat fast and loudly no wonder timmy keeps close to george an adventure he must be on guard then anything might happen in an adventure chapter sixteen a queer journey underground it was very dark inside the cliff the childrens torches made bright streaks everywhere and were very useful indeed for seeing the safest places to tread as julian had told the others there was a curious little stream flowing down the middle of the steep passage with uneven ledges on each side of it it had worn this little channel for itself during the many many years it had flowed down inside the cliff its probably water draining from the surface of the cliffs said julian in a low voice picking his way carefully be careful here the ledges are very slippery oooh said wilfrid treading on a slippery bit and finding one of his feet in icecold water the echo took up the noise at once oooohoooooohoooooh poor wilfrids little oooh echoed up and down and all round them it was very weird indeed and nobody liked it anne pressed close to julian and he squeezed her arm comfortingly sorry about my oooh said wilfrid in a low voice my oooh oooh oooh said the echo at once and george simply couldnt help giving a giggle which at once repeated itself a score of times you really will have to be quiet now came julians serious voice almost in a whisper i have a feeling were coming to some big opening theres suddenly a great draught blowing down this steep passage i can feel it round my head the others felt it too as they climbed higher up the steep passage trying to avoid the tiny stream that splashed down its worn channel it made a nice little noise very cheerful anne thought and gleamed brightly in the light of their torches julian wondered how in the world anyone could take crates or boxes down such a steep dark passage its wide enough i suppose he thought but only just and the bends in it must be very awkward for boxes to get round i do hope we dont meet anyone round a bend carrying a crate or two my word the draught is quite a wind now there must be an opening somewhere ju weve not only gone upwards weve gone a good way forward too whispered anne wasnt the old castle somewhere in this direction yes i suppose it would be answered julian stopping to think gosh i wonder if this passage comes up in one of its cellars an old castle like that would have huge cellars and probably a dungeon or two for prisoners let me think we must have left the cliff behind now and yes i think we may be heading for the castle why didnt i think of that before well then the wellwall must run down beside the castle foundations said dick in much too loud a voice the echo made everyone jump violently and julian stopped climbing and hissed at dick whisper cant you idiot you nearly made me jump out of my skin skin skin skin said the echo in a peculiar whisper that made george want to laugh sorry whispered back dick i think you may be right about the wellwall running down beside the foundations of the castle julian said whispering again i never thought of that the castle wasnt very far from the well it would probably have enormous cellars spreading underground the wall in the well that that queer little door was in was terrifically thick said dick i bet i was looking into one of the castle cellars when i peeped through it this was all very interesting julian thought about it as they went on and on through the endless passage it ran more or less level now and was easy to walk through for it was much wider i think this part of the passage was manmade said julian stopping and facing the others his face bright in the light of their torches he went on in a loud whisper up through the cliff the passage was a natural one awfully dificult to climb but here its quite different look at these old bricks here probably put there to strengthen the tunnel yes a secret way from the castle to the sea said dick almost forgetting to keep his voice down in his excitement i say isnt it thrilling everyone began to feel even more excited all except timmy who didnt much like dark secret passages and couldnt imagine why julian was taking them for such a gloomy and peculiar walk he had splashed solemnly through the stream the whole time finding the stone ledges much too slippery for his paws the draught grew stronger and was very cold indeed were coming near to the opening where the draught comes from whispered julian all quiet now please they were as quiet as possible and anne began to feel almost sick with excitement where were they coming to then suddenly julian gave a low exclamation here we are an iron gate they all tried to crowd round julian to see the gate was a big strong one with crisscross bars of iron they could easily see between the bars and they shivered in the draught that swept through the great gate julian shone his torch through the bars his hand shaking in excitement the bright ray of light ran all round what looked like a stone room quite small with a stout nailstudded door at the far end this door was wide open and it was through this that the steady draught blew this is a cellar or a dungeon more likely said julian i wonder if the gate is locked he shook it and it swung open quite easily as if it had been welloiled julian stepped into the dungeon flashing his torch all round the dark and dismal little place he shivered its cold as ice even on this warm day he said my word i wonder how many poor miserable prisoners have been kept down here in the cold look heres a staple in the wall said dick standing beside him examining the halfhoop of iron deeply embedded in the stone wall i suppose the unhappy prisoner was tied up to this to make his punishment even worse anne shivered how could people be so cruel she said her vivid imagination seeing wretched men here with perhaps only crusts of bread to eat water to drink no warmth no bed only the stone floor perhaps some of them escaped out of the gate and went down the cliffpassage she said hopefully no its much more likely that the passage was used to get rid of the prisoners said dick they could be dragged down to the sea and drowned and nobody would ever know dont tell me things like that said anne it makes me feel i shall hear groans and cries i dont like this place lets go i hate it too said george and timmys tail is right down i feel as if this horrid dungeon is full of miserable memories julian do lets go julian walked over to the nailstudded door and went through the doorway he looked out on to a stone paved passage with stone walls and ceiling he could see other doors ironbarred along a dismal stone passage he came back to the others yes these are the castle dungeons he said i expect the castle cellars are somewhere near too where they stored wine and food and other things come on lets explore i cant hear a sound i think this place is absolutely empty they all followed julian down the stone passage looking in at each miserable dungeon as they passed horrible dirty damp cold bare poor poor prisoners of long ago at the end of the passage was another ironbarred door but that too was wide open they went through it and came out into an enormous cellar old boxes were there old wormeaten chests broken chairs loose papers that rustled as their feet touched them the kind of junk that can be found in a thousand cellars it all smelt rather musty though as julian said the draught that blew everywhere took away some of the smell they came to some stone steps and went up them at the top was another great door with an enormous bolt on it fortunately the bolt is our side said julian and slid it out of its socket he was surprised that it went so smoothly he had expected it to be rusted and stiff its been oiled recently he said shining his torch on it well well other people have been here not long ago and used this door wed better go quietly in case they are still here annes heart began to beat loudly again she hoped there was no one waiting round a corner to jump out at them be careful julian she said somebody may have heard us they may be waiting to ambush us they all right anne dont worry said julian old timmy would give us a warning growl if he heard a single footstep and good gracious at that very moment timmy did give a growl an angry startled growl that made everyone jump and then stand still holding their breath dick looked round at timmy who was growling again his head was down and he was looking at something on the floor what was it dick swung down his torch to see then he gave a small laugh its all right we dont need to be scared yet look what timmys growling at they all looked down and saw a great fat toad its brilliant eyes staring steadily up at them as they exclaimed at it it turned aside and crawled slowly and clumsily to a little damp spot in the corner of the wall ive never seen such a big toad in my life said anne it must be a hundred years old goodness timmy you made me jump when you suddenly growled like that the toad squatted down in its corner facing them it seemed to glare at poor timmy come away tim said dick toads can ooze out a very nastysmelling nastytasting stuff never bite a toad julian had now gone through the door at the top of the steps he gave a loud exclamation so loud that the others rushed to him in alarm wondering what was exciting him look said julian shining his torch into the dark space beyond see where weve come to did you ever see such a storehouse of wonders chapter seventeen in the treasure chamber julians torch shone steadily into the vast room which seemed to have no end the others shone their torches too and timmy pressed between their legs to see what the excitement was what a sight they were actually in the enormous chamber that the boys had seen through the opening in the wellwall what a place it was absolutely vast thought anne awed at the size the height and the great silence there are the golden statues said dick going over to a group of them wonderful queer faces they have though not like ours and look how their slanting eyes gleam when we shine our torches on them makes them look as if theyre almost alive and looking at us anne suddenly gave a cry and rushed over to something the golden bed she said i wished i could lie on one and now i shall and with that she climbed on to a vast fourposter bed with a great canopy now rotting to pieces the bed gave a mournful creak and the part that anne was lying on suddenly subsided the canopy collapsed and anne disappeared in a cloud of dust the bed had quite literally fallen to pieces poor anne the others helped her up and timmy looked at the clouds of dust in surprise what was anne doing making such a dust he sneezed loudly and then sneezed again anne sneezed too she scrambled quickly out of the collapsed bed and dusted herself down it has a gold carved headpiece and gold legs and endpiece said dick shining his torch on it what a monster of a bed though i should think six people could sleep in it at once what a pity it has been lost here so long all the hangings fell to pieces as soon as anne climbed on the bedpart what a dust there was no doubt about it there were priceless treasures in this vast underground cellar the children could not find the sword with the jewelled handle nor the necklace of rubies which julian thought were probably locked away in one of the chests but they found many other wonderful things look in this chest this beautiful carved chest called anne gold cups and plates and dishes still bright and clean and look whats in here shouted george wrapped up in stuff that falls to pieces when i touch it they crowded round a great enamelled box in it was a set of animals carved out of some lovely green stone they were absolutely perfect and when anne tried to stand them up each of them stood as proudly as once they did many many years ago when little princes and princesses played with them theyre made of green jade said julian beautiful goodness knows how much theyre worth they should be in some museum not mouldering away in this cellar why didnt those collectors take these and the golden statues and all the other things wondered anne well thats obvious said julian for one thing this is a secret cellar i should think and nobody would be able to get into it unless they knew the secret way to it theres probably a sliding panel or hidden door that leads to it somewhere in the castle above its very old and ruined in many parts and some of the walls have fallen in so i suppose it was pretty impossible to get to the cellars even if the secret way was known yes but what about the way we came up said dick from the sea up the cliff passage well i dont know exactly why that hasnt been used before said julian though i could make a guess did you notice that great heap of fallen rocks near the entrance to the cliff passage i should think that that part of the cliff fell at one time and hid the passage completely blocked it up then maybe a storm came and the sea shifted some of the rocks and lo and behold there was the secret passage open again and somebody found it somebody perhaps who had heard the old legends about the castle of whispering island said anne a collector of old things do you think asked george what about those two men on the island the ones we saw in the courtyard do you suppose they know of this entrance yes probably said julian and its likely they were put on guard in case anyone else found it and came to rob the secret chamber the things here are priceless those men are not there to guard the animals on the island as they were in the old ladys day she had genuine keepers like that nice old man lucas who told us about this island the other day you think these men are in somebodys pay then somebody who knows about this great chamber under the castle and wants to get the centuriesold treasures said dick yes said julian and whats more i dont believe that the real owner of the island the greatnephew of the old lady who owned it even knows theyre here or that anyone is taking things from his island for all we know he may live in america or australia and not care tuppence about his island how extraordinary said anne if i owned an island like this id live here and never leave it and all the animals and birds would be protected as they once were and dear anne what a pity it isnt yours said julian ruffling her hair but now the thing is what are we going to do about all this well talk about it when were back at the cottage my word its getting late it will be pitch dark outside unless the moon is up and the sky is clear of clouds well come on then lets go said dick making for the great nailstudded door then as timmy suddenly gave a bloodcurdling growl he stopped in fright they had shut the door but now it was opening somebody was coming into the great underground chamber who could it be quick hide said julian and he pushed the two girls behind a great chest the others were near the golden bed and they crouched behind it at once dicks hand on timmys collar he had managed to stop the dog from growling but was afraid that timmy would begin again at any moment a man came into the room one of the two big fellows that the children had seen in the courtyard he didnt seem to have heard timmy growling for he sauntered in whistling lightly he shone his torch all round and then called loudly emilio emilio there was no answer at all the man yelled again and then an answer came from beyond the door and hurrying footsteps could be heard then in came the other big rough fellow and looked round shining his torch he lighted an oil lamp on a box and switched off his torch always you sleep emilio growled the first man always you are late you know the boat comes tonight to take the next batch of goods have you the list we must wrap them up quickly and take them to the shore that little statue has to go i know he went over to the statue of a boy whose eyes gleamed with emeralds well boy said the man youre going out into the world howll you like that after being in the dark so long dont glare at me like that or ill box your ears apparently the golden boy went on glaring for the man gave his head a sharp smack the other fellow came over and shifted a long deep box over from the wall to the little golden statue then he began to wrap it up carefully rolling material round and round it from head to foot while the golden boy stood patiently what time is lanyon coming for it asked emilio have i time to wrap another yes that one over there said the first fellow pointing emilio went whistling over to it passing the chest behind which the girls were hiding they crouched right to the floor afraid of being seen but emilio was sharpeyed and thought he saw something move as he passed by the chest he stopped what was that poking out by the side of the chest a foot a foot emilio rushed round the chest his torch switched on again he gave a loud shout carlo theres someone here come quickly carlo the second man dropped what he was holding and raced round to emilio who had now pulled the girls roughly to their feet what are you doing here how did you get in shouted emilio julian shot out from his hidingplace at once followed by dick and wilfrid george was doing all she could to hold back timmy who was now deafening everyone with his angry barks he did his best to get away from george but she was afraid he might fly at emilios throat the two men were full of amazement to see the five children and timmy keep that dog back or ill shoot him said carlo producing a gun who are you what do you mean by coming into this place we came by boat but the boat got washed out to sea said julian weve been camping on the island we just er wandered into this place by mistake by mistake well i can tell you that youve certainly made the biggest mistake in your life said carlo youll have to stay here for quite a long time till our jobs done at any rate whats your job asked julian bluntly wouldnt you like to know said carlo well one part of it is to guard the island and keep off strangers now weve jobs to do tonight and tomorrow and im afraid youre going to have a miserable time youll stay down here in this old cellar till we come back again and what will happen to you after that i dont know because ill have to tell my employer youve been spying down here i wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt hand you over to the police or lock you up down here for a month on bread and water timmy growled very fiercely indeed and tugged hard to get away from george and fly at this hateful man she hung on to him for all she was worth though how she longed to let him leap at the man and get him on the ground better go carlo or well miss that boat out there said emilio grumpily well deal with these kids when we get back he shouldered the box into which he had put the wrapped statue and started for the door carlo followed him backing all the time to make sure that george did not set timmy on to him he shut the great door with a loud bang and shot the bolt dont say anything for a minute in case they are listening outside the door said julian so they all stood in silence annes knees trembling a little oh dear how unlucky to be caught like this relax said julian at last you all look so stiff and tense well i should think so said dick i dont particularly want to stay shut up here till those men deign to come back and do a bit more stealing suppose they never came back wed be here for keeps no dick said anne and to everyones surprise she began to laugh we can easily escape what through that locked and bolted door said dick not a hope but we can easily escape said anne and george suddenly brightened up and nodded her head smiling oh yes of course dont look so solemn dick look up there dick looked up to where anne was pointing what am i supposed to look at he said the old stone wall no just there over the top of that tall chest said anne dick looked and then a large smile came over his face what an idiot i am thats the old iron door in the side of the old wellwall isnt it the opening i looked through it looks just like an ordinary ventilation hole from down here and i dont really believe anyone would ever notice it except us who know what it is i see what youre getting at anne good old anne said george realizing what anne had in mind of course weve only got to climb up to that hole in the wall open the door there and then go up the well and were safe yes but its easier said than done said julian soberly weve got to get hold of the rope and climb right up it to the top not very easy suppose the ropes at the top with the bucket hanging on the hook said anne wed never reach it then well think of something said julian anyway its our only hope of escape now well push that huge high chest or wardrobe or whatever it is right over against the wall under thit opening into the well and then well haul a table on top of that theres a sturdy little one over there come on well be through that opening in no time and up the well what a shock for dear emilio and carlo when they come back and find that the birds have flown chapter eighteen a most exciting time it was quite a job pushing the heavy chest over towards the stone wall of the castle it took all of them shoving with all their might to do it we seem to be making an awful noise with the chest scraping over the floor panted dick i hope were not heard timmy wished he could help he kept jumping up and pressing his paws on the side of the chest but dick stopped him youre getting in the way he said you go and sit near the door and warn us if you hear those men coming so timmy ran to the door and sat there his head cocked to one side listening while the others went on shoving the heavy chest along at last it was in position then came the job of hoisting a stout little wooden table on top julian climbed up to the top of the chest to take the table from dick but just couldnt manage it it was so heavy and solid so wilfrid climbed up beside him and between the two of them they pulled up the little oblong table and set it firmly on top of the chest julian stood on it and found he could easily reach the little iron door that led into the old well good he said and he gave the door a hard shove it shook a little but didnt budge he gave it another hard push whats up said dick climbing up beside julian it must open the bolts not there any more it fell off into the well i expect its rusted a little again well both shove it together the girls watched the boys anxiously dreading every moment to hear the two men returning together the boys pushed at the iron door and it groaned and then gave way swinging open inside the wellwall to the boys delight there was the rope hanging near them weve done it dick called down softly to the girls well come down and help you up to the table here then well try our luck up the well the girls were soon on the chest top there wasnt room for everyone on the table and the boys were debating what to do next you go up the rope julian said dick you can climb up to the top and get out and look around and make sure theres no one about then wilfrid can climb up do you think you can wilfrid of course said the boy then i can help julian to wind up the girls right said dick ill stay here with the girls and help each of them on to the rope first anne and you two can wind the rope up with her on it then george can go and ill follow last of all and shut the welldoor and when the men come they wont know how in the world we got out of the treasure chamber said anne grinning what a shock for them when youve all gone up safely ill climb in myself and shut the door said dick ready ju ill shine my torch for you julian nodded he squeezed through the old iron door reached out for the rope and swung on it for a moment then up he went handoverhand till he reached the top a little out of breath but delighted to be out in the open air and the bright moonlight it seemed almost as light as day he called down the well im at the top dick and alls well moons out and all is quiet you next wilfrid said dick can you get hold of the rope all right do you think for pitys sake dont fall into the water my torch will give you plenty of light dont worry about me its just like being on the ropes at gym in school said wilfrid scornfully he swung his legs into the opening leapt at the rope hung on and began to climb up just like a monkey julians voice came down the well again echoing hollowly sounding rather queer wilfrids safely up now send anne well wind up the rope for her so that she doesnt need to climb only to hang on through the opening went anne and sat on its ledge can you swing the rope a bit julian she called its rather far for me to jump good gracious for goodness sake be careful called julian in alarm tell dick to help you but the wellwall opening was so small that dick couldnt even look through it while anne was sitting there dont jump till youve got firm hold of the rope anne he told his sister anxiously is ju swinging it to and fro can you see it clearly its so dark in the well and my torch isnt too good now yes i can see it said anne it bumped against my legs then and i just missed getting it here it comes again ive got it im going to hold on to it tightly and drop off the ledge here i go she sounded very much braver than she felt she let herself drop off the ledge and there she swung on the thick rope with the black water far below wind me up ju she called and held on as the two boys at the top exerted all their strength dick saw her disappear up the well and heaved a sigh of relief now for george he climbed down from the table and chest and looked for george and timmy shining his torch everywhere to his utmost surprise he couldnt see them he called softly timmy a small stifled whine came from somewhere dick frowned george where are you for goodness sake buck up and come out from where youre hiding those men might come back at any time dont play the fool a dark curly head poked out from behind a large box near the door and george spoke in a very fierce voice you know timmy cant hang on to a rope hed fall and be drowned i think you are all horrid to forget that he cant climb im staying here with him you go on up the well certainly not said dick at once i shall stay here with you i suppose its no use asking you to let me stay with tim while you climb up not the slightest use hes my dog and im jolly well sticking by him said george hed never desert me im sure of that dick knew george only too well when she was in one of her determined moods nothing absolutely nothing would make her change her mind all right george i expect id feel the same if timmy was mine said dick im staying here with you though no said george well be all right tim and i dick ran to the chest and table that he had used to get up to the opening in the wellwall and climbed quickly to the top he swung himself through sat on the edge of the opening and called up the well julian are you there listen george wont leave timmy because he cant climb up the rope so im staying with her no sooner had he said these words than he heard someone unlocking the door of the room they were in timmy growled so fiercely that dicks heart jumped in fear suppose tim leapt at those men and one of them had a gun george heard the noise of the key turning in the door and quick as lightning she went behind a pile of boxes with timmy go for them timmy just as soon as you can she said get them down before they can hurt you woof said timmy understanding every word he stood beside george ears cocked showing his teeth in a snarl the door opened and a man came in carrying a lantern ive brought you a light he began and then timmy leapt at him crash down went the lantern and the light went out down went the man too shouting in fear as the big dog leapt on his chest his hairy face so close that the man could feel the dogs hot breath the mans head struck against the edge of a chest and he was suddenly still and silent knocked out i do believe said dick to himself and very cautiously shone his torch round yes there was the man on the floor eyes closed unmoving george was at the open door looking out timmy by her side dick im taking timmy down the secret way through the cliffs ill be perfectly safe with him i must tell julian said dick hes still at the top of the well expecting you and timmy you go as quickly as you can and be careful timmy will look after you george disappeared at top speed her shoes making no sound she looked anxious but not afraid good as a boy thought dick for the hundredth time every bit as good as a boy doesnt turn a hair now id better get back to that opening in the well and tell julian that george and timmy have gone down the secret way that man is still knocked out thank goodness he was soon on top of the chest and table and peering through the hole he could see the light from julians torch far away at the top the light flashing on and off as if signalling dick called up julian oh so youre still there said julian sounding very relieved anything happened yes said dick ill tell you in a minute swing the rope a bit ju the rope swung near dick and he caught it and was just about to swing himself into the well when he heard a noise he looked back into the vast room which was now in darkness for he had switched off his torch someone came in hurriedly whats happened why didnt you then he stopped as the light from the lantern he carried picked out the figure of the man on the floor he gave an exclamation and knelt down by him dick grinned to himself what about a nice little shock for this fellow he reached down to the sturdy little table gave it a shove that sent it hurtling down to the floor and then swung himself into the well on the rope he was just in time to see the table fall with a crash by the man with the lantern and to hear him shout in fear and then julian and wilfrid hauled him up the well still grinning to himself bit of a shock for those men he thought george and timmy disappeared and the rest of us gone most mysteriously pull julian pull ive a nice little story to tell you and soon he was up on the wellwall telling the others what had happened they laughed in delight good old george good old timmy george knows the way down the cliff passage all right and if she didnt timmy would take her safely said julian well go down on the rocks and meet her i think she should be all right because the moons out now and everything is as light as day and off they all went through the wood laughing when they thought how puzzled and mystified those men must be chapter nineteen anne is a tiger in the meantime george was hurrying down the secret way through the cliffs timmy ran first in front and then behind his ears pricked for any possible pursuer or danger he could hear no one good both he and george were glad to hear the babbling of the funny little underground stream as it ran swiftly down towards the sea its a nice friendly sound tim said george i like it once or twice they slipped from the wet ledges into the water and george felt a bit afraid of falling and breaking her torch it wouldnt be much fun if we had to go down this passage in the pitch dark she told timmy and he gave a little woof of agreement whats that bright light said george suddenly stopping in the passage look tim awfully bright is it someone coming with a lantern timmy gave a loud bark and rush in front he knew that lantern all right it was the one that somebody sometimes hung in the sky and that george called the moon didnt she know george soon did know of course and cried out in delight oh its the moon of course dear old moon id forgotten it was a moonlight night tonight i wonder where the others are timmy youll have to smell them out timmy already knew where they were he had caught their scent on the wind they werent very far away he barked joyously soon they would all be together again he and george came out of the tunnel in the cliff and found themselves on the rocks the sea was splashing over them and the waves gleamed brightly in the bright moonlight george saw something moving in the distance she put her hand on timmys collar careful tim she said is that someone coming over there stay by me but timmy disobeyed for once he leapt away and splashed through pools over seaweed over slippery rocks barking madly timmy called george not recognising who was coming timmy come back and then she saw who were coming over the rock in the bright moonlight picking their way through the slippery seaweed she waved and shouted joyfully here i am ive escaped all right what a joyful meeting that was they all sat down on a convenient rock and talked nineteen to the dozen telling each other what had happened and then a big wave suddenly came up and splashed all over them blow said julian tides coming in i suppose come on lets get back to whispering wood anne gave a most enormous yawn i dont know what the time is she said and its so bright everywhere that im not sure if its day or night all i know is that im suddenly most awfully sleepy julian glanced at his watch its very late he said long past our bedtime what shall we do risk sleeping here on the island or find wilfrids boat and row across to the mainland and have a nice long peaceful snooze in that dear little cottage oh dont lets stay on the island said anne id never go to sleep id be afraid those men would find us dont be silly anne said george trying not to yawn they wouldnt have the remotest idea where to look for us i honestly dont fancy looking for wilfrids boat rowing all the way to the mainland and then climbing up that steep hill to the cottage well all right said anne but oughtnt somebody to be on guard oughtnt we each to take turn why so fussy anne asked george timmy would hear anyone i suppose he would said anne giving way well stay here then they were all very tired the boys pulled up armfuls of old dry bracken and spread it in a sheltered patch of grass where bushes surrounded them and sheltered them from the wind it was not far from the cove where wilfrids boat lay they snuggled into the bracken nice and cosy said george yawning ohhh ive never felt so sleepy in my life and in three seconds she was sound asleep wilfrid dropped off at once too and dick and julian were soon giving little gentle snores anne was still awake she felt nervous id dearly like to know if those men are safely underground she thought i cant imagine that they are very pleased at us getting away theyll know well go to the mainland as soon as we can and tell everyone what we have found i should have thought they would try to stop us leaving they must hnow we have a boat she lay and worried keeping her ears open for any strange sound timmy heard her tossing and turning and crept over to her very quietly so as not to wake george he lay down beside anne giving her a loving lick as if to say now you go to sleep and ill keep watch but still anne didnt fall asleep still she kept her ears wide open for any unusual sound and then quite suddenly she heard something so did timmy he sat up and gave a very small growl anne strained her ears yes it was certainly voices she could hear low voices that didnt want to be heard it was the men coming to find wilfrids boat once they had that the children couldnt get away from whispering island timmy ran a little way from the bushes and looked round at anne as if to say coming with me anne got up quietly and went to timmy he ran on in front and she followed she really must see what was happening then if it was anything important she could run back and rouse everyone timmy was taking her to the cove where wilfrid had left his boat hauled high up on the sand for fear of big waves they were both as quiet as they could be timmy growled a little when he heard the voices again much nearer this time the men had come quietly round the island in their own boat to set wilfrids boat adrift anne saw them pushing wilfrids boat down the sand towards the sea once it was adrift she and the others would be prisoners on the island she yelled at the top of her voice you stop that its our boat and timmy began to bark his head off prancing round the men and showing his big white teeth the barking awoke all the others and they leapt up at once thats timmy shouted julian thats timmy barking come on quickly but be careful they ran at top speed to the cove timmy was still barking madly and someone was yelling it sounded like anne anne no no it couldnt be quiet little anne thought julian but it was for when the four arrived at the cove there was anne yelling to timmy to bite the men and dancing about in a rare old temper how dare you come and take our boat ill tell timmy to bite you and he will too get them tim get them how dare you take our boat bite them timmy timmy had already bitten both the men who were now rowing away in their own boat at top speed anne picked up a stone and sent it whizzing after them it struck their boat and made them jump anne jumped too when she turned and saw julian george wilfrid and dick im so glad youve come she said i think timmy and i have frightened them off the beasts frightened them off youve scared them stiff said julian hugging his sister you even scared me good gracious the mouse has certainly turned into a fearsome tiger i can almost see smoke coming out of your nostrils a tiger did i really sound like a tiger said anne im glad i hated you all thinking i was a mouse youd better be careful now i might turn into a tiger again the men were now out of sight and timmy sent a volley of barks after their vanished boat what chance had any men against a dog and a tiger woof julian why cant we row back to the mainland now demanded anne im so hungry and theres nothing to eat here now and i wasnt really very comfortable in that brackeny bed im longing to sleep in a proper bed ive a good mind to take that boat of wilfrids and row myself back if you dont want to come julian couldnt help laughing at this new fierce anne he put his arm round her i believe its dangerous to say no to a tiger he said so you shall have your way anne im awfully hungry too and i bet the others are and in five minutes time the six of them were out on the sea julian taking one oar and dick the other swishswash swishswash went the oars and the boat rocked as it sped along i bet if those men spot us out on the sea in a boat going across to the mainland they will feel pretty uncomfortable said julian theyll know well be going to the police first thing tomorrow my word this has been quite an adventure hasnt it i shall be glad of a little peace now well youll soon have it julian that little cottage is waiting for you all with its glorious view over the harbour and whispering island youll have quite a bit of excitement tomorrow of course when the police take you back to the island in their boat and you show them the old well the vast treasurechamber the secret passage and all the rest youll be there when all the men are rounded up youll watch them chugging off prisoners in the police boat amazed that the famous five should have defeated them what an adventure and what a relief when all the excitement is over and you lie peacefully on the hillside with the little cottage just behind you now for a real lazy time said anne when the five had seen the last of the police lets all go out on the hill in the sunshine and have orangeade and biscuits and fruit salad and wilfrid shall play his magic pipe and bring his furred and feathered friends to see us has he found his pipe then said dick pleased yes he took the wellbucket to get some water to drink and lo and behold the pipe was in the bottom of the bucket said anne he thinks it must have fallen there the last time he went to fetch water from the well and nobody noticed it oh good said george thankfully wilfrid what about playing a tune on your little pipe im so glad its found id like to hear it again wilfrid was pleased all right he said ill see if my friends here still remember me he sat down on the hillside a little away from the others and began to blow down the pipe and out came the strange little tune at once the birds in the trees around turned their heads in the bushes the lizards raised themselves put their quaint heads on one side and listened rabbits stopped their play the big hare bounded up the hill its great ears taking in every note a magpie flew down to the boys foot and sat there wilfrid didnt stir he just went on playing as the creatures came to listen timmy listened too and went to the boy pressing against him licking his ear then he went back to george well leave them all there in the sunshine quiet and peaceful watching the little creatures that wilfrid can always bring around him julian is lying back looking at the april sky glad that their adventure ended so well dick is looking down at whispering island set in the brilliant blue harbour anne is half asleep quiet little anne who can turn into a tiger if she has to and george of course is close to timmy her arm round his neck very happy indeed goodbye five it was fun sharing in your grand adventure
