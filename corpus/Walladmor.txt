walladmor dedication to ws the german translator of walladmor sir having some intention of speaking rather freely of you and your german translation in a postscript to the second volume of my english one i am shy of sending a presentation copy to berlin neither you nor your publisher herr herbig might relish all that i may take it into my head to say yet as books sometimes travel far if you should ever happen to meet with mine knocking about the world in germany i would wish you to know that i have endeavoured to make you what amends i could for any little affront which i meditate in that postscript by dedicating my english translation to yourself you will be surprised to observe that your three corpulent german volumes have collapsed into two english ones of rather consumptive appearance the english climate you see does not agree with them and they have lost flesh as rapidly as captain le harnois in chapter the eighth the truth is this on examining your ship i found that the dry rot had got into her she might answer the helm pretty well in your milder waters but i was convinced that upon our stormy english seas she would founder unless i flung overboard part of her heavy ballast and cut away some of her middle timbers which i assure you were mere touchwood i did so and she righted in a moment and now that i have driven a few new bolts into her calked her and payed her i am in hopes she will prove seaworthy for a voyage or so we have a story in england rather trite here and a sort of philosophic commonplace like buridans ass between two bundles of hay but possibly unknown in germany and as it is pertinent to the case between ourselves i will tell it the more so as it involves a metaphysical question and such questions you know go up to you people in germany from all parts of europe as to the courts abovesir john cutler had a pair of silk stockings which stockings his housekeeper dolly continually darned for the term of three years with worsted at the end of which term the last faint gleam of silk had finally vanished and sir johns silk stockings were found in their old age absolutely to have degenerated into worsted stockings now upon this a question arose among the metaphysicians whether sir johns stockings retained or if not at what precise period they lost their personal identity the moralists also were anxious to know whether sir johns stockings could be considered the same accountable stockings from first to last and the lawyers put the same question in another shape by asking whether any felony which sir johns stockings could be supposed to have committed in youth might lawfully be the subject of an indictment against sir johns stockings when superannuated whether a legacy left to the stockings in the second year could be claimed by the stockings at the end of the third and whether the worsted stockings could be sued for the debts of the silk stockings some such question i conceive will arise upon your account of st davids day as darned by myself but here my good sir stop a moment i must not have you interpret the precedent of sir john and dolly too strictly sir johns stockings were originally of silk and darned with worsted but dont conceit that to be the case here no no my good sir i flatter myself the case between us is just the other way your worsted stockings it is that i have darned with silk and the relations which i and dolly bear to you and sir john are precisely inverted what could induce you to dress good st david in an old threadbare coat it passes my skill to guess it is enough that i am sure it would give general disgust and therefore i have not only made him a present of a new coat but have also put a little embroidery upon it and i really think i shall astonish the good folks in merionethshire by my account of that saints festival in my young days i wandered much in that beautiful shire and other shires which he contiguous and many a kind thing was done to me in poor mens cottages which to my dying day i shall never be able to repay individually hence as occasions offer i would seek to make my acknowledgments generally to the county upon penmorfa sands i once had an interesting adventure and i have accordingly commemorated penmorfa to the little town of machynleth i am indebted for various hospitalities and i think they will acknowledge that they are indebted to me exclusively for their mayor and corporation and there are others in that neighbourhood that when they read of st davids day will hardly know whether they are standing on their head or their heels as to the bishop of bangor of those days i owed his lordship no particular favor and i have here taken my vengeance on that see for ever by making it do suit and service to the house of walladmor but enough of st davids day there are some other little changes which i have been obliged to make in deference to the taste of this country in the case of captain le harnois it appears to me that from imperfect knowledge of the english language you have confounded the words sailor and tailor for you make the captain talk exactly like the latter there is however a great deal of difference in the habits of the two animals according to our english natural histories and i have therefore slightly retouched the captain and curled his whiskers i have also taken the liberty in the seventh chapter of curing miss walladmor of an hysterical affection what purpose it answered i believe you would find it hard to say and i am sure she has enough to bear without that your geography let me tell you was none of the best and i have repaired it myself it was in fact a damaged lot something the public will bear topographical sins dwindle into peccadilloes in a romance and no candid people look very sharply after the hydrography of a novel but still it did strike me that the case of a mans swimming on his back from bristol to the isle of anglesea was more than the most indulgent public would bear they would not stand it sir i was convinced besides it would have exposed me to attacks from mr barrow of the admiralty in the quarterly review especially as i had taken liberties with mr croker in a note your chronology was almost equally out of order but i put that into the hands of an eminent watchmaker and he assures me that he has regulated it and will warrant its now going as true as the horse guards well to conclude i am not quite sure but we ought to be angry at your taking these sort of hoaxing liberties with our literati and i dont know but some of us will be making reprisals what should you say to it in germany if one of these days for example you were to receive a large parcel by the postwagen containing posthumous works of mr kant i wont swear but i shall make up such a parcel myself and if i should i bet you any thing you choose that i hoax the great bavarian professor with a treatise on the categorical imperative and the last words of mr kant on transcendental apperception look about you therefore my gay fellows in germany for if i live you shall not have all the hoaxing to yourselves footnote mr schelling for whom however without any joke at all i profess the very highest respect meantime mine dear sare could you not translate me back again into german and darn me as i have darned you but you must not sweat me down in the same ratio that i have sweated you for if you do that i fear that my dimensions will become invisible to any thick sight in germany and i shall present no mark to the critical enemy darn me into two portly volumes and then i give you my word of honor that i will again translate you into english and darn you in such grand style that if dolly and professor kant were both to rise from the dead dolly should grow jealous of me and kant confess himself more puzzled on the matter of personal identity by the final walladmor than ever he had been by the cutlerian stockings jusquau revoir my dear principal hoping that you will soon invest me with that character in relation to yourself and sign as it is now my turn to sign your obedient but not quite faithful translator footnote to dedication footnote mr schelling for whom however without any joke at all i profess the very highest respect german translators dedication to sir walter scott bart sir uncommon it may certainly be but surely not a thing quite unheard of that a translator should dedicate his translation to the author of the original work and the translation here offered to your notice being as the writer flatters himself by no means a common one he is the more encouraged to take this very uncommon liberty ah sir walter did you but know to what straits the poor german translator of walterscottish novels is reduced you would pardon greater liberties than this ecoutez first of all comes the bookseller and cheapens a translator in the very cheapest market of translationjobbers that can be supposed likely to do any justice to the work next the sheets dripping wet as they arrive by every post from the edinburgh press must be translated just as they stand with or without sense or connexion nay it happens not unfrequently that if a sheet should chance to end with one or two syllables of an unfinished word we are obliged to translate this first instalment of a future meaning and by the time the next sheet arrives with the syllables in arrear we first learn into what confounded scrapes we have fallen by guessing and translating at haphazard nomina sunt odiosa else but i shall content myself with reminding the public of the wellknown and sad mishap that occurred in the translation of kenilworth in another instance the sheet unfortunately closed thus to save himself from these disasters he became an agent of smith and we all translated um sich aus diesen trbseligkeiten zu erretten wurde er agent bei einem schmiedemeister that is he became foreman to a blacksmith now sad it is to tell what followed we had dashed at it and waited in trembling hope for the result next mornings post arrived and showed that all germany had been basely betrayed by a catchword of mr constables for the next sheet took up the imperfect and embryo catchword thus field matches or marriages contracted fur the sake of money and the whole gasman sentence should have been repaired and put to rights as follows er negocirte um sich aufzuhelfen die sogenannten smithfields heirathen oder ehen welche des gewinnstes wegen geschlossen werden i say it should have been but woe is me it was too late the translated sheet had been already printed off with the blacksmith in it lord confound him and the blacksmith is there to this day and cannot be ejected you see sir walter into what sloughs of despond we german translators fall with the sad necessity of dragging your honor after us yet this is but a part of the general woe when you hear in every booksellers shop throughout germany one unanimous complaint of the nonpurchasing public and of those great profitabsorbing whirlpools the circulating libraries in short all possible causes of diminished sale on the one hand and on the other hand the forestalling spirit of competition among the translationjobbers bidding over each others heads as at an auction where the translation is knocked down to him that will contract for bringing his wares soonest to market hearing all this sir walter you will perceive that our old german proverb eile mit weile ie festina lente or the more haste the less speed must in this case where haste happens to be the one great qualification and sinequnon of a translator be thrown altogether into the shade by that other proverb wer zuerst kommt mahlt zuerst first come first served i for my part that i might not lie so wholly at the mercy of this tyrant haste struck out a fresh path in which you sir were so obliging as to assist me but see what new troubles arise out of this to the unhappy translator the world pretends to doubt whether the novel is really yours people actually begin to talk of your friend washington irving as the author and god knows whom beside as if any man poets out of the question could be supposed capable of an act of selfsacrifice so severe as that of writing a romance in vols under the name of a friend all this tends to drive us translators to utter despair however i in my garret comfort myself by exclaiming odi profanum if i cannot altogether subjoin et arceo from your obliging disposition sir walter i anticipate the gratification of a few lines by the next post establishing the authenticity of walladmor should these lines even not be duly certified coram notario duobusque testibus yet if transmitted through the embassy they will sufficiently attest their own legitimacy as well as that of your youngest child walladmor notwithstanding what i have said about haste i fear that haste has played me a trick here and there the fact is we are in dread of three simultaneous translations of walladmor from three different publishers and you will hardly believe how much the anxiety lest another translation should get the start of us can shake the stoutest of translating hearts the names of lindau methusalem mller dr spieker von halem and loz sound awfully in the ears of us gentlemen of the trade and now alas as many more are crowding into this quinquevirate should it happen that the recent versions of your works had not entirely satisfied your judgment and that mine of walladmor had i would in that case esteem myself greatly flattered by your again sending me through the house of b a copy of the manuscript of your next romance in provision for which case i do here by anticipation acknowledge my obligations to you and in due form of law bind myself over to the making good all expenses of copy c to the translation of both prose and verse according to the best of my poor abilities that your eminent name may not fall into discredit through the translators incompetence to all possible affection friendship respect c in so far as you yourself shall be pleased to accept of any or all of these from the german translator of walladmor footnotes to the german dedication footnote oh spirit of modern scepticism to what shocking results art thou leading us already have lycurgus romulus numa c been resolved into mere allegorized ideas and a learned friend has undertaken to prove within the next years according to the best rules of modern scepsis that no such banker as mr rothschild ever existed that the word rothschild in fact was nothing more than a symbolic expression for a habit of advancing loans at the beginning of the th century which indeed the word itself indicates if reduced to its roots i should not be surprized to hear that some man had undertaken to demonstrate the nonexistence of sir walter scott already there are symptoms abroad for the mysterious author of waverley has in our own days been detected in the persons of so many poets and historians the most opposite to each other that by this time his personality must have been evaporated and volatilized into a whole synod of men note of the dedicator footnote names of persons who have translated one or

faerie queene b v c ii perhaps the reader may still remember the following article in the times newspaper which about a year or two ago raised a powerful interest on the welch coast carnarvonyesterday the inhabitants of this city were witnesses to a grand but afflicting spectacle from the highlands of the coast the steamvessel halcyon from the isle of wight and bound to the north coast of wales was suddenly in midchannel when not a breath of wind ruffled the surface of the sea driven into our bay scarcely had she rounded the point of harlech when we beheld a column of smoke rising and in a moment after a dreadful report echoing from the mountains made known that the powder magazine was blown up and the ship shattered into fragments the barks which crowded to the spot from all quarters found nothing but floating spars and were soon compelled to return by the comingon of a dreadful hurricane of the whole crew and of sixty passengers chiefly english people returning from france not one is saved it is said that a very atrocious criminal was on board the halcyon we look with the utmost anxiety for the details of this melancholy event to the grief of several noble families in england this account was confirmed in its most dreadful circumstances some days after the bodies of lord w and of sir o that distinguished ornament for so long a period of the house of commons were found upon the rocks so much were they disfigured that it was with difficulty they were recognized on that day there stood upon the deck of the halcyon a young man who gazed on the distant coasts of wales apparently with deep emotion from this reverie he was suddenly roused as the ship whirled round with a hideous heaving he turned as did all the other passengers who had been attracted on deck by the beauty of the evening to the man at the helm he was in the act of stretching out his arms to the centre of the ship whence a cloud of smoke was billowing upwards in voluminous surges the passengers turned pale the sailors began to swear its all over they shouted old davy has us so huzza lets have some sport as long as he leaves us any daylight amidst an uproar of voices the majority of the crew rushed below stove in the brandycasks drank every thing they could find and paid no sort of regard to the clamorous outcries of the passengers for help help except that here and there a voice replied help there is no help old nick will swallow us all so let us swallow a little comfort first the master of the vessel who retained most presence of mind hurried on deck with his sabre he made a cut at the ropes which suspended the boat and as he passed bertram the young man already mentioned who in preparation for the approaching catastrophe had buckled about his person a small portmanteau and stood ready to leap into the boat with a blow of his fist he struck him overboard all this was the work of a minute scarcely had the young man been swept to a little distance by a wave when the ship blew up with a tremendous crash the shattered ruins were carried aloft to an immense elevation bertram was stunned by the explosion and upon recovering his senses he saw no object upon the surface of the waters the ship had vanished and nothing remained but a few spars floating in the offing urgent distress throws us back upon our real and unfanciful wants in the peril of the moment bertram forgot all the prospects sad or gay painful or flattering which had occupied his thoughts on board the ship and exerted his utmost force to swim through the tumbling billows to a barrel at a little distance which appeared and disappeared at intervals sometimes riding aloft and sometimes hidden by the waves at the moment when his powers began to fail him he succeeded in reaching the barrel but scarcely had he laid hold of the outermost rim with both hands when the barrel was swayed down from the opposite side a shipwrecked man whose long wet hair streamed down over his face fixed his nails as it were the talons of a vulture on the hoops of the barrel and by the energy of his gripe it seemed as though he would have pressed them through the wood itself he was aware of his competitor and he shook his head wildly to clear the hair out of his eyes and opened his lips which displayed his teeth pressed firmly together no though the d l himself thou must down into the sea for the barrel will not support both so speaking he shook the barrel with such force that the young man had he not been struggling with death would have been pushed under water both pulled at the barrel for some minutes without either succeeding in hoisting himself upon it in any further contest they seemed likely to endanger themselves or to sink together with the cask they agreed therefore to an armistice each kept his hold by his right hand each raised his left aloft and shouted for succour but they shouted in vain for the storm advanced as if it heard and were summoned by the cry the sky was black and portentously lurid thunder now began to roll and the waves which had hardly moved before the explosion raised their heads crested with foam more turbulently at every instant it is in vain said the second man heaven and earth are against us one or both must perish messmate shall we go down together at these words the wild devil all at once left loose of the barrel by which means the other who had not anticipated this movement lost his balance and was sinking his antagonist made use of his opportunity he dashed at the sinking mans throat in order to drag him entirely under the water but he caught only his neckhandkerchief which luckily gave way the other thus murderously assaulted on finding himself at liberty for an instant used his time and sprang upon the barrel and just as his desperate enemy was hazarding a new attack in a death struggle he struck him with his clenched fist upon the breast the wild man threw up his arms groaned sank back and the waves swallowed him up in the moments of mortal agony and conflict human laws cease for punishments have lost their terrors even higher laws are then silent but in the pauses of the struggle the voice of conscience resumes its power and the heart of man again relents as bertram went rocking over the waves numbed in body and exhausted in spirits all about him hideous gloom and the fitful flashes of lightning serving but to light up the great world of terrors this inner voice was not so silenced but that he felt a pang of sorrow at the thought of having destroyed the partner of his misfortunes a few minutes however had scarcely passed before he heard a groaning near him happily at this instant a flash of lightning illuminated the surrounding tract of water and he descried his antagonist still fighting with the waves he was holding by a spar too weak to support his weight but capable of assisting him in swimming his powers were apparently failing him as he looked up to his more fortunate enemy he stretched out his hand to him and said stranger show me this pity all is over with me or in a moment will be should you have a happier fate take from my pocketbook this letter and convey it to the lady oh if thou hast ever loved i beseech thee to do this tell her that i never ceased to think of her that i thought of her only when i was at the point of death and whatsoever i may have been to man that to her i have been most faithful with frantic efforts he strove to unclasp his pocketbook but could not succeed bertram was deeply touched by the pallid and ghastly countenance of the man in whose features however there was a wild and licentious expression which could not be mistaken and he said to him friend below if i should have better luck i will endeavour to execute your commission meantime i can swim and i have now rested myself give me your hand you may come aloft and i will take a turn in the waters until i am tired in this way by taking turn about possibly both of us may be saved what cried the other are you crazy or are there really men upon this earth such as books describe no matter said bertram give me your hand and spring up i will catch at the barrel when i feel weak the other grasped the outstretched hand and supporting himself for a few moments upon his elbows gradually ascended the barrel bertram on his part resigning the portmanteau to his companion slipped off into the waves meanwhile the storm continued and the natural darkness of night was now blended with the darkness of tempest after some minutes the man who was at present in possession of the barrel began thus you fool below there are you still alive yes but i am faint and would wish to catch hold of the barrel again catch away then do you know any thing of the sea hereabouts no it was the first time in my life that i was ever on shipboard the other laughed you dont know it well now i do and i can tell you this theres no manner of use in our plaguing ourselves and spending the last strength we have in keeping ourselves afloat i know this same sea as well as i know my own country and i am satisfied that no deliverance is possible there is not a spot of shore that we can reach not a point of rock big enough for a seamew and the only question for us is whether we shall enter the fishes maw alive or dead it is still possible said the other that some human brother may come to our assistance the other laughed again and said human brother eh methinks my friend you should be rather young in this world of ours and have no great acquaintance with master man i know the animal and you may take my word for it that on such a night as this no soul will venture out to sea what man of sense indeed would hazard his life for a couple of ragamuffins like you and me and suppose he would who knows but that it might be worse to fall into the hands of some men of sense than into the tender mercies of the sea but i know a trick worth two of that tell it then let us leave fooling this cask on which i sit to my knowledge contains rum or arrack which is as good we can easily knock a hole in it then make ourselves happy and bouzy fling our arms about each other like brothers and go down together to the bottom after that i think we shall neither trouble nor be troubled for we shall hardly come up again if we go down groggy shocking why thats suicide well is your conscience so delicate and scrupulous however as you please for any thing i care and as you like it better some dog of a fish may do for us what we might as well have done for ourselves but now come aloft my darling ill take my turn at swimming as long as the state of things will allow it and wait for you below they changed situations but even upon the barrel bertram began to feel his powers sinking he clung as firmly as he could but the storm grew more and more terrific and many times he felt faint in his wild descents from the summit of some mounting wave into the yawning chasm below nature is benign even in the midst of her terrors and when horrors have been accumulated till man can bear no more then his sufferings are relieved for a time by insensibility on awakening it is true that the horrors will return but the heart has gained fresh strength to support them so it fared with bertram who continued to grow fainter and fainter until at length in the midst of silent prayer he finally lost all consciousness when bertram next awoke from his fainting fit he heard the sea no longer thundering about him and no longer felt himself tossing upon its waves there was darkness around him but not the darkness of that mighty night which the elements in uproar form what first met his eyes was the obscure outline of a rude hut for a long time he stared without consciousness upon the rafters of the ceiling on which fish and ragged aprons were hung up to dry and swinging to and fro in the current of air this monotonous motion which under other circumstances might have lulled him to sleep like the ticking of a clock gradually awoke him to entire consciousness the awful scene which had just passed over him came up to his mind in sudden contrast with that bright moment on the deck of the halcyon in which he had first beheld the coasts of wales lying in sunshine before him and his thoughts soon took a coherent arrangement though he could not yet make out the connexion between the barrel on which he had navigated the ocean and his present bed nor between that fearful night abroad and the dried herrings and patched aprons which now dangled above him these thoughts however gave way at this moment to anxiety about his portmanteau this to his great satisfaction he found beneath his head and he now turned his attention to the other objects about him the cottage was of that humble order which in this kingdom are found only at the extremities of the scotch highlands and tenanted by a race of paupers who gain a scanty subsistence from the limpits and other marine products which they take at low water the framework of the hovel was rudely put together of undressed pineboughs the walls were a mixed composition of clay turf seaweed muscleshells and flints timbers had been laid for the mainbeams of a ceiling but they were not connected by joists nor covered in so that the view was left open to the summit of the roof which being composed of sedge and moss allowed a passage to the wind and rain in the little room were hanging all kinds of utensils but in so confused an arrangement and in so dubious a light that bertram could make out but little of what he saw the sole light in the hut proceeded from a fire in the corner but this fire was so sparingly fed that it seldom blazed up or shot forth a tongue of flame except when a draught of wind swept through which however happened pretty often the smoke escaped much less through the chimney than through the chinks of the wall enveloping every object in a dusky shade and deepening the gloom perfect silence reigned in the house and no living creature appeared to be present but once when the fire happened to shoot forth a livelier gleam the clouds of smoke parted and discovered a female countenance old and with striking features and fixing a pair of large darkgrey eyes upon a pan or cauldron which hung over the fire sometimes when a cloud of vapour arose from the pan and collected in a corner into fantastic wreaths she pursued it with her eyes and a smile played over her withered cheeks but when it dispersed or escaped through the chinks a low muttering and sometimes a moaning might be distinguished she had as bertram observed a spinningwheel between her feet but busy as her hands seemed and mechanically in motion it was evident that she did little or no work at intervals she sang but what she sang was more like a low muttered chaunt than a regular song at least bertram understood not a word of it if words they were that escaped her after one of these chaunts the old woman rose suddenly from her seat wrung her hands seemed to trace strange circles in the air and then scattered some substance into the fire which raised a sudden burst of flames that curled over the cauldron lit up the house for a few moments and then roaring up the chimney left all in greater darkness than before during these few moments however bertram had time to observe the whole appearance of the woman with some distinctness she seemed to have the stature of a wellgrown man but her flesh had fallen away so remarkably that the red frieze gown which she wore hung in loose folds about her much as bertram was shocked at first by the spectacle of her harsh bony lineaments her fiery eye and her grey disheveled hair he yet perceived in her face the traces of former beauty she raised her bony arms as if in supplication to that quarter of the room where bertram was lying he perceived however that it was not himself but some object near him which drew her attention to his great alarm he now discovered close to himself a chair the only one in the room and sitting upon it some motionless figure in the attitude of a living man the old woman stretched out her hands with more and more earnestness to this object as though she looked for some sign from it but receiving none she struck her hands violently together in a transport of rage upset the spinningwheel and fell back into her seat if bertram had at first felt compassion on witnessing the expressions of her grief and the anguish of her expectation this feeling was soon put to flight by the frantic explosion of anger which followed so great was his consternation that he resolved to attempt escaping unobserved from the cottage and he first hoped to recover his full selfpossession when he should find himself at liberty and in the open air with this intention it may be readily imagined how much his consternation was increased on finding himself unable to stir either hand or foot his head even moved with difficulty and it seemed as though no faculty had been left unaffected but that of eyesight which served but to torment him by bringing before him this scene of terror he could almost have wished to exchange his present situation for his recent exposure to the fury of the elements he attempted to sleep but found himself unable and after the lapse of two long hours he heard a knocking at the door chapter ii tit fear her not lucius somewhat doth she mean canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus boy my lord i know not i nor can i guess unless some fit or frenzy do possess her for i have heard my grandsire say full often extremity of griefs would make men mad and i have read that hecuba of troy ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear tit andron act iv the knocking grew louder and louder but the old woman answered not a word on the contrary she seemed only the more earnestly intent on her spinning at length a little rustling was heard by some artifice the door was unbolted from the outside and somebody stepped in even then the old woman did not stir from her seat and the man who had entered flinging down a heap of old drift wood opened the conversation himself whats the matter now mother that you keep me so long waiting waiting retorted the old woman without raising her eyes from her wheel you waiting humph a pretty waiting i should have if i were to wait on every idle fellow that knocks aye mother but think of the weather and the frost that the frost i tell thee what a bonnier lad than thou and one that i loved better far lies frozen in his grave well heres a brave load of wood i gathered it on the beach wood aye ragged fragments theres many such drifting about in this world like enough mother and ragged as they are theres many a bold fellow with rags on his back that would be glad to warm his hands over them theres one in his grave will never warm himself again and here the old woman began to mutter her unintelligible songs so the old crooning said the young man to himself and going up to the fire he said mother you mind nothing youve no thought for any of us and one of these days youll be doing something or other that will bring the police rats upon us and then alls up and we shall all go to the old tree to the tree go and welcome and ill go with you all the tribe of you is not worth a hair of him that i knew once and when the day comes that some are outside and knocking at the door that shall knock well i wot one of these days and all you are hushed and trembling within and the proudest of you shaking at the knees then comes my time for laughing and i will open the door and cry here they are the young man muttered something to himself pushed aside the cauldron and laid on some faggots and dry wood so that the rude hovel was suddenly illuminated with splendour aye said the old woman best make a beaconfire and light all the constables up hither well better be hanged than freeze but mother mother wheres the warm broth for the poor perishing soul when he wakes what said the old woman angrily shall i go down on my knees and tend him like a son of my own well i remember the day woe is me that they all scoffed at me when i moaned for one that was not a stranger as gods my help ill be no laughingstock again its my turn to laugh next but nicholas mother its nicholas that bids us tend him and our souls are pledged for the strangers nicholas eh oh yes bonny nicholas and his soul is in pledge too the old one has had him once by the head and for that time he let him go but he has him for all that the noose is fast and theres no sheers will ever cut that noose without paying any further regard to her words the young man filled a kettle with water and placed it on the fire then shaking the old womans arm as if to rouse her like a child into some attention to his words he said to her earnestly mother gillie now boil the seamans drink of thyme groundivy pepper ginger honey brandy and all that belongs to it you know how make it as you make it for shipwrecked folk and give it every hour to the poor soul there and remember this mother gillies life answers for his like a child that has been told to do something under pain of punishment the old woman answered aye aye thyme groundivy pepper ginger and went about her work the young man then came up to the bed and laying his hands on bertram said ah poor soul hell never be warm again the sea has broke over him too roughly but no matter mother gillie must brew the drink if the man were a corpse for nicholas has said it well mother god bless you and another time when a christian and one of us knocks at the door on a winters night sing out come in and if he should chance to be cold and thirsty give him a glass of brandy and think now and then that a living man is made of flesh as well as bones whither away then tom to grace ill warrant the wench that has snared thee and carries thee away from all thy kinsfolk no i must be gone to the castle for sir morgan hunts in the morning ah that sir morgan that sir morgan he wheedles thee tom and to serve him thou leavest thy old mother he and the young lady and that lass grace build houses for thee but a mothers curse will pull them down mother the baronet is my good friend his father gave mine the oatfield by the shore his grandfather saved mine from death in canada and the walladmors have still been good masters and we have still been faithful servants and let the white hats say what they will them that the quality calls radicals my notion is that people should stick to their old masters and be true to them and thats best for both sides go get thee gone to thy boat falsehearted lad snakes will rear their heads out of the water and seize on him that honoureth not his parents and that forgetteth his brother without shewing the least displeasure at these angry words tom took his leave and the old woman now addressed herself in good earnest to the task of preparing the cordial for the young stranger he meantime had gradually recovered his entire selfpossession and from the conversation between mother and son most of which he understood he had drawn conclusions which tended more and more to alarm him at his total loss of power over his limbs from the expressions of the old woman which marked an entire indifference about him he anticipated that she would be apt to mistake his apparent want of animation for a real one and busied himself with all the horrors which such an error might occasion but he was mistaken the old woman followed the directions of her son to the letter when her preparations were finished a pleasant odour began to diffuse itself over the house she drew near to the sick stranger and rubbed his breast with a handful of the liquor almost immediately he felt the genial effects the muscles of his face relaxed he breathed more freely his lips opened and she poured a few spoonfuls of the cordial down his throat then wrapping him up in blankets she raised him with a strength like that of a stout man rather than of an aged woman and laid him down by the fireside here the cordial combined with previous exhaustion and agitation and the genial warmth of the fire soon threw him into a profound sleep he slept as powerless as a child that is rocked by its nurse lulled by the unintelligible songs which the old woman continued to murmur to her spinningwheel and which still echoed through his dreams though they had lost their power to alarm him some hours he had slumbered when he suddenly awoke to perfect consciousness and what gave him still greater satisfaction to the entire command of his limbs he unswathed himself from his blankets stood upright on his feet and felt a lively sense of power and freedom as he was once more able to stretch out his arms and legs in the house all was silent the fire upon the hearth was glimmering with a sullen glow of red light and it appeared to be about daybreak window there was none but through a sort of narrow loophole penetrated a grey beam of early light this however lent no aspect of cheerfulness to the hut on the contrary the ruddy blaze of a fire had given a more human and habitable though at the same time more picturesque air to a dwelling which seemed expressly contrived to shut out the sun and the revelations of day light looking round he observed that the old woman was asleep he drew near and touched her she did not however awaken under the firmest pressure of his hand but still in dreams continued at intervals to mutter and to croon snatches of old songs an instinctive feeling convinced bertram that he was a prisoner and that it would be advisable for him to quit the hut clandestinely this purpose he prepared to execute as speedily as possible without delay he caught up his portmanteau and advanced to the door it cost him no great trouble to find the bolts and to draw them without noise but on opening the door and shutting it behind him he found himself in fresh perplexity for on all sides he was surrounded by precipitous banks of earth and the faint light of early dawn descended as into a vault through a perforated ceiling however he discovered in one corner a rude ladder by means of which he mounted aloft and now found that the roof of this vault consisted of overarching eglantine thorn bushes furze and a thick growth of weeds and tangled underwood from this he soon disengaged himself turning round and finding that the hut had totally disappeared from sight he now perceived that the main body of the building was concealed in a sort of cleft or small deserted quarry whilst its roof irregularly covered over with mosses and wild plants was sufficiently harmonized with the surrounding brakes and in some places actually interlaced with them effectually to prevent all suspicion of human neighbourhood at this moment a slight covering of snow assisted the disguise and in summer time a thicket of wild cherry trees woven into a sort of fortification by an undergrowth of nettles brambles and thorns sufficiently protected the spot from the scrutiny of the curious having wound his way through these perplexities he found his labour rewarded for at a little distance before him lay the main ocean he stood upon the summit of a shingly declivity which was slippery from the recent storm and intersected by numerous channels so that he was obliged in his descent to catch hold of the bushes to save himself from falling the sea was still agitated the sky was covered with scattered clouds and in the eastern quarter the sun was just in the act of rising not however in majestic serenity but bloodred and invested with a pomp of clouds which reflected from their irongrey the dull ruddy colors of the sun when the sun rises red said bertram it foreshows stormy weather have i then not had storms enough in this life he looked down upon the sea and saw the waves as they rolled to shore bringing with them spars sails cordage c which either dashed to pieces against the rocks or by the reflux of the waves were carried back into the sea strange said he what has with difficulty escaped the sea after struggling fruitlessly for preservation is destroyed in a moment or carried back into the scene of its conflicts is not this the image of my own lot with what mysterious yearning did i long for england all the difficulties which threatened me on the continent i surmounted only to struggle for my life as i came within view of the english shores to witness the barbarizing effects upon human kindness of death approaching in its terrors and at last perhaps to find myself a helpless outcast summoned again to face some new perils he still felt the effects of his late exhaustion and sitting down upon a large stone he threw his eyes over the steely surface of the sea looking upwards again he was shocked at beholding a few paces from him the tall erect person of his hostess she stood upon a point of rock with her back to the sun and intercepting his orb from bertram so that her grey hair streaming upon the wind her red cloak which seemed to be set as it were in the solar radiance and the lower part of her figure which was strongly relieved upon the tremulous surface of the sea gave to her a more than usually wild and unearthly appearance bertram shuddered as before a fiend whilst the old woman by whose side crept a large wolfdog said with an air of authority so then i see the old proverb is true save a drowning man and beware of an adders sting but i have power and can punish the thankless heart so rise traitor and back to the house bertram felt himself too much reduced in spirits and too little acquainted with the neighbourhood to contest the point at present he considered besides that he was really indebted to her for attentions and hospitality and was unwilling to appear in the light of a thankless guest in this feeling he surrendered himself to her guidance but to gratify his curiosity he said good mother i owe you much for my recovery but who is it that i must thank for my deliverance from the water i was lying upon a barrel at the mercy of the waves i lost my senses and on recovering i find myself with you and know not how or by whose compassion what then youll never be a hair the drier for knowing that but mother i had a companion in my misfortunes was he saved along with me or have the waves parted us for ever never trouble yourself about that you are saved thats news enough for one day if the other fellow is drowned all the better for him hell not need hanging here the old woman laughed scornfully and sang a song of which the burthen was high is the gallows the ocean is deep one aloft one below how sound is their sleep bertram now descended again into the hovel and finding that the old woman would answer no more questions he stretched himself upon his bed and throughout the day resigned himself to the rest which his late exhaustion had rendered necessary from a slumber into which he had fallen towards evening he was awaked by a gentle pressure upon his arm he unclosed his eyes for one moment but shut them again immediately under the dazzling glare of a resinous torch which the old woman held in his present situation he thought it best to dissemble and therefore kept his eyes half closed peering at the same time from beneath his eyelids and watching the old womans motions she was kneeling by the side of his bed with her left hand she raised aloft a torch with her right she had raised a corner of the blanket and was in the act of examining his left arm having stripped his shirt sleeve above his elbow and appearing at this moment to be in anxious search of some spot or mark of recognition her whole attitude and action betrayed a feverish agitation her dark eyes flashed with savage fire and seemed as though straining out of their sockets and bertram observed that she trembled a circumstance which strikingly contrasted with the whole of her former deportment which had discovered a firmness and intrepidity very alien to her sex and age presuming that her guest was asleep the old woman now transferred her examination to his right arm which lay doubled beneath his body and which she endeavoured gently to draw out not succeeding in this she made an effort to turn him completely over to this effort however without exactly knowing why bertram opposed all the resistance which he could without discovering that he was awake and the old woman unless she would rouse him up which probably was not within her intention found herself obliged to desist her failure however seemed but to increase the fiendish delirium which possessed her she snatched a blazing pinebough from the fire stepped into the centre of the room and waving her torch in fantastic circles about her head began a solemn chaunt in a language unknown to bertram at first low and deep but gradually swelling into bolder intonations towards the end the song became more rapid and impetuous and at last it terminated in a sort of wild shriek keeping her eyes fixed upon bertram as if to remark the effect of her song upon him the old woman prepared to repeat it but just at this moment was heard the sound of voices approaching a wild hubbub succeeded of wrangling laughing swearing from the side on which bertram had ascended the ladder and directly after a clamorous summons of knocking pushing drumming kicking at the door the aged hostess faithful to her custom laid down her pinebrand on the hearth arranged the blanket again and seated herself quietly without taking any notice of the noise only whilst she turned her spinningwheel she sang in an under voice he that knocks so loud must knock once and again knock soft and low or ye knock in vain mean time the clamorers without contrived to admit themselves as the young man had done before but did not take the delay so patiently it was a company of five or six stout men any of whom to judge by their appearance a traveller would not have been ambitious of meeting in a lonely situation the general air of their costume was that of seafaring men close short jackets long roomy slops and coloured handkerchiefs tied loosely about the neck and depending in long flaps below the breast a fishermans hat with large slouched brim was drawn down so as nearly to conceal the face all wore sidearms and some had pistols in their belts in colours their dress presented no air of national distinction for the most part it seemed to be composed of a coarse sacking originally gray but disfigured by every variety of stains blended and mottled by rain and salt water bertram could discover no marks of rank or precedency amongst these men as they passed him one by one each turning aside to throw a searching glance on the apparently sleeping stranger as they advanced to the old woman they began to scold her so at least bertram gathered from their looks gestures and angry tones for they spoke in a language with which he was wholly unacquainted she whom they addressed however seemed tolerably familiarized to this mode of salutation for she neither betrayed any discomposure in her answers nor ever honoured them by raising her eyes to their faces but tranquilly pursued her labours at the spinningwheel it was pretty evident that the aged woman exercised a very remarkable influence and some degree of authority over these rough seamen she allowed them to run on with their peal of angry complaint and as soon as the volley was over she started up to her feet with an authoritative air and uttered a few words which interpreted by such gestures as hers would have been understood by a deaf man as words of command that looked for no disobedience the men muttered swore a little and cursed a little and then sitting down in any order and place just as every man happened to find a seat made preparations for a meal such as circumstances allowed broth was simmering on the fire from various baskets were produced bread shipbiscuit and brandy dried haddock and sprats were taken down from the chimney fresh herrings were boiling and in no long space of time the whole wealth of the hut together with no small addition imported by the newcomers seemed in a fair way of extinction bertram felt violently irritated by appetite to jump up and join the banqueters for this was the second night since his shipwreck and he was beginning to recover from his fatigues but doubts and irresolution checked him and a misgiving that this was not the most favourable moment for such an experiment especially as he perceived that he himself was the subject of general conversation without relaxing in their genial labours the men showed sufficiently by their looks and gestures that they were deliberating on some question connected with himself the old woman now and then interposed a word and the name of nicholas as bertram remarked was often repeated by all parties some person of this name continued to occupy the conversation an hour longer frequently it happened that one or other of the company uttered an oath in english or dutch and seemed disposed to pursue the conversation in one of those languages but in such cases the old woman never failed to check him either by signs or in her own language which was wholly unintelligible to bertram so that of the entire conversation he could make out nothing more than that it related to himself after the lapse of about an hour the whole party retired and the hut was again restored to its former solitude and quiet chapter iii this loller here wol prechen us somwhat nay by my fathers soule that shal be nat sayd the shipman here shal be nat preche he shal no gospel glosen here ne teche we leven all in the gret god quod he he wold sowen som difficultee or springen cockle in our clen come chaucer as soon as the last echo of the retreating footsteps had died away bertram raised himself up from his couch and playing the part of one just in the act of awaking he yawned and asked for something to eat and drink the old woman grumbled and fetched him the remains of a jug of whiskey with some biscuit and fish never troubling herself to inquire about the palateableness of these viands bertram ate and drank with as little scrupulousness as belonged to his situation and then finding his spirits somewhat restored he began to question his hostess afresh good mother i know not whether i was dreaming or half awake but it seemed to me that there were fishermen or some such people in the house and that the refreshment i have just taken came from their table aye said the old woman drily they can find time to dream that do little with their hands but what would you have me do my good hostess have you any work for me the old woman shook her head well then give me the means of going where i have something to do and where is that the coast of wales for which i was bound when i met with my misfortune the coast of wales never trouble it theyve rogues enough already then fixing her eyes steadily on bertram she looked thoughtfully and shook her head were you ever in wales before never look well to yourself then and why the gallows is high my bonny lad and they dont stand much upon ceremony what is it then you take me for am i like a thief or a robber i know not but youve a wicked look of one that i know well and hes doomed to the gallows if theres a gallows in england the old woman now relapsed into her moody silence or answered only by peevish monosyllables and despairing of gaining any further information from her bertram contented himself with requesting that she would acquaint him with the first opportunity which might offer for quitting his present abode upon which his hostess muttered something in no very cordial or acquiescing tone and bertram drawing the blankets about him resigned himself to the consideration of his present prospects he was now so much recovered from his late suffering and exhaustion that he felt prepared to set his hostess and her wolfdog at defiance but the scene which he had just witnessed suggested another kind of dangers he feared that he had been thrown on a nest of smugglers or worse some piratical attempts had recently been made on the belgian flag off antwerp the parties concerned were said to be smugglers occupying some rock or islet off the coast of wales and into their hands bertram began to fear that he had fallen closing his eyes he continued to ruminate on these possibilities until at length he dropped into a slumber from this he was awakened in the middle of the night by a hand laid roughly on his shoulder he stared up and beheld the old woman at his bedside get up said she or it will be too late yonders a french captain taking water aboard make haste and hell give you a passage bertram sprang from his couch recompensed his hostess and hastily prepared for departure in the midst of this hurry however his thoughts had leisure to revert to those anxieties which had occupied him as he was falling asleep who was this french captain whither bound what was his connexion with those in whose hands he now found himself on what terms and with what motives had they treated for his passage when all is darkness however the benighted traveller surrenders himself to the guidance of any light though possibly no more than a wildering ignis fatuus in the hope that it may lead him out of his perplexities and fortunately bertram had little time to pursue any train of anxious deliberations for at this moment two seamen appeared at the door with a summons to follow them the french captain having taken his water aboard and being on the point of weighing his anchor having made up his mind to take his chance bertram prepared cheerfully to follow his conductors first offering his acknowledgments however in few words to his ancient hostess who on her part muttered some indistinct reply without raising her eyes or quitting her usual posture at the spinningwheel the night was profoundly dark even after they had cleared the brushwood and tangled thickets which smothered up the rocky vault the weather however was calm a star or two gleamed out from the thick pall of clouds and the sea broke upon the coast with no more than its ordinary thunders supported by his two guides bertram easily contrived to slide down the shingly precipice and on reaching the bottom crossed the beach and stepped on board a very large twelveoared boat heavily laden in the bottom were lying a number of casks and bales and she was full of men but what particularly struck bertram was the gloomy silence which prevailed so opposite to the spirit of life and gaiety which usually attend the embarkation of sailors whilst the boat was now cutting her way through the waves and the monotonous stroke of the oars broke upon the silence of the night bertram had leisure to renew his speculations upon the nature of his immediate prospects a slight circumstance gave them a favourable color at this moment a nightbreeze was sweeping pretty freshly over the water and bertram who had preserved but a slender wardrobe from his shipwreck felt its influence so much that he shivered from head to foot this was not unobserved and one of the men drew out a large woollen boatcloak and wrapped it about him with an air of surly goodnature this was a trifle but it indicated that he had fallen amongst human hearts and it is benignly arranged by providence that as in this life trifles light as air furnish the food of our fears our jealousies and unhappy suspicions so also oftentimes from trifles of no higher character we draw much of our comfort our hopes and assurance although the boat was rowed stoutly yet being very deeply laden nearly an hour elapsed before she fell alongside the french captain a solitary lanthorn or two were twinkling from the sides and they were hailed by the party who had the watch with a qui va l uttered however as bertram remarked in a cautious and subdued tone to this challenge the boat returned for answer pcheurs du roi et de la sainte vierge upon which ropeladders were dropped the boats company ascended and the barrels c were hoisted up by pullies to the deck bertram admired the activity address and perfect orderliness with which so many heavy casks were raised above the decks and then lowered into their several stations at the same time that he could not but suspect from their number and appearance that the business of watering was not the only one which had induced the french captain to drop his anchor at this point it tended however somewhat to abate these suspicions that by the flashes of the lanthorns as they played unsteadily upon the guns anchors and tackling of the vessel he could distinguish the lilies of france and upon inquiry from the helmsman who spoke to him however in english he learned that he was on board a french corvette les trois fleurs de lys at this moment the wind veered a point and instantly a voice of thunder was heard exclaiming mort de ma vie look sharp by the three names of satan ill send you a message else from this little brace of bulldogs you there at the foresheet be handy will you or by our lady ill nail you to the mast until the cormorants have made their breakfast all was now life and activity the sails were bent and furled men and boys were crawling about every part of the rigging the helmsman took his quiet station and just as day began to break the trois fleurs de lys with all sails set was running gaily before a fresh breeze of wind she had made a good deal of way before there was light enough for bertram to examine the coast he was leaving and by the time he became able to use his eyes with effect all the details by which it was possible to have identified the exact situation of his late confinement were obliterated and melted into indistinct haze which preserved only the great outlines of the coast in these the principal feature was a bold headland and within that a pretty deep bay what is that promontory called said bertram addressing an old sailor who was passing him at the moment what that right a helm said the sailor yes they call that lubbers point and what do you call the bay beyond the bay why buttermilk bay and tother horn to leward is cape sugarcandy so saying the old sailor hitched his trowsers and with perfect gravity passed on leaving bertram not much in his debt for any accessions to his geographical knowledge he had no leisure however to ruminate on this little specimen of nautical gaiety for just at this moment up rolled a brawny thickset figure and without any ceremonies of introduction or salutation spoke to him or rather spoke at him thus so this is the son of a gun that was asking for a passage the lordly step and gay confidence of eye sufficiently announced to bertram that he who addressed him was the captain of the ship apart from which claims of rank he was striking enough by mere personal appearance to have commanded the homage of very particular attention from any judicious spectator his figure was short broad and prodigiously muscular his limbs though stunted appearing knotty and in woodmans language gnarled at the same time that the trunk of his body was lusty and for a seaman somewhat unwieldy in age he seemed nearer to seventy than sixty but still manifested an unusual strength hardened to the temper of steel by constant exposure to the elements and by a life of activity the colour of his hair was probably white that is per se and with reference to its absolute or fundamental base but by smoke and neglect it had been tarnished into grim upper strata of rusty grey and sullen yellow which contrasted with a broad fiery disk of face harsh bushy eyebrows and a bardolph nose effectually extinguished all ideas of the venerable which might else have been suggested by his age a pair of keen grey eyes looked out from a mass of flesh in which they were sunk and by their catlike glances showed pretty clearly that in the hour of danger and conflict they could awaken into another sort of expression more characteristic of the man an expression however which in this piping time of peace and in the hours of his gentle morning potations was content habitually to slumber the captains gait we have described as rolling which in fact it was but without meaning at all by that expression to derogate from its firmness for firm it also was as the tread of a hippopotamus and wheresoever the sole of his vast splay foot was planted there a man would have sworn it had taken root like a young oak but a figure as broad as his could do no other than roll when treading the deck of a vessel that was ploughing through a gay tumbling sea as to dress the captain wore long slops of striped linen stout shoes and immense shoebuckles but for the upper part of his costume in spite of his official dignity he chose to sport instead of the long uniform coat of a french captain a short blue jacket worn over a red waistcoat to which last was attached a broad leathern belt bearing a brace of pistols and depending from the belt by a short chain he carried a turkish scymeter in a silver scabbard upon his head only could he be said to wear any mark of distinction that proclaimed his rank for upon his hat which was a round one like that of all the crew and slouched like theirs but a little higher he advanced by way of cockade and as a badge at once of the national flag he hoisted and of his own rank a very conspicuous white lily such was the portly personage that now came up to bertram or rather shouldered him in passing and summoned him as it seemed to face about by demanding in the voice of a stentor so this is the son of a gun that was asking for a passage bertram turned to face the captains side made his bow and modestly replied that he was the person who had been a candidate for that honour without altering his oblique position the captain slightly turned his head carelessly glanced his eye over bertrams person and replied thus so humph damn and where do you want to go ashore at bristol said bertram or any place on the coast of wales bristol the devil coast of wales the devils grandmother was the like ever heard captain le harnois to alter his course the trois fleurs de lys to tack and wear drop her anchor and weigh her anchor for a smockfaced vagabond but i thought sir that is i understood that the fleurs de lys was expressly purposing to cruize off the welch coast expressly purposing a tobaccobox i tell you what tom drum theres a d d deal too many rogues running about these seas a d d deal and the english police is no great shakes of a police that doesnt look more sharply after them who the devil are you bertram was preparing to answer this unceremonious question but the captain interrupted him aye i can see with half an eye an abram man a mumper a knight of the post that jumps up behind coaches and cuts the straps of portmanteaus steals into houses in the dusk waylays poor old people and women to rob them of their rags and their halfpence for as to the highway and cutting throats i think he has hardly metal for that or may be hes a juggler a ropedancer and plays off his hocus pocus on peoples pockets upon my word captain you put unspeakable wrong upon me with all my heart god give you health to wear it touched to the quick by these affronts bertram drew out his pocketbook and taking out some papers he presented them with all the hauteur he could assume to the captain saying at the same time if sir you will do me the honour to run your eye over my passport and the certificates annexed i am disposed to think that i shall not need any further vindication from the suspicions you are pleased to intimate tollderollloll said captain le harnois whats this trumpery whose pothooks are these at the same time negligently unfolding the papers and tearing several by his coarse way of handling them he threw a hasty glance over one or two but it struck bertram that he was holding them upside down be that as it might after tumbling mumbling and tearing one document after another the noble captain tossed them all on the deck advanced the broad extinguisher of his foot upon them blew out a cloud of breath into the morning air and exclaimed pooh pooh tom drum lillibullero twont do forged papers never think to put off your rogues tricks on captain le harnois so saying he rolled off to complete his quarterdeck turn preparing however to open his fire again when he came upon the other tack bertrams indignation was naturally great at what he viewed as an unprovoked outrage and in spite of his precarious situation and though fully aware that he was in the captains power he was on the point of giving a loose to those feelings which calumniated innocence is at all times privileged to express when the boatswain tapped him on the shoulder and whispered in his ear easy master easy the captain doesnt mean all he says he speaks worse than he thinks when he has taken his breakfast rather early he takes brandy to breakfast you understand twice a day he hauls his wind and speaks you as fair as a man could wish just afore breakfast thats once your next times just afore noon oh but its pleasant talking with the captain then at this moment captain le harnois was again bearing down and just as he brought his broadside to bear bertram who was in the act of gathering up his scattered papers and replacing them in his pocketbookcontented himself with observing that on shore he hoped at least to meet with some magistrate that would pay more respect to papers regularly authenticated shore magistrate thundered the captain the dragon and his horns whats a shore magistrate more than a saltwater magistrate mort de ma vie i take it a captains commission with four ministers hands to it signed and countersigned should be as good as a lubbers warrant what talk to me of lawyers and justices the fleurs de lys is as good a lawyer as i know egad when she shows her teeth and here captain le harnois grinned horribly and showed his own which after their kind were not less formidable egad she can lay down the law too egad can she aye and ive seen the day and here the captain chuckled in a fondling tone ive seen the day that the little wanton devil has made law and d d good law it was though some said not blast their eyes to all this bertram was silent and captain le harnois pursuing his tender remembrances broke out afresh ah the pretty little vengeful devil ha ha ha i rememberbut d n me if thats not the very thing that master tommy here is thinking of he has heard that story or some other as good and thats what he means by singing out for shore law but youngster id have you to know thats all over that scores rubbed out and the little frisky gipsy d n her for a little hardened devil has got her pardon alls right now her decks are washed she has a chaplain on board and she carries the flag of his most christian majesty indeed said bertram aye indeed most venerable youth the flag of louis le desir do you hear have you any thing to say against that what does smockface think of the bourbons is smockface not a good subject eh captain le harnois i am neither a french subject by birth nor in any respect indebted to the french government nor owe it any obedience on which account i am sure you will see the propriety of dispensing with any declaration of my political sentiments in this matter what what what not bourbonish oh but thats a foul fault master tommy my ship d n her for a little vixen she doesnt know what shed be at my ship shes bourbonish im bourbonish my lads theyre bourbonish were all bourbonish and ill have nobody swabbing my deck thats not bourbonish i congratulate myself said bertram on sailing with so loyal a subject of his most christian majesty aye thats soon said but if youngster is not bourbonish is he not liberal neither such are my unfortunate circumstances captain le harnois that at present it is wholly out of my power to be liberal i really come thats well however glad of that thats something my shy cock any thing but a liberal or a constitutional cut portmanteaustraps waylay old women hocus pocus any thing you like but ill have no liberal doings here no liberality shall be found on board of me whilst my names le harnois damn ive a character to support i believe we mistake each other there are different sorts of liberality and what i meant to say was i care nothing about it it signifies nothing talking about sorts of liberality ill have no sort and now pray what religion are you of has smockface no religion eh really captain le harnois it does appear to me that no man is authorized or commissioned merely upon the strength of flinging a rope to a drowning man or affording him some common office of humanity to institute an inquiry into his religious creed oh crimini not commissioned by my commission im to lay hold of every man that has any thing to say against his most christian majesty the catholic faith or our lady my commission is that im to overhaul every mans religion and as to what younker says about flinging a rope a ropes end for it if i fling a rope to a drowning man and he lays hold of it by my commission im to say ahoy there waterfowl are you religious is your religion so and so and if he sings out no my commission is to let go the rope and to say then first of all get baptized with salt water and when thats done come and tell captain le harnois thats my commission d n i think i should know what my commission is d n but captain you can surely make allowances for my education that may have been unfortunate but still i profess the most entire respect for the romish church and her adherents respect and be d d ill have no respect ill have religion pure neat religion with none of your protestant water in it or d d half and half my ship a little vixen shes religious for i tell you shes had her decks scrubbed by the chaplain im religious ships companys religious were all religious and my passengers shall be religious or my names not le harnois for my commission says that im to have none but the very best of christians aboard prime articles and none else no damaged lots bertram was perfectly confounded at hearing of such intense orthodoxy on board a man of war but he was disposed to question the entire accuracy of the representation on chancing to observe that all the crew who were behind the captains back were laughing as they went about their work captain le harnois himself seemed more than half disposed to laugh at his own picture of the holy fleurs de lys but at this moment he began to feel drowsy and giving up for the present any further examination of his passengers theology he got under weigh for his cabin grumbling out as he advanced but without looking back well thisll do for the first examination and for our ladys sake and for the honour of the white lily smockface may bundle himself between decks till the next time that we pump ship and then he must over board with the bilge water we must be charitable now and then for our ladys sake but let us have no irreligion let all be handsome lovely bourbonish and religious what the d l an irreligious dog aboard captain le harnois but i shall overhaul his principles for thats what my commission says else my names not le harnois damn with which emphatic monosyllable ascending in a growl from the bottom of the companion ladder captain le harnois concluded his matins on the deck of the fleurs de lys a roar of laughter followed his final disappearance and a succession of songs which seemed any thing but handsome lovely bourbonish or religious chapter iv pist perpend my words o signieur dew and mark o signieur dew thou diest on point of fox except o signieur thou do give to me egregious ransome fr sol o prenez misericorde ayez pitie de moy pis moy shall not sarve i will have forty moys hen v act spite of the captains absence and though there was no regular officer to represent him bertram was surprised to find that the duty on deck seemed in no respect to suffer either in order precision or alacrity all were in full activity moving with the industry and almost with the instinct of bees in the tops among the shrouds or on deck handling the ropes trimming the sails sounding and performing all other parts of a vigilant seamans duty this seemed the more remarkable as most of the crew carried a flask of brandy slung about their necks very few of them choosing to justify the captains flattering picture of their orthodoxy by substituting a rosary the steady old helmsman to whom bertram was communicating his astonishment replied aye aye but this is nothing you should see them in a storm or on a boarding party theres not a man of em but might take the captains place and for that matter the captain might take any of ours for hes as good a seaman as ever stept the deck and once he was the handiest among us all and would take his turn at any thing but now i know not whats come to him ever since we were made regular you understand and crossed out of the kings black books and since the captain got his commission its partly my belief that hes not right here touching his forehead and no good will come of it for one hour we must behave pretty and be upon honour and says he lads i must have you chained up by reason were now a kings ship and the next hour hell be laying his plots and his plans for doing some business in the old line the captain must have a spree now and then he couldnt be well without it whereby it comes that what between the old way and the new way a queer rumlooking life we lead of the business on board however though interesting for a short period bertram soon grew weary and stretching himself at his length upon the deck he gradually withdrew his attention from every thing that was going on about him to the contemplation of the sea and the distant shores which he was approaching the day for a winters day was bright and sunny the sky without a cloud the atmosphere of a frosty clearness and the sea so calm that it appeared scarcely to swell into a ripple except immediately in the ships wake the distant promontory which he suspected to be the point whither he had been washed by the waves after the explosion of the halcyon and which seemed the extremity of a small island had now receded into an azure speck the ships course lay to the southward or southeast and on the larboard quarter a long line of coast trended away to the southwest a remarkable pile of rock on this coast attracted his attention and rivetted his gaze as by some power of fascination who will refuse to sympathize with the feeling which at this moment possessed him what person of much sensibility or reflection but has in travelling or on other occasions sometimes felt a dim and perplexing sense of recognition awakened by certain objects or scenes which yet he had no reason to believe that he could ever have seen before so it was with bertram a feeling of painful perplexity disturbed and saddened him as he gazed upon the coast before him he felt as though he had at some early period of his life been familiar with some of its features which yet seemed impossible for he now understood from the helmsman that what he saw were parts of the caernarvonshire and merionethshire coasts in the neighbourhood of pwlheli bay the wind was fair and the fleurs de lys carried so much sail that within the next hour the whole line of coast and bay began to unfold itself and all the larger objects were now becoming tolerably distinct of these the most conspicuous was a lofty headland which threw its bold granite front in advance of all the adjacent shore and ran out far into the sea like a diadem upon its summit was planted an ancient castle presenting a most interesting object to the painter if it were not in some respects rather grotesque it might truly be described as planted for it seemed literally a natural growth of the rock and without division of substance it was indeed in many places an excavation quarried into the rocks rather than a superstructure upon it and where this was not the case the foundations had yet been inlaid and dovetailed as it were so artificially into the splintered crest of the rock and the whole surface had been for ages so completely harmonized in colour by storms and accidents of climate that it was impossible to say where the hand of art began or that of nature ended the whole building displayed a naked baronial grandeur and disdain of ornament whatever beauty it had seeming to exist rather in defiance of the intentions of its occupants and as if won from those advantages of age and situation which it had not been in their power to destroy the main body of the building by following and adjusting itself to the outline of the rock had of necessity taken the arrangement of a vast system of towers and quadrangles irregularly grouped and connected at intervals it was belted with turrets and its habitable character was chiefly proclaimed by the immense number of its windows and by a roof of deep red tiles which last though generally felt as a harsh blot in the picturesque honours of the castle were however at this particular time lowered into something like keeping by the warm ruddy light of the morning sun which was now glancing upon every window in the seafront and also by the dusky scarlet of decaying ferns which climbed all the neighbouring hills and in many plains skirted the waters edge in what style of architecture the castle was built it would have been difficult to say it was neither exactly gothic nor italian of the middle ages and upon the whole it might safely be referred to some rude and remote age which had aimed at nothing more than availing itself of the local advantages and the materials furnished by nature on the spot for the purpose of constructing a secure and imposing fortress without any further regard to the rules or pedantries of architecture attached to the main building which ascended to the height of five stories and yet did not seem disproportionately high from the extent of its range were several smaller dependencies some of which appeared to be framed of wood the purists of our days who are so anxious to brush away all the wooden patchwork and little tributary cells that formerly clustered about the pillars and nooks of cathedrals like so many swallows nests had here apparently made no proselytes and on the whole the final impression was that of a very venerable and antique but at the same time rather fantastic building from each side of the promontory on which the castle stood ran off at right angles a smaller promontory that which was on the left side as viewed from the sea though narrower and lower than the corresponding one on the other side terminated however in a much larger area and on that consideration apparently in spite of its less commanding elevation had been selected as the station for a watchtower this tower was circular and in that respect accurately fitted to the area or platform on which it stood the platform itself being a table of rock at the summit of a rude colossal cylinder which appeared to grow out of the waves the whole of this lateral process from the main promontory presented a most impressive object to a spectator approaching it from sea for the connecting part which ran at right angles from the great promontory to the platform had been partly undermined originally perhaps by some convulsion of nature but latterly the breach had been greatly widened by storms so that at length a vast aerial arch of granite was suspended over the waves which arch once giving away and falling in the rocky pillar and the watchtower which it carried would be left insulated in the waves bertram was more and more fascinated by the aspect of the ancient castle and the quiet hills behind it with their silent fields and woodlands which lay basking as it were in the morning sun the whole scene was at once gay and tranquil the sea had put off its terrors and wore the beauty of a lake the air was frosty but kindly and the shores of merry england which he now for the first time contemplated in peace and serenity were dressed in morning smiles a morning it is true of winter yet of winter not angry not churlish and chiding but of winter cheerful and proclaiming welcome to christmas the colours which predominated were of autumnal warmth the tawny ferns had not been drenched and discoloured by rains the oaks retained their dying leaves and even where the scene was most wintry it was cheerful the forest of ported lances which the deciduous trees presented were broken pleasingly by the dark glittering leaves of the holly and the massy gloom of the yew and other evergreens was pierced and irradiated by the scarlet berries of various shrubs or by the pucecoloured branches and the silvery stem of the birch the fleurs de lys had gradually neared the shore and in the deep waters upon this part of the coast there was so little danger for a ship of much heavier burthen that she was now running down within pistol shot of the scenery which bertram contemplated with so much pleasure he could distinguish every cottage that lurked in the nooks of the hills as it sent up its light vapoury column of smoke here and there he could see the dark blue dresses of the cottagechildren and occasionally a sound of laughter or the tones of their innocent voices betraying them to the ear where they were not seen or the crowing of a cock from the bosom of some hamlet answerd by faintly echoing farms remote gave language and expression to the tranquil beauty of the spectacle bertram absolutely shuddered with the feeling of one who treads upon a snake as he turned from these touching images of human happiness to the grim tackling and warlike furniture of the little bloody vixen on board which he was embarked together with the ferocious though intelligent aspects of her desperate crew he was already eager to be set ashore and the sudden shock of contrast made him more so on communicating his wishes to the boatswain however he was honoured by a broad stare and a laugh of derision what said the boatswain put you ashore close under the muzzle of walladmor castle and why not ask the captain my good lad ask captain jackson jackson i thought the captains name had been le harnois alls one for that le harnois or jackson one names as good as tother but i wouldnt be the man to put you upon asking the captain any such a thing its odds but youd be sent overboard my good lad head over heels thats to say on any day when the captain had taken his breakfast no no high as its perched up amongst the eagles nests that d d old castle has been the rock that many a good ship has struck on but wait till three or four oclock and then maybe well put you on ashore further down when wishes are hopeless the mind is soon reconciled to give them up bertram felt that his were so and contentedly stretching himself again upon the deck surrendered his thoughts to the influence of the lovely scenery before him at length the sun was setting and another reach of coast had unfolded upon his view when all at once he heard the dash of oars and on rising up he observed a little skiff rapidly nearing them in a few minutes she boarded the fleurs de lys and all was life and motion upon deck casks and packages were interchanged and private signals in abundance passed between the different parties bertram took the opportunity of bargaining for a passage to shore and was in the act of stepping into the boat when he was suddenly summoned before the captain he found the old tiger on the quarterdeck and in one of his blander humours captain le harnois was sitting on a coil of rope his back reclining against a carronade with a keg of brandy on the dexter hand and a keg of whisky on the sinister an air of grim good humour was spread over his features he had just awaked from slumber was for a few minutes sober and had possibly forgotten the heterodoxy of his passenger whom he saluted thus well sweet sir and how goes the world with you captain le harnois i understand that i can have a passage in the boat alongside and i am really anxious to go ashore well tom and whats to hinder it the shores big enough to hold you and if it isnt i cant make it bigger then captain i have the honour to wish you a very good evening the same to you tom and i have the honour tom to drink your worships health i thank you sir and perhaps you will allow me to leave a trifle to drink for the boats crew that brought me aboard do tom leave a trifle ill allow you to put fifty francs down on this whisky keg fifty francs captain le harnois permit me to remind you that i only came aboard this morning and that jessamy its no use talking fifty francs we give no change here and what the d l would you think to treat the crew of the fleurs de lys four and forty picked men with less than sixty franks sixty captain you said fifty did i well but that was the first time of asking come quick my young gallant or i shall hoist it up to seventy i say boatswain tell the smith to send me a hammer and a few tenpenny nails ive a customer here thats wanting to cheat me and i see i must nail him to the mast before we shall balance books but stop a minute ill tell you what jessamy if youll enter aboard the fleurs de lys ill let you off for the money i fear captain that your work would be too much for my constitution i am hardly strong enough to undertake such severe duty not strong enough oh the dragon my darling what should ail you ill make you strong enough by tomorrow morning just hang him up an hour to the mast head salt him take him down pickle him hoist him up in the main tops to season then give him some flapdragon and biscuit and ill be bound theres not a lubber that lives but will be cured into a prime saltwater article but come sixty francs bertram hesitated for a moment during which captain le harnois rose turned on his heel placed himself astride the carronade with a large goblet of brandy in his right hand and with the air of an old cupid who was affecting to look amiable and to warble but in reality more like a boreas who was growling he opened the vast chasm of his mouth and began to sing a sentimental love song bertram perceived that as the brandy lowered captain le harnois demand would be likely to rise and therefore paid the money without further demur and now my sweet boy said captain le harnois what do you think of the fleurs de lys tight seaboat isnt she and a little better managed than the halcyon eh things go on in another guess fashion here than they did on board your d d steam boat different work on my deck eh very different work indeed captain le harnois aye a d d deal different my boy i know what it is im speaking to when i speak to my lads but im d d if a man knows what hes speaking to when he speaks to a boiler during this speech bertram was descending the ships side when he had seated himself in the boat he looked up and seeing the captain lounging over the taffarel he said by way of parting speech you are right captain le harnois perfectly right and i shall always remember the very great difference i found between the halcyon and the fleurs de lys the old ruffian grinned and appeared to comprehend and to enjoy the equivoque he was in no hurry to clear scores with bertram but leisurely pursued the boat with a truculent leer nailed bertram with his eye and when the boat was just within proper range he took his speakingtrumpet and hailed him tom drum ahoy take care now when you get ashore where you begin your old tricks portmanteaus old women tumbling mind you dont begin hocus pocus too soon steer large and leave walladmor castle on the larboard tack for theres an old dragon in walladmor that has one of his eyes on you by this time hes on the lookout for you so farewell hes angling for you good bye my lilywhite tom a handier lad has been caught than you tom so let the old women pass quietly till walladmors out of hearing i cant cry tom but heres my blessing so saying captain le harnois drank up his goblet of brandy and tossing his heeltaps contemptuously after the boat rolled away to his orgies at the carronade and in this manner terminated bertrams connexion with the trois fleurs de lys it was not very agreeable to bertram that the gallant captains farewell speech had drawn the attention of all in the boat upon himself and in no very advantageous way most of the party laughed pretty freely at the bottom of the boat lay a man muffled up in a cloak and apparently asleep but it appeared to bertram that he also was laughing to relieve himself from this distressing attention he took out his pocketbook and busied himself with his pencil using it alternately for minuting memoranda of the scene before him or sketching some of its more striking features these were at this moment irresistibly captivating the boat was gliding through a sea unrippled by a breeze the water was exquisitely clear and reflecting the rich orange lights of the decaying sunset a bold rocky shore was before him haunted by gulls and seamews flights of which last pursued the boat for the sake of the refuse fish which were occasionally tossed overboard behind the rocky screen of the coast appeared a tumultuous assemblage of mountains the remotest of which melted away into a faint aerial blue and finally the boats company itself consisting of sailors rowing in their shirtsleeves fishermen and their wives in dresses of deep red and indigo with the usual marine adjuncts of fish tangle seaweed c composed a centre to the spectacle which inspirited the whole by its rich colouring grouping and picturesque forms the living part of the contributors to this fine composition seemed however but little aware of their own share in the production of the picturesque for most of them were engaged in amusing their fancies at the expense of bertram whose motions had but given a different turn to the satiric humour which captain le harnois had called forth one old man who sate opposite to bertram laid aside his pipe and said in an under tone to his next neighbour well in my life i never saw the man that brought as much to paper in a summers day as young master here has done in one half hour he beats the parson and torney williams all to nothing but i see how it is they say merlin wrote the history of wales down to the day of judgment upon these very rocks that lie right ahead and sure if he did theres somebody must come to read it and that must be young master here for you see he cocks his eye at the rocks as if he had some run goods in his pocket and was looking out for a signal to come on shore look at him now lord how nimbly his fingers go one would swear he believed that all must be over with this world if he should stop above half a minute see look at him there he goes again aye said another but i think hes hardly writing merlins history though its true enough that old saying about merlin he wrote it all with his fore finger and yet they tell me it is cut as deep into the rock as if it had been done with chisel and mallet but he must clear the moss off the face of the rock before hell read that and its not every man that will read it when thats done who then why none but a seventh son of a seventh son nor he neither except in the moonlight well i know not said the first speaker but as to this writing and reading i see little good it does lord to think of these gentlefolks that come up to tanybwlch and festiniog in the summer time like a shoal of herrings i go with scores of parties to pontaberglasllyn well now what should you think there could be to write down consarning a great cobble stone or consarning a bit of a shaw or a puddle of water yet theres not one of the young quality but as soon as ever they get sight of the llyn bless your eyes theyll stand and theyll lift up their hands and theyll raise the whites of their eyes and skrike out to one another that its awful to be near em the d l you dont say so aye and then down they all sits and out comes their books and the young gentlemen holds their bits of umbrellas for the ladies and away all their fingers are running like a dozen of harpers playing morfa rhuddlam and manys the time ive seen em stand whilst a man would walk a mile and a half staring up at widow daviss cottage that one can hardly see for the ivy and writing consarning it that one would think it was as old and as big as harlich or walladmor gad ill make bold some summer to ask em what they see about it for as widow davis said to me i wonder what they find on the outside for i never could find any thing in the inside and what do they do with their writings when theyve penned em god knows im sure its past my power to think for its clear to me owen that a writ consarning a spring will never quench a mans thirst and as to these limners that go about making a likeness of the sea why theyll never get a herring out of it by this time the boat was running up a narrow creek which soon contracted into the mouth of a little mountain brook here the boat took the ground and all on board began to jump ashore except bertram who was lost in contemplation of the long vista of mountains through which the brook appeared to descend from this abstraction he was at length awakened by the voice of the old fisherman who was mooring the skiff and drily asked him if he purposed to go out to sea again in chace of captain le harnois at this summons he started up and was surprised to observe that his companions were already dispersed and going off through various avenues amongst the mountains the boat was quite empty and his own portmanteau even had been carried out and was lying on a stone and now my good friend said bertram answer me one question what is the name of the nearest town for you must know that i am quite a stranger in these parts in what direction does it lie how far from this spot and which is the direct road to it one question why thats four questions master and more by three than you bargained for however as youre a stranger ill make shift to fit you with three short answers that shall unlock your four riddles the nighest town is machynleth and a rumlooking town it is ifs just fifteen miles off and you cant miss it if you follow your nose by the side of this brook till it leads you into yon pass amongst the mountains im much obliged to you friend but is there any person you know of that could guide me through this pass and carry my portmanteau aye master i know of three such persons and where are they two of them are on board captain le harnois and the other is where at machynleth and ill warrant him as drunk as he can go and of what use will that be to me nay master its past my power to find out but youre a scholar and can tell more than i can perceiving that he had got all the information from the old fisherman which he was likely to get bertram wished him good night and hoisting his portmanteau on his shoulder set off in the direction pointed out chapter v wher dwellen ye if it to tellen be in the subarbs of a town quod he lurking in berns and in lans blind whereas thise robbours and thise theves by kinde holden hir privee fereful residence as they that dare not shewen hir presence so faren we if i shal say the sothe chaucer bertram now found himself in a situation of some perplexity he was alone perfectly unacquainted with the country it was already dusk and he had to make his way through a labyrinth of hills which was likely to present danger in more shapes than one his experience on board captain le harnois had taught him that he was not perfectly secure from behind and before him was a mountainous region better peopled in all probability with precipices and torrents than with human habitations under these circumstances he had to go in quest of a lodging for the night and this from all that he had read of england on a double account he could scarcely venture to anticipate under any respectable roof first because he was on foot and secondly because he carried his own portmanteau however he entered on his course with spirit and for some time advanced without much difficulty the path meandered away along the margin of the little brook diverging from it at times but soon winding back upon it and as long as the road continued to lie over the little common which lay between the sea and the hills the light being here less intercepted and reflected more freely from the pellucid brook he had no difficulty in proceeding but when he had reached the foot of the hills and found that the brook suddenly immerged into a mountain ravine he halted in utter despondency looking back upon the shore which lay due west he perceived that the last faint blush of color had died away in the sky a solemn veil of darkness had descended over the sea even that was disappearing and within the narrow windings of the hills upon which he was now entering the darkness of chaos and old night seemed to brood that his road would be likely to lead him over precipices elevated enough for all purposes of danger he already knew for now and then the path began to ascend pretty steeply from the edge of the brook though it soon again subsided to the same level all around him was the sound of waters and of torrents no ray of candlelight or cheerful fire issued from any cottage amongst the hills he shouted but received no answer and he sate down to deliberate upon his situation just at this moment it seemed to him that he heard somewhere in his neighbourhood a low muttering he looked round but it was impossible to distinguish any object at more than a few paces distance and as he had repeatedly turned to look back in his road from the sea and had besides walked fast he felt convinced that no person could have dogged him and was disposed to think that he had been mistaken the next minute however the noise recurred he rose and moved a few paces onwards again he heard the low muttering as of some person talking to himself in a moment after steps rang upon the hard frosty ground as of a heavy foot behind him and before he could collect his thoughts a hand touched him on the shoulder and a deeptoned voice exclaimed halt he had now no choice left but to face the danger he stopped therefore and turning round he perceived close to his elbow a man in no very respectable attire so far as the obscurity would allow him to judge but half muffled up in a cloak and armed with a stout bludgeon much as he had just now been wishing for some guide he yet could not congratulate himself on so unpropitious a rencontre the strangers dress and unceremonious greeting were not more suspicious than the abruptness of his appearance for bertram felt convinced that he must have waylaid him assuming however as much composure as he could he demanded in a loud tone why did you not answer me when i shouted just now you must have heard me heard you said the other in a low but remarkably firm and deep voice heard you yes i heard you well enough but who in his senses goes shouting at nighttime up and down a byeroad on a smugglers coast as if he meant to waken all the dogs and men in the country who why any man that has a good conscience what difference can the night make aye that has but take my word for it friend a man that comes ashore from jacksons brig may as well go quietly along and say as little as possible about his conscience in this country they dont mind much what a man says many a gay fellow to my knowledge has continued to give the very best character of himself all the way up the ladder of the new drop and yet after all has been nonsuited by jack ketch when he got to the top of it for wanting so little a matter as another witness or so to back his own evidence well but i suppose something must be proved against a man some overt act against the laws before he can be suspected in any country till that is done the presumption is that he is a respectable man and every judge will act on that presumption yes in books perhaps but when a runningfire of crossexaminations opens from under some great wig and ones blood gets up and one doesnt well remember all that one has said before i know not how it is but things are apt to take a different turn well my rule is to steer wide of all temptation to do ill and then a man will carry his ship through in any waters will he why may be so and may be not there are such things as sunk rocks and its not so easy to steer wide of them constables for instance justices of peace lawyers juries but how came you to know that i was put on shore from jacksons brig why to tell you a secret it was i that lay at the bottom of the boat whilst your learned self were writing notes in a pocketbook but hush whats that he stopped suddenly looked cautiously round and then went on it was nothing i believe we may go on but we must talk lower in these cursed times every stone has ears here we must cross the brook and double the rock on the left whilst bertram went on he loitered a few steps behind and then cried out do you see any body on receiving an answer in the negative he advanced turned the corner and then began again you are going to machynleth and you want a guide to show you the road and to carry your portmanteau now ill do both on cheap terms for all i ask in return is this that up to the inndoor if we meet any body that asks unpleasant questions you will just be so good as to let me pass for your servant whom you have brought from abroad what say you is it a bargain my good friend according to the most flattering account i have yet received of your morals which is your own they are rather of a loose description and with all possible respect for your virtue that the case allows you will admit yourself that i should be running some little risk in confiding my portmanteau to your care for i know not who you are and before i could look round you might be off with my whole property in which case i should certainly be on a sunk rock some little risk yon must candidly allow no said the stranger no not at all and if thats all the objection you have ill convince you that you are wrong in a moment now just look at me theres a little starlight at this moment perhaps youll admit that im rather a stouter man than yourself oh doubtless and possibly this bludgeon would be no especial disadvantage to me in a contest with an unarmed man i must acknowledge it would not nor this particular knife according to your view of my morals as you call them i suppose it would not be very difficult for me to cut your throat with it and then pitch you into one of these dark mountain ravines where some six weeks hence a mouldering corpse of a stranger might chance to be found that nobody would trouble his head about are my arguments forcible satisfactory eh undoubtedly i must grant that there is considerable force in your way of arguing the case but permit me to ask what particular consideration moves you to conduct me and my portmanteau without hire to machynleth it seems too disinterested a proposal to awaken no suspicion not so disinterested as you may fancy suppose now i happen to have left a few debts behind me in this country or suppose i were an alien with no passport or suppose any other little supposes you like only keep them to yourself and talk as low if you please as convenient well be it so heres the portmanteau take care you dont drop this little lettercase the stranger tossed the portmanteau over his shoulder and both pushed forward up the pass at a rapid pace for some miles they advanced in silence and bertram being again left to his own meditations had leisure to recur to his original suspicions whenever the stranger happened to be a little ahead of him bertram feared that he might be then absconding with his property when he stopped for a moment bertram feared that he was stopping for no good in no way could he entirely liberate himself from uneasy thoughts even upon his own account of himself the man wore rather a suspicious character and what made it most so in the eyes of bertram was the varying style of his dialect he seemed to have engrafted the humorous phraseology of nautical life which he wished to pass for his natural style upon the original stock of a provincial dialect and yet at times when he was betrayed into any emotion or was expressing anger at social institutions a more elevated diction and finer choice of expressions showed that somewhere or other the man must have enjoyed an intercourse with company of a higher class in one or other part it was clear that he was a dissembler and wearing a masque that could not argue any good purposes spite of all which however and in the midst of his distrust some feeling of kinder interest in the man arose in bertrams mind whether it were from compassion as towards one who seemed to have been unfortunate or from some more obscure feeling that he could not explain to himself the road now wound over a rising ground and the stranger pointed out some lights on the left which gleamed out from the universal darkness yonder is machynleth if that is to be our destination but if the gentlemans journey lies further i could show him another way which fetches a compass about the town it is late already and very cold for what reason then should i avoid machynleth oh every man has his own thoughts and reasons and very advisable it is that he should keep as many of them as possible to himself let no man ask another his name his rank whither he is bound on what errand and so forth and if he does let no man answer him for under all these little matters may chance to lurk some ugly construction in a court of justice when a man is obliged to give evidence against a poor devil that at any rate has done him no harm aye said bertram and there are other reasons which should make the traveller cautious of answering such questions for consider how is he to know in what dark lane he may chance to meet the curious stranger on his next days journey though to be sure youll say that for a man with no more baggage than myself such caution is somewhat superfluous the stranger laughed heartily and said true too true as the gentleman observes and indeed the gentleman seems to understand how such matters are conducted very well however after all i would strongly recommend it to the gentleman to avoid the town of machynleth but why so is it a nest of thieves oh lord bless us no quite the other way rather too honest and strict you understand well and for what reason then avoid making the acquaintance of so very virtuous a town why for that reason its unreasonably virtuous in particular there is a certain magistrate in the neighbourhood who hangs his men per annum and why for no other cause on gods earth than because their blood is hotter than his own he has his bloodhounds for tracking them and his spies for trepanning and all the old women say that he can read in the stars and in coffee grounds where contraband goods come ashore why my pleasant friend what is it you take me for the stranger turned round pressed his companions hand but not finding the pressure returned he laughed and said in a significant tone take him for i take the gentleman to be as respectable and honourable a gentleman as any thatfrequents the highway by night you are come from abroad at school you had read flattering accounts of this famous kingdom of england and its inhabitants and desiring to see all this fine vision realized you did not let the distance frighten you and to a young man i take it that is some little credit well sir well before you left home your purse had been emptied at some watering place well say by gamblers sharpers black legs c but no matter how there are many ways of emptying a purse and you are now come over to our rich old england to devise means for filling it again all right he that loses his money at one sort of game must try to draw it back by some other and in england there are many one man marries a rich heiress another quacks another opens a tabernacle and wheedles himself into old womens wills but perhaps the best way of all is to go into trade break take the benefit of the insolvent act and in short get famously ruined in which case youre made for life so then you do really take me to be an adventurer a fortunehunter oh sir god forbid i should take a man for any thing that it is not agreeable to him to be taken for or should call him by any name which he thinks uncivil but the last name i think is civil enough for i suppose every man is a fortunehunter in this world some there are now that hunt their fortunes through quiet paths where there is little risk and much profit others again and here he lost his tranquil tone and his selfpossession others hunt a little profit through much danger choosing rather to be in eternal strife and to put their hopes daily to hazard than to creep and crawl and sneak and grovel and at last perhaps they venture into a chase where there is no profit at all or where the best upshot will be that some dozen of hollow smiling fawning scoundrels who sin according to act of parliament and therefore are within the protection of parliament may be he paused suddenly and made a fierce gesture which supplied the ellipsis to his companion but the latter had little wish to pursue such a theme and he diverted the conversation into another channel resuming a topic which had been once broken off i have come to wales said bertram chiefly from the interest i take in its traditions antiquities and literature the ruined monuments of so ancient a people that maintained its independence so long and so heroically against enemies so potent have a powerful interest to my mind when connected with their grand historical remembrances the great architectural relics of older times the castles of aberconway caernarvon harlech and kilgarran aye and walladmor said the other laughing yes walladmor and many others possess a commanding interest to him who has familiarised himself with their history all places too connected with the memory and half fabulous history of king arthur the grand forms of welch scenery ennobled and glorified by the fine old romancers norman or english or by the native bard songs i know them all said the stranger interrupting him and laughing heartily theres arthurs fort at cairwarnach arthurs table arthurs chair the brook at drumwaller where he forded without wetting his feet and scores of old ruins in this neighbourhood and doubtless you have had much pleasure in ranging through these grey memorials of elder days pleasure aye that i have manys the good keg of brandy that ive helped to empty among em keg of brandy said bertram somewhat shocked yes brandy right cogniac better than ever king arthur drank ill be sworn faith i believe hed have sold his sceptre for a dozen of it and sir gawain would have tumbled through a hoop for a quart oh the fun that some of those old walls have looked down upon manys the dark night when i was a little younger aye many a wild jolly party have i sat with in some of those old ruins and such a din weve kept that ive expected old merlin would come down from some old gallery and beat up our quarters why certainly night is in some respects a favourable time for visiting such buildings for the lights and shadows are often more grandly and broadly arranged but were these parties that you speak of parties of tourists to whom you acted as guide tourists god knows a rum kind of tourists though and a rum kind of guide was i egad i led em a steeple chase up hill and down hill thick and thin rocks and ruins nothing came amiss and theres not many tourists i think on the wrong side of twentyfive that would choose to have followed usbut i suppose now as youve come to wales on this errand you would be glad to see a few old churches abbeys and so on fine picking there for a man that hungers after the picturesque owls ivy wall moonshine and what not certainly i shall said bertram i design to see every thing that is interesting and i understand that wales is particularly rich in such objects and ive seen some beautiful sketches with all the picturesque adjuncts and accidents that you mention aye bless your heart but did you ever see a sketch of griffith ap gauvon it lies about miles north of machynleth in the eastern ravines of snowdon g youd lift up your hands if you saw the ruins how majestically they stand upon the naked peaks of the rocks and how boldly the pointed arches rise into the air and throw themselves over the unfathomable chasms look up from below and there on a moonlight night youll see the white pillars all standing in rows like so many wax lights and if one looks down from above its half enough to put thoughts into a mans head of throwing himself down i protest said bertram you make my head giddy with your description aye but dont be giddy just yet for we are now going over a narrow path and theres a precipice below here give me your hand so now turn to the right now two steps up and now take my arm for its so dark under these walls that youll be apt to stumble both advanced in this way for some hundred paces when suddenly his guide stopped and said here we are at last and my term of service is out this is the walladmor arms and it is decidedly the best inn in the town for there is no other if any courteous reader has ever in the maytime of his own life or in the maytime of the year made a pedestrian tour among the northern or western mountains of our island he will understand what was in bertrams mind at this moment a vision of luxurious refreshment and rest after a hard days fatigue disturbed by anxious doubts about the nature of his reception in this state he laid his hand upon the latch and perhaps the light of the doorlamp which at this moment fell upon his features explained to his guide what was passing in his mind for he drew him back by the arm and said one word of advice before we part even the servant may presume to counsel his master as he is quitting his service the landlord within is not one of those landlords who pique themselves on courtesy and the gentleman tourist with submission be it said is not one of those tourists who travel with four horses or even by the stagecoach and foottravellers in england especially in the winter season do not meet with high consideration which premises weighed if you were to ask for a nights lodging at your first entrance i bet ten to one that you will get none no not though the house were as empty as it is probably full by the infernal din but do what i tell you call for ale porter or wine the moment you enter as fast as your reckoning mounts so fast will the frost thaw about the landlords heart go to work in any other way and ill not answer for it but youll have to lie in the street with full determination to pay attention to his advice bertram again laid his hand upon the latch opened the door and made his appearance for the first time in his life upon that famous stage in the records of novelists a british inn chapter vi now this is worshipful society king john the room into which bertram now introduced himself was spacious beyond any thing that he had anticipated but spacious as it was it seemed barely sufficient for its different occupants a large playbill hung in a very conspicuous situation announced the play of venice preserved for representation on that evening it was now a good deal after oclock and the performance was over but the venetian nobili in the dignified solemnity of their black dresses were scattered about the room in parties or laying aside the costlier part of their finery in a remote corner partly screened off from public view which had been allotted to them as a tiring room round about the fireplace in an elevated sort of dais which had been railed off into a bar a canopy of smoke proclaimed that a festive party were somewhere seated beneath it on advancing a few steps further bertram could distinguish their faces and arrangement close by the fire side sate a huge dutchman with a huge pipe solemnly fixing his eyes upon the pomp of clouds which he had created or was in the act of creating and apparently solacing himself with some vague images of multiplication and division his leaden eye showed that he was completely rapt away from all that was passing about him two critics disputing at his right ear upon the relative pretensions of two actresses two politicians disputing at his back on the sinking fund and the funds in general as little disturbed his meditations as two disputants before his face viz the landlord and the manager of the theatrical company who were sharply discussing some private point of finance in their daily reckoning the poor manager with his keen meagre and anxious countenance at this moment rendered doubly anxious by the throes of an arithmetical computation seemed the antagonist pole of the dutchman he was endeavouring with little success to bring the nights receipts into something like a counterbalance to the daily bill this had just been presented by the landlord who had placed his bulky person immediately behind him looked over his shoulder and having encircled him with his arms for the sake of leaning with his knuckles upon the table had fairly pinned in the poor manager who continued at intervals upon every perplexing interruption from his antagonist to wheel round and face him like a stag at bay nearer to bertram sate a man whose curved nose black hair ardent looks and sallow complexion at once announced him as a frenchman he was occupied in painting a portrait of one actress at the same time that he was making complimentary grimaces to three others in the chimneycorner and over against the dutchman was seated an elderly man of short thickset person dressed in a shabby grey coat boots and a white hat his features were not in themselves very striking but had been habitually composed to one intense expression of dissatisfaction with all about him like the dutchman he looked away from the company towards the fire and appeared to take no interest in any thing which went on but this in him was mere affectation the dutchman as a child could see was most sincerely indifferent to every thing but the festoons of smoke which formed about him nor ever seemed to suffer in his peace of mind except when this aerial drapery was rent or too much attenuated then indeed he puffed with a perceptible agitation until he had reinstated the vapoury awning which done he immediately recovered his equanimity but as to white hat by the complexity of his manoeuvres for disguising his interest in the conversation about him by uniformly shifting his chair upon the approximation of any other chair and by the jealous anxiety with which he affected to turn away his head if any person were talking near him he made it sufficiently evident that no one person in the room paid so earnest an attention to what was passing as himself he also had resorted to a pipe for the sake of expressing his abstraction from the world about him but how different were his short uneasy asthmatic puffs from the floating pomp with which the dutchman sent up his voluminous exhalations in his right hand he held a newspaper which he appeared to be reading sometimes glancing his eye over it sometimes dwelling upon the words as if he were spelling them in general however giving himself a great deal of trouble to impress upon all about him that he took little or no interest in any thing he read these were the most noticeable persons of the company to which bertram now advanced taking care at the same time to call for wine in an imposing tone of voice at this sound the landlord wheeled suddenly round which fortunately set the poor manager at liberty both stared at bertram the frenchman looked up for a moment even the white hat being taken by surprise made a half wheel on his chair though immediately reverting not without some indignation at himself to his former position in fact every soul in the room looked at bertram except the dutchman silence ensued and the landlord after raising and dropping his eyes alternately from bertrams head to his foot demanded if he had a horse with him no i am on foot replied bertram very late time of night the landlord muttered to be walking pray which way do you come from the seaside where i was set ashore this evening about oclock after a little further crossexamination the landlord appeared to be satisfied and directed jenny to bring the wine the buz of conversation which had been hushed during the landlords colloquy with the stranger freshened again and bertram proceeded to take his seat amongst the company it is affirmed by some philosophers that timon of athens himself if on issuing from the darkness and cold of a fifteen miles walk on a frosty winters night succeeding to a day of hardship and exposure he were suddenly to burst on a gay fireside of human faces lights wine and laughter would inevitably forget his misanthropy for that evening and be glad to take his share in the conversation bertram was probably so disposed it was therefore unfortunate for him that he took his seat by the side of the dutchman i perceive said bertram that you have had a play performed this evening without looking up from his pipe minheer replied like enough i was told there were players here nothing discouraged bertram turned to his opposite neighbour the white hat you sir probably attended the performance i replied the indignant man i trouble myself with such fooleries when the poor country is ruined and perishing for bread fooleries mr dulberry exclaimed the manager what venice preserved venice preserved or venice treacle what care i its a playbook isnt it here we are taxed already for the support of libraries museums herculanean manuscripts elgin marbles and god knows what very soon i suppose government will assess us so much a head for the theatres ah poor venice preserved ejaculated the manager sighing it has always some enemy or other in quiet times it is laid on the shelf then comes some season of political ferment the liberty boys kick up a dust the public voice calls for the play clamorously the theatre fills nightly every allusion is caught at with rapture and as to the actors they may lie upon their oars for let them play as ill as they choose they are sure of applause for the sake of what they utter but as often as ever this happens in steps the government and forbids the representation forbid the representation shrieked mr dulberry forbid that excellent play venice preserved what theres something in it against government is there oh its an admirable play and how now how is it they forbid it not by act of parliament i dare swear bad as parliament is they would hardly trust it to them by an order in council i suppose and lord londonderry sends a regiment of dragoons into the pit eh no mr dulberry the lord chamberlain forbids it the lord chamberlain worse and worse and so its the lord chamberlain that sends the dragoons chamberlain why thats the man that takes care of the government sheets and pillowslips the overseer of the chambermaids and hes to trample on the liberties of the country and to put out the lights of the theatre by the hoofs of military despotism oh fie fie poor old england partly from political indignation and partly from some more personal indignation at a little laughing which now arose in some quarter of the room the patriot returned hastily to the courier which he held in his hand and the conversation seemed likely to droop when suddenly bertrams attention was drawn by a bright blaze of light and looking up he beheld his reforming neighbour mr dulberry metamorphosed into a pillar of salt his mouth was wide open the whites of his eyes were raised to the ceiling one hand was clenched the other hung lifeless by his side the courier had sunk with one end into the fire a roaring flame was springing up and enveloping the whole and before mr dulberry returned to his selfpossession the newspaper with all its world of history and prophecy was reduced to ashes mr dulberry for gods sake mr dulberry whats the matter exclaimed the company on all sides has bolivar beaten the royalists is the austrian loan repaid or what is it for the love of heaven what is it gentlemen a thing to make your ears tingle the manchester massacres were a trifle to it an englishmanoh lord gentlemen its all over with the habeas corpus actan englishman has been arrested by the emissaries of government after he had quitted the kingdom what government the french government no gentlemen by the english government arrested out of the kingdom think of that gentlemen but where where exclaimed several voices in france why yes i think i may say in france for he was going to france and he had actually put off in a boat from the isle of wight and was three hundred yards from shore on his way towards a french ship which he was going to board oh come mr dulberry said some of the company laughing but thats england however as far as an english cannonball will reach and a little farther too in the opinion of some jurists the four seas are english property englands domain her manor her park and she has a right to set up turnpike gates if she pleases by no means gentlemen by no means blackstone says that to constitute possession there must go two things the act of possessing and the will to possess so also no doubt of a mans domicile to make this bar my domicile i must not only be here but secondly i must will to be here now this man willed to be in france and england was no longer his domicile and where a man is not there he ought not by law to be arrested this pretty piece of subtilty was received by most of the company with a smile but as mr dulberry remarked that some little murmuring arose which announced that some of his auditors were impressed with what he had said he seized his opportunity jumped upon his chair flourished his white hat and briefly harangued the company gentlemen said he we all know that ministers have sealed this country against all unhappy foreigners and have tarnished the old english character for generous hospitality by their cursed alien bill this we knew before but now comes a fresh assault on liberty not only must we look on and see nets and lines set all round our once hospitable shores to catch the unhappy fugitives from continental tyranny but at length it seems ministers are to be allowed to throw out their grappling hooks after english fugitives from the tyranny of lord londonderry if a man runs to the north pole i suppose lord londonderry and ally croaker will soon be after them and that by the way is the meaning of all these polar voyages i see that even the ministerial gentlemen present cast down their eyes and look ashamed no man has a word to say in defence what i propose therefore is that we all unite in an address to the king testifying our abhorrence of this last act which has made the cup of our afflictions run over and begging that his majesty would dissolve the present administration and form a new one on a more patriotic basis but mr dulberry who is it that has been arrested cried many of the company thats nothing to the purpose gentlemen the mans an englishman and thats enough i hope but how if he should turn out to be an english lunatic escaped from his keepers said a cynical looking man in the corner a laugh followed and a general cry of name name not to forfeit his hold upon the public attention mr dulberry found himself obliged to relax the rigor of his principles and to descend from the universal character of englishman to so impertinent a consideration as the character of the individual his name gentlemen is edward nicholas nicholas edward nicholas said a number of voices at once what our nicholas as to that i know not he was described in the courier as a bold adventurer many honourable traits were recited of his conduct and in particular i remember it was said that he had fought on the side of liberty in south america and had once commanded a sloop of war as a commissioned officer under artigas oh the same the same exclaimed the greater part of the company our nicholas sure enough but what mad trick has he been playing now the patriot was evidently uneasy and reluctant to answer this question being pressed however on all sides he replied i dont know gentlemen that he has been playing any tricks the courier pretends that he is charged with some knowledge of the catostreet affair treason or misprision of treason as they call it in their d d treasury jargon oh catostreet is that it cried the whole room with one voice then well have no addresses for him no no well not address his majesty for a catostreet conspirator but gentlemen said the disconcerted patriot but gentlemen i say mr dulberry it wont do interrupted a gravelooking tradesman attack the ministers as much as you will let every man attack them its all fair and i dare say they deserve it for im not the man to think any of them saints but lets hear it all in the old english way all fair and above board no foul play no stabbing of unarmed men set junius upon them set cato upon them set publicola upon them in the newspapers but no slipping into mens friendly meetings no cutting throats by the fireside no venice conspirators in england friendly meetings and firesides said dulberry why god bless me how you varnish the matter to hear you talk one would suppose these ministers of ours were so many lambs and met for nothing but to kiss and sing psalms i tell you they never meet but to plot against us and our liberties and as to conspirators if you come to that i know of none except at lord harrowbys you say there was a conspiracy of catostreet against grosvenorsquare i say no there was a conspiracy of grosvenorsquare against catostreet this view of the case seemed so new and original to the company that a general laugh followed and the reformer finding that he was no longer accompanied by the sympathy of his audience sate down in dudgeon muttering something about lacqueys of lord londonderry the politician being silenced an opening was now allowed for a subject far more interesting to the majority of those who were present and to many more in this part of wales and so nicholas is taken at last said mr bloodingstone a butcher well now thats what i could never have thought that nicholas should let himself be taken as quietly as a lamb bless your hearts on all this coast theres not a creek or a cranny big enough for a fieldmouse but he knew it and all the way from barmouth to carnarvon ill be sworn theres not a man on the preventive service simple or gentle but nicholas has had his neck under his foot at one time or another aye mr bloodinsgtone replied the landlord but a bowstreet officer with his staff is like joshua the son of nun he can make the sun and moon stand still so thats not the thing i wonder at what surprizes me is that a man like nicholas should ever meddle with these politics and politicians that get nothing for their pains but bloody heads and a trifle of fame that would never pay for one glass of good whiskey punch what nicholas was a man of sense and a d d long head he had of his own and if he would but have been quiet and have gone on in a regular way he might have been a rich man by this time for he had credit for evermore with the merchants in amsterdam and antwerp and with some others too that ill say nothing about was this nicholas then settled in business at this place asked the frenchman a smile appeared on the major part of the faces present and the landlord answered with a loud laugh settled my god i would be glad to see the place where nicholas was ever settled for twentyfour hours together no bless you nicholas was no settler and theres some folk will say that he never sate down in his life but thats not true for ive seen him sit many a time in that very armchair where the young gentleman is now sitting here he pointed to bertram who felt somewhat uneasy at the very marked attention which was at this moment directed on him by the company the landlord however took no notice but proceeded in his answer no nicholas was no settler and just as little can i call him a man in business he was a sort of agent you see in other peoples business and a d d dangerous sort of business too and i suppose theres never been his match in that way since the time of owen owalys however well say nothing about all that he stocked the whole country with cheap brandies and other little matters and so ill say nothing against his way of doing business though i reckon we mustnt praise it except in a corner you must understand monsieur said a voice from behind that this nicholas set up an opposition trade against the government and undersold it so that government lost all its trade in this part of the country for which reason government is jealous of him and cant abide him but landlord it seems you knew this nicholas i knew him in a manner but how i knew him and i knew him not scores of times he has sate in this bar and i never knew it to be him until after he was gone sometimes he would come dressed like an old beggar and slink into a corner sometimes like a labouring man and argue with me for the value of a halfpenny other times i have known him come like a lord and make his guineas fly about like so much dust and once egad i cant help laughing he came in the uniform of a dragoon officer and he would needs cudgel me for letting nicholas escape he got me by the throat i sung out for my very life jenny she ran for the constables the neighbours came flocking in alderman gravesand brought all his posse comitatus down for he was then on the lookout for nicholas at the towns end and would you believe it by that time all was settled the whole party of the smugglers bag and baggage was clean through the town and ten miles on the road to ap gauvon and all this at noonday well landlord and what said nicholas when you saw him next the next time i saw him gentlemen was in my own bar and dressed in one of my own wigs jacket and apron gad i never was so frightened in the whole course of my life i had just walked a mile out of town to our parsons and as i was coming back a man shot by me like an arrow but as quick as he was says i to myself thats nicholas and sure enough many minutes hadnt passed before up comes a great company of men and asks me which way nicholas had gone i thought to myself thesell be the blazers men of the revenue service thats stationed off caernarvon so i didnt trouble myself to give em much of an answer and away they pelted after him in full cry well gentlemen before i got home both hare and hounds as it happened had turned into my bar and if youll believe me the first man i clapt my eyes on as i came into my own house egad i thought it was myself or my own ghost and if this had been in the scotch highlands now landlord you would have been sure of being in your coffin before the year was out why i know not for that sir but its not lucky in any country for a man to see his own likeness walking about and ill not deny but i was a little startled and i sate me down amongst the blazers men and could not speak a word and says he to me but he turned his face rather away good man did you call for whiskey and i could have sworn to the voice for my own amongst a thousand but when he served me the whiskey i looked hard at him and i saw it was nicholas but i hadnt the heart to betray him and i says to him landlord how are you and how goes business business says he weve business for evermore im run off my feet with business and sure enough he took sixpence of me in my own bar and fifteen shillings of the revenue men for smuggled brandy and whilst they were drinking out he slips and whips away at the north gate by the very same road they had all come and two minutes after the lieutenant and his company were off as if the devil drove em to the south this extraordinary talent for personating every age and character said the manager he learned or improved however whilst he was in my troop he was the best actor i ever had nothing came amiss to him richard the third or aguecheek shylock or pistol romeo or the apothecary hamlet or the cock for by the way he once took it into his head to play the cock in the first scene of hamlet and he crowed in so very superior a style that the oldest cock in the neighbourhood was taken in and got to answering him and the crowing spread from one farmhouse to another till all the cocks in carnarvonshire were crowing ha ha ha mr manager and what said the audience to this what said the audience why they encored him pit boxes and gallery and the ghost was obliged to come on again that he might be crowed off again but all this was when he was a boy of for he soon got tired of the stage aye he grows tired of every thing said some of the company and by this time ill be bound for it hes grown tired of smuggling and if it be true that he has had any thing to do with thistlewood thats the reason no said another thats not the reason tired of smuggling i dare say he was for a man like nicholas could never have liked it for any thing but its active life and its danger and its difficulties but if any thing has brought him connected with catostreet it is love love what love for lord londonderry no no you guess what i mean there are few in this room but know pretty well what i mean love for a young lady in the neighbourhood miss walladmor i suppose hush hush said the landlord let us name no names well no matter for the name but we all know that love had turned his brain he was desperate and for this last year and a half its notorious that he has been as mad as a march hare nicholas in love said mr bloodingstone well now that sounds as comical to me as if i should say that my bulldog towser was in love with a bull why god bless my soul havent the rotterdam merchants turned him out of their service for that very reason i know it to be a fact that no farther back than last february when one of them was promising him guineas if hed do this and that damn your guineas says he if it were not for a fairer face than ever i saw on a guinea i would never set foot in wales again and he raved at such a rate about the young lady that all the owners began to be shy of him and the end of it was that captain lewhats his name has been put in his room captain jackson you mean said the landlord for thats his real name aye its true enough that jackson has now got the command well but mad or not mad what became of nicholas after the bowstreet officers had laid hold of him mr dulberry you had the paper what became of him clapt into a postchaise for london eh no sir with all their plots it seems government couldnt make sure of catching him on the catostreet business witnesses couldnt be bought or juries couldnt be packed i suppose and so theyve sent him to this part of the country and hes to take his trial at dolgelly or carnarvon for some old affairs god knows what with the customhouse or the blazer god bless me exclaimed almost every man in the room so then we shall see edward nicholas once more and ill walk fifty miles rather than miss the sight and which way does he come mr dulberry by sea gentlemen they shipped him on board the steampacket halcyon and god in his mercy grant that this cursed instrument of despotic power may blow up and deliver so good a patriot from their snares the halcyon exclaimed bertram with a vehemence proportioned to his sudden surprise and the interest which by this time he felt in the subject of the conversation the halcyon why then mr dulberry your prayer is granted for the halcyon blew up two days ago in st georges channel somewhere i believe off the isle of anglesea i was one of the passengers and to the best of my belief all on board have perished except myself in lloyds coffeehouse or other places of great resort in london when a placard is exhibited reporting any important news the restlessness of public impatience seems often as though it would extort an answer to its further curiosity from the inanimate pillar or post to which the placard is affixed it may be supposed how much more liable to such importunity is the bearer of a placard that happens to be no stone pillar but a living man bertram was pressed upon from all sides for his narrative of the catastrophe which he gave in substance as the reader has already heard it of nicholas whom he now understood to have been his fellowpassenger he knew nothing that some state prisoner of extraordinary character was on board he had indeed casually heard but had seen nothing of him to his own knowledge and if he were under hatches and in irons there was no room to doubt that he must have been amongst those who were most sure to have perished all that he could certainly report of the final sequel to his own share in the adventure was that since his eyes had opened on shore they had rested on no countenance which he remembered to have seen on board the halcyon it is needless to say that a mixed expression of wonder deep interest in the events and compassion for the unfortunate sufferers accompanied bertrams narrative the narrator himself was the object of a mingled sympathy of condolence and congratulation blended however with an air of keen examination directed to his features now that they were brought nearer to the observers and under a steadier light which had once before distressed him in the course of the evening and for which he could find no satisfactory explanation the prevailing sentiment which arose at the end of the account was a lively regret that the near prospect of seeing edward nicholas again so suddenly opened upon them should have been so suddenly overcast nevertheless such was the general confidence in his good fortune and his unrivalled resources in presence of mind and bodily activity that considerable odds were offered by many of the company that nicholas who had outlived so many desperate storms both by sea and land in all climates of the world would yet be heard of again for any of these feelings or considerations mr dulberry had no leisure the moral which he drew from this as from all other events great or small sad or merry was exclusively civic and full of patriotic spleen so then said he you see what sort of ships government choose for transporting their state prisoners but good god mr dulberry you can hardly suppose that the boiler of the halcyon was in the pay of my lord londonderry the boiler no but where was the engineer that should have been in his pay didnt mr bennett propose a year or two ago that no steampacket should be lawfully turned off the stocks before it was thoroughly examined by a state engineer didnt but here supper was announced a summons welcome in itself and at this moment doubly so as putting a stop to the reformer even that person condescended to be pleased on the former consideration though reasonably incensed on the other and he advanced to the table in a continued ejaculation of inarticulate grunts a sort of equivocal language in which he designed to convey alike his approbation of supper and displeasure at the interruption bertram took his seat with the rest of the party but sought an early opportunity of withdrawing himself from a scene of convivial merriment in which his previous fatigues had by this time wholly disqualified him for sharing with any cordiality wearily he followed the person who conducted him to his bedchamber but spite of his sleepiness and exhaustion he was roused to a slight shock of something like terror by a little incident which occurred on the way in one of the galleries through which they passed a man was standing at the further end he was apparently in the act of admitting himself into a bedroom but something which embarrassed him about the lock or the key detained him until they advanced near enough to throw the light of a candle full upon his profile it was the profile of a face tanned into a gypsey complexion and for so young a face weatherbeaten thin and wasted but otherwise of grecian beauty of outline and as far as could be judged from so hasty and oblique a glance remarkably expressive and dignified the man did not look round or take any other notice of them as they advanced and the attendant either had not or affected not to have any knowledge of his person but bertram felt a bewildering remembrance as if suddenly snatched and recovered from a dream of the same features seen under circumstances of some profounder interest he labored anxiously to recollect in what situation and when but the events of the last few days had so agitated and bewildered his mind that he labored in vain and the more he thought the more he entangled himself in a web of perplexity from this and all other perplexities however he was speedily liberated by the sound sleep which seized him the moment he had laid his head on the pillow footnotes to chapter vi footnote a joke upon an irish accentuation of mr crokers the secretary to the admiralty in his talavera he accentuated the word ally hibernic with the accent on the first syllable on which mr southey playfully called him ally croaker footnote a joke borrowed from by whom it was applied to a better man than himself one of the most extraordinary men of genius in this age and whose life has been more romantic than that of edward nicholas chapter vii pand hark they ate coming from the field shall we stand up here and see them as they pass towards ilium good niece do sweet niece cressida cress at your pleasure pand here here heres an excellent place here we may see most bravely ill tell you them all by their names as they pass by but mark troilus above the rest troilus and cressida act when bertram awoke the sun was already high and pouring a golden light through the frosted window of his bedroom the churchbells of machynleth were ringing gaily from one or two neighbouring villages arose a fainter sound of bells and the stir and motion within doors and without proclaimed that this was some festal day on descending to breakfast he found the house arranged in the neatest order and garnished with branches of fir the door was crowded and the street was swarming with groups of country people men women and children the women adorned with gay ribbons and the men with bouquets of leeks the landlord and many of his inmates paid the same honor to the day and every thing announced that it was the great national festival of wales sacred to good st david a day on which no man of welch blood though he should be at seringapatam would think it lawful to forget this ancient recognizance of cambrian fraternity true it is however that like all other old usages this also except in the principality itself is rapidly falling into disuse else surely it could never have happened that precisely on this day a certain noble lord of welch descent should have thought fit to rise in his place in the house and make an eloquent exposition and apology for the jacobinical creed of his friends we cannot doubt that had a bunch of leeks been suddenly presented to his lordship at this moment his face would have crimsoned with a blush as deep as that of the red nightcap which apparently is the object of his homage for surely no hostility can be deeper than that between the badge of jacobinism and this antique symbol of honor good faith and loyal brotherhood and reverence for the dust of our forefathers how now landlord said the reformer is this absurd superstitious commemoration of st davids day never to cease have a care mr dulberry dont talk too loud theres some of our country friends outside that if they should overhear you might take a fancy for trying the strength of your head with iceclods or put you under the pump or perhaps said the manager give you a leek to eat and not in so courtly a manner as i once saw fluellen administer his leek to pistol on the london boards the part of fluellen on that particular night by garrick to whom by the way in that part i was myself considered equal all rank superstition trash and mummery from the days of darkness and barbarism continued dulberry and hence it comes that sound principles make so little progress in wales as if we hadnt redletter days in the calendar more than enough already from national and general superstition but these local superstitions must step in to add another gentlemen it seems to me that parliament should put a stop to all bellringing wearing of leeks flaunting about with ribbons and flocking together in the street suppose gentlemen we should have an address prepared against leeks no addresses mr dulberry said the landlord for this day at any rate sir morgan walladmor would send the beadle to you with a rod of nettles if he was to hear of such a thing for he doats upon the leek and st davids day this is one of his great jollification days and he sends bread meat drink coals and money to every poor cottage for a dozen miles round nay i may go farther and tell no lie for though the baronets an old man now and has had some sorrow to bear of his own by his good will there shouldnt be a sad heart in machynleth on st davids day and thats five and twenty long miles from castle walladmor abominable despotism and the poor oppressed creatures do actually swallow his drink swallow it aye mr dulberry its no physic and they dance too i suppose every mothers child of them mr dulberry not a soul butll dance today except babies and cripples lord mr dulberry if you dont like to see poor labouring folks happy for one day in the year ill tell you this you must keep out of machynleth on st davids day well this tyranny goes beyond any thing ive seen we all know that lord londonderry has compelled manchester and all england to wear mourning but this rustic tyrant is determined to make people merry when as every body must know they want to cry come come sir the baronets a good man and no tyrant though he may have his fancies and his faults like the rest of us but we most of us like him pretty well tenants and all and as to his niece miss genevieve i believe theres not many between this and the castle but would go through fire and water for her sir morgan walladmor said alderman gravesand is a wise man and in these times of change and lightmindedness he sticks up for ancient customs its a pity but there were more such aye and hes a clever man added the landlord and knows how to tack with the wind for let who would be in or out of the ministry he has still been the kings lieutenant for these two counties of carnarvon and merioneth ever since i can think on there youre wrong landlord replied the alderman sir morgan never shifts or tacks for any body hes a staunch whig like all his ancestors from and though he doesnt go up to parliament now so often as he did in his younger days yet there has never been a tory administration but sir morgan walladmor has opposed it so far as he thought honorable that is to say he has opposed it on the fine old whig principles of the russels the cavendishes and the spencers and why doesnt he go up to parliament id be glad to know said dulberry what the d l does he stay here for like a ruminating beast chewing the cud of his youthful patriotism because he has got some pleasant sinecure for himself i suppose and some comfortable places for his sons his grandsons his nephews and his cousins ill tell you mr dulberry why he doesnt go up to parliament said alderman gravesand not as you say out of consideration for his sons grandsons nephews and cousins for he happens to have neither son grandson nephew nor cousin not as you say to preserve his own sinecures for he has never had a shilling for his services nor any reward at all from the state except indeed what a man like sir morgan thinks the greatest of all rewards the thanks of parliament and the approbation of his sovereign not as you say to take his ease and pleasure for he has troubles enough of his own to keep him waking at walladmor house as much as if he were in st jamesssquare these are not his reasons mr dulberry but now ill tell you what is there are just now in london and elsewhere a set of presumptuous illiterate mechanical rogues who take upon themselves to be the defenders of old england and her liberties and they have made the very name of liberty ridiculous and all the old authentic champions of constitutional rights in parliament or elsewhere shrink back in shame from the opprobrium of seeming to make common cause with a crew so base and mechanical and if there were any person of that stamp here and he were to take liberties with better men than himself i would take him by the shoulder just as i do you mr dulberry and i would pin him down into his chair and i would say to him thou ridiculous reformer if i hear a word of insolence from thy lips against our worthy lord lieutenant i will most unceremoniously toss thee neck and heels out of the window for a day of peace and festivity that would be an unsuitable spectacle and therefore glad i am that i see no such ridiculous person before me but on the contrary my worthy old friend and acquaintance samuel dulberry the reformer made no manual reply to this significant threat but contented himself with turning his back contemptuously on the alderman at the same time uttering these words well mr gravesand serve your master after your own fashion what is it to me carry his lapdogs fondle his cats fawn upon his spaniels what care i but what dreadful form of commination hung pendant upon this but was never known for precisely at this moment and most auspiciously for the general harmony of the company the reformers eloquence was cut short by a joyous uproar of voices theyre coming theyre coming and immediately a sealike sound of glad tumultuous crowds in advance of the procession swelled upon the ear from the open door every window was flung up in a moment mothers were hurrying with their infants fathers were raising their lads and lasses on their shoulders the thunders of the lord lieutenants band began to peal from a distance in half a minute the head of the procession appeared in view wheeling round the corner heads after heads horses after horses in neverending succession kept pouring round into the street the whole marketplace filled as with the influx of a spring tide and all eyes were turned upon the ceremonial part of the procession which now began to unfold its pomp first came the snowdon archers two and two in their ancient uniform of green and white in number one hundred and twenty immediately behind them rode a young man in black and crimson usually called goldenspear from the circumstance of his carrying the gilt spear of harlech castle with which by the custom he is to ride into machynleth church at a certain part of the service on st davids day and into dolgelly church on the day of pentecost and there to strike three times against traitors grave with a certain form of adjuration in three languages after him came the rangers of penmorfa all mounted and riding four abreast they were in number about eightyfour and wore as usual a uniform of watchet ie azure and white with horsecloths and housings of the same colors and the ancient custom had been that all the horses should be white this rule had been relaxed in later times from the poverty of the penmorfa people in consequence of repeated irruptions of the sea but was now restored with brilliant effect on the coloring of the procession by the liberality of sir morgan walladmor next after these rode the sheriff of merionethshire and his billmen all in ancient costume and then came the most interesting part of the cavalcade on st davids day it had always been the custom that the bishop of bangor should send some representative to do suit and service for a manor which he held of the house of walladmor and the usage was that if there were an heir male to that ancient house the bishop sent four young men who carried falcons perched on their wrists but if the presumptive claimant of the walladmor honors and estates were a female in that case he sent four young girls who carried doves both the doves and the falcons had an allusion to the arms of the walladmors and for some reason in the present year sir morgan had chosen himself to add the four falcons and their bearers to the bishops doves these were arranged in the following manner four beautiful girls drest altogether in white without bonnets and having no headdress but white caps were ranged in line with the four falconbearers who were young boys dressed in complete suits of bishops purple and purple mantles all the eight rode on white horses and immediately behind them came a kind of triumphal car low but very spacious and carrying sir morgans five domestic harpers and the silver harps which they had won in the contests first introduced under queen elizabeths reform in behind the car again rode five horsemen on gigantic horses carrying the five banners of the five several castles belonging to sir morgan in wales the banners were so managed as to droop over the heads of the young women and boys and thus the doves the falcons their beautiful bearers the white horses the venerable harpers and their silver harps were all gathered as it were into one central group by means of the banners of purple and gold which spread their fine floating draperies above them all this was the centre of the procession but immediately in advance of this part ie between it and the sheriffs party rode the two presiding persons of the ceremony and who in that character as well as for the interest connected with their own appearance commanded universal attention immediately before the falconbearers and mounted upon a grey charger rode a tall meagre man in a dress well fitted to raise laughter in the spectator and with a countenance well fitted to repress it this was sir morgan walladmor his dress was an embroidered suit something in the fashion of the french court during the regency of the duke of orleans in the minority of louis the fifteenth and having been worn by the baronet in his youth upon some memorable occasion where it had either aided his then handsome person in making a conquest or in some other way had connected itself with remembrances that were affecting to him he never would wear this dress on any day but st davidsnor on that day would ever wear any other the dress was sacred to the festival which like all joyous ceremonials and commemorations to those who are advanced in years bring with them some sorrow blended with their joy in such sorrow however where it is a simple tribute of natural regrets to the images of vanished things and the fleeting records of poor transitory man there is often an overbalance of pleasure but the merest stranger who read the features of sir morgan walladmor with a discerning eye might see a history written there of a sorrow that went deeper than that a sorrow not tempered by any pleasure on ordinary occasions this was the predominant expression of his countenance mixed however at all times with something of a humorous aspect a half fantastic sense of the ludicrous and perhaps a few reliques of that sternness which at one time was said to have had some place in the composition of his character but this had long given way to the influences of time and the softening hand of affliction all harshness that might once have thrown a shade over the milder graces of his character was now removed and on this day above all days in the year his heart had no leisure for any feelings but those of kindness dilated as it was by the old ancestral glories that were revived and shadowed forth in the pomps before him every part of the ceremonial to his eye was rich with meaning and symbolic language and in the eye of the rudest of his countrymen he saw this language repeated and reflected the language of exulting national pride with a personal application to himself as its chief local representative apart from these patriotic feelings sir morgan was capable of enjoying that purest of all happiness which is reflected from the spectacle of happiness in others he was besides now riding for the sixtieth time in this annual procession having begun to ride when he was no more than five years old and finally sir morgan was a gentleman in the most emphatic sense of that emphatic word hence it arose that his manners on this occasion were more than merely courteous or condescending all thought of condescension was lost and forgotten in the expression of paternal benignity with which he looked on those around him the meanest and the highest the youngest and oldest came in alike for the salutation of his eye to the poorest cottagers as he past he bowed and smiled with an air of cordial sincerity that allowed no thought of artifice and young and old man and woman all smiled with delighted faces and happy confidence as they bowed and curtsied in return as he passed under the inn sir morgan threw up his eyes to the upper windows and observing them thickly crowded with strangers he moved with a courtly politeness at the same time smiling archly but goodnaturedly as his eye caught that of mr dulberry whose character as a reformer had reached him and who at this moment was the only one amongst the gentlemen present that stood bolt upright and proclaimed his radical patriotism by refusing to acknowledge the lord lieutenants salutation impressive as sir morgans aspect and costume were the attention of every body however was at this moment drawn off to his youthful companion who just now turned her eyes with a hurried glance on the inn but immediately withdrew them as she observed the crowd of gentlemen at the windows all the strangers were aware that this was the baronets niece who was now an object of sufficient interest from the disclosures of the preceding night even though she had been less attractive in her person sorrow in miss walladmor wore its most touching shape as yet it had made no ravages in her beauty and if it had laid a hand of gentle violence upon her health it had as yet cropped only the luxuriance of her youthful charms it was clear to every eye that miss walladmor was not one of those persons who surrender themselves unresisting victims to dejection and sink without a struggle into premature valetudinarians somewhat indeed her early acquaintance with grief had dimmed the lustre of her fine blue eyes and had given a pensive timidity to her manner but if her eye were less bright it was still full of spirit and intelligence and if the roses were stolen from her cheek her paleness was rather the paleness of thought than of constitutional languor or to express it in the exquisite lines of a modern poet if she wore a pale face it was however a pale face that seemd undoubtedly as if a blooming face it ought to be and her whole person and deportment expressed that naturally she was of redundant health and gaiety but suffering under the shocks of a trial to which she had been summoned too early for her youthful fortitude having mounted on horseback only at the entrance of machynleth miss walladmor did not wear a ridinghabit but had gratified her uncle by assuming the plain white morning dress white ribbons and cap which ancient custom had consecrated to the occasion adding only in consideration of the frosty day an ermine tippet the horse she rode was a white palfrey of the beautiful breed so much valued by charles i and in fact traced its pedigre from the famous white rose which had been presented by the sister of that prince the electress palatine to an ancestor of sir morgans who had attended her to heidelberg at the moment of passing the inn one of the doves which miss walladmor had been in the habit of feeding quitted the hand of the young bearer behind and perched upon the shoulder of her mistress making up a picture of innocent beauty somewhat fanciful and allegoric but not on that account the less fitted to harmonize with the antique pageantries of this heraldic solemnity such were the two central and presiding figures every eye strained after them and all that followed was unnoticed the bailiff of talyllyn with the surcoat and the silver spurs of llewellyn the high constable of aberglasllyn with his gorgeous display of antique liveries the tawny coats of the bishop of st asaph who came to ride the boundaries of the old episcopal demesne of aberkilvie in company with the retainers of sir morgan the mayor and corporation of machynleth in their crimson robes all alike passed unheeded and the spectators were first roused from the fascination of the departing spectacle by the clangor of the band which with the barmouth seafencibles two troops of dragoons and the cortge of the sheriff of carnarvonshire brought up the rear of the cavalcade as fast as the procession cleared the ground with the fluent motion of water the crowd closed up in its wake all eager to press after it into the church bertram who had shared deeply in the general admiration and pity expressed for miss walladmor sympathized no less with the national feeling belonging to the day who can blame him the spectacle of a whole multitude swayed by one feeling however little the object of that feeling may be approved by the judgment of the spectator appeals irresistibly to his sympathies if he be not more than usually coldhearted and i remember well that though myself a faithful son of the scotish church i was once seduced by such an occasion into an involuntary act of idolatrous compliance with popery it was at orleans the day was splendid the bells proclaimed a festival a vast procession of a mixed composition religious and military was streaming towards the cathedral and by a moral compulsion rather than by any physical pressure of the crowd i was swept along into the general vortex suddenly an angle of the road brought me into such a position with respect to all who were in advance of my station that i could see the whole vast line bent into the form of a crescent and with its head entering at the greatdoors of the cathedral i gazed on the tossing of the plumes and the never ending dance of heads succeeding to heads as they plunged into what seemed the dark abysses of the church one after one i beheld the legions and their eagles the banners and the lilies of france swallowed up by the cathedral then as i came nearer and nearer i could hear the great blair of the organ throwing off its clouds of ascending music like incense fuming from an altar nearer still i could look through the high portals into the nave of the church and could distinguish the opposite windows storied with gorgeous emblazonries of saints and martyrs angels and archangels whilst above them were seen the madonna and the lamb of god with the cross and through the upper panes streamed in the golden rays of the sun and the blue light of the unfathomable heavens then as i myself was entering suddenly the shattering trumpetstop was opened and i heard the full choir singing the great anthem of pergolesi and the dead shall arise at which instant i also wept with the multitude and acknowledged a common faith and a common hope and for a moment i will confess that i apostatized to the church of rome for the sake of her pomps and vanities a sin which i trust is forgiven me as i can assure the church of scotland that it is the single occasion throughout my life on which i have had any wanderings of thought from her pure and orthodox creed under a similar impulse caught from the contagion of public enthusiasm bertram pressed after the procession into the church he was carried by the crowd into a situation from which he could overlook the entire nave which was in the simplest style of gothic architecture and naked of all the ornaments which belong to the florid gothic of a later age the massy pillars were left unviolated by the petty hand of household neatness they stood severe in monumental granite unwhitewashed unstuccoed without tricks or frippery all the gingerbread work of plinths to the base or fretted cornices to the capitals had been banished by the austerity of the presiding taste and it struck bertram also as a picturesque circumstance in the whole effect and at the same time a circumstance of rude grandeur which well accorded with the spirit of the architecture that there was no ceiling the whole was open to the slates and the vast beams and joists of oak which had been laid for upwards of four hundred years were clearly distinguishable below these were suspended antique banners which floated at times in the currents of air and all the pillars were hung with shields helmets shirts of mail and other ancient records of warlike achievements arranged in the manner of trophies all these were covered with venerable dust the deposition of centuries which no loyalhearted welchman would on any account have disturbed the service as is usual at machynleth at bangor cathedral and other great churches in north wales was partly performed in welch and partly in english the singing which was fine and supported by an organ of prodigious power was chiefly of a triumphant and as it appeared to bertram almost martial character just before the sermon however an ancient ceremony showed that if the religion of the day clothed itself in the attire of earthly pride and exultation the martial patriotism of wales could sometimes soar into a religious expression the people divided to the right and the left leaving a lane from the great door a trumpet sounded and in rode goldenspear lance in rest the whole length of the nave passed into the choir and halted before a monument of black marble he paused for a few moments then cried with a loud voice in welch english and latin bastard of walladmor to which summons the choir sang a penitential antiphony then he raised his spear and struck the outside of the tomb to which again the organ muttered and the choir sang a response then a second time he raised the golden spear and plunged it through an iron grating which occupied the place of heart in the stony figure of a knight recumbent on the tomb the spear sank within a foot of the head and again the organ muttered some sad tones after which he pronounced these words god who in six days and seven nights created heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is send up thy guilty soul into this grave so long as the sea and the earth endure on st davids day annually to hear the message which i bring from walladmor and harlech the death which thou gavest to the pagan dogs was given in vain the treason which should have trampled on the cross was confounded by gods weak instruments a falcon and a dove the crescent was dimmed at walladmor and the golden spear prevailed at harlech and the banner of walladmor is flying to this day so let it fly until arthur shall come again in power and great beauty on which day thy treason be forgiven thee thus having delivered his message to the grave the herald drew forth his spear ported it bowed to the altar and turning his horse rode back and as goldenspear issued from the choir the organ and the choristers commenced one of the chorusses in judas maccabaeus then followed the sermon which was in welch but as bertram could distinguish full of allusions to the great names of wales and in fact as martial as any part of the service and to all appearance as gratifying to the patriotic fervour of the audience that finished the rival thunders of the organ within and the martial band without gave notice that the procession was on its return footnotes to chapter vii footnote see ap howel de lege principal per forestam et chasam snowd hactenus recepta hist of the gwedir fam c footnote for the legend of the two traitors vid ap howel ubi supra chapter viii charmi sir i may move the court to serve your will but therein shall but wrong you and myself rom why think you so sir charmi cause i am familiar with what will be their answer they will say tis against law and argue me of ignorance for offering them the motion rom you know not sir how in this case they may dispense with law and therefore frame not you their answer for them but do your parts massinger and field fatal dowry with the hope of again seeing miss walladmor and her uncle bertram was attempting to make his way up to the centre of the procession so many others however had precisely the same object in view that he was likely to have found it a matter of some difficulty to pierce the dense array of foot and horse passengers suddenly at this moment he found himself tapped on the shoulder by somebody who stood behind and turning round he perceived mr dulberry come with me said dulberry and i will show you a short cut by the back way jump a hedge or two and trespass over a few silly old womens potato gardens and we shall be at the inn before the procession arrives it will pass the inn then on its return i suppose so but what need you or i care for such absurd mummeries good god to think of the money that might have been earned by all these horses if they had been spending the day creditably and honestly in ploughing and tilling the land whereas now ploughing mr dulberry but surely its not the season just now with the ground frozen as deep as it is for rural labours of that sort well no matter theres work enough for horses amongst dyers tanners and such people by the way did you ever hear of my machine for teazing wool wonderful invention horse labor entirely superseded a little steam and a man or two give me these and ill teaze the whole world wonderful the progress of the human intellect since the time of archimedes but no doubt you are acquainted with my teazing machine in fact i have that honor or rather what am i saying i beg your pardon that particular teazing machine of yours which you now allude to i have not the honor of knowing at all ah but then you should the sooner the better for no man can be said to have finished his education who is not well acquainted with my teazing machine in fact it has had a great influence on the literature of this country for the ode to my teazing machine which is generally regarded as the most finished production of the english lyric muse here mr dulberry was interrupted by a hedge which it was necessary to leap and bertram remarked that in spite of the contempt which he professed for unprofitable show and mummery the reformer bestirred himself as actively and took a hedge as nimbly as the youngest lad could have done under the fear of missing any part of the spectacle on reaching the inn however they learned that their labor was thrown away one part of the procession had gone off by different routes to ride the boundaries of lordships and perform other annual ceremonies part had dispersed and another part had accompanied sir morgan to the town hall of machynleth where a welsh courtofgrace was held according to immemorial precedent for receiving petitions granting extraordinary favors or dispensations and redressing any complaints against the agents of sir morgan as lord of walladmor and many other manors in their various feudal duties at this court it was sir morgans custom to preside in person as to miss walladmor she it appeared had got into her carriage at the church door was gone off to make some calls in the neighbourhood and was not expected to pass through machynleth on her road back to walladmor castle before dark after taking some refreshment dulberry proposed to bertram that they should adjourn to the town hall on entering the courtroom they were both surprized to observe the phlegmatic dutchman addressing sir morgan in the character of petitioner they caught enough of his closing words to understand that the gte of his petition was to obtain the baronets sanction for the regular and christian interment of some foreigner who had died at sea by all means mr van der velsen replied sir morgan by all means there needs no petition wales i thank god has never failed in any point of hospitality to poor strangers who were thrown upon her kindness much less could she betray her religious duties to the dead but what is the name of the deceased sare morgan replied the dutchman de pauvre man fos not welsherman to him got fos not gif so moch honneur he no more dan pauvre jack frenshman bot vat den he goot christen man sweet lovely charmant man des plus aimables oh fos beautiful man of war but what was his name i ask mr van der velsen de name de name oh de name is le harnois monsieur le harnois he fos captain au service de sa majest trs chrtienne bertram started with surprize but he controlled his astonishment and attended to what followed from sir morgan well mr van der velsen frenchman or not i know of no possible objection to his being decently buried in the churchyard of aberkilvie which lies by the seaside about eighteen miles from this place there are bodies of all nations dutch english danes spaniards and no doubt frenchmen flung upon our shores by shipwreck or other accidents of mortality by all means let the french captain be honourably interred at aberkilvie tank sare morgan moch tank bot bot sare dare is anoder leetle ting and what is that sir here another friend of the deceased stepped forward and briefly stated that captain le harnois was a roman catholic and that his son therefore naturally wished to bury him in a catholic buryingground but where is there such a buryingground asked sir morgan i know of none but the chapel of utragan where nobody has been buried since the wars of the two roses and now i am sorry to say it is used as a potato ground if the lord lieutenant would permit us to carry the deceased so far inland there is the consecrated ground of griffith ap gauvon true there is ap gauvon certainly i had forgot well be it so let captain le harnois be buried in one of the chapels at ap gauvon tank sare moch tank said the dutchman but dare is noder leetle ting and then he explained in substance that as the captain had died at sea all his friends were apprehensive that the officers of the customs and excise would insist on searching the hearse and coffin an indignity which would grievously wound the feelings of his son and all his family and which could not be viewed in france in any other light than as an insult unworthy of a great and liberal nation to the memory of a brave officer who had the honor to serve his most christian majesty i am sorry for it said sir morgan but in this point it is quite impossible for me to be of any service the coast hereabouts has been so much resorted to of late years by smuggling vessels that the officers of the revenue are reasonably very strict and the law is imperative but this officer said the english spokesman this captain le harnois if you will condescend to listen to me sir morgan walladmor was a man of honor and of known integrity i might go further he was a religious man and distinguished for his catholic devotion was he not herr van der velsen oh var moch religious as for a man of war he fos beautiful christen he cry moch for sin often dat i see him all de leetle prayer and all de leetle hymn he sing dem all one two tree quatre noine time per day de word dat de haf all time in his mout to me and to oder men fos deese let all ting be charmant lufly bourbonish and religious oh for de saltwater christen he was beautiful beautiful man of war i doubt it not gentlemen said sir morgan and am happy to hear such an account of the captains piety which will now be of more service to him than all the honors we could render to his poor earthly remains not that i would countenance any person in offering them an indignity if i could see how it were to be avoided we are all sure that you would not said the englishman the name of walladmor is a pledge for every thing that is highminded and liberal and in this case young le harnois the captains son was the more induced to hope for the indulgence desired because the deceased was a man of family and connected with the highest blood in europe in particular he had the honor to be distantly related to the house of walladmor ah said sir morgan in what way through the montmorencies it is notorious to all europe that there is an old connexion between the walladmors and the montmorencies and the family of le harnois is nearly connected by the female side with the montmorencies undoubtedly said sir morgan my family have more than once intermarried with the montmorencies undoubtedly what you say is very true gentlemen and as this is the case i will not deny that i am disposed to view your petition favourably some indulgence some consideration is certainly due to the blood of the montmorencieslet me think a moment then after a pause he added well gentlemen i will grant you the dispensation you ask you shall have my order to the officers of the customs and excise for the undisturbed passage of the funeral train to griffith ap gauvon i will take the whole responsibility on myself and this evening i will write to the lords of the treasury and the home secretary to prevent any misstatement of the matter davies make out the order and i will sign it both the appellants made their acknowledgments to sir morgan in the warmest terms and having received the order together with an assurance from sir morgan that he should send down a carriage from walladmor house to meet the funeral on the seashore and pay the last honors to the poor gentlemans remains they bowed profoundly and quitted the court bertram meantime who had so recently parted with captain le harnois in apparent good health had been at first thoroughly confounded by this unexpected intelligence of his death until the portrait of the deceased gentlemans piety drawn by his friends in such very flattering colors began to suggest a belief that certainly there must be two captains le harnois and probably therefore two descendants of the montmorencies cruizing off the coast of wales this belief again was put to flight by de word which he haf alway in his mout as reported by herr van der velsen not knowing what to think he followed the two negociators and addressing himself to the dutchman begged to know if the deceased captain on whose behalf the petition had just been presented to the lord lieutenant were that captain le harnois who commanded the fleursdelys oh sare ja de var same de pious good christen capitaine le harnois god bless me is it possible i parted with him last night at five oclock and i protest i never saw a man look better in my life dead why it seems a thing incredible at five oclock yesterday but twentythree hours ago i declare to you mr van der velsen that i saw him with a keg of spirits by his side and ill venture to say that he drank a glass of it every three minutes aye alway he trank his physic at five oclock bot sare mine dear sare all would not save him no ting would save him his time fos come and what was his complaint pray consomption consumption what captain le harnois complaint consumption oh que oui sare he complain moch of consomption why he had good reason to complain of it if it killed him with so little warning but what sort of consumption consumption of the brandy cask oh no mine dear friend consomption what you call it trotting consomption galloping consumption he means said the english coadjutor of mr van der velsen in good truth then it must have galloped said bertram for last night well sir no matter how or when you hear that the captain is dead we are not his doctors but his executors and if you owe him any money you will pay it to me or to this gentleman or he added on observing that bertram laughed at such a conceit as that of the worthy captains having suffered any man to leave the fleursdelys in his debt or if you owe nothing to his estate perhaps out of love you will join us tomorrow on the road to ap gauvon and at the same time he put into bertrams hand a written paper of the following tenor but without date or subscription in full confidence that you are a good christian and that you patronize freedom of trade we hereby invite you to attend the funeral of the late captain le harnois a worthy christian and one who admired patronized and personally promoted unlimited freedom of trade by every means in his power the place of rendezvous is huntingcross near the seaside by aberkilvie the time nine in the morning if any other engagement should interfere with your attending at this hour and place you will be so good as to join us on the road to griffith ap gauvon finally dear christian brother out of affection to the memory of the deceased have the kindness to bring a cudgel with you not less than two inches thick and three and a half feet long bertram mused a little on this last item in the invitation but recollecting that it might possibly be part of the etiquette in welsh funeral solemnities and being at any rate certain that the funeral had the highest possible sanction he said at length well gentlemen i cannot say that i owe the deceased captain any money or much love but i bear no malice and i have a mind to see how funerals are conducted in north wales and griffith ap gauvon i now recollect was one of the places pointed out to me as best worth seeing in this part of the country all things considered therefore if the morning should prove fine i will not fail to join you somewhere on the road to ap gauvon at this point the conversation dropped his two companions thanked him and turned off down a bye street upon some business connected with the preparations for the ensuing day whilst bertram pursued the direct road to the inn by this time it was dusk the cottage windows were beginning to brighten with the blazing fire within crowds of men were in the street elevated with sir morgans liquor and all the boys of machynleth were gathering into groups and preparing to let off their squibs and crackers in honour of the day on approaching the inn bertram observed a carriage drawn up to the door and a sudden blaze of light from one of the torches which now began to appear amongst the crowd showed him the figure of a young lady sitting inside a minute afterwards one of the attendants lit the carriage lamps in doing which the light of his candle illuminated the inside of the carriage and fell strongly upon a face too beautiful and expressive to be forgotten by any one who had once beheld it bertram perceived that it was miss walladmor who was now on her return to walladmor house shell be off in a moment said the landlord shes only stopping to change horses and get the lamps lit the lord lieutenants horses that brought her in from the castle in the forenoon have been a matter of thirty miles with her since churchtime on the other side the country and thats near sixty in all and so she takes my horses on to walladmor and does sir morgan not accompany her oh lord no sir morgan always dines with the corporation and hell not be on the road for these seven hours not on this side of midnight ill warrant him this is st davids day id have you to remember and this ill take upon me to saymind i name no namesbut this ill say theres no man in machynleth gentle or simple that will have the face to be sober tonight when the clock strikes twelve nor any man that will leave machynleth sober after twelve what do you take us for heathens most of us have been drunk these four hours agone and are ready to be drunk again and theres not many here but will have their eyes set in their heads in two hours more ill answer for one well but at least youll except miss walladmors servants i hope ill except nobody if miss walladmor wants lads to drive her that are not drunk she must send for em to some other county shell not find em in this but she knows that well enough lord love her theres not a driver in the county not a horse almost nor any dumb creature whatsomever that would bring miss walladmor into any danger what the lads may be a little fresh or so but theyll drive all the better for that theres that lad now hes going to ride the leaders and im much in doubt whether hell be able to mount but if he once gets fairly into the saddle the devil wont throw him out hell sit like a leech all the way from carnarvonshire to jerusalem whether wrong or right in the latter part of this prediction the landlord was certainly right in the former for at this moment the postillion had succeeded in putting his foot into the stirrup but in throwing his leg over the horses croupe he grazed his flank sharply with the spur and from the instantaneous rearing and plunging of the horse was pretty nearly flung under his feet drunk as the lad was however he had a sort of instinct for maintaining or recovering any hold once gained that soon enabled him to throw himself into the saddle but the danger was now past his power to control a shower of squibs and crackers which had been purposely reserved by way of a valedictory salute to miss walladmor were at this moment discharged and one of them unfortunately fell under the feet of the near leader previously irritated and now alarmed beyond measure by the fireworks the huzzas and the flashing lights the horse became ungovernable the contagion of panic spread all were plunging and kicking at once the splinterbar was smashed to atoms and the crowd of bystanders being confused by the darkness and the uncertain light before any one could lay hands upon them the horses had lurched to one side and placed the carriage at the very edge of the road fenced off only by a slender wooden railing of two feet high from a precipice of forty feet which just at this place overhung the river at this instant a man muffled up in a dark cloak whom bertram whilst talking with the landlord had repeatedly observed walking about the carriage and looking anxiously to the windows sprang with the speed of lightning to the leaders heads and held them forcibly until others followed his example and seized the heads of the wheelhorses but all the horses continuing still to tremble with that sort of trepidating and trampling motion which announces a speedy relapse into the paroxysm of fury the man who held the leaders drew a cutlass from beneath his cloak and tossing it to a sailorlike man who stood near him bade him instantly cut the traces not a moment was to be lost for the hind wheels were already backing obliquely against the rails the slight wood work was heard crashing and a few inches more of retrograde motion would send the whole equipage over the precipice the sailor however had a sailors agility and cut away as if he had been cutting at a boarding netting ten seconds sufficed to disengage the carriage from the horses and at the same instant a body of men seizing the hind wheels rolled the carriage forward from the dark precipitous edge over which it already hung in tottering suspense a burst of joyous exultation rose from the crowd for miss walladmor was universally beloved as much on her own account as from the local attachment to her name and family whilst the danger lasted she had sate still and composed in the carriage when it was over she first felt a little agitated and the loud testimonies of affectionate congratulation made her more so she bent forward however to the window and commanded herself sufficiently to thank them all in a low but very audible and emphatic tone the sweetness of her low and melancholy voice trembling with emotion and her pensive beauty which was at this moment powerfully revealed by the torchlight charmed the rudest man in the crowd all was hushed while she spoke and the next moment an answer rose from the whole assemblage of people in clamorous expressions of attachment to the young lady of walladmor bertram had been a silent observer of all he still kept his eye on the man in the cloak and he observed that as soon as the attention of the crowd was withdrawn from the carriage this man again approached it miss walladmor had also observed him and being well aware that it was chiefly to the man in the cloak that she was indebted for her safety she was anxious for an opportunity of thanking him separately for this purpose she leaned forward as he approached and was going to have spoke but suddenly the stranger unmuffled his head the light of the lamp fell upon his features and disclosed the countenance of a young man apparently about twentyfour years old a countenance which at this moment appeared to bertram eminently noble and dignified and strongly reminded him of the fine profile which he had seen in the gallery of the inn it was a countenance that to miss walladmor was known too well for her peace this was evident from all that followed she uttered a sudden shriek on seeing him the noise of the crowd overpowered it but bertram was near and heard it then sank back for a moment then again leaned forward and turned deadly pale then seemed to recover herself and burst into tears large tears which glittered in the lamplight and at last fixing her eyes upon the stranger and seeing that he stood checked and agitated by the uncertain meaning of her manner in a moment and in a rapture of tenderness that asked no counsel of fears or selfish scruples or of any thing on this earth but her own womans heart she stretched out her hand to him and through her streaming tears smiled upon him with innocent love she had no voice to thank him as her deliverer nor did she at this moment think of him as such for her heart had gone back to times in which she needed no ties of gratitude or believed that she needed none to justify her attachment on the other hand the stranger likewise uttered not a word he who would have died a thousand times to have saved a hair of her head from suffering injury had not thought of his recent service as of any thing that could entitle him to a moments favour and when he actually beheld the smile of her angelic countenance and found her hand within his own he held it at first as one who knew not that he held it for a little space his thoughts seemed to wander he looked upwards as if in deep perplexity and bertram observed a slight convulsive movement about his lips but suddenly he recovered himself pressed the hand which he held with a look of unutterable fervor to his heart kissed it with an anguish of love deep endless despairing and as he resigned if offered a letter which miss walladmor immediately accepted without hesitation and then without hazarding another look he disappeared hastily in the darkness all passed within little more than a minute from the position he occupied bertram had reason to believe that he only had witnessed the extraordinary scene and he could not but ejaculate to himself what a world of meaning was uttered here and yet no syllable spoken miss walladmor now drew up the glasses the injuries sustained by the carriage were speedily repaired the horses again harnessed and within ten minutes from a scene so variously agitating to her fortitude and her affections she was happy to find herself left to the solitude and darkness of her long evening ride to walladmor chapter ix char what away away for shame you profane rogues must not be mingled with these holy relicks this is a

forget his engagement would have been reminded of it by the silence of the inn and the early absence of all the strangers most of whom there was reason to suspect had gone off with the view of witnessing or taking part in the funeral honors of captain le harnois this however was a conjecture which bertram owed rather to his own sagacity than to any information won from the landlord who seemed to make it a point of his duty to profess entire ignorance of the motions of all whom he harboured in his house and with respect to the funeral in particular for some reason chose to treat it as a mysterious affair not publicly to be talked of taking the direction of aberkilvie bertram pursued a slanting course to the sea but so as to command a view of the first reach of the valley through which the funeral was to pass his purpose being to drop down into the procession from the hills which he was now traversing at any convenient spot which the circumstances of the ground might point out at length on looking down from the summit of a hill he descried the funeral train the head of the column had apparently been in motion for some time and was now winding through the rocky defiles into the long narrow strath which lay below him but such was the extent of the train that the rear had but just cleared the seashore it was a solemn and impressive spectacle to look down from such a height upon the sable and inaudible procession stealing along and meandering upon the narrow ribbonlike paths that skirted the base of the mountains the mourners were naturally a silent train even when viewed from a nearer station but from bertrams aerial position the very horses and carriages seemed shod with felt so far as he could make out the objects from the elevation at which he stood the procession opened with a large hearse by the side of which walked four stout marines as mourners close behind the hearse followed about a dozen postchaises and by the side of each walked a couple of sailors armed with cutlasses immediately in the rear of the postchaises followed those who claimed relationship to the deceased amongst whom bertram fancied that he could distinguish plumes of feathers and occasionally as the inequalities of the ground threw the files into a looser array a motley assemblage of colors and a glittering of arms from this leisurely view however of the procession as in the character of an indifferent spectator bertram now gradually dropped down the hill in order to take his station in it as an active participator in its labors the speed and direction of his course proclaimed his purpose and although the majority of the train walked with their heads bent to the ground there were many who saw him and all with one accord called aloud to him before he took his place in the train to cut himself a knotty cudgel this symbol of fraternity bertram had wholly forgotten to provide and observing that in feet all the mourners carried one he hesitated not to cut a stout bough out of the first thorn bush he happened to see this however chanced to be so large knotty and clublike that bertram could not forbear secretly comparing his own appearance with that of the heraldic wild man of the woods as emblazoned in armorial bearings indeed this whole ceremony of initiation struck him as so whimsical and so nearly resembling the classical equipment for the funeral regions dictated by the sibyl to neas that he took the liberty on assuming his place in the funeral train to put a question to his next neighbour on the use and meaning of so singular a rite was it an indigenous welsh custom or a custom adopted from france on this particular occasion in honour of capt le harnois his neighbour however happened to be somewhat churlish and surly and contented himself with replying the meaning of it is this there are a d d number of dogs in this country and theres no keeping them in any order without cudgels thats the use of them for some time the procession advanced with great order and decorum and so long as the sea continued to be visible in the rear a profound quietness and silence reigned throughout the multitude but no sooner had the windings of the hills and the inequalities of the road shut out the seashore from their view than a freer movement of feeling began to stir through the train and to relax all the previous restraints one coughed another hemmed and hawed some began to unmuffle their voices from the whispering way in which they had hitherto spoken and others who had acquaintances dispersed up and down the procession conversed with them from a distance in loud and familiar tones once invaded the whole solemnity of the procession was speedily dissolved and a corpulent man stepping out of the line threw himself down upon a stone unbuttoned his coat and waistcoat and at the same time sang out let who will endure this devils quick march ill not go a step further without a dram you there ahead have you got any thing to drink hearse ahoy have you no gin under hatches im d d if i go a step further without grog and capt le harnois may turn out and tumble to his grave head over heels for me unless you bring us a glass of something i dont care what d n this walking on foot come bear a hand there do you hear you lubbers ahead what the devil i say hearse ahoy when once a mutineer steps forward he is pretty sure of another to second him for it is but the first step over the threshold which alarms men so it was here the standard of revolt which the corpulent man had set up was soon flocked to by many others as well corpulent as lean and a general clamor was raised for spirits or wine this meeting with no attention a dutch concert began of songs in every possible style hunting songs sea songs jovial songs love songs comic songs political songs together with the lowest obscenity and ribaldry all which floated on the breeze through the sinuous labyrinths of the mountains in company with the catholic chaunts and anthems which attended the body of captain le harnois never man had merrier funeral singing being over then commenced every possible variety of ingenious mimicry oft every possible sound known to the earth beneath or the waters under the earth howling braying bleating lowing neighing whinnying hooting barking catterwauling until at length a grave and welldressed man stepped forward to expostulate with the insurgents in this person bertram immediately recognised the manager of the theatre and was thus at once able to account for the motleycolored dresses which he had seen and the plumes of feathers him however the seceders refused to hear what listen to a harlequin whom every man may see for sixpence and the insurrection seemed likely to prosper the conductors of the funeral however who had advanced far ahead with the van of the procession now returned and proposed an accommodation with the malcontents by virtue of which they should be allowed triple allowance of wine and spirits at the place of their destination in lieu of all demands on the road which on certain considerations it was dangerous to concede even this proposition however would not perhaps have been accepted by the musical insurgents but for a sudden alarm which occurred at this moment a sailor who had been reconnoitring from the neighbouring heights hastily ran down with the intelligence that the excise officers were approaching under this pressure of common danger the treaty was immediately concluded all resumed their places in the procession and the funeral anthems began to peal through the winding valleys again bertram indeed who heard some persons in his neighbourhood still uttering snatches of ribaldry anticipated some serious collision of the sacred music with the profane just as the officers were passing but on the contrary the vilest of the ribalds passed from their alehouse songs into the choral music of the funeral service with as much ease as a musician modulates out of one key into another in a few minutes a halt which ran through the whole long line of the procession announced by a kind of sympathy what was taking place in its head some stop and crossquestioning it had to parry from a small party of exciseofficers but that was soon over the excisemen rode slowly past them on their sorry jades and reconnoitred them suspiciously but gave them no further interruption and the whole line moved on as freely as before the funeral train now advanced for some time without interruption the next disturbance of the general harmony arose in the shape of some political songs of an inflammatory character these were sung in a loud voice which bertram immediately recognised as that of mr dulberry much it surprised him to find the reformer in a situation of this character which apparently promised so little fuel to the peculiar passions which devoured him however mr dulberry afterwards made it evident to bertram that it promised a good deal for in the first place he cherished a secret hope that the whole meeting was of an unlawful character and in the second place he was sure of being treated to the consolations of smuggled brandy in which besides its intrinsic excellence every glass would derive an additional zest from the consideration that it had been the honored means of cheating government out of three pence halfpenny with all his horror however of regular government and subordination mr dulberry was made sensible that on the present occasion he must submit to some such oppression for as he was wholly unsupported in his annoyance the managers were determined to prevent its spreading by acting with summary vigor accordingly the reformer was roughly seized and made sensible by the determined air of those about him that this conduct would not be tolerated threats however seldom weighed much with mr dulberry to all such arguments he was in the habit of retorting magna charta the bill of rights habeas corpus c and to the rough gestures of those who had seized him he objected actions of assault and battery seeing whom they had to deal with one of the coolest amongst the managers applied an argument better suited to his temper are you a spy mr dulberry an informer a tool of lord londonderry mr dulberry was dumb with horror because continued the other you are now abetting the agents of government whose active opposition we anticipate according to some private information we have received at the next tollbar we are fast approaching to it and they will desire no better plea for stopping our progress than the style and tendency of your songs on so solemn an occasion at this moment in fact a curve in the road brought them in view of a turnpike gate the appearance of which unpleasantly corroborated the private information for it was barricadoed with carts and waggons and flanked on both sides of the road by parties of horse and foot from the customs and the excise at this spectacle mr dulberry immediately desisted from his opposition the line of march was restored and again the solemn anthem rose filling the narrow valley through which the road lay meantime the leaders of the company mustered behind the chaises which had now been placed two abreast in order to masque their motions close consultations were held and from a sack which had been taken out of one of the post chaises about a dozen cutlasses were distributed to a select party of friends these however were concealed by the long mourning cloaks and nothing was allowed to appear that could tend to throw any colorable doubt on the pacific character of the procession the head of the train had now reached the gate an abrupt halt ensued and halfadozen welldressed persons went forward to demand the cause of this interruption high words were soon heard passing between the parties and numbers began to quit their stations in the procession and press forward some from secret orders to that effect and others from anxious curiosity among the latter was bertram who came up as one of the spokesmen on the side of the funeral was exclaiming so then you refuse to respect the order of the lord lieutenant by no means replied a revenue officer by no means we have the highest respect for the lord lieutenant and his orders you mean to say then that the order is a forged one no not forged but granted perhaps on forged representations the lord lieutenant is no more satisfied with the truth of the allegations which obtained that order than we are that is false sir the lord lieutenant is perfectly satisfied as some here can testify and it is a mere accident and owing no doubt to the earliness of our departure from the shore that his carriage is not in the train you deceive yourselves gentlemen it is no accident information was given to sir morgan late last night which determined him to alter his intentions in that point or at least to suspend them satisfy us that the body of captain le harnois is in that hearse and we will immediately despatch an express to walladmor castle from which a carriage and attendants will be able to join you in two hours by the cross road of festiniog but good god is it possible that you can wish to disturb the remains of a gallant officer and a legitimate descendant of the montmorencies why sir the most savage islanders of the south seas cannibals even anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders respect the rights of the dead the son of capt le harnois is in the company will not his word of honor the word of a montmorency be a sufficient guarantee for us the bare name of a montmorency the first french family that ever received baptism ought to be a passport through christendom it is a name replied the officer that will pass no turnpike gate in merionethshire and to cut the matter short not a carriage shall pass this gate till we have searched it but if you disregard the name of montmorency will you show no honor to the lilies of france the deceased captain mounted the flag of his most christian majesty are you not afraid of causing a rupture between the courts of st james and st cloud the officer smiled and said he hoped it would not come to that perhaps not but what will prevent it why this my friend that you will yourself be made the sacrifice it is notorious that the english treasury are just now shy of war something however must be thought of to appease the wounded honor of france lord londonderry will send down a mantrap some dark night you will be kidnapped and your head will be sent in a charger to the thuilleries a burst of laughter followed in which bertram was surprized to perceive that many of his own party joined as heartily as the other some however of a weatherbeaten seafaring appearance listened with manifest impatience to this conference and one of them as spokesman for the rest cried out my eyes whats the good of all this jaw get out of my way master harlequin and go aft noble captain shall us lay em aboard so saying he turned his eye upon a young man near the hearse who had been pointed out to bertram as young le harnois and chief mourner his hat was slouched over his eyes and his side face only presented to bertram who in this however fancied again that he saw enough to recognize the stranger who had so much impressed him in the gallery of the inn but he had little time for examination in a moment after the young man whispered to a person who stood on his right and to another on his left these retired a little to the rear whilst a strong party that had gradually collected in advance of the hearse rapidly formed and dressed in a line facing the revenue officers at that instant the young man whistled and in the twinkling of an eye upwards of forty cloaks were slipped off discovering a stout body of sailors well armed with pistols dirks and cutlasses and some of them carrying carbines slung at their backs a general huzza followed the two persons who had gone to the rear each with seven or eight followers ran severally to the right and left at right angles from the road strait up the steep hills which rose on each side then making a short circuit they descended like a torrent in the rear of the revenue officers swarmed with the agility of cats over their waggons and from these upon the turnpike gate whence they threw themselves with ease on the horses riding en croupe behind the officers who on their part being hemmed in by a party far outnumbering themselves in front and by the gate behind had no means of counteracting the manoeuvre in this awkward situation pinioned from behind and too ill mounted to have any hope of charging through so dense a crowd of armed men whose rear rested upon a triple line of post chaises the officers saw that resistance would be fruitless and unwillingly they gave up their arms meantime a stronger party of officers who were on foot had retired into a little garden adjoining to the turnpike house and were now drawn up behind a low hedge to dislodge these a select body of sailors was ordered forward which the chief mourner headed in person as they were advancing the officers discharged their pistols of which however not many were loaded with ball so powerful a resistance not having been anticipated and the result was that nobody was wounded except the commander of the party and he only by a flesh wound in his left arm according to the directions previously given them before the officers had time to reload the whole party of sailors rushed in upon them and without unshipping their firearms or cutlasses attacked them with cudgels ten or eleven out of fiveandtwenty were instantly stretched on the ground and disarmed of the remainder the major part scaled the turnpike gate and succeeded in throwing themselves into a waggon which was drawn up with its broadside across the road beyond this were drawn up two other lines of carts into the last of which for the sake of keeping open their retreat they stepped from these however the horses had not been taken out they were simply backed up at right angles to the two inner lines which stood across the road the horses heads looking down the road here they posted themselves half their faces in one direction half in the other now then for my boarders said the young leader jocosely where are my boarders and instantly an active party whom he ordered not to advance beyond the second range of carts swarmed over the gate two or three others meantime slipped round by the hill and whilst the boarders engaged the whole attention of the enemy applied their cudgels so suddenly and so vigorously to the horses that they started off at full gallop and to prevent any early relaxation of their speed the sailors ran along with them for fifty or sixty yards belaboring them with exemplary vigor the consequence of this sudden movement was that five lost their balance and fell overboard all the rest continued to scud along the road in the two heavy vessels on board which they had embarked themselves repeatedly crossing and nearly running foul of each other until at length just as they approached a turn of the road which would have carried them out of sight of their enemies they came into sudden and violent collision both carts capsized and all on board were shot out to every point of the compass a roar of laughter ascended from the sailors who now proceeded hastily to collect their trophies and to clear the road of obstructions the captured arms were tossed into a light cart which was sent on before three of the horses selected with due regard to their dulness and moral incapacity for trotting were harnessed to the waggon which was given up to those of the revenue officers who had sustained any hurt in the engagement the rest were mustered and directed to go about their business by the same road which the funeral train had just traversed by these arrangements all danger of immediate pursuit was obviated the turnpike being eighteen miles in that direction from the nearest town the chapel of utragan four miles ahead was fixed as the place at which all the horses and arms would be left for their owners on the ensuing night and then the enemy were finally turned adrift with three cheers and a glass of french brandy to those who chose to accept it and now my lads said the leader after ordering a double allowance of brandy to be served out to every man now we must make the most of our time so leave the carts here clap the horses on as leaders to our own and push forward like hell to utragan where we must all rendezvous and somewhere in that neighbourhood will consign our cargo to safe custody so saying he mounted one of the horses and hastily rode off then followed a scene which put the finishing hand to the astonishment of bertram who had stood aloof during the late engagement and formed an appropriate close to the funeral of captain le harnois the cart horses were distributed as far as they would go amongst the carriages the hearse which originally had four was now therefore drawn by six a jolly boatswain who had armed his heels with a pair of immense old french spurs rode the leaders a couple of huge broadbacked plough horses his mourning cloak he used by way of saddle and in lieu of whip he produced the cat of the fleursdelys the two hinder pairs were driven with long reins by a sailor whose off leg was a wooden one this he turned to excellent account by thumping the footboard incessantly to the great alarm of the horses assessor to him upon the box sate an old fisherman who made himself useful to the concern by leaning forward and flagellating the wheel horses with one of the captured cart whips upon the roof were mounted sixteen or eighteen sailors two of whom in one corner were performing a minuet with a world of ceremonious bows and curtseys to each other and most of the others were linking hands and dancing the steps of a hornpipe about a man in the centre who had tied his mourning cloak to his cudgel by way of flag and was holding it aloft to catch the breezes which streamed through the narrow defiles of the hills none but sailors well practised in treading the deck of a rolling ship could possibly have maintained their footing for the boatswain the wooden leg and the fisherman kept up their horses inexorably to their duty of an immutable gallop the hearse and its plumes flew through the solitary valley the postchaises carrying a similar crew on their upper decks flew after the hearse and in the rear of the whole with all the sail they could crowd but haud passibus quis flew a long straggling tail of pedestrians with cloaks streaming outstretched arms and waving hats hallooing and upbraiding the sailors with treachery for not taking them on board amongst them the most conspicuous was mr dulberry with his cloak tucked about his middle succinct for speed he spun along with fury in his eyes howling out at every moment stop ye cursed aristocrats all men are equal stop for your pedestrian brothers ye vile aristocratic hounds but all in vain the sailors had shouting enough of their own to mind from the hearse which acted as commodore to the whole squadron a running fire of signals and nautical instructions was kept up fore and aft now bowson now fisherman what are you after keep em up keep em up look at that great lumbering devil what that no that on the starboard by g he runs like a cow whos got a stone here hand it us and ill send him a remembrance messmates astern keep a sharp look out theres breakers ahead now bowson come what are you up to give that off leader of yours a kick for me look at him he never was out of a plough field and he thinks hes ploughing for the devil have you ever a bullet bowson drop it into his ear and hell gallop like a pig in a storm fisherman you throw your lash as if you were troutfishing here give us your whip and ill start him an old black devil now bowson mind how you double cape horn in the next moment cape horn was doubled one after one the flying squadron of hearse and chaises which still continued to scud along like clouds before the wind whirled round a point of rock and vanished like a hurricane in a few minutes the flying pedestrians had followed them the hubbub of shouts halloos curses and travelling echoes were hushed abruptly as in the silence of the grave the wild spectacle of black draperies and fierce faces had fled like an exhalation or a delirium all were locked up from the eye and the ear by the lofty barriers of another valley and bertram who had lingered behind and now found himself left alone in a solitary valley with a silence as profound under the broad light of three oclock in the afternoon as elsewhere at midnight felt so much perplexed by this abrupt transition and the tumultuous succession of incidents that for some time he was almost disposed to doubt whether captain le harnois and the funeral of captain le harnois and every thing that related to captain le harnois were not some aerial pageant bred out of those melancholy vapors which are often attributed to the solemn impressions of mountain solitudes footnote to chapter ix footnote sed non ante datur telluris operta subire auricomos quam quis decerpaerit arbore foetus n vi end of vol
