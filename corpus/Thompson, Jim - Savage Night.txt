savage night by jim thompson copyright id caught a slight cold when i changed trains at chicago and three days in new york three days of babes and booze while i waited to see the man hadnt helped it any i felt lousy by the time i arrived in peardale for the first time in years there was a faint trace of blood in my spit i walked through the little long island railway station and stood looking up the main street of peardale it was about four blocks long splitting the town into two ragged halves it ended at the teachers college a halfdozen red brick buildings scattered across a dozen acres or so of badly tended campus the tallest business building was three stories the residences looked pretty ratty i started coughing a little and lighted a cigarette to quiet it i wondered whether i could risk a few drinks to pull me out of my hangover i needed them i picked up my two suitcases and headed up the street it was probably partly due to my mood but the farther i got into peardale the less i liked it the whole place had a kind of decayed dyingonthevine appearance there wasnt any local industry apparently just the farm trade and you dont have commuters in a town ninetyfive miles from new york city the teachers college doubtless helped things along a little but i figured it was damned little there was something sad about it something that reminded me of baldheaded men who comb their side hair across the top i walked a couple blocks without sighting a bar either on the main drag or the side streets sweating trembling a little inside i set the suitcase down and lighted another cigarette i coughed some more i cursed the man to myself calling him every kind of a sonofabitch i could think of id have given everything i had just to be back at the filling station in arizona but it couldnt be that way it was either me and the mans thirty grand or no me no nothing id stopped in front of a store a shoe store and as i straightened i caught a glimpse of myself in the window i wasnt much to look at you could say id improved a hundred per cent in the last eight or nine years and you wouldnt be lying but i still didnt add up to much it wasnt that my kisser would stop clocks understand or anything like that it was on account of my size i looked like a boy trying to look like a man i was just five feet tall i turned away from the window then turned back again i wasnt supposed to have much dough but i didnt need to be rolling in it to wear good shoes new shoes had always done something for me they made me feel like something even if i couldnt look it i went inside there was a little showcase full of socks and garters up near the front and a chubby middleaged guy the proprietor i guess was bending over it reading a newspaper he barely glanced up at me then jerked his thumb over his shoulder right up the street there sonny he said those red brick buildings you see what i said i thats right you just go right on up there and theyll fix you up tell you what boarding house to go to and anything else you need to know look i said i you do that sonny if theres anything i dont like to be called its sonny if theres a goddamned thing in the world i dont like to be called its sonny i swung the suitcases high as i could and let them drop they came down with a jar that almost shook the glasses off his nose i walked back to the fitting chairs and sat down he followed me redfaced and hurtlooking and sat down on the stool in front of me you didnt need to do that he said reproachfully id watch that temper if i were you he was right i was going to have to watch it sure i grinned it just kind of gets my goat to be called sonny you probably feel the same way when people call you fatty he started to scowl then shifted it into a laugh he wasnt a bad guy i guess just a nosy knowitall smalltowner i asked for size five doublea elevators and he began dragging the job out to get in as many questions as possible was i going to attend the teachers college wasnt i entering a little late in the term had i got myself a place to stay yet i said that id been delayed by sickness and that i was going to stay at the jc winroy residence jake winroys he looked up sharply why you dont why are you staying there mainly because of the price i said it was the cheapest place for board and room the college had listed uhhuh he nodded and do you know why its cheap son young man because there aint no one else that will stay there i let my mouth drop open i sat staring at him worriedlooking gosh i said you dont mean hes that winroy yes sir he bobbed his head triumphantly thats just who he is the very same the man who handled the payoff for that big horsebetting ring gosh i said again why i thought he was in jail he smiled at me pityingly youre way behind the times s whatd you say your name was bigelow carl bigelow well youre way behind on your news carljakes been out for well sixseven months now got pretty sick of jail i reckon just couldnt take it even if the big boys were paying him plenty to stay there and keep his mouth shut i kept on looking worried and kind of scared understand now im not saying that you wont be perfectly all right there at the winroy place theyve got one other boarder not a student a fellow that works over to the bakery and he seems to do all right there hasnt been a detective around the house in weeks detectives i said sure to keep jake from being killed ysee carl he spelled it out for me like someone talking to an idiot child ysee jake is the key witness in that big bookie case hes the only one who can put the finger on all them crooked politicians and judges and so on who were taking bribes so when he agrees to turn states evidence and they let him out of jail the cops are afraid he might get killed ddid my voice shook talking with this clown was doing me a lot of good it was all i could do to keep from laughing did anyone ever try it huhuh stand up a minute carl feel okay well lets try the other shoe nope no one ever tried it and the more you think about it the easier it is to see why the public just aint much interested in seeing those bookies prosecuted as things stand now they cant see why its so wrong to bet with a bookie when its all right to bet at the track but taking bets is one thing and murder is another the public wouldnt go for that and ocourse everyoned know who was responsible them bookies would be out of business thered be such a stink the politicians would have to stage a cleanup no matter how they hated to i nodded hed hit the nail right on the head jake winroy couldnt be murdered at least he couldnt be murdered in a way that looked like murder what do you think will happen then i said theyll just let ja mr winroy go ahead and testify sure he snorted if he lives long enough theyll let him testify when the case comes to trial forty or fifty years from now want to wear em yeah and just throw the old ones away i said yep thats the way its working out stalling getting the case postponed theyve already done it twice and theyll keep right on doing it id be willing to bet a hundred dollars that the case never does get into court hed have lost his money the trial was set for three months from now and it wouldnt be postponed well i said thats the way it goes i guess im glad you think itll be all right for me to stay with the winroys sure he winked at me might eyen have yourself a little fun mrs winroy is quite a stepper not that im saying anything against her understand of course not i said quite a uh stepper huh looks like she could be anyways if she had the chance jake married her after he left here and moved to new york after he was riding high wide and handsome it must be quite a comedown for her living like she has to now i moved up to the front of the store with him to get my change i turned left at the first corner and walked down an unpaved side street there were no houses on it only the rear end of the corner business building on one side of the alley and a fencedin backyard on the other the sidewalk was a narrow roughbrick path but it felt good under my feet i felt taller more on even terms with the world the job didnt look so lousy any more i hadnt wanted it and i still didnt but now it was mostly because ofjake the poor bastard was kind of like me he hadnt been anything but hed done his damnedest to be something hed pulled out of this hick town and got himself a barbers job in new york it was the only work he knew the only thing he knew anything about so hed done that hed got himself into exactly the right shop one down around city hall hed played up to exactly the right customers laughing over their corny jokes kissing their tails making them trust him when the smashup came he hadnt swung a razor in years and he was handling a milliondollaramonth payoff the poor bastard no looks no education no nothing and hed pulled himself up to the top and now he was back on the bottom again running the onechair barber shop hed started with trying to make a little dough out of the winroy family residence that was too rundown to sell all the jack hed made in the rackets was gone the state had latched onto part of it and the federal government had taken another big bite and lawyers had eaten up the rest all he had was his wife and the dope was that he couldnt get a kind word out of her let alone anything else i walked along thinking about him feeling sorry for him and i didnt really notice the big black cadillac pulled up at the side of the street nor the man sitting in it i was just about to pass on by when i heard a psst and i saw that it was fruit jar i dropped the suitcases and stepped off the curb you stupid pissant i said whats the idea temper he grinned at me his eyes narrowing whats your idea sonny your train got in an hour ago i shook my head too sore to answer him i knew the man hadnt put him on me if the man had been afraid of a runout i wouldnt have been here beat it i said goddam you if you dont get out of town and stay out i will yeah what do you think the man will say about that you tell him i said tell him you drove down here in a circus wagon and stopped me on the street he wet his lips uneasily i lighted a cigarette dropped the package into my pocket and brought my hand out i slid it along the back of the seat nothing to get excited about he mumbled youll get into the city saturday the manll be back and oof thats a switchblade i said youve got about an eighth of an inch in your neck like to have a little more you crazy bas oof i laughed and let the knife drop down upon the seat take it with you i said ive been meaning to throw it away and tell the man ill look forward to seeing him he cursed me ramming the car into gear he took off so fast i had to jump back to keep from going with him grinning i went back to the walk id been waiting for an excuse to hand one to fruitjar right from the beginning when hed first made contact with me in arizona hed been picking at me i hadnt done anything to him but right away he was riding me calling me kid and sonny i wondered what was behind it fruit jar needed dough like a boar hog needs tits hed dropped out of the bootleg racket before the war and gone into used cars now he was running lots in brooklyn and queens he was making more money legit if you can call used cars legit than hed ever made with the booze but if he hadnt wanted to come in why was becoming in so much farther than he had to he hadnt needed to come down here today in fact the man wasnt going to like it a bit so so i was still thinking when i reached the winroy residence if youve been around the east much youve seen a lot of houses like it two stories high but looking a lot taller because theyre so narrow in depth steeproofed with a chimney at each end and a couple of gabled attic windows about halfway down you could goldplate them and theyd look like hell but theyre usually painted in colors that make them look twice as bad as they normally would this one was a crappy green with pukebrown trimming i almost stopped feeling sorry for winroy when i saw it a guy who would live in a place like that had it coming to him you know maybe im a little nuts on the subject you know theres just no sense to things like that id bought a little shack in arizona but it sure didnt stay a shack long i painted it an ivory white with a blue trim and did the window frames with a bright red varnish pretty it was like one of those pictures you see on christmas cards i pushed the sagging gate open i climbed the rickety steps to the porch and rang the bell i rang it a couple of times listening to it ring inside but there wasnt any answer i couldnt hear anyone stirring around i turned and glanced around the bare yard too goddamned lazy to plant a little grass i looked at the paintpeeled fence with half the pickets knocked off then my eyes came up and i looked across the street and i saw her i couldnt let on but i knew who she was even in a jersey and jeans her hair pulled back in a horses tail she was standing in the door of a little bar down the street not sure whether i was worth bothering with i went back down the steps and through the gate and she started hesitantly across the street yes she called while she was still several steps away can i help you she had one of those husky wellbred voices voices that are trained to sound well bred one look at that frame of hers and you knew the kind of breeding shed had straight out of beautyrest by boxsprings one look at her eyes and you knew she could call you more dirty words than youd find in a mile of privies im looking for mr or mrs winroy i said yes im mrs winroy how do you do i said im carl bigelow yes that broada yes was getting on my nerves should that mean something to me that depends i said on whether fifteen dollars a week means anything to you fif oh of course she laughed suddenly im terribly sorry car mr bigelow our hired girl our maid that is had to go home to her folks a family crisis of some kind and we were really expecting you last week and and things have been in such a turmoil that surely of course i cut her off i hated to see anyone work so hard for a few bucks its my fault entirely can i make up for it by buying you a drink well i was she hesitated doubtfully and i began to like her a little better if youre sure you i can i said todays a celebration tomorrow ill start tightening up well she said in that case i bought her two drinks then because i could see she wanted to ask for it i gave her thirty dollars two weeks in advance i said okay oh now she protested huskily that wellbred voice hitting on all cylinders thats entirely unnecessary after all we mr winroy and i arent doing this for money we felt it was more or less our duty you know living here in a college town to lets be friends i said friends im afraid i dont sure so we can relax i hadnt been in town more than fifteen minutes before i knew all about mr winroys trouble her face had gotten a little stiff i wish youd told me she said you must have thought i was a terrible fool to will you i said relax and i gave her my best grin big and boyish and appealing if you keep talking about being in turmoil and a terrible fool and all that stuff youll get me dizzy and im dizzy enough just looking at you she laughed she gave my hand a squeeze listen to the man or did you mean that the right way you know how i meant it i said ill bet i look a fright honest to hannah carl i oop listen to me calling you carl already everybody does i said i wouldnt know how to take it if anyone called me mister but id like to try i thought and id sure try to take it its been such a mess carl for months i couldnt open a door without a cop or a reporter popping out at me and then just when i think its finished and im going to have a little peace it starts all over again i dont like to complain carl i really dont but she did like to naturally everyone does but a dame whod lived on the soft money so long was too smart to do it she let her hair down just far enough to be friendly thats certainly tough i said how long do you plan on staying here how long she laughed shortly the rest of my life it looks like you dont mean that i said a woman like you why dont i mean it what else can i do i let everything slide when i married jake gave up my singing you knew i was a singer well i gave that up i havent been in a night club in years except to buy a drink i just let everything slide my voice my contacts everything now im not a kid any more now stop that i said you stop that right now oh im not complaining carl really im not how about another drink i let her buy it well i said i dont know too much about the case and its easy for me to talk but yes i think mr winroy should have stayed in jail thats what id have done of course you would any man would but maybe he knows best i said hell probably work out some big deal thatll put you higher on the heap than you were before she turned her head sharply her eyes blazing fire but i was all wideeyed and innocent the fire died and she smiled and squeezed my hand again its sweet of you to say that carl but im afraid i get so damned burned up i well whats the use talking when i cant do anything i sighed and started to buy another drink lets not she said i know you cant afford it and ive had enough im kind of funny that way i guess if theres anything that gets me its to see a person keep pouring it down after theyve had enough you know i said its funny that you should mention that its exactly the way i feel i can take a drink or even three or four but then im ready to give it a rest with me its the companionship and company that counts of course certainly she nodded thats the way it should be i picked up my change and we left the place we crossed the street and i got my bags off the porch and followed her to my room she was acting a little thoughtful this looks fine i said im sure im going to like it here carl she was looking at me curiously friendly enough but curious yes i said is there something wrong youre a lot older than you look arent you now how old would that be and then i nodded soberly i must have tipped you off i said youd never have known it from looking at me why do you say it that way you dont like i shrugged whats the use not liking it sure i love it who wouldnt like being a man and looking like a kid having people laugh every time you act like a man i havent laughed at you carl i havent given you the chance i said suppose things had been different suppose say id met you at a party and id tried to kiss you like any man in his right mind would why youd have laughed your head off and dont tell me you wouldnt because i know you would i jammed my hands into my pockets and turned my back on her i stood there head bowed shoulders slumped staring down at the threadbare carpet it was raw corny as hell but it had almost always worked before and was pretty sure it would with her she crossed the room and came around in front of me she put a hand under my chin and tilted it up you know what you are she said huskily youre a slicker she kissed me on the mouth a slicker she repeated smiling at me slanteyed whats a fast guy like you doing at a tanktown teachers college i dont really know i said its hard to put into words its well maybe you know how it is youve been doing the same thing for a long time and you dont think youre getting ahead fast enough so you look around for some way of changing things and youre probably so fed up with what youve been doing that anything that comes along looks good to you she nodded she knew how that was ive never made much money i said and figured a little education might help this was cheap and it sounded good in the catalogues at that i almost got right back on the train when i saw what it looked like yes she said grimly i know what you mean but you are going to give it a try arent you i kind of think i will i said now will you tell me something ifi can are those real those what oh she said and laughed softly boy are we slick wouldnt you like to know though well well she leaned forward suddenly eyes dancing watching my face she moved her shoulders from side to side up and down and then she stepped back quickly laughing holding me away with her hands huhuh no sir carl i dont know why i must be losing my mind to let you get away with that much just so you dont lose anything else i said and she laughed again it was louder and huskier than any of the others it was like those laughs you hear late at night in a certain type of saloon you know the people are all in a huddle at one end of the bar and theyre all looking at this one guy their lips pulled back a little from their teeth their eyes kind of glassy and all at once his voice rises and he slaps his hand down on the counter and you hear the laughter sweet she gave me another quick pat on the cheek just as sweet as he can be now ive got to get downstairs and throw something together for dinner itll be about an hour from now in case youd like to take a nap i said i might do that after id unpacked and she gave me a smile and left i started stowing my things away i was pretty well satisfied with the way things were going for a minute or two id thought i was moving too fast but it seemed to have worked out okay with a dame like her if she really liked you you could practically throw away the brakes i finished unpacking and stretched out on the bed with a truedetective story magazine i turned through the pages locating the place id left off thus the story of charlie bigger the deadliest most elusive killer in criminal history the total number of his slayingsforhire will probably never be known but he has been officially charged with sixteen he is wanted for murder in new york philadelphia chicago and detroit little bigger vanished as from the face of the earth in immediately following the gangland slaying of his brother and contactman big luke bigger exactly what became of him is still a topic for heated discussion in police and underworld circles according to some rumors he died years ago of tuberculosis others would have it that he was a victim of a revenge murder like his brother big still others maintain that he is alive the truth of course is simply this no one knows what happened to little bigger because no one knew him no one that is who survived the acquaintance all his contacts were made through his brother he was never arrested never fingerprinted never photographed no man naturally who was as murderously active as he could remain completely anonymous and little bigger did not but the picture we get pieced from various sources is more tantalizing than satisfying assuming that he is still alive and unchanged little bigger is a mildlooking little man slightly over five feet tall and weighing approximately one hundred pounds his eyes are weak and he wears thicklensed glasses he is believed to be suffering from tuberculosis his teeth are in very bad condition and many of them are missing he is quicktempered studious a moderate smoker and drinker he looks younger than the thirty to thirtyfive years which according to estimates he is now despite his appearance little bigger can be very ingratiating particularly in the case of women i tossed the magazine aside i sat up and kicked off the elevator shoes i walked to the hightopped dresser tilted the mirror down and opened my mouth i took out my upper and lower plate i pulled my eyelids back first one then the other and removed the contact lenses i stood looking at myself a moment liking the tan liking the weight id put on i coughed and looked into my handkerchief and i didnt like that much i lay back down on the bed thinking i was sure going to have to watch my health wondering if it would do me much damage when i started making love to her i closed my eyes thinking about her and him and the man and fruit jar and this crappypuke looking house and the bare front yard and the squeaking steps and and that gate my eyes snapped opened then drooped shut again id have to do something about that gate someone was liable to walk by the place and snag their clothes on it i met mr kendall the other boarder on the way down to dinner he was a dignified little old guy the kind whod remain dignified if he got locked in a nickel toilet and had to crawl under the door he said he was very happy to meet me and that he would consider it a privilege to help me get settled in peardale i said that was nice of him i was thinking about work he said as we went into the dining room coming in late this way it may be a little difficult the parttime jobs are pretty well sewed up by now but ill keep my eyes open at the bakery we employ more student help than any place in town i believe and its just possible that something can be worked out i wouldnt want you to go to any trouble i said no trouble after all were all living here together and ab that looks very good mrs winroy thanks she made a little face brushing a wisp of hair out of her eyes we may as well see how it tastes heaven only knows when jake will get here we all sat down mr kendall more or less took over the job of passing things while she slumped in her chair fanning her face with her hand she hadnt been just kidding about throwing dinner together apparently shed dashed out to the store for an armload of canned goods it wasnt bad you understand shed bought a lot of everything and it was all topgrade but she could have done twice as well with half the money and a little more effort mr kendall sampled his asparagus and said it was very good he sampled the anchovies the imported sardines and the potted tongue and said they were very good he tapped his mouth with his napkin and i was expecting him to say that it was very good or maybe hed give her a nice juicy compliment on her can opener instead he turned and glanced toward the door his head cocked a little to one side that must be ruth he said after a moment dont you think so mrs winroy mrs winroy listened she nodded thank god she sighed and began to brighten up i was afraid she might stay away another day ruth is the young lady who works here mr kendall told me shes a student at the college too a very fine young woman very deserving yeah i said maybe i shouldnt say so but it sounds to me like shes got a broken piston he gave me a blank look mrs winroy let out with the guffaw again silly she said thats her fathers car her pa she calls him he drives her back and forth from their farm whenever she goes home for a visit there was a slight mimicking note to her voice a tone that wasnt so much nasty as amused and contemptuous the car stopped in front of the house a door opened and closed slammed and someone said now you take keer o yerseif ruthie and that broken piston began to clatter and the car pulled away the gate squeaked there was a footstep on the walk just one footstep and a tap a kind of thudtap it she came up the walk stepping and thudtapping she came up the steps thudtap thudtap and across the porch mr kendall shook his head at me sadly poor girl he said dropping his voice mrs winroy excused herself and got up she met ruth at the front door and hustled her right down the hall and into the kitchen so i didnt get a good look at her rather i should say one good look was all i did get but what i saw interested me maybe it wouldnt interest you but it did me she had on an old mucklededungcolored coat the way it was screaming searsroebuck they should have paid her to wear it and a kind of rough wool skirt her glasses were the kind your grandpa maybe wore little tiny lenses steel rims pinchy across the nose they made her eyes look like walnuts in a plate of cream fudge her hair was black and thick and shiny but the way it was fixed murder she only had one leg the right one the fingers of her left hand gripping the crosspiece of her crutch looked a little splayed i heard mrs winroy ordering her around in the kitchen not mean but pretty firm and fussy i heard water running into the sink and pans clattering and the thudtap thudtap thudtap moving faster and faster humble apologetic anxious i could almost hear her heart pounding with it mr kendall passed me the sugar then spooned some into his own coffee tsk tsk he said id been hearing people say that in books for years but he was the first reallife guy id ever heard say it such a sad thing for a fine young woman yeah i said isnt it and theres nothing to be done about it apparently shell have to go through life that way you mean she cant raise the dough for an artificial leg i said theres ways of getting around that weel he looked down at his plate uncomfortably of course the family is impoverished but its well its not a question of money what is it a question of well er uh he was actually blushing i have no uh personal knowledge of the er situation but i understand its a its due to a very uh peculiar malformation of the er yeah i encouraged him of the left limb he finished he came out with it like it was a dirty word i grinned to myself and said yeah again but he wasnt talking any more about ruths uh er limb and i didnt press him any it made it more interesting not to know i could look forward to finding out about it myself he stuffed his pipe and lit up he asked me if id ever noticed how so many deserving people people who did their best to be decent got so little out of life yes i said well he said i suppose every picture has its bright side ruthie couldnt get employment in any other household and mrs winroy couldnt uhmrs winroy was having some difficulty in finding anyone so it all works out nicely mrs winroy has a grateful and industrious servant ruth has her board and room and spending money five dollars a week now i believe no kidding i said five dollars a week that must put an awful strain on mrs winroy i suppose it does he nodded seriously things being as they are but ruths an unusually good worker i should think she would be for that kind of money he took his pipe out of his mouth and looked into the bowl he glanced up at me and he chuckled im not much of a man to recite personal history mr bigelow but well i was a teacher for a great many years english literature yes i taught here at the college for a time my parents were living then and i couldnt stretch my salary over the needs of the three of us so i entered and remained in a more remunerative trade but ive never lost my interest in literature particularly in the satirists i see i said and it was my turn to blush a little its always seemed to me that satire cannot exist outside the rarefied atmosphere of excellence it is either excellent or it is nothing i should be very glad to lend you my gullivers travels mr bigelow also the collected works of lucilius juvenal butler thats enough thats more than enough i held up a hand grinning im sorry mr kendall quite all right he nodded placidly you had no way of knowing of course but a student who earns five dollars a week and her board and room in a college town this town at least is doing very well for herself sure i said i dont doubt it a bit all at once id had a crazy idea about him one that kind of gave me the whimwhams because maybe everyone doesnt have a price but if this dull dignified old guy did have one well hed be worth almost anything he asked as an ace in the hole he could throw in with me in case of a showdown back me up in a story or actually give me a hand if there was no other way out otherwise hed just keep tabs on me see that i didnt try a runout but that was crazy ive already said so the man knew i couldnt run he knew i wouldnt fluff the job i shoved the idea out of my mind shoved it damned good and hard you just cant play around with notions like that mrs winroy came in from the kitchen picking up her purse from the sideboard she paused at the table i dont want to rush you gentlemen but i think ruth would like to cleat up here whenever youre through certainly certainly mr kendall pushed back his chair shall we take our coffee into the living room mr bigelow why dont you take carls cup for him she said id like to speak to him for a moment certainly of course he said he took our cups and crossed the hall into the living room i followed her out onto the porch it was dark out there she stood up close to me you stinker she said accusingly half laughing i heard you giving him the rib so im putting a strain on myself am i hell i said you couldnt expect me to pass up an opening like that as a matter of fact when it comes to an attractive opening i she snickered but look carl honey yeah i said i brought my hands up to her hips ive got to run downtown for a while honey ill get back as soon as i can but if jake shows up while im gone dont well dont pay any attention to him that could be quite a job i said i mean hes almost sure to be drunk he always is when hes late this way but its all talk with him he hasnt got any real guts just dont pay any attention to anything he says and everything will be all right i said id do my best there was nothing else i could say she gave me a quick hard kiss then she wiped my mouth with her handkerchief and started down the steps remember carl just dont pay attention to him ill remember i said mr kendall was waiting worriedly afraid that my coffee would be cold i said it was fine just the way i liked it and he leaned back and relaxed he started talking about finding a job for me hed taken it for granted that id need one he moved from the subject of a job for me to that of his own job as got it he was the manager of the place the kind of manager who doesnt have the title and who works all hours for a few bucks more than the regular hired hands get i believe he was all set to take the night off by way of giving me a full and complete history of the baking industry as it worked out though he hadnt been spouting for more than ten or fifteen minutes when jake winroy arrived youve seen pictures ofjake of course anyone who reads the newspapers has but the pictures youve seen were probably taken when he was still in there punching for thejake youve seen and the one i saw were two different people he was a tall guy around six feet i guess and his normal weight was around two hundred pounds but he couldnt have weighed more than a hundred and forty now the skin on his face hung in folds it seemed to tug at his mouth drawing it downward it tugged down at the pouches of his eyes even his nose dropped it sagged out of his face like a melting candle in a pan of dirty tallow he was stooped curveshouldered his chin almost touched his neck and his neck seemed to bend and wobble from the weight of his head he was very drunk of course he had every right to be because he was dead the same as and i guess he knew it he got snagged coming through the gate id known damned well that gate would snag someone and when he yanked himself free he went sprawling and stumbling almost to the porch he got up the steps falling back two for every one he took it sounded like he came across the porch in a kind of staggering rush he staggered into the hall he stood weaving and swaying there a moment blinking his eyes and trying to get his bearings mr winroy mr kendall edged toward him nervously would you uh may i help you to bed mr winroy bbed jake hiccuped whhhhoo yyou now you know very well who i am sir ssure i know but duhduh duh dyou betcha ccan tell me can you mr kendalls mouth tightened would you like to come over to the bakery with me for a while mr bigelow i think ill go up to my room i said i and jake jumped like hed been shot he jumped and whirled at the sound of my voice he looked at me wildeyed and one of his long veined hands came up pointing wwho yyou this is mr bigelow said mr kendall your new boarder oh yeah yeah he took a step backward keeping his eyes fixed on me bboarder huh so hhes the new bboarder huh oh yyeah of course hes the new boarder kendall snapped a very fine young man and youre certainly doing your best to make him uncomfortable now why oh yuhyeah yeah he kept on edging toward the door edging backward in a sort of half crouch his eyes peered out at me wildly through the tumbled strands of his greasy black hair nnew bboarder makin hhuhhim uncomfortable huhhim uncomfortable oh yyeah it was like a broken record a broken record with a rasping wornout needle he made me think of some wild sick animal trapped in a corner oh yyeah yeah he didnt seem to be able to stop it all he could do was back up back back back this is disgusting sir you know quite well youve been expecting mr bigelow i was present when you talked about it with mrs winroy oh yyeah yeah sspectin mr bigelow yeah sspectin mr bbiggerlow his back touched against the screen door and he tripped on the lintel plunged stumbling across the porch and went crashing down the steps he turned a complete somersault on the way down oh my goodness mr kendall snapped on the porch light oh my goodness hes probably killed himself wringing his hands he scuttled across the porch and started down the steps and i sauntered after him but jake winroy wasnt dead and he didnt want any help from me nnnnuhno he yelled nnuhnuh no he rolled to his feet he sprang awkwardly toward the gate and he tripped and went down again he picked himself up and shot staggering into the road he took off right down the middle of it toward town arms flapping legs weaving and wobbling crazily running because there was nothing to do but run i felt pretty sorry for him he didnt need to let his house look like it did and i couldnt excuse him for it but i still felt sorry please dont let this upset you mr bigelow kendall touched my arm he simply goes a little crazy when he gets too much liquor in him sure i said i understand my father was a pretty heavy drinker lets get the light off huh i jerked my head over my shoulder a bunch a yokels had come out of the bar and were staring across the street at us i turned the light off and we stood on the porch talking a few minutes he said he hoped ruthie hadnt been alarmed he invited me to the bakery again and i turned him down he stuffed tobacco into his pipe puffed at it nervously i cant tell you how much i admired your selfpossession mr bigelow im afraid i ive always thought i was pretty cool and collected but you are i said you were swell its just that youre not used to drunks you say your uh your father it was strange that id mentioned it i mean there wasnt any harm in mentioning it but it had been so long ago more than thirty years ago of course i dont remember anything about it i said that was back in and i was only a baby at the time but my mother that was one lie i had to pound home my age tsk tsk poor woman how terrible for her he was a coal miner i said over around mcalester oklahoma the union didnt amount to much in those days and i dont need to tell you there was a depression about the only work a man could get was in the wildcats working without inspection stripping pillars i paused a moment remembering remembering the stooped back and the glaring fearmaddened eyes remembering the choked sounds at night the sobbing screams he got the idea that we were trying to kill him i said if we spilled a little meal or tore our clothes or something like that hed beat the tar out of us out of the others i mean i was only a baby yes but i dont understand why its simple i said anyway it was simple enough to him it seemed to him that we were trying to keep him in the mines keeping him from getting away using up stuff as fast as we could so that hed have to stay down there under the ground until he was buried under it mr kendall tsktsked again wretched poor deluded fellow as if you could help we couldnt help it i nodded but that didnt make it any better for him he had to work in the mines and when a man has to do something he does it but that doesnt make it any easier you might even say it was twice as hard that way youre not brave or noble or unselfish or any of the things a man likes to think he is youre just a cornered rat and you start acting like one mmm you seem to be an unusually introspective young man mr bigelow you say your father died of drink no i said he died in the mines there was so much rock on top of him that it took a week to dig him out mr kendall shoved off for the bakery after a few more tsks and howterribles and i went back in the house then i sauntered on back to the kitchen she was bent over the sink the crutch gripped under her armpit washing what looked like about a thousand dishes apparently mrs winroy had saved them up for her while shed been away them and every other dirty job i hung my coat over a chair and rolled up my sleeves i picked up a big spoon and began scraping the pans out i got them all scraped into one pan and started for the back door with it she hadnt looked at me since id come into the room and she didnt look at me now but she did manage to speak the words came out in a rush like a kid whos nerved to recite a poem and has to do it fast or not at all the ggarbage cans at the side of the porch you mean they dont have any chickens i said why they ought to have some chickens to feed it to yyes she said its a shame to waste food this way with all the hungry people there are in the world i i think so too she said sort of breathless that was all she was up to for the moment she was blushing like a house afire and her head was ducked so far over the sink was afraid she would fall in i took the garbage outside and scraped it out slowly i knew how she felt why wouldnt know how it felt to be a kind of joke to have people tell you off kind of like it was what you were made for you never get used to it but you get to where you dont expect anything else she was still pretty shocked by the idea of having talked to me when i went back inside but being shocked didnt keep her from liking it she said i sshouldnt be helping her wipe the dishes then pointed out a towel to me she said hhadnt i better put an apron on she did it for me her fingers trembling but lingering we stood wiping the dishes together our arms touching now and then the first few times it happened she jerked hers away like shed brushed against a hot stove then pretty soon she wasnt jerking away and once when my elbow brushed her breast it seemed to me that she sort of leaned into it studying her out of the corner of my eyes i saw that id been right about her left hand the fingers were splayed she didnt have the full use of it and she kept trying to hide it from me even with that though and her leg whatever was wrong with her leg she had plenty on the ball all that hard work and deep breathing had put breasts on her like daddycometochurch and swinging around on that crutch hadnt done her rear end any harm if you saw it by itself you might have thought it belonged to a shetland pony but i dont mean it was big it was the way it was put on her the way it hinged into the flat stomach and the narrow waist it was as though shed been given a break there for all the places shed been shortchanged i got her to talking i got her to laughing i draped another dishtowel over my head and started prancing around and she leaned back against the drainboard giggling and blushing and protesting sstop now carl her eyes were shining the sun had come up behind them and was shining out at me yyou stop now stop what i said pouring it on all the harder what do you want me to stop ruth you mean this or this i kept it up sizing her up while i did it and i changed my mind about a couple of things i decided i wasnt going to give her any tips on dressing i wasnt going to fix her up with a compact and a permanent because any dolling up she did need shed do for herself and she didnt really need any then suddenly she wasnt laughing any more she stopped and stood staring over my shoulder i knew what it must be id had a hunch it was coming i turned slowly around and i was damned careful to keep my hands away from my sides i cant say whether hed rung the doorbell and we hadnt heard him or whether hed just walked in without ringing but there he was a tall rawboned guy with sharp but friendly blue eyes and a graying coffeestained mustache havin quite a time for yourself hey kids he said well thats fine nothing i like bettern to see young folks enjoying themselves ruths mouth opened and closed i waited smiling been meaning to get out and see your folks miss dome he went on hear you got a new baby out there dont believe ive ever met you young fellow im bill summers sheriff summers how do you do sheriff i said and i shook hands with him im carl bigelow hope i didnt startle you folks just now dropped over to see a fellow named bigelow you say youre carl bigelow yes sir i said is there something wrong sheriff he looked me over slowly frowning taking in the apron and the dishtowel on my head looking like he couldnt decide whether to laugh or start cussing i reckon weve got some talking to do bigelow darn that jake winroys hide anyway we were in my room mrs winroy had come in a couple of minutes behind him and shed blown her lid so high wed had to come upstairs i just cant understand it i said mr winroys known i was coming for several weeks if he didnt want me here why in the world didnt well ocourse he hadnt seen you then what with seem you and connecting you up with a name that sounds kinda like yours well i can see where it might give him a little start a man thats in the fix jake winroys in if anyones got a right to feel upset its me i can tell you this sheriff if id known that james c winroy was jake winroy i wouldnt be here now uhhuh sure he shook his head sympathetically but i was kind of wonderin about that son why did you come here anyway all the way from arizona to a place like peardale that was it partly i shrugged because it was a long way from arizona as long as i was making a fresh start i thought id better make a clean break of it its not easy to make something out of yourself around people who remember you when you werent anything uhhuh yeah that was only part of it of course i said this was cheap and the school would accept me as a special student there arent many colleges that will you know if you dont have a highschool education youre out of luck i laughed shortly making it sound pretty grim and dispirited it seems pretty crazy to me now id dreamed about it for years getting myself a little education and landing a good job and and but i guess i should have known better aw now son he cleared his throat looking troubled dont take it that way i know there aint no sense to this and i dont like it a bit better than you do but i aint got no choice j ake winroy being what he is now you just help me out and well get this settled in no time ill tell you anything i can sheriff summers i said swell what about kinfolks my fathers dead my mother and the rest of the family i dont know about them we started splitting up right after dad died its been so long ago that ive even forgotten what they looked like uhhuh he said yeah i started talking nothing i told him could be checked but i could see he believed me and it would have been strange if he hadnt the story was pretty much true you see it was practically gospel except for the dates there was a hell of a depression in the oklahoma coal fields in the early twenties there were strikes and the militia was called in and no one had money enough for grub let alone doctors and undertakers and there was plenty to think about besides birth and death certificates i told him how wed drifted over into arkansas picking cotton and then on down into the rio grande valley for the fruit and then over into the imperial for the stoop crops sticking together at first then splitting up for a day or two at a time to follow the work splitting up and staying split up id sold newspapers in houston id caddied in dallas id hustled programs and pop in kansas city and in denver in front of the brown palace hotel id put the bite on a big flashylooking guy for coffee money and hed said jesus charlie you dont remember me im your brother luke but i left that part out of course uhhuh he cut in on me id given him so much he was getting tired when did you go to arizona december of ive never been real sure of my birthdate but id just turned sixteen as near as i can figure it anyway i made a point of being careful about it i dont see how i could have been more than seventeen sure he nodded scowling a little anyoned know that dont see how you could even have been sixteen well the war was still on and any kind of help was hard to get this mr fields and his wife awfully nice old couple gave me a job in their filling station and it didnt pay much because it didnt make much but i liked it fine i lived with them just like i was their son and saved everything i did make and two years ago when da i mean mr fields died i bought the place from her i guess i hesitated i guess thats one reason i wanted to get away from tucson with dad fields dead and mom moved back to iowa it just didnt seem like home any more the sheriff coughed and blew his nose dang that jake he growled so you sold out and came back here eh yes sir i said would you like to see a copy of the bill of sale i showed it to him i also showed him some of the letters mrs fields had written me from iowa before she died he paid a lot more attention to them than he had to the bill of sale and when he was through he blew his nose again goldarn it carl im really sorry to ye put you through all this but i reckon im not through yet you wont mind if i do a little telegraphin out there to tucson i just about got to you know otherwise jakell keep kickin up a fuss like a chicken with its head off you mean i paused you want to get in touch with the chief of police in tucson you aint got no objections have you no i said i just never got to know him as well as i did some of the other folks could you send a wire to the sheriff too and county judge mccafferty i used to take care of their cars for them goldang it he said and got to his feet i stood up also will this take very long sheriff i hardly feel like enrolling at the college until its settled ocourse you dont he nodded sympathetically well have it all straightened out sos you can start in next monday id have liked to get into new york first i said i wont go naturally until you say its all right but i bought a new suit while was there and the alterations were supposed to be done by this saturday i walked to the bedroom door with him and it seemed to me i heard a faint creak from the door across the hall a mans kinda got to get along with everyone in a job like mine so i wouldnt want you to repeat anything but these winroys well it aint good economy to stay with em no matter how cheap it is you take my advice an yes i said no he sighed and shook his head i guess you cant very well do that jake kicks up a big fuss and then you move out an no matter what i say or you say it looks bad makes it look like you had to move like maybe there was somethin to his crazy carryin on yes sir i said i surely wish id known who he was before i came here i saw him out the door and closed it again i stretched out on the bed with a cigarette lay with my eyes half closed puffing smoke at the ceiling i felt all wrung out no matter how well prepared you are for a deal like that it takes a lot out of you i wanted to rest to be left alone for a while and the door opened and mrs winroy came in carl she said huskily sitting down on the edge of the bed im so sorry darling ill murder thatjake when i get my hands on him forget it i said where is he anyway at his shop probably probablyll spend the night there hed better if he knows whats good for him i walked my fingers up her thigh and let them do a little wandering around after a moment or two she squeezed them absently and laid my hand back on the bed carl youre not angry i didnt like it i said but im not angry matter of fact i feel pretty sorry for jake hes losing his marbles why they wouldnt dare kill him it would hurt them twice as much as having him testify yeah i said i guess i dont know much about those things mrs winroy they why dont you call me fay honey when were alone like this fay honey i said they wouldnt dare to would they carl right here in his home town where everyone knows him and he knows everyone why why she laughed irritably my god this is the one place in the world where hes safe no stranger can get near him no one he doesnt know and i got near him i said oh well she shrugged im not counting you he knows that anyone the college sent here would be all right yeah he didnt act much like it because hes full of booze hes beginning to see things well i said whatever he does you cant blame him much i cant huh i dont think you should i said i raised up on one elbow and tamped out my cigarette heres the way i might look at it fay i said if were in j akes shoes practically all know about crime is what read in the papers but im pretty good at putting myself in the other fellows place and heres the way id feel if i were jake id figure that if they took a notion to kill me there wouldnt be anyway could stop them nothing could do no place i could go i but carl if they didnt get me in one place theyd do it in another some place somehow and no matter how tough it was id know theyd get me pay but they wont they cant afford to sure i said the case wont ever come to trial everyone says it wont well they probably know i said i was just talking about how jake would feel if he thought they did want to kill him yes but you said i mean when he knows they wont do it why he knows it but do they know it see what i mean he knows theyve got plenty of brains and plenty of money he knows theyd find an angle if they wanted to get him badly enough but they they dont i said but if they did there wouldnt be anyonejake could trust why they might even try to get to him through old man kendall oh carl thats ridiculous sure it is i said but you get the idea some guy who would never be suspected carl she was looking narroweyed interested cautious yeah fay i said you what if if what if what i said she kept on staring at me in that puzzled cautious way then she laughed suddenly and jumped up god she said talk about jake losing his marbles look carl youre not going to school this week i shook my head i didnt bother to rib her about snooping well ruth has a nine oclock class so you ought to be downstairs by eight if you want her to fix your breakfast or you can just help yourself to coffee and toast or something whenever you get up thats what i usually do thanks i said ill see how i feel in the morning she left then i opened a window and stretched back out on the bed i needed a bath but i wasnt up to it yet i wasnt up to such a little thing as undressing and walking a few steps down the hall to the bathroom i lay still forcing myself to lie still when i felt the urge to get up and look in the mirror youve got to take it easy you cant run for the big score with sand in your shoes i closed my eyes looking at myself in my minds eye it gave me a start it was like looking at someone else id seen myself that way ten thousand times and each time it was a new experience id see what other people seemed to see and id catch myself thinking gosh what a nice little guy you dont need anyone to tell you hes all right i thought that now and somehow it sent a shiver through me i started thinking about the teeth and the other chances and i knew that they really didnt matter but i made myself think about them i felt safer some way believing it was those things instead of instead of the teeth and the contact lenses the tanned healthylooking face the extra weight the added height and only part of it was due to the elevator shoes id worn since id straightened up when i shook the bug and but had i shaken it suppose i took sick now so sick i couldnt go through with this the man would be sore and the name charles bigger carl bigelow well it was as good as any it wouldnt have been any better to call myself chester bellows or chauncey billingsley and it would have had to be something like that a man cant get too far away from his own name you know he may try to but hes asking for trouble theres laundry markings theres answering when youre spoken to so so i hadnt made any mistakes i but the man had found me hed never seen me before either but hed known right where to send for me and if the man could do it i lighted a cigarette jabbed it out immediately and threw myself back on the pillows the man you couldnt count the man i hadnt made any mistakes and i wouldnt make any id make the score and id make the afterwards the hard part because no matter how smoothly it was done there was bound to be some heat and the surest way of getting cooked was to try to run from it youd screw things up for the man if they didnt get you he would so i felt drowsy no mistakes no letting down for even a second no getting sick and use them all mrs winroy directly the others indirectly theyd have to be on my side theyd have to know that i couldnt do what i had to do the man didnt need to watch me they would they were all watching to see that did it right and watching always watching and me they crowded the sidewalks of that dark narrow street that narrow and lonely street and they were going on about their business laughing and talking and enjoying life but still they were watching me watching me follow jake and watching the man follow me i was sweating and all out of breath because id been in the street a long time and they kept getting in my way getting between me and fake but they never got in the man sway me me they had to screw up and i could taste the black damp in my mouth and i could hear the pillars cracking and crumbling and the lamp on my cap began to flicker and i grabbed one of the bastards i grabbed himber and yanked and rolled and i had her on the bed she was under me and i had the crutch across her throat pinned down with my arms i blinked staring down at her fighting to come out of the dream i said jesus kid you dont want to ever i slid the crutch to one side and she started breathing again but she still couldnt talk she was too scared i looked into the great scared eyes watching me and it was all i could do to keep from slugging her spill it i said spit it out what were you doing here i i i i dug my hand into her side and twisted and she gasped spill it i i i wwas aafraid for you i i wwas wworried about carl ddont she began to struggle then and i lay flat against her i held her twisting her and she gasped and moaned she tried to pull at my hand and i twisted harder ddont ive nnever ccarl ive never its nnot nnnice and carl carl yyouve ggot to ill have a bbaby and shed stopped begging there was nothing left to beg for i looked down my head against hers so that she couldnt see that i was looking i looked and i closed my eyes quickly but i couldnt keep them closed it was a babys foot a tiny little foot and ankle it started just above the knee joint where the knee would have been if she had one a tiny little ankle not much bigger around than a thumb a baby ankle and a baby foot the toes were curling and uncurling moving with the rhythm of her body ccarl oh ccarl she gasped after a long time what seemed like a long time i heard her saying dont please dont carl its aall right so so please carl please dont cry any more i was a long time getting to sleep and thirty minutes after i did i woke up again i woke up exhausted but with the feeling that id been asleep for hours you know it went on like that all night when i woke the last time it was ninethirty and sunlight was streaming into the room it was shining right on my pillows and my face felt hot and moist i sat up quickly hugging my stomach the light hitting into my eyes suddenly had made me sick i clenched my eyes against it but the light wasnt shut out it seemed to be closed in under the lids and a thousand little images danced in its brilliance tiny white things little figuresevenshaped things dancing and twisting and squirming i sat on the edge of the bed rocking and hugging myself i could taste the blood in my mouth salty and sour and thought of how it would look in the sunlight how yellow and purplish and somehow i got to the dresser and got the lenses and teeth into place i staggered down the hall kicked the bathroom door shut behind me and went down on my knees in front of the toilet bowl i threw my arms around it bracing myself looking down at the wavering water in the faintly brownstained porcelain and then my whole body swelled and shook and i heaved the first one the first heave was the worst it seemed to pull me two ways forcing the stuff back and throwing it up at the same time after that it was easier the hard part was getting my breath keeping from strangling my heart pounded harder and harder the sweat of weakness streamed down off my face mixing with the blood and the vomit i knew i was making a hell of a racket but i didnt care there was a rap on the door and pay winroy called carl are you all right carl i didnt answer i couldnt and the door opened carl what in the world honey i gestured with one hand not looking around gestured that i was all right that i was sorry to get the hell out she said ill be right back honey and i heard her hurrying back up the hail and down the stairs i flushed the toilet keeping my eyes closed by the time she came back id got some cold water dabbed on my face and was sitting on the toilet seat i was weak as all hell but the sickness was gone drink it down baby she said and i drank it down a half a glass of straight whiskey i gasped and shuddered and she said here take a deep drag and i took the cigarette she handed me and dragged on it deeply the whiskey stayed down warming me and cooling me in all the places where i needed warming and cooling my god honey she was down on her knees in front of me why she bothered to wear that nightgown i didnt know because it didnt conceal anything you get that way very much carl i shook my head i havent had a spell like that since was a kid dont know what the hell brought it on well gosh i didnt know what to think you sounded worse than jake does sometimes she was smiling concerned for me but there was a calculating look in the reddish brown eyes was a sharp guy a guy who could give her a lot of kicks or was i just a sick punk someone good for a lousy fifteen a week and no laughs to go with it apparently she made up her mind she stood up and locked her arms around mine holding them she said mmmmmmmmph and kissed me openmouthed you tough little bastard she whispered oh you tough little bastard ive got half a notion to i didnt want that yet i wasnt up to it so i started a little roughhouse and that broke the mood stinker she laughed leaning against the wall of the hallway dont you dare you naughty bad boy flag me down then i said i only stop for red flags i looked at her standing there laughing everything she had on view and all the time telling me not to look not to dare i watched her listened to her i watched and listened to myself standing outside myself and it was like seeing a movie youve seen a thousand times before and and guess there wasnt anything strange about that i shaved and took the bath id missed the night before i got dressed hurrying it up a little when she called up the stairs to me and went down to the kitchen shed fixed bacon and eggs and toast some sliced oranges and french fries and shed dirtied up about half the pans and dishes in the place to do it but it was all well prepared she sat across from me at the kitchen table kidding and laughing keeping my coffee cup filled and i knew what she was but i couldnt help liking her we finished eating and i passed her a cigarette carl yes i said about about what we were talking about last night she waited i didnt say anything oh hell she said finally well i suppose id better go downtown and see jake he can stay away as long as he wants to but hes got to give me some money too bad you have to look him up i said you dont think hell be home who knows what hell do she shrugged angrily hell probably stay away until they find out about you im sorry i said i hate to have him put himself out on my account she gave me another of those thoughtful looks her eyes narrowed behind the smoke carl it will be all right wont it the sheriff he itll be all right why not i said youre going to go to school here it would be pretty foolish not to i said wouldnt it oh i dont know skip it she laughed irritably i guess im kind of goofy this morning its this town i said sticking around a hole like this with nothing to do you just werent built for it youve got too much stuff for the place i knew it the minute i saw you did you honey she patted my hand i should think you could get some kind of singing job i said something that would give you a better life yeah maybe i dont know she said if i had some clothes the dough to look around with maybe could but i dont know carl ive been out of things so long i dont know whether i could work any more even to get away from this i nodded i took another step it was probably unnecessary but it wasnt any trouble and it could save a lot youre afraid too arent you i said that things might be made a little unpleasant forjake winroys wife afraid she frowned puzzledly why should it had never occurred to her apparently and i could see it sink in on her now sink and build and spread it pushed the color out of her face and her lips trembled bbut it wasnt my fault they cant blame me carl hhow could they they wouldnt blame me would they carl they shouldnt i said i dont suppose they would if they knew how you felt carl what can i my god honey dont know why didnt see that i laughed softly it was time to call a halt her imagination could talk a lot better to her than could gosh i said look at the time almost eleven oclock and were still fooling around with breakfast but carl i forget it i grinned at her what would i know about things like that now you run on to town i stood up and began clearing away the dishes after a long moment she got up too but she didnt make any move toward the door i took her by the shoulders and gave her a little shake its like said i told her the towns getting on your nerves you ought to run into the city for the weekend she smiled weakly still pale around the gills run is right i sure as hell couldnt ride maybe you could i said you got any kinfolks there anyone you ever visit well i have a sister over in the bronx but shed yes for you give you an alibi in case jake tried to check up well i dont why should i she frowned at me blinking and thought maybe id figured her wrong or had crowded her too hard then she laughed softly huskily boy she said did i say he was slick but look carl wont it look kind of funny if we both we wont i said you let me figure it out all right carl she nodded quickly you dont you wont think im a tramp will you its just that no i said youre not a tramp ill go along as long as i can with a person but when im through well im through i just dont want any part of em any more you understand carl i understand i said now beat it will you or you stay here and ill clear out it doesnt look good for the two of us to be hanging around here alone all right honey ill go right now and oh yes dont bother about the dishes ruth can do them will you get out of here i said and she laughed and kissed me and got out i cleared up the dishes and put them away i uncovered an old rusty hammer and went out into the back yard there was part of a packing crate lying against the alley fence i knocked some nails out of it walked around to the front and went to work on that gate there hadnt been much of anything wrong with it in the beginning a couple of nails in the hinges would have fixed it up fine but just letting it go trying to slam it when it couldnt slam had damned near wrecked it i was still hard at it when kendall came home from the bakery to lunch ah he said approvingly i see youre like me mr bigelow you like to keep busy yeah i said its something to pass the time i heard about your uh little difficulty last night im glad to see youre taking it in your stride i uh dont want to seem presumptuous but ive taken a strong personal interest in you mr bigelow id have been very disappointed if youd allowed your plans to be upset by a drunken bum i said yeah or thanks or something of the kind well he said shall we go in i think lunch must be ready i told him id just finished breakfast i guess youll be the only one eating lunch mr kendall mrs winroys gone to town and i dont imagine mr winroy will be here either ill tell ruthie he said quickly the poor childs liable to go to a lot of trouble for nothing he went on inside and went back to work after a moment he came out again uh mr bigelow he called do you know where ruth might be i havent seen anything of her i said i didnt know whether she was supposed to come home at noon of course she is certainly he sounded a little annoyed she gets out of her last morning class at eleven and shes always here by eleventhirty to start fixing lunch well i said and picked up my hammer again he fidgeted on the porch uncertainly i cant understand it he frowned shes always here by eleventhirty she has to be to fix lunch and get the beds made before she goes back to school yeah i said i can see how she would i finished working on the gate i lit a cigarette and sat down on the steps to rest ruth ruthie id dreaded facing her after last night shed asked for it creeping in on me that way and yeah yeah shed wanted it and shed said it was all right but someone defenseless someone a baby but now i wanted to see her i wanted to see her more than anything in the world it was like part of me was missing i puffed at the cigarette i flipped it away and lit up another one i thought about her me swinging along on that crutch head down afraid to look at people afraid to see them looking you do all you can and its still not enough you keep your head down knocking yourself out you take all the shortcuts i got up and started around the house i almost ran kendall had said she was always here by eleventhirty she had to be to do the things she had to do and shed have to race to do it shed have to take all the shortcuts i jerked the alley gate open and looked up the line pf high board fence i looked just as she turned into the alley pulling herself along on the fence using the crutch as a cane for a moment i was sicker than id been when i first got up then the sickness went away gave way to anger i ran to meet her cursing the whole world and everybody in it for christs sake honey i took the crutch out of her hand and drew her arm around my shoulder are you hurt stop a minute and get your br nno she panted jjust let me lean on you sso her face was smudged and the left side of her coat was all dusty and dirty apparently the end piece of the crutch had worked loose and shed taken a hell of a fall where did it happen said why didnt you ask someone for help my god baby you shouldnt hhurry she gasped please ccarl i hurried letting her use me as a crutch and i didnt ask any more foolish questions what difference did it make where the accident had happened whether shed been struggling for two blocks or sixtwo thousand miles or six thousand i got her across the back yard and up the steps hurrying hurrying the two of us one person and her pounding heart pounding so hard that it seemed to come right out through the skin was my pounding heart i helped her into the kitchen and pushed her into a chair she struggled to get up and i pushed her down into it hard stay there i said goddammit stay there if you dont sit still by god ill slough you i ccant mrs wwinroy listen to me i said will you listen ruth everythings going to be all right it wwont she was rocking in the chair weeping helplessly yyou dont understand yyou dont know how it is shell ffire me and lijust cant ive ggot tto i slapped her across the face two quick hard slaps with the palm of my hand and the back of it want to listen i drew my hand back ready to swing at her again just tell me what you want to do you want to listen or do i knock your head right off of your shoulders i im she shuddered and gulped down a sob im llistening carl i found the whiskey bottle in the cupboard and poured out a stiff shot i stood over her watching her to see that she drank every last drop better huh i grinned now youre going to eat something and then youre going to lie down no i you have to be at school this afternoon have to sure you dont and youre not going to everythings jake here no one showed for lunch but kendall and he wont say anything ill talk to him and see that he doesnt yyou dont know mrs winroy she went downtown to get some money shell get it if she has to take it out of winroys hide

early and youre hard at it when she gets here okay but i have to ill do it i said and dont tell me i cant im a whiz at making beds and picking up now ill fix you a little lunch and help you upstairs and no carl just just do the other ill fix my own lunch honest i will ill do anything you say but pplease how are you going to do it what about your crutch ill fix it ive done it before i can tighten the screws with a case knife and theres some tape here andplease carl i didnt argue with her it was better to let her do a little something than to have her go hysterical again i gave her the crutch and a knife and the roll of tape there were two bedrooms downstairs ruths and an unoccupied one i didnt have to bother with them of course upstairs there were four bedrooms or i should say four rooms with beds in them because you couldnt call the place j ake slept a real bedroom it was more like a long narrow closet barely big enough for a bed and a chair and a lopsided chest of drawers i guessed it had been a closet before pay winroy had stopped sleeping with him since he hadnt slept there the night before there wasnt much of anything to do to it nothing at all in fact but i went in and looked around after id put my gloves on there was a halfempty fifth of port on the chest of drawers sixbits a bottle stuff in the top drawer of the chest was a small white prescription box i rocked it a little with the tip of one finger studied the label amyt gr no more than one in any six hour period fivegrain amytal goofballs tricky stuff you take one and you forget that youve done it so you take more a few of those in that rotgut wine and nothing not good enough he might drink too little and youd only tip your hand he might toss down too much and throw it up no it wasnt good enough but the basic idea was sound it would have to be something like that something that could logically happen to him because of what he was in the bottom drawer there was a fortyfive with a sawedoff barrel i looked it over moving it with my finger tips and saw that it was cleaned and loaded i closed the drawer and left the room you didnt really have to aim that gun for closerange shooting all you had to do was pull the trigger and let it spray and if you happen to be cleaning it when huhuh it was too obvious whenever a mans killed with something thats made for killing well you see what i mean people get ideas even where theres nothing to get ideas about mrs winroys room looked like a cyclone had struck it it looked like she might have tried to see how big a mess she could make i did a particularly good job on it and went on to mr kendalls room everything there was about as youd expect it to be clothes all hung up bookcases stretching along one side of the room and halfway down another about the only thing out of place was a book lying across the arm of an easy chair i picked it up after id finished doing the little work that had to be done and saw that it was something called mr blettsworthy on rampole island by hg wells i read a few paragraphs at the place where it had been left open it was about a guy whod been picked up by a bunch of savages and they were holding him prisoner down in a kind of canyon and he was pretty worried about getting to be as crummy as they were but he was more worried about something else just staying alive i only ready those few paragraphs like ive said but i could see how it was going to turn out when it came to a choice of being nice and dead or crummy and alive the guy would work overtime at being a heel i crossed the hall to my own room i was just finishing it up when i heard ruth coming up the stairs she looked in all the other rooms first making sure i guess that id done them up right i asked her how she was feeling she said jjust fine and ccarl i cant tell you how much i whats the use trying then i grinned come on now and ill help you downstairs i want you to get some rest before mrs winroy shows up but im all i dont need any i think you do i said you still look a little shaky to me i took her back downstairs making her put most of her weight on me i made her lie down on her bed and i sat down on the edge of it and there wasnt anything more i could do for her and i couldnt think of anything to say but she lay there looking at me as though she expected something more and when i started to get up she put her hand over mine i think id better shove off i said i want to tell mr kendall not to say anything about missing his lunch carl do you what about him anyway i said how long has he been boarding here well she hesitated not very long they didnt start keeping boarders until this last fall and he moved in right away well yes i mean i think he was the one who gave them the idea of running a boarding house you see the way it is here in a college town you cant have both girls and boys men living in the same place so the place where he was living all the boarders were boys and they were awfully noisy i guess and i see the winroys had plenty of room so he asked them to take him in and as long as they had the one boarder they decided to go after some others uhhuh only no one else would stay with them i guess mr kendall knew it would never be crowded here yeah i said i imagine he did well i think ill go and see him and carl her hand tightened on mine about last i m not sorry carl all right i said trying to be firm and gentle at the same time im glad youre not sorry ruthie and theres nothing for you to worry about now lets just leave it at that huh lets make like it never happened bbut i i thought its better that way ruthie mrs winroy might catch on ive got an idea she wouldnt like it bbut she didnt last night if wwe were careful and she was blushing she couldnt look at me straight look i said that stuff wont get you anything kid nothing but trouble you were doing all right before werent you well then tell me something carl is it because of my because im like i am ive told you why i said its just damned bad business i havent got anything i dont know how long im going to be here you cant win know what mean you ought to be doing your stepping out with one of the local boys some nice steady guy you can marry some day and give you the kind of life you ought to have she bit her lip turning her head on the pillows until she was staring at the wall yes she said slowly i suppose thats what id better do start stepping out get married thank you look i said all im trying to do is its my fault carl i felt different around you you seemed to like me and you didnt seem to notice how notice anything and guess i thought it was because you i dont mean theres anything wrong with you but i know i said i felt the same way and she didnt seem to have heard me you were just trying to be nice werent you ruth i said its all right carl thanks for everything youd better go now i didnt go of course i couldnt after that i lay down at her side pulling her around facing me holding her when she tried to pull away and after a moment she stopped trying she was holding me twice as hard dont go away carl promise you wont go away ive nnever had anyone and if you went away i i wont i said not for a long time anyway im going to stay right here ruthie was it gg she was whispering whispering and shivering her face pressed close to mine did you like me i look i said i just dont think please carl pplease she said and slowly she turned her body under mine and there was just one way of telling her that it was all right it was all right it was better than all right i didnt look down at that little baby foot and nothing could have been any better we went up to the bathroom together then i left the house and headed for the bakery it was a long onestory buff brick building about a block and a half up the street toward the business section i passed up the offices and went around to the side where a couple of guys were loading bread into trucks mr kendall one of them jerked his head at the side door hes probably in on the floor just keep going until you spot him i went in i went down a long corridor crowded with wire racks of bread and came out into a big room where about fifty guys were working some of them where throwing long ropes of dough over hooks in the wall throwing it and pulling it back and throwing it again and others were carrying the dough away from the hooks and laying it out on long wooden tables one side of the room was made up of a row of brick ovens and the guys working in front of them were stripped to the waist theyd flick the door of the oven open and reach inside with a kind of flatbladed shovel theyd reach about sixty times to the second it looked like i was watching them thinking that that kind of work i could do without when mr kendall came up behind me well he said touching me on the arm what do you think of us mr bigelow its quite a place i said not completely modern he said i mean its not mechanized to the extent that bigcity bakeries are but with help so cheap theres no reason why it should be i nodded i came over to explain about ruth mr kendall she had an accident on the way home at noon and an accident was she badly hurt just shaken up her crutch gave way under her and she took a spill the poor child youre not in any hurry well lets get out of this noise for a moment i followed him across the room a fussy polite little guy in white overalls and a white sailor cap we entered another room about a third of the size of the first one and he pushed the connecting door shut he boosted himself up on a table and gestured for me to sit beside him its clean mr bigelow we dont keep flour in here just the more or less precious commodities looks a little like a grocery store doesnt it with all these shelves yeah i said now about ruth i wanted to ask you you dont need to mr bigelow he took out his pipe and began filling it naturally i wont say anything to mrs winroy but thank you for letting me know what the situation was thats all right i said i helped her set the rooms straight i mean i let my voice trail away cursing myself i didnt want anyone to know that id been through the rooms mmm he nodded absentmindedly im very glad you came over mr bigelow as i said at noon i dont want to appear presumptuous but ive been thinking uh dont you believe that instead of merely waiting around until you hear from the sheriff it might be well for you to start putting roots down in a word dont you feel it would be sound psychology to demonstrate that there is not the slightest doubt in your own mind of the outcome of last nights unfortunate business yeah i said i dont get you i was referring to he paused now that your response just now brings up something else i wanted to speak to you about if that is you wont think im uh being lets say i wont i said youre not being presumptuous you just feel a friendly interest in me and you want to give me a little fatherly advice id said it the right way and there wasnt anything in my face to show that i didnt mean it im glad you understand mr bigelow to take the second matter first i was going to suggest that you be a little more careful about the language you use i know most young men talk rather slangily and uh tough these days and no one thinks anything of it but in your case well dont you see i understand and appreciate the advice i said after all regardless of whats happened it wont hurt me to talk a little better brand of english im afraid i put things rather badly he said badly or baldly if theres any difference i suppose im so used to ordering these student workers around that sure surely i said dont apologize mr kendall like i say i appreciate your interest its a very warm interest mr bigelow he bobbed his head seriously all my life ive had someone to look after and now with my parents dead god rest them and nothing to occupy me but my job and my books i i sure surely i repeated he laughed a shamed sad little laugh i tried to take a vacation last year i own a little lakeside cabin up in canada nothing pretentious you understand the site is too isolated to have any value and we my father and i built the cabin ourselves so i bought a car and started to drive up there two days after left town i was back here again back here working and ive hardly had my car out of the garage since i nodded waiting he chuckled halfheartedly thats an explanation and an apology if you can unravel it incidentally if youd like to use the car some time youll be entirely welcome thanks i said id be glad to pay you for it youd only complicate my life further for me he laughed again i could only add it to my savings and since they obviously can do me not the slightest good i couldnt appreciate the pleasures they might buy and the pension which will soon be due me is more than enough to provide for my wants so i said i understand or something equally brilliant i imagine im too old to acquire the habit of spending he went on thrift like work has become a vice with me im not comfortable with them but id be less content without them does that sound pretty stupid to you i wouldnt put it that way i said id say though that if you had enough money you know twenty or thirty thousand dollars you might get quite a bit of fun out of it mmm you feel the case is similar to that of having a little knowledge eh perhaps youre right but since the relative little is what i do have and i see no way of substantially increasing it he ended the sentence with a shrug now to get back to you mr bigelow if i may if you wont feel that im trying to order your life for you not at all i said ive felt for a long time that there should be a storeroom man in here someone to check these supplies out instead of merely letting the different departments help themselves i mentioned the fact to the owner today and he gave his approval so if youd like to have the job you can start in immediately and you think i should i said start in immediately i mean well he hesitated then he nodded firmly certainly dont see that you could lose anything by it i lighted a cigarette stalling for a minutes time i thought it over fast and decided that whatever he was or wasnt i was on my own this was my job my game and knew how to play it and if anyone was going to tell me what to do it would have to be the man ill tell you what mr kendall i said ive had a long trip and im pretty tired and the job wont be at all arduous you can set your own hours practically and much of the time theres nothing at all to i think id rather wait i said i plan on running into new york tomorrow night or saturday at the latest today would probably be the only day i could get in before sunday oh he said well of course in that case i would like to have the job though said that is if you can hold it for me he said that he could rather reluctantly apparently not too pleased at failing to get his own way then his face cleared suddenly and he slid down off the table i can give itto you now he said well say that youre just laying off for a couple of days fine i said i know im overcautious and apprehensive but i always feel that if theres any small barrier we can erect against potential difficulties we should take advantage of it perhaps youre right i said we walked along the rows of shelves with him pointing out the different cans and packages of baking ingredients and giving me a running commentary on how they were used im having some batch cards designed that is requisitions for ingredients which the various departments will submit to you all youll have to do is fill them now over here is our coldstorage room where we keep perishables he levered the door on a big walkin refrigerator the kind you see in meat markets and we went inside egg whites he said tapping a fifteengallon can with the toe of his shoe and these are egg yolks and here are whole eggs tapping two more cans bakeries buy these things this way for two reasons theyre considerably cheaper of course and they can be measured much more easily i see i said trying to keep from shivering id only been in the place for a minute but the cold was cutting me to the bone now this door he said pushing it open again youll notice that i left it well off the latch id suggest that you do the same if you dont want to risk freezing to death as he smiled pleasantly im sure you dont you can sing two choruses of that i said following him out of the refrigerator i mean he laughed and gave me a dignified clap on the back quite all right mr bigelow as i said a moment ago im inclined to be overcautious well i think that will be enough for today uh i know it isnt much but in view of the jobs other advantages uh will twelve dollars a week be all right that will be fine i said you can set your own hours within reason the ingredients for the various dough batches can be checked out before theyre ready for use and then youll be free to study or do uh anything else you like we left the main storage room and entered a smaller one an anteroom stacked high with sacks of salt sugar and flour at the end of a narrow corridor between the sacks there was a door opening onto the street kendall unlocked it winking at me you see mr bigelow your own private entrance and exit no one is supposed to have a key to this but me but if you should be caught up on your work and feel the need for a breath of air i see no reason why uh he gave me one of his prim dignified smiles and let me out the door i paused outside and lighted another cigarette glancing casually up and down the street the door the one id just come out of was well to the right of the entrance to the office even if there was someone in there working late as would be on an afterschool job i could go in and out without being seen and straight down the street a matter of a hundred and fifty yards or so was the house with fay winroy to set him up for a certain time a good dark night it would be a cinch i could stand there at the door and watch until he went by and then it was too much pie it was so good that i couldnt make up my mind whether i liked it i sauntered on down the street turning in at the bar across from the house i ordered an ale and sat down kendall was he just a nice old busybody a man whod taken a fancy to me like a lot of elderly people had or had the man got to him i couldnt make up my mind about him twice now well three times id thought id had him figured and each time even now right after hed practically told me where he stood and handed me the deal on a platter i began to doubt my figuring i still wasnt sure he just didnt fit the part no matter what he said or did i just couldnt hold a picture of him as a guy whod get mixed up in a gang murder and yet well you see that was what made him an almost surefire bet if if the man was a little leery of me if he did have an ace in the hole little old man kendall would be his boy it would have to be him or someone like him i kicked it around in my mind pulling myself first one way then the other whatever he was kendall was a long way from being stupid he wouldnt do the job himself assuming that it was something that an amateur could handle he wouldnt work with me as an accomplice hed handle his end without doing a thing that could be pinned on him and if i didnt handle mine if fell down on the job or screwed it up i didnt like to think about it because if i fell down or screwed it up id never live to fumble another one maybe i wouldnt anyway but id have a chance id done the vanishing act before and id stayed hidden for more than six years but with kendall keeping tabs on me if he was with him tipping off the man the moment i went sour on the deal or it went sour on me huhuh the man didnt take excuses he didnt let you quit i wouldnt run far enough to work up a sweat i bought another ale so what if it was that way id agreed to do the job and as long as i did it id be all right since that was the way things stood what difference did it make about kendall it made plenty it showed that the man didnt trust me and it wasnt good when the man didnt trust you it was either that or he was leery of the job and that wasnt good either the man didnt operate on hunches if he was leery he had good reason to be i wondered what hed say if i asked him pointblank about kendall and i didnt need to wonder long about it i was through wondering almost before i began hed laugh it off hed put his arm around my shoulder and tell me how much he liked me and that would be the beginning of a damned fast end hed have to get rid of me hed be afraid not to afraid i might be getting panicky or worrying about a doublecross i finished my ale and started out of the bar just as i reached the door pay winroy came in oh there you are hon she caught herself i thought you might be over here the sher theres someone at the house to see you she drew me outside lowering her voice its the sheriff honey maybe youd better go on over by yourself and ill stay here for a drink all right i said thanks for hunting me up carl she looked at me anxiously are you sure that everythings all right is there anything that not a thing i said why nothing no reason he said it was all right but yeah i said he acts so funny about it carl so so awfully funny he was waiting for me in the living room when i came in he eased himself up out of his chair a few inches as though he was planning on shaking hands then he let himself down again and i sat down across from him im sorry i kept you waiting i said ive been down at the bakery lining up a parttime job uhhah he nodded miss ruth told me she thought you might be there but you was already gone when i stopped by got you a job eh yes sir i said i havent started to work yet but uhhah youre plannin on staying here then going to school and all why yes i said thats why i came here uhhah sure he drawled again well i hope it works out all right we got a nice little town here nice little college wed like to keep it that way i frowned at him looking him straight in the eye i dont particularly like it here sheriff i said in fact i wish id never seen your town or your college but now that im here i plan on staying and if you can think of any reason why i shouldnt perhaps youd better tell me he swallowed heavily he wasnt used to being talked to that way didnt say there was any reason did i maybe you better tell me if you can think of any i didnt even bother to answer him he cleared his throat uncomfortably after a moment his glance wavered and he gave me a sheepish grin pshaw he mumbled now how the heck did i ever get started talkin to you thataway must be i had to hold in the good news i had for you so long it kinda clabbered on me ever have that happen to you you got somethin nice to pass on to a fella and when you cant find him good news i said what good news the answers to them wires i sent to arizona dont know when ive seen so many good things said about a man looked like the judge an the chief o police was trying to outdo each other theyre very fine gentlemen i said must be dont see how they could be anything else he nodded firmly and with two highplaced people like that speakin up for you i dont see yes i said nothin just sort of talkin to myself more or less kind of a bad habit of mine he stood up slapping his hat against the side of his pants lets see now you was saying you planned on running into the city this weekend tomorrow or saturday i said if its all right sure sure its all right you just go right ahead he put out his hand and gave mine a firm hard grip i went upstairs and my head had hardly touched the pillows before fay winroy slipped into the room carl was it what did he want nothing much i moved over on the bed to let her sit down just came to tell me that id gotten a clean bill from arizona oh but he acted so strange carl i thought how about it i said you didnt give him a bad time when he came here looking for me nno she hesitated i mean naturally i dont like cops hanging around with their cars parked in front of the house but well im sure i didnt say anything out of the way i wouldnt have bet money on it i dont imagine kendall liked having him come to the bakery either i said that must have been the trouble the guy had his feelings hurt you cant think of anything else i shrugged i dont know what it would be how did you make out with jake her eyes flashed i dont want to talk about him neither do i i yawned in fact id just as soon not talk at all i think ill take a nap well she laughed getting up heres my hat whats my hurry huh but its almost dinnertime honey im not hungry i said you could have something up here would you like to have me bring you up a tray in about an hour well i frowned itll be all right kendall will be gone back to the bakery youd think the guy would move his bed over there and ruth will have plenty to keep her busy in the kitchen ill see that she does i nodded in about an hour then she left i closed my eyes and tried to forget about kendall and the sheriff and the man and fruit jar and i was still trying an hour later when she pushed the door open and came in with the tray she had a glass half full of whiskey on it covered up with a napkin i drank it down and began to feel hungry it was a good dinner a beef stew with vegetables and apple pie for dessert pay lay back on the bed while i ate her hands clasped under the back of her head i drank the last of my coffee i lay down crosswise on the bed with her pulling her around in my arms carl thats me i said did you really mean what you said this morning about us me going into new york i reached the wallet out of my pocket and took out two twenties i tucked them into the front of her brassiere oh carl honey she sighed i can hardly wait i told her where to meet me a hotel on west fortyseventh where the fix was in strong ill go in tomorrow afternoon i said and come back late saturday night you come in saturday morning and come back here sunday night and dont forget to fix things up with your sister i wont honey she sat up eagerly ill be very careful about everything ill tell jake that sis sent me the money to come on and all right i said just be careful and let it go at that she took the bills out of her brassiere and smoothed them over her knee then she folded them neatly and tucked them back between her breasts sweet she said huskily laying her head against my shoulder you dont mind waiting do you honey i didnt mind i wanted it who the hell wouldnt have but i wasnt in any hurry it was something that had to be done the clincher to the bargain it would do me good to mind i said yes she nodded im not well i know im a long way from being what i should be but here well to do it to start off here in jakes house if you say so i will but thats okay i said youre not sore carl you know what im trying to say i think i do i said and its all right but i cant say how long it will stay that way if you dont beat it out of here she looked at me teasingly her head cocked a little to one side suppose i change my mind she said suppose i wake up in the night and i made a grab for her she leaped back laughing and ran to the door she pursed her lips then she whispered good night honey and slipped out of the room i slept pretty good that night nothing out of the way happened the next morning i got up around nine after kendall and ruth had left and fixed my own breakfast i lingered over it thinking fay might join me but she didnt so cleaned up the dishes left for the railroad station the long island was outdoing itself that day it was only an hour late getting into new york i picked up the suit id bought and checked in at the hotel at six oclock i called the man from a booth telephone then strolled down to the automat near fortysecond and broadway and waited fruit jar drove up in front of the place at seven oclock i got into the cadillac and we headed for the mans house youve heard of the man everyone has theres hardly a month passes that the papers dont have a story about him or you dont see his picture one month hes up before some government investigating committee the next hes attending a big political dinner laughing and talking to some of the very same people who were putting him through the wringer the month before the man is a big importer he controls shipping companies and distilleries race tracks and jobbing houses wire services and loan companies hes one of the biggest openshop employers in the country but its not because hes opposed to unions hes a charter member of two oldline craft unions and hes supported their organizational drives and hes got letters from some of the top laborskates thanking him for his earnest endeavors in behalf of the american workingman the man controls race tracks but he supports antiracetrack legislation he can prove that hes supported it and you cant prove that he controls the tracks he controls distilleries but can you prove it and he supports temperance movements he controls loan companies controls the men who control them and he backs antiloanshark laws the man donated heavily to the defense of the scottsboro boys the man went bail for bigwigs in the klan no one has ever pinned anything on him hes too big too powerful too coveredup you try to pin something on him and you lose it along the way the man lived in a big stone and brick house out in forest hills he wasnt married of course although i dont know why i say of course and the only servant around was the squarefaced japanese houseboy who let us in the boy took us into the librarydrawing room where the man was waiting and the man still stood beaming at me shaking my hand and asking me about my trip east and saying how delighted he was to meet me im so sorry didnt get to talk to you before you went down to peardale he said in his soft pleasant voice not im sure that you need my advice i thought id better not lose any more time i said the school term has already started of course naturally he finally let go of my hand and waved me to a chair youre here now and thats the important thing he sat down smiling and nodded to fruit jar perfect wouldnt you say so murph we couldnt have found a better man for the job than little bigger didnt i tell you hed be worth any trouble we went to in locating him fruit jar grunted would you mind telling me how you did it i said how you found me not at all but i didnt suppose it would be anything that would mystify you well it doesnt exactly i said i mean i think i have it figured out i was red hot here in the east and id had a little lung trouble and your teeth and eyes were very bad you figured id just about have to go west id have to take some kind of unskilled outdoors job id get my teeth and my eyes taken care of not in the place i was living but some place nearby and id be damned careful to build up a good reputation and and about all isnt it he chuckled beaming at me the teeth and the contact lenses of course were decisive but the police knew as much about me as you did even more maybe if you could find me why couldnt they ah the police he said poor fellows so many distractions and diversions and restrictions so many things to do and so little to do it with theres the reward money it totaled around fortyseven thousand dollars the last i heard but my dear charlie we cant expend public funds on the offchance that the police may collect rewards of course if they wished to carry on their search on their own time and at their own expense yeah i said but some ambitious private investigator no charlie i can understand the slight trepidation which you may feel but it is absolutely groundless what would it profit anyone some rewardhungry or publicspirited citizen if he did find you he would have to prove your identity would he not and who would believe that you this softspoken slip of a youth was a murderer youve never been arrested never mugged or fingerprinted i nodded he spread his hands smiling you see charlie i didnt need to prove who you were with me it was merely necessary to know i could then place my proposition before you and ask for your cooperation i dislike the word demand dont you and you were kind enough to give it the police the courts he shrugged wryly paah id like to get just one more thing straight i said i wanted this job but i dont want any others i dont want to pick up again where i left off the last time naturally you dont what murph didnt you tell him not more than a dozen times said fruit jar the man gave him a long slow look he turned back to me you have my word on it charlie it wouldnt be practical to use you again even if i wanted to fine i said thats all i wanted to know im delighted to reassure you now to get down to the business at hand i gave him a report on how things stacked up in peardale about my runin withjake and lining up a job at the bakery and how id made out with the sheriff he seemed pleased he kept nodding and smiling and saying excellent and splendid and so on then he asked me one question and for a moment was kind of stunned i felt my face turning red well he asked it again you said the sheriff got his report on you yesterday afternoon did jake stay at the house last night i i swallowed i dont believe he did you dont believe he did dont you know i should have known of course it was the one thing i should have known i was pretty sure that he hadnt stayed at the house but id been worn out and id got to grabassing around with fay winroy and thats rather important the man said and waited if he wasnt there last night how can you be sure that he plans on staying there at all well i said i i dont think you can say that again fruitjar snickered boy oh boy that snapped me out of it look i said look sir i talked to the sheriff yesterday for the second time in two days i spent more than an hour with this man kendall he doesnt know anything but hes a pretty sharp old bird kendall oh yes the baker i see no cause to worry about him im not worried about him or the sheriff either but with jake feeling the way he does i dont have to move very far out of line to be in trouble i cant show any interest in him i cant do anything that might be interpreted as showing interest in him i deliberately went to bed early last night and i stayed there until late this morning i yes yes the man interrupted impatiently i commend you for your discretion but there should have been some way to hell stay at the house i said mrs winroy will see that he does oh yes he shook his head leaning forward in his chair not just yes charlie are you telling me that after only fortyeight hours youve made a proposition to mrs winroy ive been leading up to one and shell grab it she hates jakes guts shell jump at the chance to get rid of him and make herself a stake at the same time im relieved that you think so personally i believe id have taken a little more time in arriving at such a decision i couldnt take any more time she was opening up to me before id talked to her five minutes if hadnt played up to her right at the start i might not have got another chance so and you felt you had to have her assistance i think it will come in pretty handy yes she can still make j ake jump through hoops she knows her way around she could get tough if she thought she was losing her meal ticket with nothing to take the place of it well the man sighed i can only hope your appraisal is correct i believe shes a former actress isnt she a singer singer actress the two arts overlap ive got her taped i said ive only known her a couple of days but ive known women like her all my life mmm may i assume that theres a connection between her and your arrival in town a day early shes meeting me here tomorrow shes supposed to be visiting her sister but i understand well im rather sorry you didnt consult me but inasmuch as you didnt i thought that was why you wanted me i said because id know what to do without being told oh i did charlie i do he smiled quickly i dont at all doubt your ability and judgment its just that your procedure seemed rather daring unorthodox for such an extremely important matter it seems that way here other things may seem that way to you here what have to go on is how things seem to me there its the only way can work if i had to ask you every time i wanted to make a move well i just couldnt do it i im not telling you where to get off but of course not he nodded warmly after all were all intent on the same goal were all friends we all have a great deal to gain or lose you understand that part dont you charlie murph made it clear to you he did but he didnt need to good now about the time youll naturally be governed to an extent by the local factors but the optimum date would be about a week before the trial that will allow you to become firmly integrated into the life of the town to allay the suspicion which always attaches to a stranger also by disposing of jake at the approximate time of the trial the newspapers will have less to feed upon there will only be one story instead of two ill try to handle it that way i said fine splendid now oh yes his smile faded one more thing murph tells me that you pulled a knife on him actually stabbed him in the back of the neck he shouldnt have been there in peardale you know he shouldnt sir perhaps not but that doesnt excuse your actions i dont like that at all charlie he shook his head sternly i looked down at the floor and kept my mouth shut would you mind waiting out in the reception room murph i have quite a few things to say to charlie i dont mind said fruit jar take your time and he sauntered out of the room grinning the man chuckled softly and i looked up he was holding out the knife to me could you use it again charlie i stared at him pretty blankly i guess he put the knife in my hand and closed my fingers around it you killed his brother he said did you know that christ no so that was it when what i dont know the details it was in detroit i believe detroit i tried to place him and of course i couldnt the name wouldnt have meant anything and thered been four no five in detroit i was disturbed by the way he felt toward you i made a few inquiries it wont do charlie hes stupid and vengeful he could blow things higher than a kite yeah i said but tonight tonight you havent been here charlie he was here to see me about a financial matter i walked out to the car with him when he left i saw him stop down there on the highway and pick up a hitchhiker in fact toko and i both saw him he chuckled again you understand my position charlie i depended on murph and he failed me how long would i last if i tolerated failure in the people i depend upon i simply cant do it charlie regardless of the person or cost the whole system is based on swift punishment and prompt reward i understand i said in that case he stood up how about another drink before you leave i guess not i said i mean no thanks sir he walked out to the car with fruit jar and me walked between us with an arm around each of our shoulders he shook hands with both of us and stood at the side of the car talking a moment a beautiful evening he said breathing in deep smell that air charlie ill bet arizona doesnt have anything finer than that no sir i said i know theres no place like arizona is there well he gave fruit jar a playful punch on the arm why dont i see more of you these days hey not for business just a little quiet gettogether well say fruit jar began to puff up just say the word and well make it sunday no no ill come to see you he stepped back from the car beaming sunday afternoon say ill look forward to it fruit jar drove away so swelled up that he could hardly sit behind the wheel and i wanted to burst out laughing or crying because he was a nogood sonofabitch but felt sorry for him i guess you got told off he said flicking a glance at me youre lucky he didnt do nothin but eat you out he told me off i said im lucky you think men him aint like that you think he didnt mean that about coming to see me i shook my head the man would see him all right hed have a quiet gettogether with him sunday afternoon theyd have fruit jar embalmed by that time the trouble with killing is that its so easy you get to where you almost do it without thinking you do it instead of thinking i told fruit jar that id take the subway into town and he drove me over near queens plaza i had him pull up there in the shadows of the elevated and i said im sorry as hell fruit jar will you accept an apology and he was feeling good so he stuck out his hand and said sure kid long as you put it that way i i jammed his right hand between my knees i gripped the fingers of his left hand bending them back and i snapped the knife open jjesus his eyes got wider and wider and his mouth hung open like the mouth of a sack and the slobber ran down his chin thick and shiny wwhatcha ddoin whatcha aaahhhhh i gave it to him in the neck i damned near carved his adams apple out i took the big silk handkerchief out of his breast pocket wiped my hands and the knife and put the knife in his pocket then i shoved him down on the floor of the car and caught the train into town and i hadnt ridden to the next station before i saw what a fool id been fruit jar he could have told me i could have made him tell me the thing that might mean the difference between my living and dying and now he couldnt tell me his brother his brother hell i almost yelled it out i think i did say it but i was up in the front of the car by myself and no one noticed people hardly ever notice me and maybe thats the reason im his brother detroit not sure of the details not sure the man wasnt sure christ almighty as if hed have hauled fruit jar into this deal without knowing every damned last thing there was to know about him hed hauled him in fruitjar had been sitting pretty with no heat on him and a swell income and the man had hauled him in on something that could be very hot he couldnt say no to the man he couldnt even let on that he didnt like it but he didnt like it he was sore as hell and since he couldnt take it out on the man hed taken it out on me that was the trouble just what id thought it was all along it must have been that i guessed his brother even if hed had a brother even if hed had fiftyfive brothers and id killed them all he wouldnt have done anything about it not anyway until after id done my job i should have known that i did know it when i stopped to think but the man had shot me the line fast and i wasnt thinking why think when its so easy to kill the man wanted me to believe that fruitjar had come down to peardale that day on his own he had to make me think that or id think of another reason for fruitjar being there the real reason because hed been sent it might blow the job if i knew that i might blow it and get away instead of getting what a guy always got for blowing or running out fruit jar wasnt very bright he hadnt needed to be very bright for the job the man had sent him to do to deliver some dough maybe or maybe to throw in a good chill as the clincher to a deal but he hadnt been even that bright hed missed connections somehow with the party he was supposed to see and instead of beating it and trying again later hed screwed around waiting hed gone out of his way to needle me id scratched him up with the knife and hed been a little worried when he took off for the city he had a pretty good idea that hed pulled a boner and he should have known what the man was like when the man was really sore at you you never knew it but he wasnt bright like ive said and or was it that way was i knocking myself out over nothing had the man given me the straight dope he might have a guy like me well he gets so used to looking around corners that he cant see in a straight line the more true a thing is the less he can believe it the man could have leveled with me i was damned sure he hadnt but he could have he had he hadnt he hadnt he had i didnt know i couldnt be sure and it wasnt the mans fault and it wasnt fruit jars there was just one guy to blame a stupid driedup jerk named charles bigger big shot bright boy i could feel it the hard glaze spreading over my eyes i could feel my heart pounding pounding like someone pounding on a door pounding like a scared kid locked in a closet i could feel my lungs drawing up like fists tight and hard and bloodless forcing the blood up into my brain there was a crowd of people waiting to get on the train at times square i went through them i walked right through them giving it to them in the ribs and insteps and no one said anything so maybe they sensed what was in me and knew they were lucky because they were lucky there was a woman getting on and i gave it to her in the breasts with my elbow so hard she almost dropped the baby she was carrying and she was lucky too but maybe the baby wasnt maybe it would have been better off down under the wheels everything ended why not tell me why not i walked back to fortyseventh street and somewhere along the way i bought a couple of newspapers i rolled them up tight under my arm and their hardness felt good to me i rolled them tighter and slapped them against the palm of my hand and that felt good too i walked along swinging them against my hand swinging them like a club the motions getting shorter and shorter jerkier and jerkier and temper temper who was it thatd said that i grinned and it made my mouth hurt and the hurt felt good temper temper sure i knew have to watch the tempertemper so id watch it i liked to watch it there was only one thing id like better but everyone saw how lucky they were and in a minute or two id be alone in my room and it would be all right then i walked up the two flights of stairs there was only one elevator and it was crowded and i had enough sense to know that id better not get on it i climbed the stairs to the third floor and walked down the corridor to the last room on the right and i leaned against it a moment panting and shaking i leaned there quivering like id been through a battle and and i heard it heard the splashing and humming the quivering and the panting stopped i turned the door knob it was unlocked i stood in the doorway of the bathroom looking at her she was scooted down in the tub of suds one arm raised up so she could soap it under the pit she saw me and she dropped the washcloth and let out a little squeal ccarl honey you scared me to death what are you doing here i said why she tilted her head to one side smiling at me lazily you dont recognize mrs jack smith what are you doing here dont speak to me that way carl after all what are you doing here the smile began to shrink pull in around the edges dont be mad honey i i dont look at me like that i know i was supposed to come in tomorrow but get out of there i said but you dont understand honey you see sis and her boy friend drove out to peardale aand i it was perfectly nnatural for me to rride back to the city with them no one could think there was anything wwrong with i didnt hear what she said i didnt want to i heard but i made myself not hear i didnt want any explanations i didnt want it to be all right i was scared sick so damned sick and i was already sliding into fruit jars shoes and i couldnt pull back i couldnt run they were all watching and waiting looking for the chance to trip me up all i could do was kill get out of there i said i was slapping the newspapers into my palm get slap out slap of there slap slap get slap her face was as white as the suds but she had guts she forced the smile back tilted her head again now honey with you standing

know how ssweet all the things ill she stopped talking i had my hand knotted in her hair and i was pulling her up out of the water and she didnt try to pull away she came up slowly her neck her breasts the soapsuds sliding away from them like they didnt want to let go she stood up she stepped out of the tub she stood there on the bathmat fighting with everything she had to fight with offering it all to me and she saw it wasnt enough she knew it before i knew it myself she raised her arms very slowly so slowly that they hardly seemed to move and wrapped them around her head she whispered nnot in the face carl jjust dont hit me in the i flicked the newspapers across her stomach lightly i flicked them across her breasts i drew them back over my shoulder and and held them there giving her a chance to yell or try to duck hoping shed try it and stop being lucky there were too many lucky people in the world youre a pretty good actress i said tell me youre not an actress tell me you havent been leading me on acting hardboiled and easytoget so you could screw me up go on tell me call me a liar she didnt say anything she didnt even move i let the newspapers drop from my hand i stumbled forward and sat down on the toilet stool and made myself start laughing i whooped with laughter i whooped and choked and sputtered rocking back and forth on the stool and it was as though a river were washing through me washing away all the fear and craziness and worry leaving me clean and warm and relaxed it had always been that way once i could start laughing i was all right then i heard her snicker and a moment later that husky saloonatmidnight laugh and she hunkered down in front of me laughing burying her head in my lap yyou crazy tough little bastard you youve taken ten years off my life so now youre sixteen i said im going to count on it crazy what in the name of god got into you anyway she raised her head laughing but looking a little worried it was all right to come in wasnt it as long as sis and sure it was all right i said it was swell im tickled to death youre here ive just had a hell of a hard day and i wasnt expecting you and let it go at that let me up off this toilet before i fall in yeah but honey i tilted her chin up with my fist yeah we leave it at that or not well she hesitated and then she nodded quickly and jumped up stinker toughie come on and ill give you a drink she had a pint of whiskey in her overnight bag she opened it after shed slipped into her nightgown and we sat crosslegeed on the bed together drinking and smoking and talking there werent many preliminaries to go through id broken the ice but good there in the bathroom she knew who i was now if she hadnt had a damned good idea before she knew why i was in peardale she knew why id had her come into the city and it was okay with her little bigger she said her eyes shining at me little bigger why my god honey ive been hearing about you ever okay i said so im famous now just wipe it out of your head and leave it wiped out sure honey carl i dont know how ill do it well have to work that out now about the dough she was smart there she might have said fifteen or twenty grand and i might have said yes and then i might have thought i might have passed the word along the dames hungry maybe wed better keep her quiet aw honey she made a little face lets not talk about it like i was doing it for for that well be together wont we afterwards and i know youre not the kind to be stingy itll be a long time afterwards i said ill have to stay there at least until summer you can leave any time of course but i couldnt get together with you before summer i can wait where would we go honey i mean after well work it out thats no problem you got money theres always some place to go hell we could live here or anywhere after a couple of years when things cool off enough you wont you dont think im awful do you carl how do i know i havent had you yet you know what i mean honey you wont think id id do the same thing to you wont be afraid of me honey you wont think you have to i tamped out my cigarette listen to me i said listening then get this if i was afraid of you you wouldnt be here know what i mean she nodded i know what you mean carl honey that husky voice it was like having cream poured over you arent you arent i what she gestured toward the light that next week is hard to tell about so much happened so many things that i couldnt understand or that i was afraid to understand so many things that kept me worried and on edge or scared the living hell out of me i had time i knew i had to take time the man didnt want the job done for at least ten weeks so i should have been able to get my bearings and plan and take things kind of easy but after that first week hell before the week was halfway over i had an idea that what i and the man wanted didnt make any difference this might be the first week but i had a damned good idea that it wasnt far from the last one that was the week that kendall really began to show his hand at least it seemed he was showing it that was the week that jake tried to frame me it was the week he tried to kill me it was the week fay and i began brawling it was the week ruthie jesus jesus god that week even now and what do i have to worry about now it rips the guts out of me to think about it but lets take things in order lets go back to the friday before the week began to fay and me at the hotel shes said it had been over a year since you know what and i kind of think it must have been an understatement and then finally she gave me a long goodnight kiss about fifty kisses rolled into one and turned on her side and a minute later she began to snore it wasnt a real snore one of the buzzsaw variety it was as though there was some small obstruction in her nose where the moisture kept gathering and cutting loose in a little popcrack on about every tenth breath i lay there stiff and tense counting her breaths wishing by god that it was a faucet wanting to grab her by the nose and twist it off id lie there counting her breaths getting set for the little popcrack that stabbed through me like a hot needle and just when i had the damned thing about timed she broke the rhythm on me she started popcracking on a seven count then a nine and finally a twelve it went up from there to a point where she was taking twenty breaths before it came and finally god it seemed like about fortyeight hours later finally it stopped maybe youve slept with someone like that tried to sleep one of those people who cant get into dreamland good unless theyre lying all over you well she was that way and now that shed got that goddamned popcracking out of her system she started in on the other scrounging around in the bed it was hell i tried to make myself sleep but it was no dice i got to thinking about a guy id met that time i skipped out of new york i couldnt sleep so i began thinking id been afraid to show myself on a train or bus or plane so id started hitchhiking up toward connecticut i planned on getting up near the canadian border where i could jump across fast if i had to and swinging west from there well this guy picked me up and he had a good car and i knew he must have dough on him but well it doesnt make sense the way it turned out he didnt make sense like you ordinarily think of a guy making it anyway he was a writer only he didnt call himself that he called himself a hockey peddler you notice that smell he said i just got through dumping a load of crap in new york and i aint had time to get fumigated all i could smell was the whiz hed been drinking he went on talking not at all grammatical like you might expect a writer to and he was funny as hell he said he had a farm up in vermont and all he grew on it was the more interesting portions of the female anatomy and he never laughed or cracked a smile and the way he told about it he almost made you believe it i fertilize them with wild goat manure he said the goats are tame to begin with but they soon go wild the stench you know i feed them on the finest grade grain alcohol and they have their own private cesspool to bathe in but nothing does any good you should see them at night when they stand on their heads howling i grinned wondering why i didnt give it to him i didnt know goats howled i said they do if theyre wild enough he said is that all you grow i said you dont have bodies on any of of those things jesus christ he turned on me like id called him a dirty name aint got things tough enough as it is even butts and breasts are becoming a drug on the market about all theres any demand for any more is you know what he passed me the bottle and had a drink himself and he calmed down a little oh used to grow other things he said bodies faces eyes expressions brains i grew them in a threedollaraweek room down on fourteenth street and i ate aspirin when i couldnt raise the dough for a hamburger and every now and then some lordly book publisher would come down and reap my crop and package it at twofifty a copy and lo and behold if i praised him mightily and never suggested that he was a member of the jukes family in disguise he would spend three or four dollars on advertising and the sales of the book would swell to a total of nine hundred copies and he would give me ten per cent of the proceeds when he got around to it he spat out the window and took another drink how about driving a while i slid over him over behind the wheel and his hands slid over me lets see the shiv he said the what the pigsticker the switchblade the knife for christs sake dont you understand english you aint a publisher are you i gave it to him i didnt know what the hell else to do he tested the blade with his thumb then he opened the pocket of the car fumbled around inside and brought out a little whetstone christ he said drawing the blade back and forth across it you ought to keep this thing sharp you cant do any good with a goddamn hoe like this id sooner try to cut a guys throat with a bed slat well he handed it back to me thats the best can do just dont use it for nothing but belly work and it may be all right now look i said what what you look he said he reached over and took the lueger out of my belt he held it down under the dashlight and looked at it well it aint too bad he said but what you really need is a rod like this and he reached into the pocket again and took out a colt automatic like to try it come on and try it on me stop the car and try them both he shoved them at me reaching for the switch key and and hell i dont know what i said finally he laughed different from the way hed laughed before more friendly and put the lueger back in my belt and the colt back into the car pocket just not much sense to it is there he said how far you want to ride as far as i can i said swell thatll be vermont well have time to talk we went straight on through taking turns about driving and going in places for coffee and sandwiches and most of the time he was talking or i was not about ourselves nothing personal i mean he wasnt nosy just about books and life and religion and things like that and everything he said was so kind of offtrail i was sure could remember it but somehow later on it all seemed to boil down pretty well to just one thing sure theres a hell i could hear him saying it now now as i lay here in bed with her breath in my face and her body squashed against me it is the drab desert where the sun sheds neither warmth nor light and habit forcefeeds senile desire it is the place where mortal want dwells with immortal necessity and the night becomes hideous with the groans of one and the ecstatic shrieks of the other yes there is a hell my boy and you do not have to dig for it when i finally left him he gave me a hundred and ninetythree dollars everything he had in his wallet except a tenspot and i never saw him sagain i dont even know his name fay started snoring again i got the whiskey bottle and my cigarettes and went into the bathroom i closed the door and sat down on the stool and i must have sat there two or three hours smoking and sipping whiskey and thinking i wondered what had ever happened to that guy whether he was still in vermont growing those things i think about what hed said about hell and it had never meant more tome than it did right now i wasnt an old man by a hell of a long ways but i got to wondering whether the way i felt had anything to do with getting older and that led into wondering how old i really was anyway because i didnt know about all i had to go on was what my mother told me and shed told me one thing one time and another thing another time i doubt that she really knew offhand she might have figured it out but with all the kids shed had she didnt get much figuring done so i tried to dope it out a screwy thing like that i added up and subtracted and tried to remember back to certain times and places and all i got out of it was a headache id always been small except for those few years in arizona it seemed like id always been living on the ragged edge i thought way back and if things had ever been very much different or id ever been very much different i couldnt remember when it was i sipped and smoked and thought and finally i caught myself nodding i went back into the bedroom she was sleeping in a kind of loose ball now with her rear end way over on one side of the bed and her knees on the other that left some space at the foot of the bed so i lay down across that i woke up with her feet on my chest feeling like my ribs had been caved in it was nine oclock id had less than four hours sleep but i knew i wasnt going to get any more so i slid out from under her and got up i went to the toilet and took a bath being as quiet about it as i could i was standing in front of the bathroom mirror fitting the contact lenses into place when i saw her looking in the doorway she didnt know that i saw her its funny how people will watch you in a mirror without thinking that youre bound to be watching them she was looking at the lower part of my face my mouth and i saw her grimace then she caught herself catching on to the fact i guess that i might be able to see her she moved back into the bedroom waited a moment and headed for the door again making enough noise for me to know that she was up i slipped my teeth into place i guess my mouth did look bad without them kind of like it belonged in another location but i didnt give a damn whether she liked it or not she came in yawning drowsily scratching her head with both hands gosh honey she said whatd you get up so early for i was sleeping soooahh scuse me so good its after nine i said i figured id been in bed long enough well i hadnt you woke me up with all your banging around maybe id better go stand in the corner her eyes flashed then she laughed half irritably grouchy you dont have to snap me up on everything now get out of here and let me take a bath i got out and let her i dressed while she bathed and started brushing her teeth washing her mouthout a thousand and fifty times it sounded like gargling and spitting and hacking i began getting sick at my stomach rather i got sicker than i already was i threw down the rest of the whiskey fast and that helped i picked up the phone and ordered breakfast and another pint and i knew how bad the whiz was for me id been told not to drink it at all but i have to have it she was still horsing around in the bathroom when the waiter came i got down another fast drink then i gulped and coughed and a whole mouthful of blood came up in my handkerchief i raised the bottle again i lowered it holding my breath swallowing as rapidly as i could and there wasnt any blood that time none came up but i knew it was there id already been damned sick in front of her once if i was sick very much if she thought i might be on the way down down like jake she came out of the bathroom feeling a lot better than when she went in and with a fresh half pint of whiskey in me i wasnt feeling so bad myself we ate all the breakfast with her helping out quite a bit on my share i lighted cigarettes for us and she lay back on the pillows well she crinkled her eyes at me well what i said how was it best coffee i ever drank i said stinker she let out with that guffaw again i was getting to where i waited for that too like id waited for her snoring mmm she said i do if you do want to come back to bed with mama look baby i said im sorry as hell but well youll have to be starting back huh she sat up aw now honey you said i said wed stay overnight weve done it it doesnt make any difference whether it does too make a difference you havent been stuck in that godforsaken hole as long as i have i why dont we do it like we planned honey i can go back tonight and you can come tomorrow thatll give us a whole day together or i can stay ill go over and stay with sis tonight and come tomorrow and you can look baby look fay i said i guess i hadnt thought the thing through ive had plenty of things to think about and i couldnt see that it mattered much whether of course it matters why wouldnt it matter youve got to go back i said now or ill start back and you can come later on in the day i cant stay at the house overnight unless youre there ive got to have you there to yes me in case something pops with jake if he should get out of line like he did the first night pooh for all we know he may not even come home thats another thing hes got to start staying there all the time youll have to see that he does he cant just be there on the one night that something happens to him hell she stamped out her cigarette angrily and reached for the bottle just when i think im going to well gosh honey you could go back tomorrow and i could go back tonight why wouldnt that be all right im afraid of it im not supposed to have much dough it doesnt look right for me to take damned near three days to pick up a suit she slammed the whiskey bottle down angrily im sorry as hell fay i said she didnt say anything we just cant take chances now weve got too much to lose i went on talking and explaining and apologizing and knew shed better snap out of it fast or she wouldnt be able to get back to peardale finally she turned back around maybe she noticed the tightening of my voice all right honey she sighed half pouting if thats the way it is why thats the way it is fine thats my baby i said well have our good times just you and me and thirty grand maybe five or ten more if its an a job oh i know carl her smile was back itll be wonderful and im awfully sorry if i i was just kind of disappointed and thats okay i said she wanted me to go back to peardale first she wanted to laze around a while and take her time about dressing i said it would be all right just so she showed before night we chewed the fat a while longer just talking without saying much after a while she said mmmmm honey and held out her arms to me and i knew i couldnt do it not so soon not now god jesus i knew i couldnt do it but i did i struggled and strained aching clear down to my toenails and i kept my eyes closed afraid to let her see what she might see in them and and i was in that drab desert where the sun shed neither heat nor light and what about that afterwards anyway if there was an afterwards what about her i stared out the dirty window of the long island train half dozing my mind wandering around and around and drifting back to her what about her she was stacked she was pretty she was just about everything you could want in a woman as long as you were on top or you looked like you might be on top but i couldnt see it the one big long party which was what it would be like with her i couldnt see it and couldnt take it what i wanted was well i wasnt sure but it wasnt that just to be by myself maybe with someone like well like ruthie someone i could be myself around ruth fay fay ruth or what i didnt know what i wanted i wasnt even real sure about what i didnt want i hadnt wanted to be dragged in on this mess but i had to admit id been getting pretty fed up out there in arizona id kept quiet about it but id had more than one babe in my shack hell the last month id had two or three a week a different one each time and they were all okay i guess they all had plenty on the ball but somehow none of them seemed to be it whatever it was i wanted whatever it was i wanted my eyes drifted shut and stayed shut the man would probably have something to say about fay he might see a spot where he could use her again or he might decide that she was a bad risk hed talk to me about it of course and if i wanted her and was responsible for her i didnt know i didnt want her now her or anyone else but that was natural enough tomorrow the next day afterwards i didnt know my head fell over against the window and i went to sleep it was hours later when i woke up i was way the hell out to the end of the line and the conductor was shaking me somehow i managed to keep from punching the stupid bastard in the face i paid the extra fare plus the fare back to peardale it was still early afternoon i could still get back to peardale well ahead of her i went to the john and washed my face i came back to my seat studying the minute hand on my watch wondering what the hell was holding us up and then i glanced out the window and started cursing mr stupid the conductor who should have picked up my seat check and put me off at peardale he and all the other trainmen were sauntering up the street together taking their own sweet time about it shoving and grabassing with each other and braying like a bunch of mules they turned in at a restaurant they stayed in there doing what god only knows because they couldnt have been eating that long they must have stayed in the place two hours finally when i was just about ready to go up into the locomotive and drive off by myself they got through doing whatever they were doing and sauntered back to the station again they got there eventually back to the station but of course they didnt climb on the damned train and get going the had to stand around on the station platform gabbing and picking their teeth i cursed them to myself calling them every dirty name i could think of they were trying to screw me up they broke it up at last and began climbing on the train it was dark when we got into peardale a train from the city was just pulling out i looked through the station door and saw a taxi on the other side the only taxi there he swung the door open and i climbed in and but i guess i dont need to tell you id tried to be so damned careful yet here she was here we were riding home together she gave me a startled halfscared look i said why hello mrs winroy just come out from new york yyes she bobbed her head did did you i laughed it sounded as hollow as that conductors head not exactly i left the city this morning but i fell asleep on the train they carried me out to the end of the line and im just now getting back well she said just well but the way she said it she was saying a whole lot more i was all worn out i said a friend i stayed with in new york snored all night and i didnt get much sleep she turned her head sharply glaring at me then she bit her lip and i heard a sound that was halfway between a snicker and a snort we reached the house she went on inside and i paid off the driver and went across the street to the bar i drank two double shots then i ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and a bottle of ale and sat down in one of the booths i was easing down a little it was a stupid mixup but it was just one and it would be hard for anyone to make anything out of it anyway it was done and there wasnt any use worrying i ordered another ale easing my nerves down arguing away the worry i almost convinced myself that it had been a good break it could be if you looked at it in the right way because any damned fool ought to know that we wouldnt be goofy enough to lay up in town and then ride home together i finished the ale started to order a third one and decided against it id had enough more than enough or i never would have you take just so much from the bottle and then you stop taking from then on youre putting i picked up my suit box and crossed the street to the house half hoping that jake was on hand he was he and fay and kendall were all in the living room together and she was laughing and talking a mile a minute i went in giving them a nod and a hello as i headed for the stairs fay turned and called to me come in mr bigelow i was just telling about your train ride how you went to sleep and rode to the end of the line what did you think when you woke up i thought id better start carrying an alarm clock i said kendall chuckled that reminds me of an occasion several years ago when excuse me fay cut in on him jake he was bent forward in his chair staring at the floor his big bony hands folded across each other jake just a moment mr bigelow my husband wants to apologize to you thats not necessary i said i i know but he wants to dont you jake he knows he made a very foolish mistake and he wants to apologize for it thats right kendall nodded primly im sure mr winroy is anxious to rectify any misunderstandings which uh can be rectified j akes head came up suddenly oh yeah he snarled who pulled your chain grandpa kendall looked down into the bowl of his pipe your grandparent he said musingly i believe that is just about the foulest name anyone ever called me jake blinked stupidly then it registered on him and he dragged the back of his hand across his mouth like hed been slapped all the fight in him the little he had left went away again he looked from kendall to fay and then finally at me and i guess mine was about the friendliest face there he got up and sagged toward me a big drainedempty sack of guts he came toward me holding out his hand trying to work up a smile the sly sick look of a beaten dog on his face and i couldnt help feeling sorry for him but the flesh crawled on the back of my neck hed had too much he was too beaten when they get that far gone youd better get in the final licks fast ssorry lad musta had one too many no hard feelings i said it was okay but he didnt hear me he clung to my hand turning to look at fay he stared frowned puzzledly then turned back to me again glad to have you here anything i can do i i i that was as much of his speech as he could remember he dropped my hand and looked at her again she nodded briskly took him by the arm and led him out of the room they went out to the porch and the door didnt quite close and i heard her say now youd better not disappoint me jake ive had just about kendall pushed himself up out of his chair well mr bigelow you look rather tired if i may say so i am i said i think ill turn in excellent i was just about to suggest it cant have you getting sick at a time like this can we at a time like this i said how do you mean why his eyebrows went up a trifle just when youre on the threshold of a new life your schooling and all i feel that great things are in store for you here if you can just keep your original objective in mind keep forging ahead toward it despite divertissements of the moment thats the secret of your success huh i said and he colored a little but he smiled eyes twinkling that i believe is what might be called leaving ones self wide open the obvious retort if i cared to stoop to it would be an inquiry as to the secret of your success we said good night and he went back to the bakery i started up the stairs fay had seenjake off for town or wherever he was going and was out in the kitchen with ruth i stood at the foot of the stairs a moment listening to her lay down the law in that husky whatareyouwaitingon voice then i cleared my throat loudly and went on up to my room about five minutes later fay came in she said there wasnt a thing to worry about kendall and jake had swallowed the story whole and id know if they hadnt honey i was watching believe you me they didnt suspect a thing she was feeling pretty proud of herself i told her shed done swell wheres jake gone to the liquor store hes going to get a fifth of wine and hell probably pick up a couple of drinks in a bar he damned sure wont get any more than that i got all his money away from him but two dollars swell i said thats my baby mmmmm even if i do snore ahhh i was kidding i was sore about that goddamned train ride weel just so youre sorry she leaned against me i gave her a poke and a kiss and pushed her away better beat it now baby i know im just as anxious to be careful as you are honey she reached for the doorknob then she clapped her hand over her mouth suddenly stifling a giggle oh carl theres something i just have to tell you yeah i said dont take too long about it youll die laughing i dont know why i didnt see it before but shes just not the kind of person you pay much attention to and and of course it may have just happened i you just wont believe it honey its just so that is funny i said better not tell me any more or ill be laughing all night stinker just for that its ruthie honey would you believe it i swear to god someones gotten to her i laughed i did a pretty good job of it considering no fooling how did she happen to tell you about it she didnt silly you can see it it sticks out all over her that should be something to see i said crazy she buried her head against my chest giggling bbut but honestly carl who in the world would want to carl i bet i know yeah i said i mean you do why of course it couldnt be anyone else she went home last night ill bet its someone in her own family i swallowed i was relieved in a way but i wished she hadnt said it i felt shamed embarrassed theyre theyre that kind of people theyre trash you ought to see how they live theyve got about fourteen kids and maybe i ought to tell you i said there were fourteen children in my family oh she hesitated uncomfortably well of course i didnt mean that that sure forget it i said but it isnt the same carl you didnt just put up with it like they do you did something about it well i said isnt she doing something oh pooh what good will it do her if she does manage to squeeze through college whos going to give her a job thats worth having i shook my head ruthie looked pretty good to me but shed just about have to she was me in a way and i was seeing myself in her you know im right carl shes trash stupid like all the rest of her family if she really had any brains or guts shed shed well shed do something well maybe shes working on it now maybe shes going to grow herself a gang of kids and put them all out to picking cotton all right she laughed goodnaturedly i guess my own family didnt amount to much for that matter but i did do youd better start doing something else i said before someone catches you in here she kissed me patted me quickly on the cheek and slipped out of the room i went to bed it was only a little after nine when i turned in and i couldnt have slept better if i hadnt had a worry in the world i woke at six with nine good hours under my belt the best nights sleep id had since i left arizona i had a hangover but nothing bad i coughed and spit blood but nothing bad that rest had done me a world of good well anyway id had that much i smoked a couple of cigarettes wondering what id better do whether id better get up and get out on the town stay away from the house until the others were up or whether i should just stay here in my room until they were up it would have to be one way or another otherwise unless i missed my guess id have ruthie on my neck and all ruthie was getting from me from now on was the cold shoulder i wasnt going to get caught alone with her any time i saw her thered be someone else around pretty soon shed get the idea and then maybe it would be safe to be friendly with her just friendly i found a little lunchroom open down near the railroad station and got some coffee afterwards i sauntered back up the street it was sunday somehow that fact kept slipping in and out of my mind you know how that is maybe when a lots been happening to you and you lay off on days youre used to working and so on the church bells were starting to ring booming out over the town practically every business house was closed nothing was open but a few cigar stands lunch counters and the like i began to feel kind of conspicuous i stopped at an intersection to let a car go past but instead of passing it pulled even with me and stopped sheriff summers rolled the window down and leaned out hey there young feller give you a lift he was all duked out in a hardboiled collar and a blue serge suit there was a hatchetfaced dame with him a dame in a stiff black satin dress and a hat that looked like a lamp shade i took off my hat and smiled at her wondering why some dairy hadnt snapped her up to sour their cream for them what about the lift he said shaking hands spect youre headin for church eh glad to take you t any one you say well i hesitated as a matter of fact im not a ive never affiliated just lookin around huh well come on and go with us i went around to the other side and he started to open the front door i opened the back door and climbed in how dumb can you be anyway how little can you know about women muss em up when theyve got their clothes off thats my motto when theyre dressed up maybe in the only good thing theyve got give them room he drove on i cleared my throat i dont believe ive met your is it your daughter sheriff huh he looked up into the rearview mirror startled then he gave her a poke in the ribs with his elbow you hear that bessie he thinks youre my daughter and who am i pray tell why uh my wife thank you i was afraid youd forgotten she half turned in the seat brushing at the place where hed poked her and the way she looked then she wouldnt have stood a chance at that milksouring job thank you for the compliment young man its about the first one ive had since bill came home from the war world war one that is aw now bessie i aint that be quiet mr bigelow and i are thoroughly disgusted with you arent we mr bigelow there is nothing he can say that we care to hear not a thing i grinned thats an awfully pretty hat youre wearing mrs summers do you hear that your highness did you hear what this gentleman said about my hat well heck bessie it does look kinda of like a lamp hushjust be quiet and mr bigelow and i will try to ignore you they kept it up all the way to church and practically up to the door and they seemed to enjoy it in a way but i wondered if they wouldnt have enjoyed some other way better i mean arguing is arguing and quarreling is quarreling and its still that regardless of how you laugh and kid around about it you dont do it unless something is eating on you you dont do it when things are like they should be i opened the car door for her and helped her out and she looked at him i took her elbow and helped her up the steps of the church and she looked at him i stood aside at the door and let her go in first and she looked at him we stayed through sunday school and church and you probably know a lot more about those things than i do so i wont describe them to you it was better than wandering around the street it was as good a way as any of killing the morning i felt safe and peaceful like a guy has to feel if his brain is going to work at is best i sang and prayed and listened to the sermon just sort of letting my mind wander letting it go where it wanted to and by the time church was over i had it id figured out how i was going to kill jake winroy not completely you understand there were a few details to iron out my alibi and setting him up and so on but i knew theyd come to me mrs summers glanced at me as we went back up the aisle together well young man youre looking very happy im glad you let me come with you i said its done me a lot of good they stopped at the door to shake hands with the minister and she introduced me i told him his sermon had been very inspiring which it was id doped out the plan forjake while he was spieling we started on out to the car she and i walking together and the sheriff trailing along behind i was wondering mr big oh i think ill call you carl if you dont mind i wish you would i said what were you wondering mrs summers i was going to ask you if wed reached the curb and she turned and motioned impatiently oh do come on bill youre slower than molasses injanuary i was about to ask carl to come home to dinner with us yeah he said how come i mean uh you were her mouth tightened untightened i think she ws just about to open up on him when he headed her off well fine great he clapped me on the back tickled to death to have you son meant to ask you myself he hadnt meant to he didnt even halfway like the idea he could take me to church sure but to take me into his home pal up with me when there was any kind of a chance that i might mean trouble there was something about me that bothered him there was something he wasnt quite satisfied about thanks very much i said i dont think id better today theyre expecting me at the house and ive got a lot of things to get ready for school and and all uhhuh sure he nodded well if you cant make it you cant guess well have to eat by ourselves bessie you she said ill swear bill summers i i now whatd i do i asked him didnt i you heard him say he couldnt come didnt i he turned to me didnt you say you couldnt come hush youre impossible utterly impossible carl id ask you to let us drive you home but i imagine his highness would find some way to keep you from accepting now i wouldnt neither heck i whyd i do a thing like that why do you do anything pray tell it was getting embarrassing i put a stop to it i said i honestly couldnt take dinner with them today maybe some other time but i would appreciate a ride home neither of them said anything until we reached the house then while i was thanking them and saying good morning he squinted at the coupe pulled in at the gutter hey he frowned thats doc dodsons car aint it you got some sick folks here son not that i know of i said i left the house before anyone was up this morning must be someone sick doc wouldnt be payin no social calls on the winroys wonder who it could be why dont you go in and ask mrs summers glared at him shake hands with all of them call them all by their first names ask about their families never mind about me or how i he jammed the car into gear cutting her off im goin aint i doggone it cant you see im goin son im i i hopped out fast he drove off the engine roaring and i went up the walk and into the house fay met me in the hall she was breathless the reddishbrown eyes blazed with fear against the dead white of her face i looked past her into the dining room ruth was in there ruth and kendall and jake and a potbellied baldheaded little guy i knew was a doctor jake was sprawled on the floor on his back and the doctor was stooped down over him holding a stethoscope to his chest fay whispered to me her lips barely moving his wine poisoned doped did you i pushed past her flipping my fist against her groin goddammit of course she was scared but she didnt need to hang a sign on me she followed me into the dining room and stood beside me i moved away from her over between kendall and ruth jakes eyes were closed he was mumbling rolling his head from side to side the doc leaned back letting the stethoscope swing free and frowned down at him he picked upjakes wrist and felt the pulse he let the hand drop back to the floor hold still he said curtly sleepy sso jake kept on rolling his head breathing in great shuddering breaths ssave me llookit wwine stop that stop it this minute the doctor gripped him by the head with one hand hold still jake held still he had to the way the doc was gripping him he might have got his scalp peeled off the doctor pulled back first one eyelid then the other he stood up brushing at the knees of his pants and nodded to kendall you tell me how this happened phil why yes doc kendall took the pipe out of his mouth i dont know as i can add anything to what mrs winroy mrs winroy was somewhat excited you tell me well lets see she and i mrs winroy and i were in the living room reading the sunday papers and miss dome was in the kitchen preparing dinner isnt that right ruth yyes sir never mind all that just the essentials the doctor glanced impatiently at his watch i cant spend all morning on on you heard winroy coming down the stairs making plenty of noise about it go on i got up we both got up i believe we supposed that uh he was just drunk go on we went out into the hall and he staggered past us mumbling that hed been doped that the wine had been doped or something of the kind his speech was very unclear he came into the dining room and collapsed and we mrs winroy called he was carrying the wine bottle with him eh very carefully corked the loctors face was flushed the red seemed to go clear up into his eyes let me see it again kendall took the bottle from the table and handed itto him he sniffed it tasted it took a mansize swallow of it he brushed his mouth sourly glancing at fay he take sleeping pills how many how often i i dont kknow doctor know how many he has whether any great number is missing no i fay shook her head i brought him some back from the city but i dont know how many he had did eh have a prescription no know thats illegal never mind no bearing here hes nnot the doctor grunted he dug the toe of his shoe into jakes ribs cut it out stop it get up from there he snapped jakes eyes wavered open ssomething in the theres something in it all right alcohol twenty percent by volume he reached for his medicine kit nodding grimly at fay nothing wrong with him not a thing in the world throw a pail of water on him if he doesnt get up but i her face was red too now even redder than his why i just dont understand exhibitionism wants attention sympathy they hit that stuff long enough they dont make much sense no hes not drunk hasnt had enough fay grimaced trying to smile im terribly sorry doctor ill if youll send a bill i will and dont call me again understand i have sick people to take care of he slapped his hat on his head shook hands with kendall and slammed out of the house jake sat up he pushed himself up to his feet stood weaving his head sagged staring at the floor ruth fay kept her eyes on him havent you some work to do i yes maam ruth pivoted on the crutch and scuttled back to the kitchen jake pay moved toward him slowly jake look at me somethin something wrong he mumbled oh she said hoarsely something was wrong huh something wrong you you frightened us all half to death make a big scene here on sunday and aand let me in for a bawling out from that damned snotty dodson and and somethings wrong is that all youve got to say look at me jake winroy he kept his eyes on her feet mumbling that something was wrong moving backward as she came toward him he reached the door and there as he had that first night he whirled and made a break for it i heard him trip and stumble on the steps but he didnt fall as he had the other time he got through the gate and glancing out the window i saw him heading for town at his sagging loping walk fay turned back toward us her lips were trembling her hands clenching and unclenching she shrugged or tried to she tried to smile she said well i gguess thats ttha then she sank down into a chair at the table and buried her head in her arms kendall touched me on the elbow and we went out in the hall together not the most pleasant way to spend the sabbath eh you look like you might be able to use a small libation mr bigelow i could i said it wouldnt even have to be small so you will do me the honor then we crossed the street to the bar there were quite a few people in the place but the bartender came around from behind the counter fast and showed us to a booth hed never done that for me id never seen him do it for anyone else kendall seemed to take it as a matter of course i wondered about it this and the way the doctor had kind of kowtowed to him and i guess i showed it ive lived here the better part of my life mr bigelow or should i say the larger part of it i grew up with many of these people i taught school to many the bartender brought our drinks double scotches kendall rocked the ice in his glass looked up at me slowly his eyes were twinkling odd about winroy isnt it now he above all people should know that if you had been sent here to kill him if you had mr bigelow thats not a very pleasant if i said sorry thoughtless of me make it a hypothetical person then what good would it do for winroy to dispose of him hed only be postponing the inevitable yeah i said i guess i dont know much about those things but its so elementary they his former associates that is would be even more determined if anything suppose the officers charged with executing our laws allowed a malefactor to go unpunished merely because punishment was difficult or dangerous to render him wed have chaos mr bigelow it simply couldnt be allowed i raised my glass and took a drink i guess youre right i said it would be that way wouldnt it but a mal a criminal usually does try to get away he may know it wont do him any good but hes got to try he cant just sit yes yes i suppose so he nodded while theres life theres hope et cetera but winroy i i dont know what all this has to do with me i said what you said a moment ago it sounded like you thought hed tried to get me in trouble and surely you were aware of that why no i shook my head i thought it was like the doctor tell me mr bigelow what do you think the doctors reaction would have been if there had been a quantity of amytal in the wine what do you think would have been the end result of the ensuing course of events i stared at him what did i think jesus christ i didnt have to think he nodded slowly yes he tried to uh frame you thats the expression isnt it you are here by the grace of god and i might say due to my innate distrust of and dislike for the man here instead of in custody on a charge of attempted murder or worse but for gods sake i said how winroy is not notably an early riser neither is he inclined to show consideration to others in the matter of quiet so when i heard him moving about early this morning moving with attempted but not too successful stealth i was disturbed i got up and listened at my door i heard him creep out of his room and enter yours when he came out and went downstairs i investigated i i hope you dont think it was presumptuous of me to enter your room but my thought was that he might have harmed i dont thats all right i said just he was too obvious about it if hed used any subtlety at all but it was a box of amytal mr bigelow hed emptied six of the capsules and left the empty ones in the box with the full ones and hed placed the box behind the window curtain where anyone who suspected wrongdoing would have no difficulty in finding it well i suspected i saw what he must intend i went into his room and examined his wine with a result which you are of course aware of i might have simply called him to account but it seemed best to thwart him to make him appear so painfully ridiculous that any future similar attempt would be knocked in the head at the outset you see that do you not i saw it jake wouldnt pull another stunt like that i disposed of the amytal capsules in the toilet along with the wine then i washed the bottle out and refilled it to its former level from a bottle i had i am not what is ordinarily thought of as a drinking man but a small glass of wine sometimes when i am turning through a book he had to take a drink of it i said hed want to have at least a little of the amytal in him its a wonder he didnt notice the taste kendall chuckled his eyes twinkling well i dont imagine hes accustomed to drinking amytal and liquor so hed hardly know what taste to expect and i imagine it did taste rather peculiar to him its much better wine than hes accustomed to drinking i looked down at the table gosh i said i hardly know what to say except thanks i dont like to think what would have happened if then dont and i enjoyed doing it mr bigelow i cant remember when ive had such an interesting experience what do you think i said do you think i should move out what do you think i hesitated was he or wasnt he if he was tied up with the man id better not be thinking about moving but if he wasnt well moving would be the first thing id think of ive been trying to make up my mind i said id hate to people would naturally wonder about it and its reasonable there the price i mean and with us working together and the bakery so nearby its i dont believe id move if i were you well i said i certainly wouldnt want to i hope you dont i very much hope so of course i wouldnt want you to let me influence you against your better judgement sure i understand i admired you a great deal at your first encounter with winroy your complete selfpossession your selfcontrol nerve in the face of an alarming and awkward situation frankly i was a little envious of you you shamed me i had just about arrived at a point where i was ready to move myself in other words i was going to allow this drunken lout a convicted gangster to dictate to me that would have been wrong of me mr bigelow very wrong but i neednt tell you that of course i cant tell you how disappointed id be if you should well it sounds rather harsh but ill say it if you should turn tail and run im not going to i said im going to stay all right good excellent we shall stand shoulder to shoulder in this matter you may depend on my fullest support moral and otherwise in case of difficulty i believe you will find that my word carries far more weight in this community than winroys im sure it does i said well he raised his glass by the way am i mistaken or did sheriff and mrs summers drive you home i ran into them downtown this morning i said i went to church with them splendid those seemingly small things they mean a great deal in a town like this another drink i shook my head i wanted one but i didnt think id better take it he might get the idea that i needed the stuff to keep going we went back to the house and he and i had dinner together alone fay was in her room i guess still too upset and sore to eat we finished eating and he went to the bakery and i went right along with him we came back at seven for sandwiches and coffee and so on what they usually feed you for sunday night supper wherever you are then we returned to the bakery and i stuck with him until he knocked off at ten oclock i was afraid to be there in the house with ruth when all the others were out of the way i hoped she got the idea fast that i didnt know her from now on sunday is a big night in a bakery kendall explained on saturday theres practically nothing to do since most retail outlets are closed the following day but on sunday youre baking for monday and with almost everyone run out of stuff over the weekend its the busiest day of the week he had plenty to do out on the floor and most of the time i was by myself in the stockroom i kept busy as busy as i could it would have looked funny to loaf around for seven or eight hours he gave me a set of his whites to wear we were about the same size and i went all through the stock getting familiar with it and taking inventory of everything but the bulk stuff you can inventory that tomorrow kendall said when he dropped in on me during a lull youll need someone to help you weigh it and give you the tare the weight of the various containers that would have to be deducted from your gross weight understand to give you the net i nodded and he went on these bulk items theyre the things that have given us trouble not at all surprising either with everyone chasing in and out of here tossing their batches together by guess and by golly now here he tapped a heavily insulated barrel is a plasterofparis compound plaster of paris i said you put that stuff in in in bread a few ounces in a large batch of bread does wonders for the texture and of course its completely harmless a very little more than a few ounces well youd have something resembling paving blocks he smiled his eyes gleaming behind the glasses your dough would be wasted unless say you cared to pelt our friend winroy in the head with it i see i laughed yeah at ten oclock we dressed out together quite a few of the other workmen were changing clothes at the same time but he didnt introduce me as i kind of thought he should we started up the stairs to the street and the locker roomhad been plenty quiet a moment before but the minute we left you could hear the talk starting up by the way he said as we walked home i was very favorably impressed by your industry tonight mr bigelow i felt justified in beginning your pay instead of waiting until tomorrow well thanks i said thanks very much mr kendall not at all mr bigelow about i hesitated about my name mr kendall it seems kind of funny for you to be mistering me wouldnt you rather call me carl would you prefer that i did well i it would be all right i said im sure it would but i think we might well leave things as they are he paused to knock out his pipe on the gatepost then we went on up the walk together man is forced to give up so much of his dignity by the mere exigencies of existence it seems to me that he should cling sturdily to the few shreds that are left to him i see i said i just didnt want you to feel moreover as a somewhat more than casual student of human nature i believe you resent being called by your first name at least on short acquaintance i think our reactions are much the same in that respect the house was quiet dark except for the hall lights we said good night whispering and he went to his room and i went to mine i took out my contact lenses i took out my teeth and stood in front of the mirror massaging my gums they ached they always did there was something wrong with the jawbones they were soft and they werent shaped right id never had a set of teeth that didnt make my mouth hurt not too bad understand just a steady nagging ache that chewed away at you a little at a time i put the teeth back in and went to bed it was after midnight when she slipped into my room she said that jake had come home early and gone straight to bed and that if he knew what was good for him hed stay there it was funny her ordering him around we were going to kill him yet she was going right ahead scolding and fussing threatening what shed do if he didnt behave himself damn him anyway she whispered angrily i was never so scared in my life carl yeah i said it gave me quite a jar too why in the world do you suppose he did it oh i dont know like the doctor said probably so mixed up and screwed up he doesnt know what hes doing yeah but but gosh whew i was scared i didnt tell her about kendall i had nothing to gain by it and a hell of a lot to lose she might say something or do something that would tip him off or she might well i didnt like to think about that but i had to the fact that she might not be on or stay on the level with me kendall had saved my neck this morning he couldnt have done it if jake had been wise to him and if i needed help from kendall in the future and jake was wise to him you see kendall was the mans ace in the hole dammit he just about had to be but he was mine too up to a point as long as i kept my nose clean with the man kendall was on my side he didnt have to be he could be leading me on trying to get me to tip my hand i couldnt open up with him i couldnt lay it on the line with her the only person i could trust was charlie bigger little bigger and that sawedoff sonofabitch i was beginning to have some doubts about him talk about jake being on a spot compared to mejake didnt have anything to worry about it was a pretty chilly night and shed gotten into bed with me we lay close together whispering when we had anything to say her head pillowed on my arm id better start getting used to doing without you i said we cant keep this up baby if theres something we have to talk over sure well risk it otherwise we stay out of the clinches but but itll be months carl you mean weve got to wait all that time until maybe not i guess not i said like i said therell be times we have to get together but well have to hold em down pay the more were together the more chances that someone will find out about it i know honey i know we have to be careful another thing i suddenly remembered something those amytal capsules why in the name of god did you buy them kid well he uses so damned many of them and they cost so much if you go to a doctor and get a prescription dont try to save dough that way again i said the stuff is poison you buy it without a prescription and he accidentally takes an overdose whew she shivered why why someone else might slip him a load and i id she left the sentence unfinished at last she snickered softly i gave her a pat and took a long deep breath something funny that ruth every time i think about it i want to burst out laughing yeah i said thats a riot all right ugh it makes me kind of sick to think about it what in the world would anyone what could he be like carl i wonder i said i was up and dressed early the next morning but i didnt go downstairs right away id started to when i remembered about ruth about being alone with her and i would have been alone with her at that hour so i sat down on the edge of the bed and waited smoking and fidgeting feeling pretty queasy and nervous about getting started in school christ imagine me in school but wanting to get it over with i waited listening for kendalls door to open then i waited a few seconds more so it wouldnt look like i had been waiting for him and headed for my door he knocked on it just as i turned the knob ah good morning mr bigelow he said all ready to begin your college career yes sir i guess i am i said such enthusiasm he laughed sympathetically a little nervous eh a feeling of strangeness and unreality well thats natural enough do you know i have half a notion to uh yes sir would you regard it as uh presumptuous if i accompanied you i am rather well acquainted with the faculty and possibly as my uh er protege you might feel somewhat more i wish you would i said i cant think of anything id like better really he seemed pleased as all get out i i feel very flattered mr bigelow i was going to suggest it last night but i was afraid it might seem an intrusion i wanted to ask you i said but it seemed like a pretty nervy thing to do tsk tsk he beamed we must be less uh diffident with one another from now on how about breakfast eh i seem to have an unusually hearty appetite this morning i didnt know id been practically sure yesterday but now he had me wondering again he could be both things the nice dignified little old guy and the other too you can do that split yourself up into two parts its easier than youd think where it gets tough is when you try to get the parts back together again but he didnt need to be pretending most of the time id never pretended id really like a guy or want to help him along but id go right ahead and and do what i had to well anyway i was damned glad he was going with me it seemed funny with all the other things i had to worry me that id been uneasy about getting enrolled in a hick college but i just couldnt help it i guessed maybe it went back to the days when luke and me and the rest of us had been crop tramps and maybe youd get two days in a school one week and three days a month in another you never knew a thing about the lessons and you smelled kind of bad and maybe you had a head full of lice and youd get put way off somewhere by yourself you couldnt see worth a damn and your teeth had screwed up your hearing and there was nothing you could do that someone didnt laugh at you or lay into you and skip it forget it i was just trying to explain why i felt like i did ruth served breakfast to us and the way she kept trying to catch my eye i had a notion to take it out and hand it to her if she hadnt been kind of awed by kendall i think she might have suggested walking to the college with me shy as she was much as she hated to show herself on that crutch she seemed to have it that bad i wondered whether there wasnt some safe way of getting pay to give her the gate and i guessed there was probably but i knew i wasnt going to do it id tell her where to head in if i got the chance if i had to but i wouldnt get her fired kendall finally finished eating id just been dragging my breakfast out waiting for him and we got started i hadnt thought much about what courses i would take i didnt know the score on those things naturally and id just supposed that you wouldnt have much sayso about your studies kendall said it wouldnt be that way that would be somewhat the case if you were a regular member of the freshman class or if you were majoring in a specific subject but since youll be classified as a special student youre attending as a matter of selfimprovement and for i assume the prestige value of college study you have a great deal of latitude as to subjects now if you wouldnt uh if you would like my suggestions i certainly would i said something then which would not point up any shortcomings in your past schooling something that is not predicated upon earlier studies in the same field english literature one can appreciate pope without ever having read a line of dryden political science more a matter of common sense than doctrinaire history merely another branch of literature how does that sound to you mr bigelow well it sounds pretty impressive impressive is the word he chuckled pleased with himself with such a course no one could doubt your seriousness as a student impressive wasnt the word id been thinking of id been about to say it sounded pretty damned tough whatever you say i said if you think i can get by in those things you can and shall with perhaps some slight assistance from me you may depend upon it mr bigelow i would not suggest subjects for you in which you could not uh get by i nodded i didnt think id have much trouble getting by either with someone like kendall to steer me someone who knew the ropes i couldnt miss i imagine i could have got the enrollment over in thirty minutes and did get my registration over and my fees paid in about that time but kendall wasnt through when that was done he introduced me to the president and the chancellor and the dean of men and they were all polite and respectful to him then he took me around and introduced me to each of the instructors id have when noon came we still had one more guy to see so we ate in the school cafeteria and looked him up after lunch by the time we got through with him it was two oclock and kendall said there wasnt much point in starting any classes that day lets see now he glanced at his watch as we left the campus why dont you use the rest of the afternoon to pick up any books or supplies you need then after dinner around sixthirty say would that be agreeable mr bigelow i was thinking we might set your working shift at loosely sixthirty to eleven couldnt i come in earlier than that i said i wont need more than an hour or so to do my shopping and after today ill be out of my class at three id like to come in earlier mr kendall for a while anyway i sounded plenty sincere like maybe dick doordie fighting through to fortune and thats just how i felt until ruthie cooled off i had to have some place to hang out well uh of course there wouldnt be any more money for you but i dont care about that i said i just like to be doing something learning something he turned his head slowly and looked at me and for a moment i thought he was going to ask who the hell i was kidding and when he finally got around to speaking he seemed so pleased he was all choked up mr bigelow i i cant tell you how glad i am that you came to peardale my only regret is that we could not have met that the circumstances of our association could not have been uh he broke off blowing his nose and we walked a block before he said anything more well we must take things as we find them eh we must look on the bright side you are industrious you have fortitude the willtodo and now you are doing all that can be done to round out your education a powerful triumvirate my s mr bigelow flawed and shadowed as it may be when you consider someone like poor ruth whose sole assets virtually are ambition and a quick mind and handicapped as she is they are doubtful assets indeed your own situation seems one of great good fortune im not complaining i said you say ruths pretty smart brilliant far from worldlywise of course but an exceptionally keen intelligence an honor student at the college shes very well thought of there incidentally if you should encounter some difficulty with the curriculum im sure shed be glad to i wouldnt want to bother her i said she gets embarrassed so easily i dont want to pester you either of course but if i do have any trouble id rather talk it over with you i feel more well more at home with you hem he swelled up like a poisoned pup splendid uh that is to say excellent a pleasure mr bigelow we separated down near the middle of town he headed for the bakery and i picked up my school supplies taking a fast gander at jakes barber shop as i passed it it was a twochair joint but a cloth was draped over the front chair jake was dozing in the rear one his head drooped forward on his chest i finished my buying and had some coffee in a drugstore going out the door i ran head on into sheriff summers howdy there son he stood back from me a little thought youd be in school today ive been there most of the day i said mr kendall went with me to see that i got off on the right foot and we met so many of his friends i was all day in registering well well kendall went with you eh didnt think nothin short of a threering circus could get him away from that bakery im on my way to work there now i said ive just been picking up some things i need at school swell good boy he clapped me on the back uh kinda hopin i might run into you bessies been i mean how about eatin with us this sunday well i hesitated i if youre sure it wouldnt be any trouble for you sheriff nothin like it he said heartily tickled to death to have you howd it be if we meet you at church and go right from there i said that would be fine well be lookin forward to it then im doggone glad youre gettin lined up so well son after that after all that mess at the beginning just keep up the good work huh thank you i said i certainly intend to sheriff i passed jakes shop again on the way to the bakery and there he was standing right up against the glass staring straight out at me i could feel him watching me all the way up the street i put my books in my locker at the bakery and changed clothes i went up the stairs whistling feeling about as happy as a guy like me could feel i knew i had plenty to worry about and it wasnt any time to be getting cocky and careless but the way things had gone today getting squared away at school and the sheriff warming up to me and and everything i just couldnt worry much kendall spotted me the moment i hit the floor and he was all business now come along mr bigelow he said herding me toward the stockroom ill get you started off and then ill have to leave you we entered the stockroom the main one and he handed me the batch cards there were fourteen of them cardboard oblongs a little wider than a cigarette package and about three times the length each one listed the quantity and kind of ingredients wanted for a dough batch bread cake piecrust doughnuts and so on read them all all right mr bigelow everything clear to you let me see you set up the sponge on that wholewheat bread mix i picked out the card and shoved the others into my pocket i looked at the list of ingredients and started for the substoreroom then i remembered and picked up a pail instead thats right he smiled briskly the flours just there for the record they can draw that themselves pretty hard to over or underdraw on sacked flour all youre concerned with is the sponge sugar first remember then i remembered i scooped sugar from a barrel and weighed it on the scales i dumped it into the pail and weighed in salt and powdered milk i wiped the scales clean dribbled some of the plasterofparis compound on them and emptied it into a glassine bag i tucked the bag into the pail up against the side of it then i carried the pail into the coldstorage room id worked up a light sweat but it was gone the second i stepped inside he stood watching me holding the door open there was another set of scales in there i weighed lard onto them and dumped it into the pail i punched a depression in the lard with my fist measured a pint of malt syrup into the depression and carried the pail outside kendall let the door slam shut nodding approvingly very good mr bigelow just drop the batch card in at the side there and you have it done now about that door you cant be too careful about that be very sure its off the latch when you go in or better still block it open slightly one of those barrel scrapers should do the job ill be careful all right i said please do youll be here alone most of the time you could be locked in there several hours before you were discovered and it would be of very little use to discover you even after a much briefer lapse of time so oh yes speaking of doors he motioned to me and i followed him into the substoreroom he led me to the street door the one hed hinted i might use as a private entrance pulling out a key ring ive had a key made for you he took it off the ring we receive flour and other supplies through this door so regardless uh so youll doubtless find use for it well just see how it works now and it didnt fit too well apparently kendall had to twist it back and forth and push up on the knob before the door finally opened well he frowned i suppose well have to make it do for the time being perhaps with use his mouth came shut tightening with distaste i looked across the street where he was looking staring and i saw jake winroy duck his head quickly and speed up that sagging lopsided lope of his by a notch or two he passed out of viewing range kendall slammed the door jerked on the knob testing it and handed me the key i dont know he shook his head i dont know that ive ever met anyone i so thoroughly detested well we cant waste our valuable time on him can we any questions anything thats not clear to you if not ill get back to the floor i said i thought i had everything down pat and he left i went back to the main stockroom i lined up all the sponge pails in a row measured the dry ingredients into each of them and carried them into the coldstorage room i measured in the lard and malt tucked in the batch cards and set the pails just outside the entrance to the baking room i came back into the stockroom studying the cards for the sweet doughs i was kind of breathless i didnt need to but id been rushing my head off not out here but in there in the coldstorage room i lighted a cigarette telling myself id better take it easier i wouldnt last long rushing hard work steady hard work well id given my lifetime quota on that a long time ago aside from that it would be easy to screw things up if i hurried too fast i didnt know the job good yet working with all those different ingredients and measurements a guy wouldnt have to be even pretty careless to get a little too much of one thing and not enough of another and there wouldnt be any way of spotting the mistake until the stuff came out of the ovens as hard as brickbats maybe or as tough as shoe leather i glanced at the coldstorage room and i shivered a little so it was cold what of it i didnt need to stay in there like id done on the sponges wrapping up everything at one time i could stay in say for five minutes come out and go back in again for another five why stay in there freezing my tail off trying to do everything at once i knew why and i made myself admit it the goddam place kind of gave me the creeps i wanted to get through in there as fast as i could it was so damned quiet youd hear a noise and sort of start and then youd realize that youd gulped or one of your muscles had creaked and that was the noise youd heard the door was so thick and heavy that you seemed locked in even when you knew you werent you kept looking at the scraper to see if it was still in place and everything was kind of greasy and damp in there everything seemed about the same shade and you could look two or three times and still not be sure if you could have propped the door wide open but you couldnt do that kendall had warned me about keeping the door open any more than was necessary it would be a hell of a coldstorage room if you did that much i coughed choked back another cough the bug wasnt active again i was sure of that but i was glad i hadnt had to produce a health certificate i dropped the cigarette butt stepped on it and looked at the cards for the sweet doughs they were more complicated than the others the sponge mixes and the extrarefined flour had to be weighed out with the other ingredients they didnt just draw what they wanted as they did on the bread if i took my time on this stuff and id damned well better i probably wouldnt have it ready a hell of a lot sooner than i had to i took the scraper out of my pocket i pulled the coldstorageroom door open and went inside i laid the scraper handle against the jamb letting the door settle against it then i turned my back on the damned thing and got busy there were eight batches in all i decided to do two and go out and get the dry stuff ready for them then id come back and do two more and so on until i was through and if didnt like it in here i knew what to do about it there was an easy way to save time i could snap out of the creeps and stop checking on the door every ten seconds i got busy i put two pans on the work table leaned their batch cards against them and began pouring and dumping and weighing and the creeps stayed right with me but i didnt give in to them i never looked once at the door the work went pretty fast it didnt seem to but according to my watch it did i finished the first two batches the wet part of them took them out and set up the dry stuff and came back in again i did another two and another two and started on the fourth pair the last two i had to do i got them done and somehow they seemed to take longer than the others it seemed like id never get through with them finally though they were ready and i tucked the batch cards into the slits at the end of the pans then i picked them up and turned around and pushed against the door i pushed pretty easy at first easy because i couldnt bring myself to push hard i just sort of leaned against it because if i did more than that if i pushed hard and it didnt i put a little more steam into it just a little and then a little more and a little more and then suddenly i wasnt pushing hard or any other way i was throwing myself at it giving it every thing i had and i was still holding onto those mixes why the hell i dont know and they were slopping all over me and the floor and i hit that door like i was going to drive straight through it and i bounced and skidded and slipped and i did a belly whopper to the floor the wind went out of me like a popped balloon i gagged and retched but nothing came up i lay on the floor writhing squeezing my head between my hands trying to squeeze the pain away and after a while i could breathe again and i could get my eyes to focus i looked the door was closed tight the scraper wasnt there and it hadnt slipped inside someone had taken it away i laughed i got ahold of the table and pulled myself up i laughed and laughed brushing at the crap on my clothes feeling it cling and stick and stiffen against my fingers because what was the sense to it anyway how in the hell could you win you were right on the beam playing all the angles doing things twice as well as you thought you could and getting some breaks thrown in everything was swell and you were a bright boy and a tough boy and a punchy boozestupe without enough guts to string a uke could come along and put the blocks to you he could do it because he didnt have anything nothing to lose he didnt need to be smart to cover his tracks you had to cover them for him he could make one dopey move after another and all you could do was duck and keep your mouth shut he didnt need guts he could run from you but you couldnt run from him he could pick you off any way any time and if he got caught i had to choose between times and ways and if i got caught not responsible not a chance if you beat the law there was still the man i laughed and choked and coughed it was such a hell of a good joke me feeling sorry for jake that was my first reaction that it was the damnedest funniest thing in the world and it was a relief to get it all over it hadnt made any sense from the beginning id go right on looking for whatever i was looking for and i wouldnt stand any better chance of finding it than i ever had so it was funny it was a relief then that cold really began to gnaw into me and i stopped laughing and i wasnt relieved any more it was too simple too clearcut and easy id been swimming in muck all my life and could never quite sink in it and i could never quite get to the other side i had to go on choking to death a little at a time there wouldnt be anything for me as clean and easy as this i looked at my watch i got up and started walking back and forth stamping my feet rubbing my hands and slapping them against my body fourthirty it seemed like it ought to be hours later than that id done so much that day and got started so early but it was only fourthirty kendall would knock off at a quarter of six to go to the house for dinner and hed come in after me and then id get out of here no one would come in before then there wasnt any reason for them to and and they just wouldnt and kendall wouldnt dress out without me and go on to the house by himself either way see would make it easy for me and that was against the rules i wouldnt be found soon enough to really help or late enough to to do any good fourthirty to fivefortyfive an hour and fifteen minutes that would be the score no more no less not enough to kill me too much a hell of a lot too much to leave me unharmed just the right amount to knock me on my ass i should have given up just relaxed and stopped trying to do anything about it because whatever i did or didnt do i wasnt going to change a thing id still be just so sick almost completely screwed up not quite stripped of everything i had right at the time when i needed everything i had and couldnt be screwed up at all no i couldnt change a thing but i had to try relaxing giving up those were against the rules too i walked back and forth stamping and slapping and pounding hugging my arms across my chest sticking my hands between my crotch and clasping my legs on them and i kept getting colder and stiffer and my lungs began to feel like i was breathing fire i climbed up on the table trying to warm my hands against the light in the ceiling but there was a wire guard around it and it was just a little globe and it didnt do any good i climbed back down and started walking again trying to think a fire huhuh nothing to burn and it wouldnt do anyway it wouldnt even be smart to smoke the air wasnt too good now i looked along the rows of shelves looking for anything i studied the labels on the thick jugs extract of vanilla extract of lemon alcohol per cent but i knew better than that too youd feel warmer for a few seconds and then youd be colder than ever i began to get sore i thought for christs sake what kind of a dope are you anyway youre suppose to be smart remember you dont just take things you dont like something you do something about it locked up not locked up its still the same isnt it except for the air suppose suppose you were riding that manifest out of denton the fast meat train that balls the jack all the way into el reno its november and all the goddamned reefer holes are locked so youre riding the top in the goddamn cold wind and you cant die and youd better not get down because you remember that kid in the jungle at st joe the color of the weeds he was lying in taking on the boesfora dime ora nickelora cart of coffee or so i remembered i didnt invent the trick but its a good one you crawl down inside your cotton sack the sack you pick cotton into its nine feet long and made out of canvas and you kind of flap the end over itself so that just a tiny bit of air comes in and you breathe practically the same air in and out but you warm up fast after a while your lungs start itching and smarting and your head begins to hurt but you stay there keeping your mind on warm things warm and soft and safe i didnt have a cotton sack now of course or anything in the way of a big piece of cloth but if i could get inside of something pull something over me and put my breath to work well it would help i took a long careful look around the room egg can too small lard barrel too big it would take too long to dig the lard out mincemeat the keg was only about a fourth full i squatted down trying to measure myself against it and it was pretty small not really what ought to have but it was the only thing i did have i turned it upside down then got my arms around it and banged it up and down dumping the sweetsmelling semifrozen slush on the floor i scraped the inside with a scoop and i knew could scrape all night and not get it completely clean so i gave up and got it over me i sat down on the floor with my arms at my sides and stuck my head and shoulders into it then i sat up and let it slide down over me it only came down to my hips and little gobs of that goo kept letting go and trickling down onto me but that had to be it it and me was all i had so i breathed hard and tried to concentrate on on warmness and softness comfort and safety i got to thinking about the farm that guy had up in vermont where he grew all those things and i remembered how hed said that he didnt have any demand any more except for just the one thing i closed my eyes and i could almost see them the long rows of them and i grinned and laughed to myself beginning to feel kind of good and pretty warm and then i thought i began to see the goats were going up and down the rows walking sideways on their hind feet and every time they came to one theyd raise their tails and cut loose with the fertilizer and each time they came to the end of a row theyd stand on their heads and howl they had to do it they knew it wasnt going to get them anything because there was nothing there to get but they kept right on moving sideways and backwards because that was the way the rows were laid out and at the end they stood on their heads howling i stopped thinking about it there was no warmth in it i brought my mind back to kendall him and fay wondered what id better tell them and i knew id better not tell the truth she might blow up jump jake about it or give it away to someone else she might scare off if she got sore or shaky if she thought jake could take the ball away from me and kendall if he was on the level hed have jake in jail so fast it would make his head swim hed gotten a bang out of the other the frameup because nothing had come of it and hed outsmartedjake but if he thoughtjake had tried to kill me and if he was on the level he couldnt let it slide hed have to crack down to protect the bakery if he was with the man that would be worse yet the man already thought might have a few rocks in my head hed been sore about me dragging in fay and why in hell had i done that anyhow i could have got along without her he probably had a hunch that might have seen through that fruit jar frammis and didnt trust him as much as had to trust him and if he thought i couldnt do any better than this get it thrown into me by the guy i was supposed to throw it into no it had to be an accident that would be bad enough i twisted my wrist and looked down fivetwenty about twentyfive minutes to go an hour and fifteen minutes plus the time before id got locked in it wouldnt be enough for a guy in good health hed have the sniffles and a sore throat and that would be about the size of it with me though it would be exactly enough i couldnt have timed it better if id been trying to knock myself out twentyfour mintues ruth as long as id know i was going to use fay why had i made a play for ruth and fay getting back to pay it wouldnt have been any wonder i wouldnt have blamed the man much if hed given fruit jar that knife instead of me sure pay could be a big help sure she could make things a lot easier for me so what she could do something else too if she was smart enough to see it because how can you really trust a dame wholl help kill her own husband the man had told me what she could do hed pointed out the spot where i could go down and never come up hed just mentioned it once then hed let it lay and gone on pay was already in or as good as in and there was nothing to do but like it but he wouldnt have been the man if he had liked it brother he must have thought i was a goof me little bigger putting the one rope in the world around my neck that would hang me i didnt have a record none that they could pin on me i could line up before every cop in the country and there wasnt a one that could say yes thats our bigger boy no one could say it and prove it no one could now but if i could be caught in the act of trying to kill jake winroy if they had that much to go on and could work back from it all those rewards all for fay fortyseven thousand dollars for fay and no halfblind runt with a mouth like a dogs behind to get in her hair i got out just about on schedule kendall found me around ten minutes of six and he and one of the bakers got me home by sixthirty i was in bed with two hotwater bottles feeling sort of drowsy and dopey from something the doctor had given me it was the same doctor dodson that fay had called for jake but he wasnt at all crusty and tough with me like hed been with him and her my own moth you couldnt have wanted a guy to be nicer he pulled the blankets back up over my chest and tucked them under my chin so youre feeling fine huh no pain at all never mind i dont want you talking with that throat i grinned at him and my eyelids began to droop shut he turned and gave pay a nod i want this boy to rest he is to have complete quiet understand no nonsense no disturbance such as occurred here yesterday i fay bit her lip blushing i understand doctor good see that your husband does now if youll get that bedpan i spoke to you about a quarter of an hour ago she went out the doctor and kendall moved over near the door and i wasnt quite asleep yet i was just drifting off and i got a little of what they said all right this time stays in bed and ought to be up by relieved to strong personal interest yep this time wouldnt bet a nickel on pessimist dod why a next teeth out lens no better do it my dont mean he everything straight across the board nothing really right no good to begin that was the last i heard i was in bed until friday or i should say i didnt leave the house until then because i didnt stay in bed all the time when i had to vomit or use the toilet i went to the bathroom and i made sure that everything was flushed down good i told everyone that i felt all right that i was just sort of weak and tired and aside from all that blood and phlegm which began tapering off about thursday there didnt seem to be a hell of a lot wrong with me i didnt have much pain like i said i was just weak and tired and i had a funny feeling that a lot of me had been taken away what there was of me was all right but there wasnt much of me any more pay spent a lot of time in my room and that was okay of course since she was supposed to take care of me we had plenty of time to talk she said that jake had been in the house and in bed every night by eleven oclock as she put it he was behaving like a perfect lamb how about that anyway i asked her making it sound casual i mean how come he lets you boss him around whats he afraid of she shrugged gosh i dont know honey afraid ill leave him i guess its not doing him a hell of a lot of good for you to stay no she laughed huskily slanting her eyes at me now how would you guess a thing like that i let the talk drift off onto other things what a funny little guy kendall was and who in the hell could have seduced ruthie and after a while i let it drift back to jake again this board money doesnt amount to anything i said and i dont see how he can make any dough in that shop of his how do you keep going you call this going it takes dough quite a bit with jake hitting the whiz so hard weel he does have some business carl me she guffawed and put her hand over her mouth id be afraid id get scalped but everyone knows him and knew his folks and he has some trade on fridays and saturdays you know when all the shops are busy and hes usually hanging around there at night staying open when the other shops are closed one day wednesday i think it was when she brought my lunch up i asked her if jake had ever mentioned going back to jail she shook her head firmly for ten years he couldnt take it when he was being paid off heavy when he knew hed be taken care of when he got out they wouldnt play with him any more would they carl if he was willing hed just do his time and theyd get him when it was over i nodded if they couldnt arrange to get him inside why in hell did he do it anyway pay i know the cops probably shot him a big line about how theyd protect him and no one would dare touch him because it just wouldnt be good business but and how i hated to lose out on that payoff money but i didnt think no one seemed to think that jake must have known how it would be hell look at the way he started slipping hitting the jug and letting himself go look at the way he blew up when he spotted me yeah well she shook her head again why do we do anything he was going nuts in jail he felt like hed been the fall guy for the rest of the crowd and the money he was getting wasnt doing him any good so that was about the size of the matter i knew it id been briefed on every phase of the deal just what had happened and why and how it had happened but i wanted her to tell me anyway why doesnt he turn himself into custody stay in the jug until after the trial is over why she frowned at me puzzled thats what i said if hes so sure im someones going to bump him off to keep him from talking why but honey what good would that do theyd get him afterwards yeah sure i said thats the way it would be all right her frown deepened a little honey youre not not getting nervous are you about him i forced a laugh not a chance hes in the bag and im all set to sew it up how tell me carl i hadnt meant to tell her so soon the safest way would have been to keep itto myself right up to the last minute but well id got her a little worried with all that questioning and it looked to me like id better show her i was right on the ball before she got more worried heres the deal i said well pick a weekend night when ruths gone home to her folks and she pay would set jake up shed meet him downtown earlier and see that he didnt get too much to drink then shed go on home after she had him good and teased up to get ready for what shed promised to give him make him believe it i said make him want it so bad he can taste it know what mean i know go on carl okay you go on home he gives you a few minutes and then he follows you ill be watching at the door of the bakery and follow him i catchup with him at the steps pop his neck and drop him off on his head i beat it back to the bakery and you discover him you heard him stumble see like hes always stumbling on those steps thats it how will you his neck its easy you dont have to worry about that well gosh it it sounds so so simple you want it hard well no her frown went away and she laughed when do we do it carl ill let you know not for weeks yet gee she said wonderingly imagine me thinking you might be getting a little sca worried are you kidding i said gee she said again you tough little bastard you kendall was in to see me at least twice a day he fussed around over me like i was a twoyearold kid feeling my forehead and asking me if i didnt want this or that or the other then kind of scolding me about smoking too much and not taking better care of myself you really must mr bigelow so much depends on it hed say and id say yes sir mr kendall i understand it seemed that quite a few guys had got themselves locked into the coldstorage room at one time or another and he took it for granted that id done the same he also took it for granted that id opened that side door of the bakery for some reason and left it unlocked and of course i didnt correct him i didnt point out that hed done it himself when he was trying out the new key kendall usually managed to be around when the doctor came to see me but he and the doc didnt do much talking after the first couple visits kendall didnt want to be told that i was in bad shape and dodson apparently wasnt a guy to pull his punches so after the first couple visits when kendall argued with him and kept calling him a pessimist the doctor got sort of grim and clammed up about all hed say was id be all right this time but but hed say and let it go at that and kendall would be pretty redfaced and huffy and almost glare at him until he got out of my room a pessimist hed say huffily always looking on the dark side of everything you are feeling better arent you mr bigelow sure sure i feel fine mr kendall id say thursday evening he asked me about a dozen times if i was feeling better and if i was sure i should get up the next day after that he got pretty quiet for a time and when he spoke again it was about that little cabin he had up in canada it might be just the thing for you mr bigelow in case that is that your health should worsen and you should not uh be able to carry out your plans here im all right i said ill be able to carry them out mr kendall im sure of it it would indeed be tragic if you could not but in case it would be ideal for you mr bigelow you could take my car and living would be very cheap and i assume you have some money but i would be very happy to help i have most of what i got from my filling station i said but its awfully nice of you to offer not at all youre more than welcome to any help i can give you what do you think about it mr bigelow as a more or less pleasant solution to an unpleasant eventuality youd have complete quiet the most favorable conditions for rest and study the nearest town is forty miles away accessible enough by car but far enough distant to insure your privacy how does it sound to you anyway it sounded swell id never heard of a better place to knock a guy off as i was going to be knocked off if i fell down on the job here that sounds nice i said but i dont imagine ill be going im staying right here and going to school and and do everything else i planned of course certainly he nodded and stood up to go its just something to think about i thought about it it was almost one oclock in the morning before i could get to sleep the next day the day after that night rather was friday and i was still awfully weak and wrung out but i knew id better not lie around any longer fay would start to worrying again kendall would start to wondering whether i could carry on or not and if he had any doubts it wouldnt be long until the man had them i got up early so that could take my time about dressing and ate breakfast with kendall i left the house when he did and headed for the college that first morning monday morning i hadnt paid any attention to the other students id seen them of course some of them were passing us or we were passing them all the way to the school but they hadnt made any impression on me i mean i hadnt been bothered by them kendall had been so free and easy that id felt the same way this morning it was different i felt like a jerk there was a regular parade of students going toward the college and i was right in the middle of it but somehow i wasnt part of it i was always by myself with the others in back or ahead of me nudging each other when they thought i wasnt looking laughing and whispering and talking about my clothes about the way i looked about everything because nothing about me was right i went to my first class and the instructor acted like hed never seen me before he wanted to know if i was sure i was in the right class and why i was starting to school so late in the term and he was one of those goofs who keep asking you questions without listening to your answers and i had to explain over and over while the others sat grinning and watching me finally it sank in on him he remembered about kendall introducing me and he halfway apologized for his forgetfulness but things still werent squared away id been absent for three days so i had to go to the dean of men for an okay before i could be admitted to classes i got it a cut slip think they called it and got back just about thirty seconds before the class was over i was just sitting down in my seat when the bell rang everyone got a big bang out of it youd have thought it was the funniest thing that ever happened in one class i guess must have moved a dozen times before i found a seat that didnt belong to someone else id just get sat down when some dope would trail up and say it was where he sat and yeah i think they were making a game out of it trying to make me look dopier than felt but all i could do was keep moving until the instructor woke up and assigned me to a desk the third class the one just before lunch was the worst one it was english literature and everyone was taking turns at reading a few paragraphs aloud so it came my turn and the way was looking down and talking at the same time my teeth slipped a little bit and everything i said sounded sort of like baby talk the snickers and giggles got louder and louder and finally the instructor told me to sit down very amusing bigelow he said giving me a glare that would have frosted an orchard is mr kendall acquainted with your talent for mimicry i shrugged and smirked what the hell could i do or say and he frowned and nodded for another student to start reading a little bit later although it didnt seem like a little bit the noon bell rang i stopped by his desk on the way out and explained about the teeth he was pretty nice about it said he was sorry hed misunderstood the situation and so on so that was taken care of he wouldnt knock me to kendall but i walked down the corridor to the building entrance and everyone seemed to be laughing and talking about me and part of it was imagination of course but not all of it it was a small college and i guess the students were pretty hard up for kicks and news traveled fast i headed toward the house wondering why in hell i bothered when i know i wouldnt be able to eat anything i tried to keep to the side streets dodging people whenever i could and cursing myself for doing it she ducked out of an alley just as i was ducking across it looking back now id say that shed been waiting for me to pass i said oh hello ruth and started to go on she said ccarl wait a minute yeah i said i paused waiting i know youre mad at me about something but mad i said i dont even know youre alive yyes she said i know that too i didnt want to talk to you about that all i wanted to say was about about school ddont mind the way they act just go ahead and after a while you get used to it she smiled tried to she nodded her head and pivoted on her crutch and i knew that i should let her go like that a clean hard break but i couldnt do it i stepped in front of her i know youre alive ruthie i said i know it plenty nno i mean its all right carl i i guess i just ive been trying to give you a break im no good for you im no good period but you are too her eyes flashed youre nice and theres mrs winroy i said i think she might be a little suspicious if she thought there was anything going on between us shed probably fire you fast oh she said and her voice quavered a little i ddidnt has she said anything i couldnt lose my job carl if i youll have to watch it then i said thats why ive acted the way i have ruthie its the only reason i like you a lot she stood blushing and trembling the splayed hand gripping the brace of the crutch thats the way it is ruth keep it in mind i think youre pretty swell if i dont show it its because i cant she nodded looking like she was a dog and i owned her now you can do me a little favor i said if you want to im feeling a little rocky but i dont want to go back to the house and have everyone worrying over me so shouldnt you carl i mean dont you think you should stay in bed for another day im all right said but dont think i feel up to school this afternoon if youll tell kendall or anyone else that asks that im eating lunch at the cafeteria dont let on you know that everything isnt okay it will be carl youll get used to it sure i will i said but ive had enough for today i think ill just loaf around town for a couple of hours get myself pulled together before its time to go to work she hesitated frowning sort of troubled youre not not awfully discouraged carl you dont intend to drop out of school and not a chance i said peardales stuck with me and im sticking with it i just dont feel up to it this afternoon she went on then on down the alley and i went on up the street to a nice quiet bar id spotted the day was with kendall i settled down in a rear booth and i didnt move out of it until three oclock i wouldnt have cared much if the sheriff or someone had spotted me there theyd have had a hard time making anything out of the fact that i was taking things easy my first day out of bed but no one came into the place that knew hardly anyone came in at all for that matter so i just sat there feeling more relaxed and rested the longer i sat thinking and smoking and drinking i felt pretty good by the time left what there was of me felt pretty good i got through my shift at the bakery i put in a full eight hours there the next day saturday and i got through them all right too so i got by all right just barely because like i said there just wasnt a whole lot left of me i wondered what would happen if something tough came up something really hard to take something that i couldnt handle in my own way a little at a time like i did the job and then it was sunday and i began to find out sheriff summers belched and leaned back in his chair fine dinner bessie he said cant remember when ughahh i et so much at breakfast said mrs summers wrinkling her forehead at him more coffee carl i think from the sound of things that his highness will have to settle for some baking soda and water aw now bessie why no sir not another drop and kindly stop picking at the meringue on that pie the sheriff grinned sheepishly and winked at me aint she a terror though son bout the bossiest one woman you ever seen ill bet i dont think id say that i laughed certainly you wouldnt only his highness is capable of it hes just being polite the sheriff winked at me again but youre not are you quiet carl and i do not care to talk to you do we carl no maam i said smiling and he and she laughed and smiled at me it was a nice day any way you looked at it cool but sunny just enough breeze to ripple the greenbrown leaves of the trees and it had got off to a good start kendall had let me set up most of my sunday batches the day before and leave them in cold storage and hed insisted that i take all of today off hed really insisted not in the way people do when they expect you to talk em out of it i was beginning to feel almost as much at home with the sheriff and his wife as i had with that old couple out in arizona sheriff summers said he guessed hed take a little nap and mrs summers told him by all means to go ahead he went up to the front of the house where his bedroom was she and i sat at the table a while longer drinking coffee and talking then she took me outside to show me the yard their house was one of those rambling old cottages which never seem to go out of date no matter how old they are the yard was almost a half block wide and a block deep and shed tried to doll it up with flower beds and a rock garden in the rear i told her how id fixed up my little place in arizona and she said she could just see it and it sounded wonderful we went from that to talking about the yard here and hell it had all kinds of possibilities so i gave her a few suggestions and she was tickled pink thats marvelous carl will you come over and help me some time some weekend perhaps if i pay you no maam i said not if you pay me oh but really id enjoy doing it i like to see things looking nice i started to do a little work on the winroy place theres quite a few things you know that need i do know yes indeed but i havent felt like it was appreciated more like i might be butting in so i fixed the gate and let the other things slide those people ill bet they never even said thank you did they i shook my head for that matter i guess i wanted to do the work more on my own account than theirs the gate was the worst off but those front steps have me worried too someone could get killed on those steps it was true they were in lousy shape and someone could get killed on them without any help but i felt ashamed of myself for mentioning it it was just that i always had to keep pointing so hard at one thing that everything coming out of me everything i said or did pointed at the one thing also well i said speaking of work i think its time i was getting busy on those dinner dishes wed been sitting on the back steps while we talked i stood up and held out my hand to her she took it and drew me back down on the steps carl yes maam i said i i wish i could tell you how much i she laughed sort of crankily as though she was scolding herself oh just listen to me i guess ive gotten like bill completely out of the habit of handing out bouquets but you know what i mean carl i hope i do i said i mean i enjoy being with you and the sheriff so much i hope you we do carl weve never had any children no one but ourselves to think about perhaps thats been the well no matter what cant be cured must be endured but ive thought i seem to have had you on my mind ever since last sunday and ive thought that if things had been different if wed had a son hed have been just about your age now hhe hed be like if he was like ive always pictured him hed be like you someone who was polite and helpful and didnt think i was the worlds biggest bore and i couldnt say anything i didnt trust my voice me her son me and why couldnt it have been that way instead of the way it was she was talking again she was saying that shed been so angry at the way bill acted last sunday it was all right i said he has to be pretty careful in the job hes got careful fiddlesticks she snapped it was not all right i was never so angry in my life i gave that man fits carl i told him bill summers if youre going to be swayed by those fields someone who is obviously malicious and petty instead of believing the evidence of your own eyes and ears im the fields i turned and looked at her what fields the only fields i know are dead im talking about their son him and his family the relatives she lived with when she went back to iowa bill wired them you know at the time he wired no i said i didnt know and maybe youd better not tell me about it mrs summers as long as the sheriff didnt i dont think you should she hesitated then she said softly you mean that dont you carl i mean it i said im glad i knew youd feel that way but he knows that i planned to tell you and he doesnt object at all the whole thing was so completely ridiculous in the first place even if he couldnt see the kind of young man you were at a glance he had those wonderful wires about you from that judge and the chief of police and i dont understand i said i dont know why this son would say anything against me i couldnt have thought any more of a mother and father than i did of them why mrs fields wrote me right up to the time she died and i imagine that was a large part of the troublejealousy and you know how kinfolk can be when it comes to elderly people no matter what you do how much you do theyre always convinced that youve abused the old folks imposed on them or swindled them or worse but i i just dont see how honestly carl without ever having met you i knew it was preposterous they sent a fivehundredword telegram back here and it was simply filled with the worst possible and of course bill didnt just swallow it whole but he didnt feel that he could disregard it completely so oh i suppose i shouldnt even have mentioned it but it was so unfair carl it made me so angry that maybe youd better tell me about it i said if you dont mind she told me about it i listened sore at first and then just sick and i got sicker and sicker they this fields character had said that id stolen his mother and father blind all the time i was working for them and then id gypped her out of the station paid her about half what the place was worth he said id just moved in on his folks and taken over and theyd been too scared of me to complain he said he hinted that id actually killed mr fields that id made him do all the hard heavy work until he keeled over from heart failure he said id planned to do the same thing to the old lady but shed taken what i offered her so id let her go completely broken in health he said everything every lousy thing that a smalltime stinker could think of to say it was a lie of course every word of it id worked for those people for peanuts and id have stolen from myself quicker than i would have from them id paid mrs fields more than anyone else had offered when she put the place up for sale id even done a big part of the housework for mrs fields id made mr fields stay in bed and id waited on him and done the other work besides hed hardly been out of bed for a year at the time he died and shed hardly stirred a hand and and this character said things like that about me it made me sick these people those two people id cared more about than anything in the world and and this was the way it turned out mrs summers touched my arm dont feel badly carl i know you were just as good and kind to those people as you could be and what he says doesnt change the facts i know i said i i told her how much id thought of the fields and how id tried to show it and she sat nodding sympathetically murmuring an occasional of course and why certainly you did and so on and pretty soon it seemed like i wasnt talking to her by myself i was arguing with myself because i knew what id done but i wasnt sure why i had done it id thought i was but now i didnt know he was lying of course the way hed put things had been a lie but a lie and a truth arent too far apart you have to start with one to arrive at the other and the two have a way of overlapping you could say i had moved in on the fields they hadnt really needed any help and if theyd been younger and less goodhearted they probably wouldnt have given me a job you could say that i had made them work hard two people could get by fine on the little business their station was doing but three couldnt and id saved them all the work i could but still theyd had to work harder than they had before i came you could say that i had stolen from them just being there was stealing you could say i had cheated mrs fields on the price because all i had id got from them and the place was worth a lot more to me than it would have been to an outsider you could say you could say that id planned it the way it had turned out maybe without knowing that i was planning it i couldnt be sure that i hadnt all i could be sure of was that id been fighting for my life and fd found the perfect spot the one place to take cover id had to have what they had in a way it had been me or them those six years id spent with them maybe they were like all the other yearsjust crap nothing to feel kind of proud of or good about carl please carl im all right i said youre sick i can see it now youre coming right into the house with me and im going to fix you a cup of coffee and youre going to lie down on the lounge until i think id better go home i said i stood up and she stood up with me and she looked almost as sick as i probably did oh i wish i hadnt told you carl i might have known how upset youd be no its i just think id better be going i said let me call bill he can drive you no id rather you didnt i said i i want to walk around a little first she argued about it looking and sounding like she might burst out crying any second but finally she walked to the gate with me and i got away i walked toward the house the winroys my eyes stinging behind the contact lenses and it didnt seem sunny or pleasant any more i could hear ruthie out in the kitchen no one else seemed to be around i went out there reached the whiskey out of the cupboard and took a long drink out of the bottle i put it back in the cupboard and turned around ruthie was staring at me shed taken her hands out of the dishwater and was starting to reach for a towel but somehow she never made it she stared at me and her face twisted as though a knife had been twisted in her and she took a swing and a step on the cruch then her arms were around me and she was pressing me to her ccarl oh darling whats the nothing i said just a little sick at my stomach i grinned and pulled away from her i gave her a little spank on the thigh and i started to say i did say wheres but i didnt get a chance to finish the sentence i heard fay coming up the front steps that firm imreallysomething walk of hers and by the time she got the front door open i was in the hallway i winked and jerked my head over my shoulder just borrowed a drink of your whiskey mrs winroy had a sudden attack of stomach sickness its perfectly all right carl she gave me back the wink sick at your stomach huh well thats what you get for eating with cops thats it i laughed thanks for the whiskey not at all she said i started up the stairs about halfway up i suddenly turned around i wasnt quite sick enough to catch her at it she was already entering the dining room but i knew shed been looking at me and when i got to my room i found out why the back of my coat the two white soapsuds prints of ruthies hands fay was an actress the man had been right about that i didnt know how much shed been acting up until how but she could have been doing it all the time she was good what i mean a whole week had passed since shed seen those handprints and if i hadnt known that she had seen them id never have guessed that there was anything wrong shed come up to my room that night that sunday and wed kicked the gong around for almost an hour and shed never let on wed been together again on wednesday and i mean together and there still wasnt any indication that she knew shed never done or said anything to show that she was hellhot sore she was waiting she was going to let it all slide convince me that she hadnt seen anything before she made her move she waited a whole week until the next sunday night and that week id thought that school couldnt be any worse than itd been that friday but it was maybe it just seemed worse because there was so much more of it and so much less of me that wire mrs summers had told me about this trouble with fay ruthie kendall jake jake was at the house for almost every meal a couple of mornings he even ate breakfast with kendall and me he was still hitting the jug pretty hard but he didnt seem to sag so much he seemed to be getting bigger and i was getting littler every day there was a little bit less of me i said he was hitting the bottle pretty hard but he wasnt even in it with me i had to nail down my breakfast every morning with a few drinks before i could go to school and i had to have more in the afternoon before i could get to work and at night thursday night i took a bottle up to my room with me and i got half cockeyed i got a notion in my head to go over and wake kendall up and tell him i was too sick to go on id tell him i wanted to take him up on that business of going to canada in his car and i knew hed argue a little but not much because if a guy was that far gone there wasnt much use in trying to use him so hed let me do it and id go there and in a few days someone from the man would show up and but i couldnt get that drunk it would have been too easy and there was still a little hope left in me i had to go on waiting and hoping losing more of the little that was left of myself it didnt seem possible that id slipped so far that so much had gone wrong in such a short length of time i guess id been walking on the edge of a cliff for a longtime and it didnt take a very big breeze to start me sliding it was almost a relief to slide well i got through the week sunday came again and i kind of wanted to go to church and see mrs summers again but i couldnt bring myself to do it i got to thinking why about her why i wanted to please her and make her face light up and all i could think of was that i might be trying to pull something on her like i had on mrs fields i spent almost the whole day at the bakery not just my shift but the day i was actually there longer than kendall was and you had to go some to beat him finally though it was ten oclock and i hadnt done anything but loaf for a couple of hours so when he suggested knocking off i didnt have any excuse for staying i showered and changed clothes we walked home together he said i was doing fine ive been able to turn in a very good report on you mr bigelow he said swell i said studies going satisfactorily nothing i can help you with after all we mustnt lose sight of the fact that your job is only a means to an end if it interferes with your school the reason for your being here why i understand i said we said good night and i turned in i woke up a couple of hours later when fay crawled into bed with me shed taken off her nightgown and she snuggled up close to me warm and soft and sweetsmelling a little moonlight sifted past the edge of the window shades it fell across the pillows and i could see into her eyes and they didnt tell me a thing as they should have and because they didnt they told me a lot i knew she was ready to spring it carl she said i ive got something to tell you well its about jake hhe hes going to go back to jail until after the trial my guts sank into my stomach like a fist then a little laugh came out of me and i said youre kidding she rolled her head on the pillows its the truth honey if hes telling me the truth is it is it bad bad i said is it bad i dont mean hes going right away honey tonights the first time hes mentioned it and the way he hates jail itll probably take him a week to work himself up but i said what why is he doing it gosh i just dont know honey you told me he couldnt take jail you told me hed never go back he knew it wouldnt change a damned thing you told me that too honey remember she squirmed lazily against the sheets scratch my back will you baby you know down low there i didnt scratch it if id got a grip on her hide right then id have pulled it off of her fay i said look at me mmmm she tilted her head and looked like this carl jakes been getting his nerve back hes in a lot better shape than he was when i came here why this sudden notion to go back to jail i told you honey i dont know it doesnt make sense you think he means it im pretty sure he means it once he gets an idea in his head like he did about you you know he never lets go i see i said is it ba we can do it now cant we carl lets kill him now and get it over with the quicker its done the sooner we can be together i know youd probably rather go on like this as long as you can but why i said why do you think id rather well you would wouldnt you youre having a good time you and your dear sweet little ttrashy little i said what the hell are you talking about never mind the point is im not going to go on like this any longer even if you do want to she wouldnt come all the way out with what was eating on her and anyway i already knew it would only lead to a brawl and things were bad enough as they were ill tell you why id rather wait i said i was told to and the guy who told me wasnt talking to exercise his lungs wwhat do her eyes shifted nervously i dont see what difference it makes if i told you i spelled it out for you well it doesnt make any difference i dont care what anyone says we can do it now just as well as not all right it doesnt make any difference i said you said it doesnt so that settles that she looked at me sullenly i reached across her to the reading stand and got a cigarette lighted i let the match burn until the flame was almost to my finger tips then i dropped it squarely between her breasts oooof she slapped and brushed at the match stifling the instinctive scream into a gasp yyou she whispered wwhy did you thats the way acid feels i said just a little like that i imagine theyd start there and work up bbut i i havent youre in with me if i get it you get it only youd be a lot more interesting to work on that was wrong to throw that kind of scare into her i shouldnt make her think she had nothing to lose by pulling a doublecross but well you see for all i knew she was already pulling one or on the point of doing it and if i could make her see what it would cost her youre sure about it i said you didnt misunderstand him fay if you did youd better tell me i i she hesitated wwell maybe i no lies if thats the way it is ive got to know her head moved shakily tthats the way it is i see i said i ill talk to him carl ill rnmake him hell listen to me ill try to make him change his mind you talk him into it i said then you try to talk him out of it huhuh baby youre not that good bbut i what makes you think i dont kid me i said how was it supposed to be anyway jakes a nice boy so they give him plenty of privileges in the jug huh hell be safe and you can go right on seeing each other and he wont be missing a thing is that it she bit her lip mmaybe he doesnt mean it carl maybe he knows i didnt intend to maybe i nodded maybe a couple of times but like you said hes got the idea and he doesnt let go of his ideas bbut if oh carl honey wwhat will they nothing i said and i lay down again and pulled her into my arms ill straighten it out we should have waited but as long as we cant youre sure itll be all right youre sure carl im sure i lied ill fix it up after alljake could have got the idea by himself they wont know that he didnt she sighed and relaxed a little i kept on soothing her telling her it would be all right and after a while i got rid of her she slipped back to her room i uncorked a pint i had and sat on the edge of the bed drinking it was around daylight when i went to sleep i called the man from a booth in that quiet little bar id found he answered right away and the first thing he asked me was where i was calling from he said that was good splendid when i told him and dammit it was it was as good as i could do so many drunks phone from bars that no one pays any attention to the calls but i knew he didnt think it was good he didnt think i should be calling him at all he told me hed call me back i hung up and had a couple of drinks while he went to another phone all right charlie his voice came over the wire again whats on your mind our that merchandise i said it looks like it was going off the market well have to act fast to get it i dont understand he said youd better speak plainly i hardly think that our conversation can be completely camouflaged and comprehensible at the same time all right i said jakes talking about going to jail until after the trial im not sure whether he means it or not but i thought id better not take any chances you want to do it now then soon well i hesitated i cant do it after hes in jail that isnt what we agreed on charlie i know i said but i you said hed been talking about it to whom to mrs winroy i see and does she still have your fullest confidence charlie youll recall i believe that i had some few small doubts about her myself i think shes telling the truth i said why does she say jakes going to jail she doesnt say jake didnt tell her strange he paused i find that slightly puzzling look i said i know it doesnt seem right but jakes halfway off his rocker hes running around in circles a moment please am i wrong or wasnt it mrs winroys job to keepjake available you were very sure she could do that werent you and now the opposite has happened yes sir i said why charlie i dont know i said i dont know whether hes really going to do it he was silent for a long time id about decided hed hung up then he laughed softly and said you do whatever you think is necessary charlie as soon as you think its necessary i know how you feel i said i havent been here very long and i know it would look better if i could have waited yes and theres the matter of publicity having the story kept alive for weeks or perhaps youve forgotten that in the press of your other affairs look i said is it all right or not i want to know he didnt answer me that time he had hung up i picked up my books off the bar and went on to school cursing fay but not putting much heart into it it was my fault for bringing her into the deal the man hadnt wanted her in if she hadnt been in andjake had got this jail idea on his own i wouldnt have been held responsible as it was well a lot depended on how things worked out if it all went off all right theyd go easy on me no money of course or if i had the guts and was stupid enough to ask for money a few bills and a beating theyd leave me here that would be my payoff id be left here to rot with no dough but the little i had and no way i could get any more just barely scraping by on some cheap job as long as i could hold a job and then the man would get a kick out of that hell the hell he knew you didnt have to dig for it too and if the job didnt go right it didnt make much difference i couldnt win it was sunday when fay had given me the bad news we set jake up for thursday night so there were four days there between the first thing and the second four whole days but it didnt seem that long it seemed like id walked out of the bar after id talked to the man and stepped straight into thursday night i was through washed up i wasnt living i was just going through the motions living is remembering i guess if youve lost interest if everything is that same shade of gray the kind you see when you look into light with your eyes closed if nothing seems worth storing away either as bad or good reward or retribution then you may keep going for a while but you dont live and you dont remember i went to school i worked i ate and slept and drank and yes and ruthie i talked to her a few times on the way to and from school i remembered yes i did remember her i remember wondering what would become of her wishing i could help her some way but aside from ruthie nothing except for the few minutes i was with her i moved straight from monday into thursday thursday night at eight oclock i snapped out of it then and came back to life you have to at a time like that whether you want to or not it was a slow night on the job one of the slowest in the week i was all caught up on my work and no one had any reason to come into the stockroom i stood in the outer storeroom with the light turned off watching the other side of the street fay went by right on the dot at eight i studied my watch waiting at eightfifteen jake went by i unlocked the door and stepped out it was a good dark night he was moving in a beeline for the house not looking to right or left i sauntered down the side of the street the bakery was on until hed passed the intersection then i crossed over and followed him walking faster because hed got quite a way ahead of me i was about fifty feet behind him when he started across the parallel street to the house just about the right distance allowing for the time he needed to open the gate he fumbled with it unable to find the catch and i slowed down to where i was barely moving at last he got it open and i i froze in my tracks he this guy was a drunk i found out later hed come out of that little bar catercornered to the house and wandered across the road and i dont know how the hell hed managed it but somehow hed fallen over inside the fence he was lying there whenjake came along inside and up against the fence as jake opened the gate he rose up and sort of staggered toward him and jake let out a yell and that front yard was suddenly as bright as day two big floodlights struck it from the vacant lots on each side of the house cops deputy sheriffs rather swarmed up from everywhere i stood frozen for a second unable to move then i turned around and started walking back to the bakery id gotten almost to the corner when i heard a yell from the sheriff rising above the other yells wait a minute dang it this aint the right i kept right on going and i was crossing the street to the bakery before the shout came you there halt i didnt halt what the hell he was almost two blocks away how should i know he was hollering at me i went right on into the bakery locking the door behind me i went into the main stockroom closed the connecting door and sat down at my work table i picked up the batch cards for the night and began checking them off against my perpetual inventory someone was banging on that outside door i stayed where i was what the hell again i couldnt let anyone in that door this time of night why it might be a robber someone trying to steal a sack of flour the banging stopped i grinned to myself flipping through the cards i was alive again id have laid down for them but since i couldnt do that id make them lay me the door to the baking room slammed open kendall and the sheriff and a deputy came in the sheriff in the lead i stood up i went toward him holding out my hand why how are you sheriff i said how is mrs sum he swung his hand knocking mine aside so hard that it almost spun me around his fingers knotted in my shirt and he yanked me clean off the floor he shook me like a dog shakes a rat if ever i saw murder in a mug it was his you snotty little punk he shook and swung me with one hand and began slapping me with the other think youre cute huh think its smart to go around so danged nice an loveydovey gettin people to trust you and then i didnt blame him for being sore i guess no one can ever be as sore at you as the guy whos liked and trusted you but that hand of his was a hard as a rock and kendall couldnt get past the deputy to stop him like he was trying to do i passed out i wasnt out very long i guess but it was long enough for dr dodson to get there i came to stretched out on the floor with my head on some flour sacking and the doc bent over me how are you feeling son he said any pain of course hes in pain kendall snapped this this creature beat him within an inch of his life now wait a minute dang it i didnt shut up summers how about it son i i feel all right i said just kind of dizzy and i coughed and began to choke he raised my shoulders quickly and i bent over choking and coughing and blood spilled down on the floor in a little pool he took the handkerchief out of his breast pocket and wiped my mouth with it he lowered me back to the floor again and stood up staring at the sheriff the sheriff looked back at him sullen and sheepish kinda lost my temper he mumbled reckon you wouldve too doc if youd been in my place he was all set tdo winroy in just like the note said hed be and then this danged drunk gets in the way an he comes saunterin back here just as pretty as you please and you know the doctor cut in quietly you know something summers if i had a gun i think id blow that fat head of yours right off your shoulders the sheriffs mouth dropped open he looked stunned and sort of sick now now looky here he stammered this you dont know who this fella is hes charlie bigger little bigger they call him hes a killer an he is eh but you took care of him didnt you you want to know what happened or not sheriff summers face turned a few shades redder he ill tell you what happened kendall spoke up coldly carl stepped out for a little walk as he has my permission to do when his work is caught up in fact ive encouraged him to do it since his illness he was in the vicinity of the winroy house when this ruckus broke out and having something better to do with his time than gawk and gape at matters which did not concern him the heck they didnt concern him how come the note said he he came back here said kendall a few minutes later summers came storming into the bakery with this uh hireling and started babbling some nonsense about carls having tried to murder someone and failing to stop when he was ordered to then he rushed in here and attacked him beat him into unconsciousness ive never seen such savagely inexcusable brutality in my life dod i see the doctor nodded and turned to the sheriff well sheriff summers lips came together in a thin hard line never mind he grunted you want it that way you have it that way im takin him to jail on what charge taking a walk attempted murder thats what and what are your grounds for such a charge i already told the sheriff broke off his head lowered like a mad bull never you mind im takin him in he started toward me the deputy hanging back like he was pretty unhappy and kendall and the doc stepped in his way in about another ten seconds i think hed have had a knockdown dragout fight on his hands and there wasnt any sense in that so i got up i felt all right everything consideredjust a little smaller and weaker than i had felt ill go i said we can settle it you dont need to go the doctor said and kendall added no he certainly does not need to id rather go i said sheriff summers and his wife have been very nice to me im sure he wouldnt be doing this if he didnt think it was necessary there was some more argument from dodson and kendall but i went we all went we got to the courthouse just as the county attorney was going up the steps and the deputy took us into the cas office while he and the sheriff stood in the corridor talking the sheriff had his back to the door but the county attorney was facing it and he looked weary and disgusted all the time the sheriff was talking he just stood there with his hands shoved into his pockets frowning and shaking his head finally they came inside and he and the sheriff started to ask a question at the same time they both stopped one waiting for the other then they started again both at once they did that about three times and the doctor let out a snort and kendall sort of half smiled the county attorney grimaced and leaned back in his chair all right bill he sighed its your headache anyway sheriff summers turned to me whats your name your right name you know what it is sheriff i said its charlie bigger aint it youre little charlie bigger suppose i said yes i said then what id like to accommodate you sheriff but i dont see how that would help i asked you what your he broke off as the county attorney caught his eyes all right he grunted what was you doin sneaking along behind jake winroy tonight i wasnt sneaking anywhere i was walking you always go for a walk at that time onight not always often its a slack time for me how come you was walkin toward the winroy place instead of the other way these work clothes naturally i wouldnt want to walk up toward the business district i got a note about you it had you right down to at said you was gonna do just what you what you tried to do what was that i said you know what kill jake winroy kill him i said why i didnt try to kill him sheriff you would have if that danged drunk dr dodson let out another snort anonymous notes what next he was there wasnt he the sheriff whirled on him how come i got that note if i believe it has been established the county attorney sighed that he is in that vicinity almost every night at approximately that time but winroy aint it aint been established how i kendall cleared his throat since you seem to be unwilling to accept the note as the work of some crank who has observed mr bigelows movements and who profited by an unfortunate but by no means extraordinary coincidence its too danged extraordinary for me as i was saying then the note can only be explained in one way this shrewd and crafty killer he smiled apologetically at me the most elusive closemouthed criminal in the country went around town confiding his plans something wrong sheriff i didnt say he done that i i i see its your theory then that he wrote you or i believe it was printed wasnt it he sent you the note himself so that youd be on hand to apprehend him doc dodson burst out laughing the county attorney tried not to laugh but he couldnt quite hold it back well he said bringing his hands down on the desk bill i think the best thing we can do is now wait a minute he could have had someone workin with him they couldve given him away oh come now kendall shook his head hes a stranger here i live with him and work with him and i can assure you he has no intimates aside from me but perhaps thats what you had in mind sheriff you think i was involved in this matter i didnt say so did i the sheriff glared at him helplessly i anyway that aint all i got on him i got a wire from the kin of some folks he used to live with they said he swindled and abused these old people and i believe you got two other wires about me also i said from a chief of police and a county judge what did they say about me i well whyd you run away tonight i didnt do any running sheriff why didnt you stop when i hollered you heard me i heard someone but they were a couple of blocks away i didnt know they were hollering at me well uh why he paused trying to think of something else to ask me he wet his lips hesitating he slanted a glance at kendall and dodson and the county attorney and in his minds eye i guess he was also looking at his wife wondering how he was going to explain and excuse himself to her the county attorney yawned and massaged his eyes well he said i suppose well have an army of city cops moving in on us now ordering us around and telling us how to run our business like they did last time now i i the sheriff gulped i dont reckon we will my boys aint letting out anything hed probably like that said dr dodson likes to get his picture in the papers if i didnt think youd suffer enough without it id file a complaint against you with the county commissioners you will hey the sheriff jumped to his feet hop right to it go ahead and see if i give a dang well see dodson nodded grimly meanwhile im going to take this boy to my clinic and put him to bed you are huh he aint going anywhere very well he needs rest and medical attention ive said so these gentlemen are my witnesses and ill tell you something summers he slammed on his hat dont betoo surprised if you find them testifying against you on a charge of murder by criminal neglect pshaw the sheriffs eyes wavered how come he gets around like hes been doin if hes so sick you cant tell me i could but i doubt that youd understand coming phil well i went to the clinic the doctor checked me over from head to foot shaking his head and grunting now and then in a kind of baffled way then he gave me a shot glass of some yellowish stuff and three hypodermic injections one in each hip and the other right over my heart and i went to sleep but sheriff summers still hadnt given up he posted a deputy on my door at the clinic that night and the next morning around eleven he came in and threw some more questions at me he didnt look like hed got much sleep id have bet dough that mrs summers had eaten him out to a fareyouwell he was still at it going through the motions of playing cop when kendall showed up kendall spoke to him pleasantly he suggested that they take a little walk and they left together i grinned and lighted a cigarette kendall was starting to earn his money if he hadnt already earned it it was the first real chance hed had to get the sheriff alone the next thing hed do now the rest and the stuff the doctor had given me seemed to have perked me up quite a bit and i guess a guy always fights best just before hes through fighting i didnt think i could beat the man no one ever beat the man but i figured i could give him plenty of trouble it might be a year or two before he could hunt me down and if i could hold out that long well maybe i could find the place or the thing or whatever it was id always been looking for i had almost five hundred dollars more in the bank in arizona but i might as well forget about that with five hundred bucks and a good car and there was a drop in philly where i could turn that car fast for another one well it was worth a try i couldnt lose anything it was almost two oclock when kendall came back and was sure of what he was going to say but he led into it so gradually that i almost got unsure mrs winroy had gone to new york he said her sister had taken sick and shed had to leave suddenly poor woman ive never seen her quite so agitated thats too bad i said wanting to laugh so bad it hurt me shed probably worry herself to death before they could get to her when is she coming back she wasnt able to say i gathered however that it might be quite some time well i said thats certainly too bad yes particularly with nothing better than winroy to depend on i wanted to talk to him straighten out our accounts since mrs winroy isnt available but ruthie hasnt seen anything of him since lunchtime and hes not at his shop i suppose now that the last restraining influence is gone he intends to get drunk and stay drunk i nodded and waited he went on an awkward situation poor ruthie its really a tragedy in her case theres no other place she can get a job and with mrs winroy gone indefinitely she cant stay there id like to help her but uh a man my age giving financial assistance to a girl who obviously could not repay it im afraid it would do her more harm than good shes dropping out of school im afraid theres no alternative she seems to be bearing up very well im happy to say well i said it looks like we like youll have to be finding another place to live uh yes yes i suppose i will uh er incidentally mr bigelow the sheriff is satisfied to uh abandon this winroy matter ive brought your clothes from the bakery your pay to date also since it seemed doubtful in view of your health and uh the situation in general that you would care to continue there i see i said i understand about sheriff summers mr bigelow his attitude is by no means as compromising as i would like to have it i suspect that he would need only the slightest pretext if any to uh cause you serious embarrassment i thought it over rather i appeared to be thinking it over i laughed kind of hurt and said it looks like im out of luck all the way around mr kendall no place to live no job the sheriff all set to make trouble the i dont suppose the college will be exactly happy to have me around either well uh as a matter of fact its all right i said i dont blame them a bit he shook his head sympathetically clucking his tongue a few times then he looked up sharply eyes sparkling and came out with it as though it had just then popped into his mind mr bigelow this may turn out to be a stroke of good fortune in disguise you can go up to my place in canada for a few months use the time for studying and rebuilding your health then when all this business is forgotten gosh i said you mean youd still be willing to certainly i would now most of all of course well have to see what the doctor has to say about you but the doctor didnt like it much he fussed quite a bit particularly when he found out that i wanted to leave town that day but kendall fussed right back calling him a pessimist and so on then he took him to one side explaining i guess that i didnt have much choice about leaving so we drove to the house in kendalls car me driving since he didnt like to he asked me if id mind driving ruthie to her folks farm on my way and i said i wouldnt mind at all i stopped in front of the house and we stood at the side of the car for a few minutes talking but not getting much said by the way mr bigelow he said hesitantly i know ive seemed inexcusably dictatorial during our all too brief acquaintance im sure there must have been a great many times when you must have felt like telling me to mind my own business oh no i said not at all mr kendall oh yes he smiled at me and im afraid my reasons were extremely selfish ones do you believe in immortality mr bigelow in the broadest sense of the word that is well let me simply say then that i seem to have done almost none of the many things which i had planned on doing in this tearful vale they are still there in me waiting to be done yet the span of time for their doing has been exhausted i but listen to me will you he chuckled embarrassedly his eyes blinking behind their glasses i didnt think myself capable of such absurd poeticism thats all right i said slowly and a kind of chill crept over me what do you mean your span i was looking straight into him through him and out the other side and all i could see was a prim fussy old guy that was all i could see because that was all there was to see he wasnt working for the man he never had been so little time mr bigelow none to waste on preliminaries everything that could be done for you had to be done quickly why didnt you tell me i said for christs sake why tsk tsk mr bigelow fret you with the irremediable place yet another boulder in your already rocky path there is nothing to be done about it i am dying and that is that but i if youd only told me i only tell you now because it is unavoidable as i have indicated in the past i am not exactly a pauper i wanted you to be in a position to understand when you heard from my attorneys i couldnt say anything i couldnt even see the way my eyes were stinging and burning then he grabbed my hand and shook it and his grip almost made me holler dignity mr bigelow i insist on it if you must be mawkish at least wait until i i he let go of me and when my eyes cleared he was gone i opened the gate to the yard wondering how i could have been so wrong but there really wasnt much to wonder about id picked him because i didnt want to pick the logical person the person who could do everything he could and who had a lot better reason for doing it ruthie i wasnt particularly quiet going into the house so i guess she heard me even if she didnt let on the drapes to the living room were pulled back and her bedroom door was open and i stood watching her braced against the end of the bedstead as she pulled on her clothes i looked her over a little at a time as though she wasnt one thing but many as though she wasnt one woman but a thousand all women and then my eyes settled on that little foot with its little ankle and everything else seemed to disappear and i thought well how could i how can you admit youre screwing yourself she put on her brassiere and her slip before she took notice of me she let out a gasp and said oh ccarl i didnt about ready i said ill drive you out to your folks ccarl i i she came toward me slowly rocking on her crutch i want to go with you carl i dont care what youve i dont care about anything just so i can be with you yeah i said i know you were always afraid id go away werent you you were willing to do anything you could to keep me here help me with the school sleep with me be johnnyonthespot if i needed you for anything and you couldnt leave either could you ruthie you couldnt lose your job take me carl youve got to take me with you i wasnt sure yet so i said well go on and get ready well see then i went upstairs to my room i packed my two suitcases i turned back a corner of the carpet and picked up a carbon copy of the note id sent to the sheriff for naturally i had sent the note id meant to tell ruthie about the carbon afterwards so that she could take credit for the tip and claim the rewards i hadnt had anything to lose as i saw it i couldnt help myself so id tried to help her the person who might wind up as i had if she didnt have help i hesitated a moment turning the slip of paper around in my fingers but it was no good now theyd muffed their chance to catch me in the act of attempting to kill jake winroy and i figured there was at least one damned good reason why theyd never get another one i figured that way but i wanted to make sure i burned the carbon in an ashtray and crossed the hall tojakes room i stood at the side of his bed looking down at him and the note ruthie had written it was stupid no one would believe that jake had tried to attack her and shed done it in selfdefense but well i could understand the whole setup had been falling apart ruthie had to do it fast if at all and i guess if a person is willing to do a thing like that then hes stupid to begin with and its bound to crop out on him sooner or later it was all wrong the man wouldnt like it and getting me for him wouldnt help her any she had to latch onto me now of course and you get stupider and stupider the farther you go but excuses didnt cut any ice with the man he picked you because you were stupid he made you stupid you might say but if you slipped up you did it and you got what the man gave people who slipped it was done though and me i was done too so nothing mattered now but to let her go on hoping as long as she could hope i took one last look at jake before i left the room ruthie had almost sawed his throat out with one of his own razors scared you know and scared not to angry because she was scared it looked a lot like the job id done on fruit jar id never seen the place just the road that led up to it and id only seen that the one time years before when that writer had driven me by on the way to the train but i didnt have any trouble finding it again the road was grown high with weeds and in some places long vines had spread across it from the barebranched trees on either side the road sloped up from the vermont highway then down again so that unless you were right there right on top of them you couldnt see the house and the farm buildings ruth looked at me pretty puzzled a time or two but she didnt ask any questions i ran the car into the garage and closed the doors and we walked back toward the house there was a sign fastened to the gate it said beware of wild goats the way of the trespasser is hard and there was a typewritten notice tacked to the back door departed for parts unknown will supply forwarding address if when and as soon as possible the door was unlocked we went in i looked all through the house by myself mostly because the stairs were steep and narrow and ruthie couldnt have got around so good i went through room after room and he wasnt there of course no one was there and everything was covered with dust but everything was in order all the rooms were in order but one a little tiny one way off by itself on the second floor and except for the way the typewriter was ripped apart even that one had a kind of order about it the furniture was all pushed back against the wall and there was nothing in the bookcases but the covers of books the pages of them and god knows how many other pages typewritten ones that hadnt been made into books had been torn up like confetti and the confetti was stacked in little piles all over the floor arranged into letters and words and the lord world so loved the god that it gave him its only begotten son and thenceforth he was driven from the garden and judas wept saying verily i abominate onions yet i can never refuse them i kicked the piles of paper apart and went downstairs we moved in and stayed there was case after case of canned goods in the cellar there was a drum of coal oil for the lamps and the two stoves there was a water well with an inside pump at the sink there wasnt any electricity or telephone or radio or anything like that we were shut off from everything as though we were in another world but we had everything else and ourselves so we stayed the days drifted by and i wondered what she was waiting for and there was nothing to do except what could be done with ourselves and i seemed to be shrinking more and more getting weaker and littler while she got stronger and bigger and i began to think maybe she was going to do it that way some nights afterwards when i wasnt too weak and sick to do it id stand at the window staring out at the fields with their jungle of weeds and vines the wind rippled through them making them sway and wiggle and squirm and there was a howling and a shrieking in my ears but after while it went away everywhere everywhere i looked the jungle swayed and wiggled and squirmed it shook that thing at me there was something sort of hypnotic about it and id still be weak and sick but i wouldnt notice it there wouldnt be a thing in my mind but that thing and id wake her up again and then it was like i was running a race i was trying to get to something get something before the howling came back because when i heard that i had to stop but all i ever got was that thing not the other whatever the other was the goats always won the days drifted by and she knew that i knew of course but we never talked about it we never talked about anything much because we were cut off from everything and after a while everything was said that we could say and it would have been like talking to yourself so we talked less and less and pretty soon we were hardly talking at all and then we werent talking at all just grunting and gesturing and pointing at things it was like wed never known how to talk it began to get pretty cold so we shut off all the upstairs rooms and stayed downstairs and it got colder and we shut off all the rooms but the living room and the kitchen and it got colder and we shut off all the rooms but the kitchen we lived there never more than a few feet away from each other it was always right close by that thing was and outside it was out there too it seemed to edge in closer and closer from all sides and there was no way to get away from it and i didnt want to get away i kept getting weaker and littler but i couldnt stop there was nothing else to think about so i kept taking that thing id go for it fast trying to win the race against the goats and i never did but i kept on trying i had to afterwards when the howling began to get so bad i couldnt stand it id go outside looking for the goats id go running and screaming and clawing my way through the fields wanting to get my hands on just one of them and i never did of course because the fields werent really the place to find the goats i couldnt eat much of anything the basement was loaded with food and whiskey but i had a hard time getting any down id eaten less and less ever since that first day when id raised up the trap door that was set flush with the kitchen floor and gone down the steep narrow steps id gone down them taking a lantern with me and id looked all along the shelves packed tight with bottles and packages and canned goods id circled around the room looking and i came to a sort of setback in the walls a doorless closet kind of and the entrance to it was blocked off stacked almost to the ceiling with empty bottles i wondered why in hell theyd been dumped there instead of outside because it would be stupid of a guy to drink the stuff upstairs where he naturally would drink it and then bring the bottles back down here as long as he was up there why hadnt he i said we never talked but we did we talked all the time to the goats i talked to them while she slept and she talked to them while i slept or maybe it was the other way around anyway i did my share of talking i said we lived in the one room but we didnt we lived in all the rooms but they were all the same and wherever we were the goats were always there i couldnt ever catch them but i knew they were there theyd come up out of the fields and moved in with us and sometimes id almost get my hands on them but they always got away shed get in my way before i could grab them i thought and i thought about it and finally i knew how it must be theyd been there all along right there hiding inside of her so it wasnt any wonder i could never win the race i knew they were in her where else could they be but i had to make sure and i couldnt i couldnt touch her she didnt sleep with me any more she ate a lot enough for two people and sometimes in the morning she vomited it was right after the vomiting started that she began walking i mean really walking not using the crutch shed tuck her dress up around her waist so that it wouldnt be in the way and walk back and forth on one knee and that little foot she got to where she could walk pretty good shed hold her good foot up behind her with one hand making a stump out of the knee it came just about even then with that little baby foot and she could get around pretty fast shed walk for an hour at a time with her dress tucked up and everything she had showing but youd never have known i was there from the way she acted she hell she talked to me she explained to me wed been talking all the time and not to the goats either because of course there werent any goats and she walked on the little foot exercising the goats and at night they sat on my chest howling i stayed in the basement as much as i could she couldnt get me down there she wasnt good enough on that little foot and knee to come down the stairs and somehow i had to hang on the last race was over and id lost them all but still i hung on i seemed to be right on the point of finding something of finding out something and until i did i couldnt leave i found out one evening when i was coming up out of the basement i came even with the floor and turned sideways on the steps putting down the stuff id brought up and id brought a pretty big load because i didnt want to come up any more often than i had to and i was kind of dizzy i leaned my arms on the floor steadying myself and then my eyes cleared and there was the little foot and leg right in front of me braced the axe flashed my hand my right hand jumped and kind of leaped away from me sliced off clean and she swung again and all my left hand was gone but the thumb she moved in closer raising the axe for another swing and so at last i knew back there back to the place id come from and hell id never been wanted there to begin with but where else my friend where a more logical retreat in this tightening circle of frustration she was swinging wild my right shoulder was hanging by a thread and the spouting forearm dangled from it and my scalp my scalp and the left side of my face was dangling and and i didnt have a nose or a chin or i went over backwards then down and down and down turning so slowly in the air it seemed that i was hardly moving i didnt know it when i hit the bottom i was simply there looking up as id been looking on the way down then there was a slam and a click and she was gone the darkness and myself everything else was gone and the little that was left of me was going faster and faster i began to crawl i crawled and rolled and inched my way along and i missed it the first time the place i was looking for i circled the room twice before i found it and there was hardly any of me then but it was enough i crawled up over the pile of bottles and went crashing down the other side and he was there of course death was there and he smelled good about the author james meyers thompson was born in anadarko oklahoma in he began writing fiction at a very
