 the mighty burke by theodore dreiser taken from mcclures magazine volume mayoctober when i first met him he was laying the foundation for a small dynamo in the engineroom of the repairshop at spike and he was most unusually loud in his prostrations and demands he had with him a dozen italians all short swarthy fellows who were busy bringing material from a car that had been pushed in on the sidetrack next to the building and was loaded with crushed stone cement old boards wheelbarrows tools and the like all of which were to be used in the labor that he was about to undertake he himself was standing in the door of the shop where the operation was to be conducted his coat off and his sleeves rolled up shouting with true irish insistence come matt come jimmie get the shovels now get the picks bring some sand here bring some stone where is the cement now where is the cement jasus christ i must have some cement what are ye all doing hurry now hurry bring the cement and then calmly gazing around as if he were the only one who had any right to stand still in this world he was medium in height thick of body and neck with short gray hair and mustache and bright clear twinkling irish gray eyes and he carried himself with such an air of unquestionable authority that you would have had to take notice of him it was much as if he had said i am the boss here and indeed he was the labor he was doing was not very intricate but it was interesting it consisted of digging a trench ten by twelve feet and shaping it up with boards into a form after which concrete was to be mixed and poured in and some iron rods set to fasten the engine to it was not so urgent but that it might have been conducted with less excitement but he was so excitable by nature and so eager to have it done with that he was constantly trotting back and forth and shouting come matt come jimmie hurry now bring the shovels and occasionally bursting forth with a perfect avalanche of orders such as up with it down with it front with it back with it in with it out with it all coupled with his favorite expletive jasus christ which was as innocent of evil as prayer at the time it seemed positively appalling to me and i thought the irish brute to think of his driving his men like that but a little later i discovered that he was not so bad as he seemed and then i began to like him the thing that brought about this change of feeling in me was the attitude of his men toward him although he was so insistent with his commands they did not seem to mind he would stand over them crying up with it up with it up with it up with it or down with it down with it down with it down with it until you would have imagined their nerves would be worn to a frazzle and yet they did not seem to care rather they appeared to take it as a matter of course as if it had to be one could not help smiling at the incongruity of it it was so farcical finally i ventured to laugh and he turned on me with a sharp and yet not unkindly retort ha ha ha he mocked if you had to work as hard as these men you wouldnt laugh i explained that i was not laughing at them but at him and he took that in good part also we fell to conversing upon railroad subjects and in this way our period of friendship began as i learned that morning burke was the foreman mason for all that part of the railroad that lay between new york and fifty miles out on three divisions he had a dozen men under him and was in possession of one car which was shunted back and forth between the places in which he happened to be working he was the builder of concrete platforms culverts coalbins sidewalks and in fact anything that could be made out of crushed stone and cement and he was sent here and there as necessity required as he explained to me at the time he sometimes arose as early as am in order to make a train that would get him to his place of labor by seven darkness or storm made no difference to him shewer i have to be there he said with his quizzical elusive irish grin theyre not payin me wages fer lyin in bed if ye were to get up that way every day fer a year it would make a man of ye and how much do you get burke i asked two and a half a day the munificence of the corporation that paid him two and a half a day for ten hours work as well as the superintendence and construction of what he was doing struck me forcibly though i was not much better situated myself at the time i was working on the road for my health at fifteen cents an hour and the sight of the foreman for whom i was working was a torture to my soul he was a loudmouthed blustering redheaded ignoramus and i wanted to get out from under him since i had influence enough to obtain a transfer to any foreman who would accept me i decided to appeal to burke will you take me and let me work for you i asked hopefully shewer he replied will i have to work with the italians therell be plenty uv work fer ye to do without ever yere layin a hand to a pick er shovel shewer thats no work fer a white man to do and what do you call them burke nagurs uv course but theyre not negroes well bedad theyre not white that any man can tell by lookin at thim i accepted this characterization of the sturdy hardworking italians without protest though it struck me as a little hard they were not the degraded creatures he seemed to take them to be and yet i felt that there was no malice in what he said it was his way and i let it pass deciding to go with him if i could and i did the day that i was transferred to his flock or gang he was at williamsbridge a little station on the harlem building a coalbin it was a pretty place surrounded by trees and a grassplot which after the long confinement of the shop seemed to me a veritable haven of rest the sun was shining brightly and burke was down in a cool hole which his men had dug under the depot platform measuring and calculating with his plumbbob and level when i looked in on him so here ye arre he said with a grin yes i laughed well yere jist in time i want ye to go down to the ahffice i replied that i was willing but before i could say more he climbed out of his hole odorous of the newturned earth that had surrounded him and fished out of the pocket of his old gray coat a soiled and crumpled letter which he carefully unfolded with his thick clumsy fingers then he held it up and looked at it defiantly i want ye to go to woodlawn he continued and look after some bolts that arre up there theres a keg uv thim and sign the bill fer thim and ship thim down to me theyre not many and then i want ye to go down to the ahffice and take thim this ok he fished around and produced another crumpled slip which i saw was an ok blank all the time he kept talking of the nonsinse of it and the onraisonableness of demanding oks for everything yed think some one was going to sthale thim from thim he declared it was plain that some infraction of the railroads rules had occurred and that he had been called down or jacked up about it as the railroad men expressed it he was in a high state of dudgeon and defiant and pugnacious as his royal irish temper would allow he flung a parting shot at his superior as i departed tell him that ill sign fer thim when i git thim and not before he declared i departed on my way knowing that no such message would be accepted and that burke would not send it if he thought for a moment that i would take it i went to woodlawn and secured the bolts after which i went down to the ahffice and reported there i found the chief clerk also in a high state of temper because burke had failed to render an ok for the bolts for a whole month and more he wanted to know what explanation he had to offer and when i suggested that he thought he could leave them in the station where they would be safe until he needed to use them he was fairly beside himself what do you think of that he exclaimed shoving his hands distractedly through his hair hell leave them there until he needs them will he burke ought to know better than that hes been long enough on the road you tell him that i said that i want a signed form for everything consigned to him the moment he learns that its waiting for him and i want it without fail he has got to come to time about this or somethings going to drop im not going to stand it any longer how does he think i am going to make out my reports i wish hed let you attend to these matters while youre there it will save an awful lot of trouble in this office and it may save him his job theres one thing sure hes got to come to time from now on or either he or ill quit and then he explained to me the differences that existed between him and the hearty irishman it seemed as i learned from him then and from burke later though never directly from the latter that the great difficulty of the irishmans life was in connection with these oks and some twentyfive monthly reports that he was compelled to make covering every detail of his work from the acknowledgment of all material received to the expenditure of even so much as one mills worth of paper they were the things on which his superior based his reports to those above him and the details of them were looked after sharply if a man could not sit down and reel off a graphic account of all that he was doing accompanied by facts and figures he was in a bad way with his superiors no matter what his mechanical skill might be whereas if his reports were clear the insufficiency of his skill might sometimes he overlooked burke was not skilled in these matters though he was an a workman and consequently his standing was not of the best particularly with the chief clerk the clerk was a dapper very selfimportant individual to whom railroad work meant figuring and he was constantly hammering away at the excitable irishman to get him to come to time as he expressed it it also seemed that at the time when i dawned upon burke he was just at the place where for some reason or another he was having a very bad spell of this several items of various kinds had gone wrong and he was being bombarded with letters bearing the most significant insults to and reflections upon his intelligence coupled with the most urgent commands which tried his temper sorely the compilation of his reports and timebooks had become a veritable nightmare and when i arrived he was not only employing all of his nights and sundays but also the services of his three daughters nevertheless and notwithstanding all this he was constantly making mistakes and as constantly being jacked up about them it was a serious matter when i returned that day i was very well aware of the situation but i did not care to take the unwelcome message back to him on the contrary i decided that it would be better to take the clerical work into my own hands to find out what was wanted in this line and to do it i knew that i could not very well work with a pick and shovel and this was about all that was left outside of that consequently when i returned i quietly explained that an ok blank was what was always wanted under such circumstances and that it was wanted at once an ok blank an ok blank he echoed contentiously he wants an ok blank does he well i expect ye might as well give it to him i think the man lives on thim things the way hes aalways caallin fer thim yed think i was a bookkeeper and foreman at the same time its somethin awful an ok blank a little while later he humorously explained that he had clane fergot thim anyhow the ensuing month was a busy one for us we had a platform to lay at morrisania a chimney to build at tarrytown a sidewalk to lay at white plains and a large cistern to dig and wall in at tuckahoe besides these there were platforms to build at van cortlandt and mount kisco watertowers at highbridge and ardsley a sidewalk and drain at caryl a culvert and an ashpit at bronx park and some forty concrete piers for a building at melrose all of which required any amount of running and figuring to say nothing of the actual work of superintending and constructing which burke personally looked after the preliminary labor of ordering and seeing that the material was duly shipped and unloaded was one mans work alone and yet burke was expected to do it all how he managed before i came i could make out only on the basis that he accomplished less and employed his whole family however he displayed himself a masterful workman he preferred to superintend to get down into the pit or up on the wall and measure and direct he would toil for hours at a stretch with his trowel and his line and his level and his plumbbob getting the work into shape and you would never hear a personal complaint from him concerning the weariness of labor on the contrary he would whistle and sing until something went wrong when suddenly you would hear the most terrific uproar of words come out of that come out of that jasus christ man have ye no sinse at all put it down put it down what arre ye doing what did i tell ye have ye no raison in ye ye hathen nagur and such like until you would have imagined that the most terrible calamity had been about to befall him this would last for a couple of minutes during which time the italians would be seen hurrying excitedly to and fro and then there would come a lull and burke would be heard to raise his voice in tuneful melody singing or humming or whistling some oldfashioned irish comeallye but the thing in burke that would have pleased anyone was his ready grasp of the actualities of life his fullfledged knowledge that work was the thing the direct accomplishment of something tangible and not the talking about it thus when he was working like this nothing that might concern the clerical end of the labor could disturb him and if the sky fell he would imperturbably make you wait until the work was done once when i interrupted him to question him concerning those wretched pestering aftermaths of labor the reports he shut me off with the reports the reports what good arre the reports what have the reports to do with the work if it wasnt for the work where would the reports be and i readily echoed where another thing was his kindly attitude toward his men that innate sense of personal relationship and fatherly feeling which in spite of all his yelling and browbeating kept them friendly to him he had a way of talking to them and of saying kindly things to them in a joking manner which touched them when he arrived in the morning it was always in the cheeriest way that he began the days work come now bys he would exclaim ye have a good days work before ye today git the shovels jimmie bring the line matt and then he would go below himself if below it was and there would be joy and peace until some obstacle to progress interfered this same matt was a funny little italian soft of voice and gentle of manner whom burke liked very much but with whom he loved to quarrel he would go down in the hole where the latter was working and almost invariably you would hear the most uproarious clatter following immediately shouts of put it here i say put it here man here here jasus christ have ye no sinse at all coupled of course with defiant replies from matt who had been with him so long that he was not in the least overawed by his yelling and could afford to take such liberties presently burke would come climbing out of the hole his face and neck fairly scarlet with heat raging and shouting ill get shut uv ye ill have no more thruck with ye ye blitherin crazy loon what good arre ye what work can ye do naathing ill have no more thruck with ye after tonight then he would dance around and threaten and growl until something else would take his attention and then he would quiet down and be as peaceful as ever sometimes he would go home without saying a word to matt who would reappear as unconcernedly in the morning as if nothing had happened once i asked him how many times have you threatened to discharge matt in the last three years burke shewer he said with his ingratiating grin a man dont mane aall he says aall the time the most humorous of all his collection of workingmen was jimmie a dark mildeyed softspoken calabrian who had the shrewdness of a machiavelli and the pertness of a crow he lived in the same neighborhood as burke he kept all his italians gathered close about him and was always the one who was selected to run his family errands for him on the job no matter what it might be jimmie could never be induced to do hard work he always had a task of some other kind on hand which he used as an excuse and as he was an expert cementmixer and knew just how to load and unload the toolcar nothing was ever said to him if anyone dared to reprove him he would reply yeh yeh i knowa my biz i been now with misha buck fifteen year i knowa my biz if you made any complaint to burke he would merely grin and say jimmies a shrewd one or perhaps ill get ye yet ye fox but more than that nothing was ever done one day however jimmie failed to comply with an extraordinary order of burkes which produced a most laughable and yet characteristic scene we had been working on the platform at williamsbridge digging a coalbin when a train came along bearing the general foreman who got off to examine the work that had been done it was a rule of the company that no opening of any kind into which a person might step or fall should be left uncovered at any station during the approach stay or departure of any train scheduled to stop at that station burke was well aware of this rule he had a copy of it on file in his collection of circulars in addition he had delegated jimmie to attend to this matter a task that just suited the italian as it gave him ample time to idle about and pretend to be watching on this particular occasion jimmie had failed to attend to this matter when the train approached there was the hole wide open with burke below shouting and gesticulating about something the general foreman came forward looked down and said quietly this wont do burke youll have to keep the work covered when a train is approaching burke looked up so astonished and ashamed that he should be put in such a position before his superior that he hardly knew what to say instead of trying to answer he merely began to shout for jimmie who came running crying as he always did whats da mat whats da mat whats da mat mocked burke in his fury what the divil do you suppose is the mat what do you mane by walkin away and lavin the hole uncovered didnt i tell ye niver to lave a hole open when a trains comin didnt i tell ye to attind to that and naathing else what be all the powers dye mane by lavin it what else have ye to do what else arre ye good fer what dye mane by lettin a thing like that happen jimmie was dumfounded he did not know what to say but he began to stutter and stammer about going for a trowel a trowel cried burke a trowelye hathen guinea what ud ye be doin lookin fer a trowel and a train that close on ye it could have knocked ye off the track a trowel is it ill trowel ye git thim boards on and let me catch ye lavin such a place as that open again ill get shut uv ye ye blitherin lunatic during this entire tirade jimmie had been industriously hustling the boards into place while the passengers who had gathered about looked on in astonishment when it was all over and the train bearing the general foreman had gone burke quieted down but not without many fulgurous flashes that kept the poor italian on tenterhooks about an hour later another train arrived and by some strange fatality the hole was open again jimmie was away behind the depot somewhere and burke was as usual down in the hole misfortune trebled itself by bringing the supervisor himself a grave quiet man of whom burke stood in great awe he walked up to the hole and looking reproachfully down said is this the way you leave your excavations burke when a train is coming dont you know any better than to do a thing like that jimmie burke shouted jumping up and climbing out jimmie now by where is that blaguard italian i told him not to lave this place open and he began shoving the planks into place himself jimmie came running as fast as his legs would carry him scared almost out of his wits the excitable foreman was so enraged and ashamed however that he could not speak his face and neck were fiery red and his eyes flashed with anger he merely glared at his recalcitrant henchman as much as to say wait when the next train had arrived and the dignified supervisor had been carried safely out of hearing he turned on jimmie with all the fury of a masterful and excitable temper so yell naht cover the hole after me tellin ye naht fifteen minutes ago yell naht cover the hole and whatll ye be tellin me ye were doin now i carry da waut water for da concrete pleaded jimmie weakly waut fer the concrete echoed burke with his angry face shoved close to the italians own waut fer the concrete its too bad ye didnt fall into yr waut fer the concrete and drown ye flatfooted loonheaded nagur waut fer the concrete is it and me here and a train comin and the hole open waut fer the concrete and mr mills steppin off and lookin in on me ye blackhearted son of a seacook yet ill waut fer the concrete yet ill crack yr blitherin eyetalian skull with a pick i will ill chuck ye in yr waut fer the concrete until ye choke ye roundeyed leatherheaded lunatic ill tache ye to walk off and lave the hole open and me in it now get yr coat and get out uv this ill throuble no more with ye ill have no more thruck with ye out with ye and never show me yr face again and he made a motion as if he would grab him and rend him limb from limb jimmie was too clever however he had evidently been through many such scenes before he retreated behind the depot and when burke had gone to work came back and took a position on guard over the hole when the next train came he was there to shove the boards over and nothing more was said about the matter burke did not appear to notice him the next morning he came to work as usual and it was come matt come jimmie just as if nothing had happened it was not so very long after i arrived that burke began to tell me of a building that the company was going to erect in mott haven yard one of its great switching centers it was to be an important affair sixty by two hundred feet of brick and stone and was to be built under a time limit of three months an arrangement by which the company hoped to find out how satisfactorily it could do work for itself that is without letting it to outside contractors from his manner and conversation i could see that burke was anxious to get this job for he had been a contractor of some ability in his day and felt a little above the small odds and ends of masonry that he was now called on to do he was anxious to show the company that he could build this building and thus make a little better place for himself in the companys estimation but at the same time he was a little afraid of the clerical details those terrible nightmares of reports how arre ye feelin teddy by he would inquire with a great show of interest in my troublesome health fine burke i would say im feeling better every day thats good yere the right man in the right place now if ye were to stay a year or two at this work it would be the makin uv ye i never have a sick day meself thats right burke i intend to stick at it for a while ye ought to itll do ye good if we get the new buildin to build it will be better yet fer ye yell have plenty to do there to relave yr mind relieve indeed i thought but i did not say so on the contrary i felt so much sympathy for the lusty irishman and his reasonable ambitions that i desired to help him and urged him to get it i suggested indirectly that i would see him through which touched him greatly he was a grateful creature in his way but so excitable and so helplessly selfreliant that there was no way of aiding him without doing it in a secret or rather selfeffacing way he would have much preferred to struggle along and fail though i doubt whether real failure could have come to burke rather than openly admit that he needed aid in another three weeks the work was really given him to do and then began one of the finest exhibitions of irish domination and selfsufficiency that was ever witnessed we moved to mott haven yard the clerical details were entrusted to me and burke was given a large force of men whom he fairly gloried in bossing he would trot to and fro about the place beaming in the most angelic fashion and shouting orders that could be heard all over the neighborhood at times he would stand by the long trenches where the men were digging we had forty of them in line now and rub his hands in satisfaction saying i can just see me way to the top of the buildin and then he would proceed to harass and annoy his men out of pure exuberance of spirits ye want to dig it so man or ye dont handle yer pick right hold it this way sometimes he would get down in the trench and demonstrate just how it was to be done a thing that greatly amused some of the workmen frequently he would exhibit to me little tricks or knacks of his trade such as throwing a trowel ten feet so that it would stick in a piece of wood turning a shovel over with a lump of dirt on it and not dropping the lump and such like always adding yell never be a mason till ye can do that when he was tired of fussing with the men outside he would come around to the little wooden shed where i was keeping the mass of orders and reports in shape and getting his material for him ready to his hand and look over the papers in the most knowing manner when he had satisfied himself that everything was going right he would exclaim yere just the by fer the place teddy yed make a good bookkeeper if ever i get to be president ill make ye me secretary uv state the thing that interested and enthralled burke was the coming of the masons these hardy buccaneers of the laboring world who come and go as they please asking no favors and brooking no interference excited his most admiring and pugnacious fancy it promised him the opportunity he in mostly desired of once more fussing and fuming with real strong determined and pugnacious men like himself who would not take his onslaughts tamely but would fight him back and he was never weary of talking of them wait till the masons come teddy by he would say to me wait till we have thirty er forty men on the line thems the times yell see what excitement manes me by whatll i see burke i used to ask throuble enough theyre not crapin eyetalians thatll let ye talk to thim as ye plase yell have to fight with thim fellies do you think you can handle them burke i would ask with a great show of trepidation handle thim he would exclaim his glorious wrath kindling in anticipation of possible conflict handle thim and the likes of a thousand uv thim i know thim all everyone of thim and their thricks its naht foolin me theyll be ah me by its a fine job yell have runnin down to the ahffice gittin thim their time this is the railroad mans expression for money due or salary you dont mean to say youre going to discharge them burke do you i said shewer he exclaimed authoritatively why shouldnt i theyre just the same as other min why shouldnt i then he added after a pause its thim thatll be comin to me askin fer their time instead of me givin it to thim theyre not the kind thatll let ye talk back to thim if their work dont suit ye its give me me time wait till theyll be comin round half drunk in the mornin er not feelin quite right thims the times yell find out what masons arre made of i confess this opportunity did not seem to me as brilliant as it did to him but it had its humor i expressed wonder that he would hire them if they were such a bad lot shewer they have a right to do as they plase he said instantly jumping to their defense its no common workmen they are if ye were in their place yed do the same theres no sinse in allowin another man to walk on ye when ye can get another job i dont blame thim i was a mason wanst meself you dont mean to say that you acted as you say these men are going to act shewer well i shouldnt think youd be very proud of it i have me rights he declared flaring up what kind uv a man is it thatll let himself be walked on theres no sinse in it its not natchral its not intinded that it should be so well the masons came and a fine lot they were for the most part they were clean industrious fellows but so obstreperously conscious of their own rights and so proud of their skill as masons that there was no living with them they wanted first off as the railroad men used to say to know whether there were any nonunion men on the job and this gave burke several splendid opportunities for altercations which he hastened to improve then they wanted to know when they were to get their money and this led to more trouble as the railroad paid only once a month after that there came bickerings on all conceivable subjects the number of bricks they were to lay an hour the number of men they were to carryon one line or wall the length of time they were supposed to work or had worked or would work all of which were pure food and drink to burke he was around all the time arguing with this man or fighting with that one and calling to some mason to come down that he would give him his time frequently he would come rushing into the office the defiant mason at his heels demanding that i make out a timecheck at once which i would occasionally he would patch up a truce with the man but not often as a rule they were as eager to quit and get the money due them as he was to have them and more so it was all like a scene out of comic opera toward the last however a natural calm set in the result of weariness and a sense of surfeit which sent the building forward apace during this time burke was to be seen walking defiantly up and down in front of his men his hands behind his back his face screwed up into a quizzical expression and his whole body bearing a look of bristling pugnacity that was delicious to see he could not say much things were going so well but he could look his contentiousness and he did even now he would occasionally manage to pick a quarrel that resulted in the customary descent to the office but not often it was one cold december day about three weeks later when i was just about to announce that i could not delay my departure any longer that a most dreadful accident occurred burke and a number of italians including matt and jimmie were down in the main room of the building looking after the laying of three concrete piers that were to support three columns intended to reinforce the second floor where heavy storing was to be done when the boiler of the hoistingengine which was located inside the building and just at the juncture of three walls blew up and knocked the middle section of the wall opposite out into the middle of the great room it also let down the wall from the space above it which dislocated fourteen floorjoists and precipitated all of fourteen thousand bricks that had been placed on the third floor into this room below for a few moments there was a hurricane of bricks and falling timber and when it was over the mighty burke and five italians were found to be embedded and all but jimmie more or less seriously injured burke in particular was unfortunately placed his body from the waist down was surrounded by a pile of bricks and across his shoulder a great joist was pressing where it had struck him and cut his neck and ear he was a pathetic sight when we entered grim and bleeding but undaunted im tight fast me lad he said as i with others came hurrying up its me legs thats caught not me body give a hand to the men there the evetalians are underneath disregarding his suggestion we began working at him every man throwing away bricks like a machine but he would not have it tend to the men he exclaimed with a touch of his old firmness the eyetalians are under there matt and jimmie jasus christ cant ye see that im all right look after the men ill be all right till you let the men out come look after the men we fell to this end of the work then for there was no gainsaying him and while we did so burke stood embedded in his mass of material directing us a fabled giant he seemed half god half man composed in part of flesh in part of brick and stone and gazing on our little earthly efforts with the eye of a demigod come now get the joist from off the end there take the bricks away from that man cant ye see theres where his head is there there jasus christ theyer you would have thought we were italians ourselves and compelled to do his bidding after a time we succeeded in releasing all five of the men matt badly cut about the head and seriously injured and jimmie the imperturbable jimmie a little bit the worse for a brick mark on one shoulder but otherwise unharmed and sitting calmly under a shielding joist that had fallen over the hole in which he was digging he was more or less scared of course but comic to look at even in his fright biga smash he exclaimed when he recovered himself lika da worl fall misha buck misha buck where misha buck here i am ye eyetalian scalawag exclaimed the unyielding irishman genially but with a touch of sorrow in his voice at that are ye hurted much no misha buck help misha buck replied jimmie grabbing at bricks himself and so the rescue work began in that quarter even here however the peculiar domineering quality of the mans nature was not to be done away with he deprecated our efforts this wonderful and exceptional fuss over him and when we tugged frantically at joists and beams he interfered with contentious but what he no doubt deemed salutary objections take your time take your time im not so badly fixed as all that take your time get that board out of the way there jimmie but he was badly fixed his hip was severely crushed by the timbers and his legs broken and it was only when we had removed all the bricks that we saw how desperate his condition really was he was so seriously crushed that he could not stand and had to be laid out on the canvas tarpaulin which the yardmaster had spread on the brickstrewn ground while the doctors of the ambulance worked over him while they were examining his desperate wounds he took a critical and quizzical interest in what they were doing and offered numerous suggestions finally when they were ready to move him he asked how he was and on being told that he was all right looked curiously around until he caught my eye i could see that he realized how critical it was with him id like to see a priest teddy he whispered and if ye dont mind id like ye to go up to mount vernon and tell my wife theyll be after telegraphin her if ye dont break it easy if you will dont let her think theres anything serious theres no need of it im not hurted so bad as all that i promised and the next moment one of the doctors shot a spray of cocaine into his hip to relieve what they knew must be his dreadful pain a few moments later he lost consciousness after which i left him to the care of the hospital authorities and hurried away to send the priest and tell his wife for two weeks he lingered in a very serious condition and finally bloodpoisoning set in from the injured condition of his kidneys and he died i saw him at the hospital a number of times and trying to sympathize with his condition i frequently spoke of what i deemed the dreadful carelessness of it all ye have to expect thim things was his one comment ye cant always go unhurted i never lost a man before nor had one come to harm its the way of things ye know poor burke youd have thought the whole italian population of mount vernon where he lived knew and loved him the way they turned out at his funeral it was a state affair for most of them and they came in hundreds packing the little brick church at which he was accustomed to worship full to overflowing matt was there bandaged and sore but sorrowful and jimmie artful and scheming in the past but now thoroughly subdued he was all sorrow i think and sniveled and blubbered and wept hot blinding tears through the fingers of his dark leathery hands misha buck misha buck i heard him say as they bore the body in and when they carried the body out of the church he followed head down and as they lowered it in the grave he was inconsolable misha buck misha buck i worka with him fifteen year
