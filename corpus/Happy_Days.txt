 happy days by alan alexander milne foreword this book is made up from my contributions to punch a casual selection from the four hundred or so which have appeared in the last nine years it is offered to the american public as a sample of that punch humour and perhaps therefore british humour which americans so often profess not to understand according to whether they like it or do not like it i

at d net i shall be glad to hear from you i am the babys uncle on tuesday i got an answer by the morning post dear sir in reply to yours how dare you insult my child she is in class a priceless and bought in by the owner four months old and two days on christmas day fancy i am the babys mother margery had been getting into an expensive way of celebrating her birthday every week hitherto i had ignored it but now i wrote dear madam automatically your baby should be in class d by now i cannot understand why it is not so perhaps i shall hear from you later on with regard to this meanwhile i think that the extraordinary coincidence all but two days of the babys birthday with christmas day calls for some recognition on my part what would margery like you who are in constant communication with her should be able to tell me i hear coral necklaces well spoken of what do you think i remember reading once of a robber who killed a little baby for the coral on its neck which shows at any rate that they are worn do you know how coral reefs are made it is a most fascinating business then there is a silver mug to be considered the only thing you can drink out of a mug is beer yet it is a popular present perhaps you with your supposed greater knowledge of babies will explain this meanwhile i am the babys uncle p s which is a much finer thing than a mother to which her mother my dear boy it is too sweet of you to say you would like to get baby something no i dont know how coral reefs are made and dont want to i think it is wicked of you to talk like that im sure i shant dare let her wear anything valuable now and i dont think she really wants a mug im sure i dont know what she does want except to see her uncle there but it ought to be something that shell value when she grows up and of course we could keep it for her in the meantime her father has smoked his last cigar today isnt it awful i have forbidden him to waste his money on any more but he says he must give me for a christmas present if he does i shall give him that sideboard that i want so badly and then we shall both go to prison together you will look after baby wont you i am the babys mother p s which she isnt proud but does think its a little bit classier than an uncle and so finally i dear child ive thought of the very thing i am the babys uncle that ends chapter i here we go on to ii chapter ii finds me in the toy department of the stores i want i said a present for a child yes sir about how old it must be quite new i said sternly dont be silly oh i see well the child is only a baby ah yes now here if its at all fond of animals i say you mustnt call it it i get in an awful row if i do of course i suppose its all right for you only well be careful wont you the attendant promised and asked whether the child was a boy or girl and had you thought of anything for the little girl well yes i had rather thought of a sideboard i beg your pardon a sideboard the sideboard department is upstairs was there anything else for the little girl well a box of cigars rather full and if you have any the cigar department is on the ground floor but your lord chamberlain told me i was to come here if i wanted a present for a child if you require anything in the toy line yes but what good are toys to a baby of four months do be reasonable what was it you suggested a sideboard and a cigar that was my idea it may not be the best possible but at least it is better than perfectly useless toys you can always blow smoke in its face or bump its head against the sideboard experto crede if you have the latin whereupon with great dignity i made my way to the lift in the sideboard department i said i want a sideboard for a little girl of four months and please dont call her it i nearly had a row with one of your downstairs staff about that i will try to be careful about that sir he replied what sort of a one blue eyes and not much hair and really rather a sweet smile was that what you wanted to know thank you sir but i meant what sort of a sideboard i took him confidentially by the arm look here i said you know how when one is carrying a baby about one bumps its head at all the corners well not too much of that the mothers dont really like it you know they smile at the time but well not too many corners yes i like that very much no i wont take it with me the attendant wrote out the bill number sir shes the first thats why im so nervous ive never bought a sideboard for a child before your stores number i mean sir i havent got one is it necessary must have a number sir then ill think of a nice one for you lets see how does that strike you and the name oh i cant tell you that you must look that up for yourself goodday downstairs i bought some cigars for a little girl of four months i said and she likes them rather full please dont argue with me all your men chatter so i must said the attendant its like this if she is only four months she is obviously little your observation is therefore tautological as a matter of fact i said hotly she is rather big for four months then it was a lie look here you give me those cigars and dont talk so much ive already had words with your master of the sideboards and your undersecretary for the toy department thank you if you would kindly send them iii so there it is i have given the spirit rather than the actual letter of what happened at the stores but that the things have been ordered there is no doubt and when margery wakes up on christmas day to find a sideboard and a box of cigars in her sock i hope she will remember that she has chiefly her mother to thank for it ii how we play the pianola foreword margery wishes me to publish the following correspondence which has recently passed between us it occurs to me that the name under which i appear in it may perhaps need explanation i hate explanations but here it is when margery was eight months old she was taught to call me uncle i must suppose that at this time i was always giving her things things she really wanted such as bootlaces the best china evening papers and so on which had been withheld by those in authority later on these persons came round to my way of thinking and gave her if not the best china at any rate cake and breadandbutter naturally their offerings being appreciated at last were greeted with the familiar cry of uncle no dear not uncle thankyou came the correction i dear thankyou ive some wonderful news for you guess what it is but no you never will well ill tell you i can walk really and really it is most awfully interesting you put one foot out to the right and then you bring the left after it thats one walk and i have done seven altogether you have to keep your hands out in front of you so as to balance properly thats all the rules the rest is just knack i got it quite suddenly it is such fun i wake up about five every morning now thinking of it of course i fall down now and then you see im only beginning when i fall mother comes and picks me up that reminds me i dont want you to call me baby any more now i can walk babies cant walk they just get carried about and put in perambulators i was given a lot of names a long time ago but i forget what they were i think one was rather silly like margery but i have never had it used lately mother always calls me o d now goodbye write directly you get this your loving o d ii my dear o d i was so glad to get your letter because i was just going to write to you what do you think no youll never guess shall i tell you no yes no well ive bought a pianola its really rather difficult to play it properly i know people like paderewski and i can only think of paderewski for the moment i know that sort of person doesnt think much of the pianola artist but they are quite wrong about it all the mechanical agility with the fingers is nothing the soul is everything now you can get the soul the con molto expressione feeling just as well in the pianola as in the piano of course you have to keep a sharp eye on the music some people roll it off just like a barrelorgan but when i see allegro or andante or anything of that kind on the score im on it like a bird no time for more now as ive just got a new lot of music in your loving thankyou p s when are you coming to hear me play i did mumbling mose just now with one hand and lots of soul signed paderewski p p s i am glad you can walk iii dear thankyou i am rather upset about my walking you remember i told you i had done seven in my last well this morning i couldnt do a single one well i did do one as a matter of fact but i suppose some people would say it didnt count because i fell down directly after though i dont see that that matters do you thankyou but even with that one it was only one and yet i know i did seven the day before i wonder why it is i do it the right way im sure and i keep my hands out so as to balance so perhaps its the shoes that are wrong i must ask mother to get me a new pair and tell the man theyre for walks now do write me a nice long letter thankyou because i feel very miserable about this it is right isnt it when you have the right leg out only to bring the left one just up to it and not beyond and does it matter which foot you start with let me know quickly because father is coming home tomorrow and i want to show him your loving o d p s i am glad you like your pianola iv dear o d very glad to get yours if you really want a long letter you shall have one only i warn you that if once i begin nothing less than any earthquake can stop me well first then i played the merry widow waltz yesterday to mrs polacca who is a great authority on music and in with all the queens hall set and she said that my touch reminded her of ive forgotten the mans name now which is rather sickening because it spoils the story a bit but he was one of the real tiptoppers who makes hundreds a week and well that was the sort of man i reminded her of if i can do that with a waltz it stands to reason that with something classic thered be no holding me i think i shall give a recital tickets d no free seats no emergency exit it is a great mistake to have an emergency exit at a recital three pages omitted really o d you must hear me doing the double f in the boston cake walk to get me at my best youve heard kubelik on the violin well its not a bit like that and yet theres just the something which links great artists together no matter what their medium of expression your loving thankyou p s glad youre getting on so well with your walking v dearest thankyou hooray hooray hooray i did twentyfive walks today father counted he says my style reminds him of cancer vulgaris rather how many times can he do it not twentyfive on the third day im sure isnt it splendid of me i see now where i was wrong yesterday i got the knack again suddenly this morning and im all right now tomorrow i shall walk round the table it is a longish way and there are four turns which i am not sure about how do you turn i suppose you put the right hand out your very loving o d vi dear o d i am rather hurt by your letters i have written several times to tell you all about my new pianola and you dont seem to take any interest at all i was going to have told you this time that the man in the flat below had sent me a note just as if it had been a real piano he says he doesnt mind my playing all day so long as i dont start before eight in the morning as he is in his bath then and in listening to the music quite forgets to come out sometimes which i can see might be very awkward write to yours affectionately thankyou vii darling thankyou i am so sorry dear and i will come and hear your pianola tomorrow and i think it lovely and you must be clever to play it so well but you musnt be angry with me because i am so taken up with my walking you see it is all so new to me i feel as though i want everybody to know all about it your pianola must be lovely thankyou dear thankyou could you do you think put all the letters we wrote to each other about my walking in some book so that other people would know how to do it the way i do you might call it letters on walking or how to walk or but you could get a better title than i could do your very loving o d p s im so glad about the pianola and do you mind if i just tell you that i did walk round the table corners and all viii dearest o d right you are i will think of a good title your loving thankyou iii the knight of the chimneypiece we dont know his real name but we have decided to call him arthur sir arthur i suppose he would be he stands in bronze upon the chimneypiece and in his right hand is a javelin this makes him a very dangerous person opposite him but behind the clock coward stands the other fellow similarly armed most people imagine that the two are fighting for the hand of the lady on the clock and they aver that they can hear her heart beating with the excitement of it but to let you into the secret the other fellow doesnt come into the story at all only margery and i know the true story i think i told it to her one night when she wouldnt go to sleep or perhaps she told it to me the best of this tale i say it as the possible author is that it is modern it were easy to have invented something more in keeping with the knights armour but we had to remember that this was the twentieth century and that here in this twentieth century was sir arthur on the chimneypiece with his javelin drawn back for whom is he waiting it all began i said a year ago when sir arthur became a member of the south african chartered incorporated cooperative stores society limited ten per cents at par men only he wasnt exactly a real member having been elected under rule two for meritorious performances rule one being that this club shall be called what i said just now but for nearly a year he enjoyed all the privileges of membership including those of paying a large entrance fee and a still larger subscription at the end of a year however a dreadful thing happened they made a third rule to wit that no member should go to sleep on the billiard table of course sir arthur having only got in under rule two had to resign he had as i have said paid his entrance fee and as it happened his second years subscription in advance naturally he was annoyed and that in fact is why he stands on the chimneypiece with his javelin drawn back he is waiting for the secretary sir arthur is considered to be a good shot and the secretary wants all the flowers to be white at this point margery said her best word gorky which means a thousand thanks for the verisimilitude of your charming and interesting story but is not the love element a trifle weak margery is a true woman we must leave something to the imagination i pleaded the secretary no doubt had a delightful niece and sir arthurs hopeless passion for her after he had hit her uncle in a vital spot would be the basis of a most powerful situation margery said gorky again which as i have explained means are such distressing situations within the province of the highest art when margery says gorky twice in one night it is useless to argue i gave in at once butter i said placed upon the haft of the javelin would make it slip and put him off his shot he would miss the secretary and marry the niece so we put a good deal of butter on sir arthur and for the moment the secretary is safe i dont know if we shall be able to keep it there but in case jam does as well margery has promised to stroke him every day however i anticipate as soon as the secretarial life was saved margery said agga which is as it were encore or bis so that i have her permission to tell you that story all over again instead i will give you the tragedy of george the other fellow no knight he as she told it to me afterwards george was quite a different man from sir arthur so far from being elected to anything under rule two he got blackballed for the north london toilet club opinions differed as to why this happened some said that it was his personal unpopularity he had previously been up without success for the membership of the local ratepayers association others among them the proprietor that his hair grew too quickly anyhow it was a great shock to george and they had to have a man in to break it to him its always the way when you have a man in george was stricken to the heart this last blow was too much for what had always been a proud nature he decided to emigrate accordingly he left home and moved to islington whether he is still there or not i cannot say but a card with that postmark reached his niece only this week it was unsigned and bore on the space reserved for inland communications these words the old old wish a merry christmas and a happy new year but what about the javelin i asked margery this fellow had a javelin too you remember gorky said margery for the third time which means well upon my word i dont know what it means but it would explain it all meanwhile sir arthur he was in my story you know is still waiting for the secretary in case the butter gives out have i mentioned that the secretary wants all the flowers to be white iv the art of conversation in conversation said somebody i think it was my grandfather there should always be a give and take the ball must be kept rolling if he had ever had a niece two years old i dont think he would have bothered whats at said margery pointing suddenly that i said stroking it is dear uncles nose whats at take your finger away ah yes that is dear uncles eye the left one dear uncles left one said margery thoughtfully whats it doing thinking whats finking what dear uncle does every afternoon after lunch whats lunch eggs sardines macaroons everything with a great effort margery resisted the temptation to ask what everything was a difficult question and made a statement of her own santa claus bring margie a balloon from daddy she announced a balloon how jolly i said with interest what sort are you having one of those semidetached ones with the gas laid on or the pink ones with a velvet collar down chimney said margery oh that kind do you think i mean isnt it rather tell margie a story about a balloon bother i murmured whats bovver bother is what you say when relations ask you to tell them a story about a balloon it means but for the fact that we both have the montmorency blood in our veins i should be compelled to decline your kind invitation all the stories i know about balloons being stiff uns it also means instead of talking about balloons wont you sing me a little song nope said margery bother shes forgotten her music what did you say uncle dear what did you say i sighed and began once upon a time there was a balloon a dear little toy balloon and and whats at asked margery making a dab at my chest whats at uncle dear that i said is a button more particularly a red waistcoat button more particularly still my top red waistcoat button whats at she asked going down one that is a button description second red waistcoat parents living both infectious diseases scarlet fever slightly once whats at thats a ah yes a button the third a good little chap but not so chubby as his brothers he couldnt go down to margate with them last year and so of course well as i was saying there was once a balloon and whats aaat said margery bending forward suddenly and kissing it look here youve jolly well got to enclose a stamped addressed envelope with the next question as a matter of fact though you wont believe me that again is a button whats at asked margery digging at the fifth button owing to extreme pressure on space i began thank you that also is a button its responsibility is greater than that of its brethren the crash may come at any moment luckily it has booked its passage to the where was i oh yes well this balloon whats at said margery pointing to the last one i must have written notice of that question i cant tell you offhand whats at uncle dear well i dont know margie it looks something like a collar stud only somehow you wouldnt expect to find a collar stud there of course it may have slipped or could it be one of those red beads do you think nno no it isnt a bead and it isnt a raspberry because this is the wrong week for raspberries of course it might be a by jove ive got it its a button i gave the sort of warwhoop with which one announces these discoveries and margery whooped too a button she cried a dear little button she thought for a moment whats a button this was ridiculous you dont mean to say i reproached her that ive got to tell you now what a button is that i added severely pointing to the top of my waistcoat is a button whats at said margery pointing to the next one i looked at her in horror then i began to talk very quickly there was once a balloon i said rapidly a dear little boy balloon i mean toy balloon and this balloon was a jolly little balloon just two minutes old and he wasnt always asking silly questions and when he fell down and exploded himself they used to wring him out and say come come now be a little airship about it and so whats at asked margery pointing to the top button there was only one way out of it i began to sing a carol in a very shrill voice all the artist rose in margery dont sing she said hurriedly margie sing what shall margie sing uncle before i could suggest anything she was off it was a scandalous song she began by announcing that she wanted to be among the boys and anticipating my objections assured me that it was no good kicking up a noise because it was no fun going out when there werent any boys about you were so lonelyonelyonely here the tune became undecided and a chance word recalling another context to her mind she drifted suddenly into a hymn and sang it with the same religious fervour as she had sung the other her fair head flung back and her hazel eyes gazing into heaven i listened carefully this was a bit i didnt recognise the tune wavered for a moment and out of it these words emerged triumphant talk of me to the boys you meet remember me kindly to regent street and give them my love in the whats at uncle that i said stroking it is dear uncles nose whats by the way would you like it all over again no oh very well v afternoon sleep in the afternoon they came unto a land in which it seemed always afternoon i am like napoleon in that i can go to sleep at any moment i am unlike him i believe in that i am always doing so one makes no apology for doing so on sunday afternoon the apology indeed should come from the others the wakeful parties uncle margery will you come and play wiv me im rather busy just now i said with closed eyes after tea why are you raver busy just now my babys only raver busy sometimes well then you know what its like how important it is that one shouldnt be disturbed but you must be beturbed when i ask you to come and play wiv me oh well what shall we play at trains said margery eagerly when we play at trains i have to be a tunnel i dont know if you have ever been a tunnel no well its an overrated profession we wont play trains i announced firmly because its sunday why not because its sunday oh you little pagan hasnt mummy told you about sunday oh yes maud did tell me said margery casually then she gave an innocent little smile oh i called mummy maud she said in pretended surprise i quite fought i was upstairs i hope you follow the manners and customs of good society must be observed on the ground floor where visitors may happen upstairs one relaxes a little do you know margery went on with the air of a discoverer you mustnt say prayers downstairs or corsets i never do i affirmed well anyhow i never will again why maynt you i dont know i said sleepily say prehaps well prehaps its because your mother tells you not to well ats a silly fing to say said margery scornfully it is im thoroughly ashamed of it i apologise good night and i closed my eyes again i fought you were going to play wiv me mr bingle sighed margery to herself my name is not bingle i said opening one eye why isnt it bingle the story is a very long and sad one when i wake up i will tell it to you good night tell it to me now there was no help for it once upon a time i said rapidly there was a man called bingle oliver bingle and he married a lady called pringle and his brother married a lady called jingle and his other brother married a miss wingle and his cousin remained single that is all oh i see said margery doubtfully now will you play wiv me how can one resist the pleading of a young child all right i said well pretend im a little girl and youre my mummy and youve just put me to bed good night mummy dear oh but i must cover you up she fetched a tablecloth and a pramcover and the times and a handkerchief and the cat and a dolls whatimustntsaydownstairs and a cushion and she covered me up and tucked me in ere ere now go to sleep my darling she said and kissed me lovingly oh margie you dear i whispered you called me margie she cried in horror i meant mummy good night one two three seconds passed rapidly its morning said a bright voice in my ear get up im very ill i pleaded i want to stay in bed all day but your dear uncle said margery inventing hastily came last night after you were in bed and stayed e night do you see and he wants you to sit on him in bed and talk to him where is he show me the bounder ere he is said margery pointing at me but look here i cant sit on my own chest and talk to myself ill take the two parts if you insist sir herbert but i cant play them simultaneously not even irving why cant you play them simrulaleously well i cant margie will you let me go to sleep nope said margery shaking her head you should say no thank you revered and highly respected uncle no hank you mr cann i have already informed you that my name is not bingle and i have now to add that neither is it cann why neiver is it cann that isnt grammar you should say why can it not either why i dont know say prehaps no i cant even say prehaps well say i shall understand when im a big girl youll understand when youre a big girl margery i said solemnly oh i see thats right now then what about going to sleep she was silent for a moment and i thought i was safe then uncle just tell me why was at little boy crying vis morning which little boy ve one in e road oh that one well he was crying because his uncle hadnt had any sleep all night and when he tried to go to sleep in the afternoon say prehaps again my first rejected contribution i sighed and had another shot well then i said gallantly it must have been because he hadnt got a sweet little girl of three to play with him yes said margery nodding her head thoughtfully at was it vi a twice told tale is that you uncle said a voice from the nursery as i hung my coat up in the hall ive only got my skin on but you can come up however she was sitting up in bed with her nightgown on when i found her i was having my bath when you came she explained have you come all the way from london all the way then will you tell me a story i cant im going to have my dinner i only came up to say good night margery leant forward and whispered coaxingly will you just tell me about beauty and e beast but ive told you that such heaps of times and its much too long for tonight tell me half of it as much as that she held her hands about nine inches apart thats too much as much as that the hands came a little nearer together oh well ill tell you up to where the beast died fought he died she corrected eagerly yes well how much will that be as much as i said i nodded the preliminary business settled she gave a little sigh of happiness put her arms round her knees and waited breathlessly for the story she had heard twenty times before once upon a time there was a man who had three daughters and one day what was the mans name margery i said reproachfully annoyed at the interruption you know i never tell you the mans name tell me now oswald i said after a moments thought i told daddy it was thomas said margery casually well as a matter of fact he had two names oswald and thomas why did he have two names in case he lost one well one day this man who was very poor heard that a lot of money was waiting for him in a ship which had come over the sea to a town some miles off so he was it waiting at weymouf somewhere like that i spex it must have been weymouf because theres lots of sea there yes im sure it was well he thought hed go to weymouth and get the money how much monies was it oh lots and lots as much as five pennies yes about that well he said goodbye to his daughters and asked them what theyd like him to bring back for a present and the first asked for some lovely jewels and diamonds and like mummys locket is that jewels that sort of idea well she wanted a lot of things like that and the second wanted some beautiful clothes what sort of clothes oh frocks and well frocks and all sorts of er frocks did she want any lovely new stockings yes she wanted three pairs of those and did she want any lovely yes i said hastily she wanted lots of those too lots of everything margery gave a little sob of happiness go on telling me she said under her breath well the third daughter was called beauty and she thought to herself poor father wont have any money left at all if we all go on like this so she didnt ask for anything very expensive like her selfish sisters she only asked for a rose a simple red rose margery moved uneasily i hope she said wistfully this bit isnt going to be about you know it never did before about what good little girls and bad little girls and fings like that my darling no of course not i told it wrong beauty asked for a rose because she loved roses so and it was a very particular kind of red rose that she wanted a sort that they simply couldnt get to grow in their own garden because of the soil go on telling me said margery with a deep sigh of content well he started off to weymouth what day did he start it was monday and when oh well anyhow i told daddy it was tuesday tuesday now let me think yes i believe youre right because on monday he went to a meeting of the vegetable gardeners and proposed the health of the chairman yes well he started off on tuesday and when he got there he found that there was no money for him at all i spex somebody had taken it said margery breathlessly well it had all gone somehow prehaps somebody had swallowed it said margery a little carried away by the subject by mistake anyhow it was gone and he had to come home again without any money he hadnt gone far how far asked margery as far as that and she measured nine inches in the air about fortyfour miles when he came to a beautiful garden was it a really lovely big garden bigger than ours oh much bigger bigger than yours i havent got a garden margery looked at me wonderingly she opened her mouth to speak and then stopped and rested her head upon her hands and thought out this new situation at last her face flushed with happiness she announced her decision go on telling me about beauty and the beast now she said breathlessly and then tell me why you havent got a garden my average time for beauty and the beast is ten minutes and if we stop at the place where the beast thought he was dead six minutes twentyfive seconds but with the aid of seemingly innocent questions a determined character can make even the craftiest uncle spin the story out to halfanhour next time said margery when we had reached the appointed place and she was being tucked up in bed will you tell me all the story was there the shadow of a smile in her eyes i dont know but im sure it will be wisest next time to promise her the whole thing we must make that point clear at the very start and then we shall get along vii the literary art margery has a passion for writing just now i can see nothing in it myself but if people will write i suppose you cant stop them will you just lend me your pencil she asked remind me to give you a hundred pencils some time i said as i took it out and then youll always have one you simply eat pencils oo i gave it you back last time only just you inveigle me down here what do i do im not going to say that again for anybody well may i have the pencil i gave her the pencil and a sheet of paper and settled her in a chair baby said margery to herself planning out her weekly article for the reviews baby baby she squared her elbows and began to write there she said after five minutes composition the manuscript was brought over to the critic and the author stood proudly by to point out subtleties that might have been overlooked at a first reading baby explained the author baby yes thats very good very neatly expressed baby i like that shall i write some more said margery eagerly yes do write some more this is good but its not long enough the author retired again and in five minutes produced this b a b y thats baby explained margery yes i like that baby better than the other one its more spread out and its bigger its one of the biggest babies ive seen shall i write some more dont you write anything else ever i like writing baby said margery carelessly baby yes but you cant do much with just that one word suppose you wanted to write to a man at a shop dear sir you never sent me my boots please send them at once as i want to go out this afternoon i am yours faithfully margery it would be no good simply putting baby because he wouldnt know what you meant well what would it be good putting ah thats the whole art of writing to know what it would be any good putting you want to learn lots and lots of new words so as to be ready now heres a jolly little one that you ought to meet i took the pencil and wrote g o t got got got margery her elbows on my knee and her chin resting on her hands studied the position yes thats old got she said hes always coming in when you want to say ive got a bad pain so i cant accept your kind invitation or when you want to say excuse more as ive got to go to bed now or quite simply youve got my pencil got got said margery got got got got with appropriate action it makes a very nice recitation is that a g said margery busy with the pencil which she had snatched from me the gentleman with the tail you havent made his tail quite long enough thats better margery retired to her study charged with an entirely new inspiration and wrote her second manifesto it was this g o t got she pointed out i inspected it carefully coming fresh to the idea margery had treated it more spontaneously than the other but it was distinctly a got one of the gots have you any more words she asked holding tight to the pencil youve about exhausted me margery what was that one you said just now the one you said you wouldnt say again oh you mean inveigle i said pronouncing it differently this time yes write that for me it hardly ever comes in only when you are writing to your solicitor whats solicitor hes the gentleman who takes the money hes always coming in then write solicitor i took the pencil it was my turn for it and wrote solicitor then i read it out slowly to margery spelt it to her three times very carefully and wrote solicitor again then i said it thoughtfully to myself halfadozen times solicitor then i looked at it wonderingly i am not sure now i said that there is such a word why i thought there was when i began but now i dont think there can be solicitor it seems so silly let me write it said margery eagerly taking the paper and pencil and see if it looks silly she retired and as well as she could for her excitement copied the word down underneath the combined effort then read as follows solicitor solicitor solctor yes youve done it a lot of good i said youve taken some of the creases out i like that much better do you think there is such a word now im beginning to feel more easy about it im not certain but i hope so do i said margery with the pencil in one hand and the various scraps of paper in the other she climbed on to the writing desk and gave herself up to literature and it seems to me that she is well equipped for the task for besides having my pencil still of which i say nothing for the moment she has now three separate themes upon which to ring the changes a range wide enough for any writer these are baby got solicitor supposing that there is such a word solicitor got baby and got baby solicitor indeed there are really four themes here for the last one can have two interpretations it might mean that you had obtained an ordinary solicitor for baby or it might mean that you had got a specially small one for yourself it lacks therefore the lucidity of the best authors but in a woman writer this may be forgiven viii my secretary when five years ago i used to write long letters to margery for some reason or other she never wrote back to save her face i had to answer the letters myself a tedious business still i must admit that the warmth and geniality of the replies gave me a certain standing with my friends who had not looked for me to be so popular after some months however pride stepped in one cannot pour out letter after letter to a lady without any acknowledgment save from oneself and when even my own acknowledgments began to lose their first warmth when for instance i answered four pages about my new pianola with the curt reminder that i was learning to walk and couldnt be bothered with music why then at last i saw that a correspondence so onesided would have to come to an end i wrote a farewell letter and replied to it with tears but bless you that was nearly five years ago each morning now among the usual pile of notes on my plate from duchesses publishers moneylenders actormanagers and whatnot i find likely enough an envelope in margerys own handwriting not only is my address printed upon it legibly but there are also such extra directions to the postman as england and important for its more speedy arrival and inside well i give you the last but seven my dear uncle i thot you wher coming to see me to night but you didnt why didnt you baby has p t o hurt her knee isnt that a pity i have some new toys isnt that jolly we didnt have our five minutes so will you krite to me and tell me all about p t o your work from your loving little margie i always think that footnotes to a letter are a mistake but there are one or two things i should like to explain a just as some journalists feel that without the word economic a leading article lacks tone so margery feels and i agree with her that a certain cachet is lent to a letter by a p t o at the bottom of each page b there are lots of grownup people who think that write is spelt rite margery knows that this is not so she knows that there is a silent letter in front of the r which doesnt do anything but likes to be there obviously if nobody is going to take any notice of this extra letter it doesnt much matter what it is margery happened to want to make a k just then at a pinch it could be as silent as a w you will please therefore regard the k in krite as absolutely noiseless c years ago i claimed the privilege to monopolise on the occasional evenings when i was there margerys last ten minutes before she goes back to some heaven of her own each night this privilege was granted it being felt no doubt that she owed me some compensation for my early secretarial work on her behalf we used to spend the ten minutes in listening to my telling a fairy story always the same one one day the authorities stepped in and announced that in future the ten minutes would be reduced to five the procedure seemed to me absolutely illegal and i should like to bring an action against somebody but it certainly did put the lid on my fairy story of which i was getting more than a little tired tell me about beauty and the beast said margery as usual that evening theres not time i said weve only five minutes tonight oh then tell me all the work youve done today a little unkind youll agree but you know what relations are and so now i have to cram the record of my days work into five breathless minutes you will understand what bare justice i can do it in the time i am sorry that these footnotes have grown so big let us leave them and return to the letter there are many ways of answering such a letter one might say my dear margery it was jolly to get a real letter from you at last but the at last would seem rather tactless considering what had passed years before or one might say my dear margery thank you for your jolly letter i am so sorry about babys knee and so glad about your toys perhaps if you gave one of the toys to baby then her knee but i feel sure that margery would expect me to do better than that in the particular case of this last letter but seven i wrote dearest margery thank you for your sweet letter i had a very busy day at the office or i would have come to see you pto transcribers note page break in original i hope to be down next week and then i will tell you all about my work but i have a lot more to do now and so i must say goodbye your loving uncle there is perhaps nothing in that which demands an immediate answer but with businesslike promptitude margery replied my dear uncle thank you for your letter i am glad you are coming next week baby is quite well now are you p t o coming on thursday next week or not say yes if you are i am p t o sorry you are working so hard from your loving margie i said yes and that i was her loving uncle it seemed to be then too late for a pto but i got one in and put on the back love to baby the answer came by return of post my dear uncle thank you for your letter come erly on p t o thursday come at half past nothing baby sends her love and so do p t o i my roking horse has a sirrup broken isnt that a pity say yes or no goodbye from your loving margie of course i thanked baby for her love and gave my decision that it was a pity about the rockinghorse i did it in large capitals which as i ought to have said before is the means of communication between margery and her friends for some reason or other i find printing capitals to be more tiring than the ordinary method of writing my dear uncle wrote margery but we need not go into that what i want to say is this i love to get letters particularly these but i hate writing them particularly in capitals years ago i used to answer margerys letter for her it is now her turn to answer mine for me ix the truth about home rails imagine us if you can sitting one on each side of the fire i with my feet on the mantelpiece margery curled up in the blue armchair both of us intent on the morning paper to me by good chance has fallen the sporting page to margery the foreign political and financial intelligence of the day what said margery does it mean when it says she stopped and spelt it over to herself again i put down my piece of the paper and prepared to explain the desire for knowledge in the young cannot be too strongly encouraged and i have always flattered myself that i can explain in perfectly simple language anything which a child wants to know for instance i once told margery what miniature rifle shooting meant it was a headline which she had come across in her paper the explanation took some time owing to margerys preconceived idea that a bird entered into it somewhere several times when i thought the lesson was over she said well what about the bird but i think i made it plain to her in the end though maybe she has forgotten about it now what said margery does it mean when it says home rails firm i took up my paper again the cambridge fifteen i was glad to see were rapidly developing into a firstclass team and home rails firm repeated margery and looked up at me my mind worked rapidly as it always does in a crisis what did you say i asked in surprise what does home rails firm mean where does it say that i went on still thinking at lightning speed there it said it yesterday too ah yes i made up my mind well that i said i think that is something you must ask your father i did ask him yesterday well then he told me to ask mummy coward you can be sure i said firmly that what mummy told you would be right and i returned to my paper mummy told me to wait till you came really these parents the way they shirk their responsibilities nowadays is disgusting home rails firm said margery and settled herself to listen it is good that children should be encouraged to take an interest in the affairs of the day but i do think that a little girl might be taught by its father or if more convenient mother which part of a newspaper to read had margery asked me the difference between a bunker and a banker had she demanded an explanation of ultimatum or guillotine i could have done something with it but to let a child of six fill her head with ideas as to the firmness or otherwise of home rails is hardly nice however an explanation had to be given well its like this margery i said at last supposing well you see supposing that is to say if i and then i stopped i had a sort of feeling intuition they call it that i was beginning in the wrong way go on said margery perhaps i had better put it this way supposing you were to well wed better begin further back than that you know what no i dont suppose you do know that well if i that is to say when a man you know its rather difficult to explain this margery are you explaining it now im just going to begin thank you uncle i lit my pipe slowly while i considered again how best to approach the matter home rails firm said margery isnt it a funny thing to say it was it was a very silly thing to say whoever said it first might have known what it would lead to perhaps i can explain it best like this margery i said beginning on a new tack i suppose you know what firm means what does it mean ah well if you dont know that i said rather pleased perhaps i had better explain that first firm means that that is to say you call a thing firm if it well if it doesnt that is to say a thing is firm if it cant move like a house well something like that this chair for instance and i put my hand on her chair is firm because you cant shake it you see its quite hallo whats that oh you bad uncle youve knocked the castor off again cried margery greatly excited at the incident this is too much i said bitterly even the furniture is against me go on explaining said margery rocking herself in the now wobbly chair i decided to leave firm it is not an easy word to explain at the best of times and when everything you touch goes and breaks itself it becomes perfectly impossible well so much for that i said and now we come to rails you know what rails are like ive got in the nursery this was splendid i had forgotten these for the moment exactly the rails your train goes on well then home rails would be rails at home well ive got them at home said margery in surprise i couldnt have them anywhere else quite so then home rails firm would mean that er home rails were er firm but mine arent because they wobble you know they do yes but well why do they say home rails firm when they mean home rails wobble ah thats just it the point is that when they say home rails firm they dont mean that the rails themselves are firm in fact they dont mean at all what you think they mean they mean something quite different what do they mean i am just going to explain i said stiffly or perhaps i had better put it this way i said ten minutes later supposing oh margery it is difficult to explain i must know said margery why do you want to know so badly i want to know a million million times more than anything else in the whole world why so as i can tell angela said margery i plunged into my explanation again angela is three and i can quite see how important it is that she should be sound on the question lifes little tragedies x a crown of sorrows there is something on my mind of which i must relieve myself if i am ever to face the world again with a smile i must share my trouble with others i cannot bear my burden alone friends i have lost my hat will the gentleman who took it by mistake and forgot to leave his own in its place kindly return my hat to me at once i am very miserable without my hat it was one of those nice soft ones with a dent down the middle to collect the rain one of those soft hats which wrap themselves so lovingly round the cranium that they ultimately absorb the personality of the wearer underneath responding to his every emotion when people said nice things about me my hat would swell in sympathy when they said nasty things or when i had had my hair cut it would adapt itself automatically to my lesser requirements in a word it fitted and that is more than can be said for your hard unyielding bowler my hat and i dropped into a hall of music one night last week i placed it under the seat put a coat on it to keep it warm and settled down to enjoy myself my hat could see nothing but it knew that it would hear all about the entertainment on the way home when the last moving picture had moved away my hat and i prepared to depart together i drew out the coat and felt around for my where on earth i was calm at first excuse me i said politely to the man next to me but have you got two hats several he replied mistaking my meaning i dived under the seat again and came up with some more dust some one i said to the programme girl has taken my hat have you looked under the seat for it she asked it was such a sound suggestion that i went under the seat for the third time it may have been kicked further along suggested another attendant she walked up and down the row looking for it and in case somebody had kicked it into the row above walked up and down that one too and in case somebody had kicked it on to the other side of the house many other girls spread themselves in pursuit and soon we had the whole pack hunting for it then the fireman came up suspecting the worst i told him it was even worse than that my hat had been stolen he had a flash of inspiration are you sure you brought it with you he asked the programme girls seemed to think that it would solve the whole mystery if i hadnt brought it with me are you sure you are the fireman i said coldly he thought for a moment and then unburdened himself of another idea perhaps its just been kicked under the seat he said i left him under the seat and went downstairs with a heavy heart at the door i said to the hall porter have you seen anybody going out with two hats by mistake whats the matter he said lost your hat it has been stolen have you looked under the seats it may have been kicked along a bit perhaps id better see the manager i said is it any good looking under the seats for him i expect its just been kicked along a bit the hall porter repeated confidently ill come up with you and look for it if theres any more talk about being kicked along a bit i said bitterly somebody will be i want the manager i was led to the managers room and there i explained the matter to him he was very pleasant about it i expect you havent looked for it properly he said with a charming smile just take this gentleman up he added to the hall porter and find his hat for him it has probably been kicked under one of the other seats we were smiled irresistibly out and i was dragged up to the grand circle again the seats by this time were laid out in white draperies the house looked very desolate i knew that my poor hat was dead with an air of cheery confidence the hall porter turned into the first row of seats it may have been kicked on to the stage i said as he began to slow down it may have jumped into one of the boxes it may have turned into a rabbit you know i expect you arent looking for it properly the manager was extremely sympathetic when we came back to him he said oh im sorry just like that oh im sorry my hat i said firmly has been stolen im sorry he repeated with a bored smile and turned to look at himself in the glass then i became angry with him and his attendants and his whole blessed theatre my hat i said bitingly has been stolen from me while i slept you must have seen me wearing it in the dear old days greeny brown it was in colour but it wasnt the colour that drew your eyes to it no nor yet the shape nor the angle at which it sat it was just the essential rightness of it if you have ever seen a hat which you felt instinctively was a clever hat an alive hat a profound hat then that was my hat and that was myself underneath it xi the lucky month know thyself said the old greek motto in greek but this is an english book so i bought a little red volume called tersely enough were you born in january i was and reassured on this point the author told me all about myself for the most part he told me nothing new you are he said in effect goodtempered courageous ambitious loyal quick to resent wrong an excellent raconteur and a leader of men true generous to a fault yes i was overdoing that rather you have a ready sympathy with the distressed people born in this month will always keep their promises and so on there was no doubt that the author had the idea all right even when he went on to warn me of my weaknesses he maintained the correct note people born in january he said must be on their guard against working too strenuously their extraordinarily active brains well you see what he means it is a fault perhaps and i shall be more careful in future mind i do not take offence with him for calling my attention to it in fact my only objection to the book is its surface application to all the people who were born in january there should have been more distinction made between me and the rabble i have said that he told me little that was new in one matter however he did open my eyes he introduced me to an aspect of myself entirely unsuspected they he said meaning me have unusual business capacity and are destined to be leaders in great commercial enterprises one gets at times these flashes of selfrevelation in an instant i realised how wasted my life had been in an instant i resolved that here and now i would put my great gifts to their proper uses i would be a leader in an immense commercial enterprise one cannot start commercial enterprises without capital the first thing was to determine the exact nature of my balance at the bank this was a matter for the bank to arrange and i drove there rapidly good morning i said to the cashier i am in rather a hurry may i have my passbook he assented and retired after an interminable wait during which many psychological moments for commercial enterprise must have lapsed he returned i think you have it he said shortly thank you i replied and drove rapidly home again a lengthy search followed but after an hour of it one of those whitehot flashes of thought such as only occur to the natural business genius seared my mind and sent me posthaste to the bank again after all i said to the cashier i only want to know my balance what is it he withdrew and gave himself up to calculation i paced the floor impatiently opportunities were slipping by at last he pushed a slip of paper across at me my balance it was in four figures unfortunately two of them were shillings and pence still there was a matter of fifty pounds odd as well and fortunes have been built up on less out in the street i had a moments pause hitherto i had regarded my commercial enterprise in the bulk as a finished monument of industry the little niggling preliminary details had not come up for consideration just for a second i wondered how to begin only for a second an unsuspected talent which has long lain dormant needs when waked a second or so to turn round in at the end of that time i had made up my mind i knew exactly what i would do i would ring up my solicitor hallo is that you yes this is me what yes awfully thanks how are you good look here come and lunch with me what no at once goodbye business particularly that sort of commercial enterprise to which i had now decided to lend my genius can only be discussed properly over a cigar during the meal itself my solicitor and i indulged in the ordinary smalltalk of the pleasureloving world youre looking very fit said my solicitor no not fat fit you dont think im looking thin i asked anxiously people are warning me that i may be overdoing it rather they tell me that i must be seriously on my guard against brain strain i suppose they think you oughtnt to strain it too suddenly said my solicitor though he is now a solicitor he was once just an ordinary boy like the rest of us and it was in those days that he acquired the habit of being rude to me a habit he has never quite forgotten what is an onyx i said changing the conversation why asked my solicitor with his usual business acumen well i was practically certain that i had seen one in the zoo in the reptile house but i have just learnt that it is my lucky month stone naturally i want to get one the coffee came and we settled down to commerce i was just going to ask you said my solicitor have you any money lying idle at the bank because if so whatever else it is doing it isnt lying idle i protested i was at the bank today and there were men chivying it about with shovels all the time well how much have you got about fifty pounds it ought to be more than that thats what i say but you know what those banks are actual merit counts for nothing with them well what did you want to do with it exactly that was why i rang you up i er this was really my moment but somehow i was not quite ready to seize it my vast commercial enterprise still lacked a few trifling details er i well its like that i might get you a few ground rents dont i shouldnt know where to put them but if you really have fifty pounds simply lying idle i wish youd lend it to me for a bit im confoundedly hard up generous to a fault you have a ready sympathy with the distressed dash it what could i do is it quite etiquette for clients to lend solicitors money i asked i thought it was always solicitors who had to lend it to clients if i must id rather lend it to you i mean id dislike it less as to the old friend of my childhood yes thats how i wanted to pay it back bother then ill send you a cheque tonight i sighed and thats where we are at the moment people born in this month always keep their promises the money has got to go tonight if i hadnt been born in january i shouldnt be sending it i certainly shouldnt have promised it i shouldnt even have known that i had it sometimes i almost wish that i had been born in one of the decent months march say xii the rescue william bales as nice a young man as ever wore a cummerbund on an esplanade was in despair for halfanhour he and miss spratt had been sitting in silence on the pier and it was still williams turn to say something miss spratts last remark had been oh mr bales you do say things and william felt that his next observation must at all costs live up to the standard set for it three or four times he had opened his mouth to speak and then on second thoughts had rejected the intended utterance as unworthy at the end of halfanhour his mind was still working fruitlessly he knew that the longer he waited the more brilliant he would have to be and he told himself that even bernard shaw or one of those clever writing fellows would have been hard put to it now william was at odds with the world he was a romantic young man who had once been told that he nearly looked like lewis waller when he frowned and he had resolved that his holiday this year should be a very dashing affair indeed he had chosen the sea in the hopes that some old gentleman would fall off the pier and let himself be saved by and later on photographed with william bales who in a subsequent interview would modestly refuse to take any credit for the gallant rescue as his holiday had progressed he had felt the need for some such old gentleman more and more for only thus he realised could he capture the heart of the wayward miss spratt but so far it had been a dull season in a whole fortnight nobody had gone out of his way to oblige william and tomorrow he must return to the city as unknown and as unloved as when he left it got to go back tomorrow he said at last as an impromptu it would have served but as the result of halfanhours earnest thought he felt that it did not do him justice so you said before remarked miss spratt well its still true talking about it wont help it said miss spratt william sighed and looked round the pier there was an old gentleman fishing at the end of it his back turned invitingly to william in halfanhour he had caught one small fish which he had had to return as under the age limit and a bunch of seaweed william felt that here was a wasted life a life however which a sudden kick and a heroic rescue by w bales might yet do something to justify at the paddington baths a month ago he had won a platediving competition and though there is a difference between diving for plates and diving for old gentlemen he was prepared to waive it one kick and then fame and not only fame but the admiration of angelina spratt it was perhaps as well for the old gentleman who was really quite worthy and an hour later caught a fullsized whiting that miss spratt spoke at this moment well youre good company i must say she observed to william its so hot said william you cant say i asked to come here lets go on the beach said william desperately we can find a shady cave or something fate was against him there was to be no rescue that day im sure im agreeable said miss spratt they walked in silence along the beach and rounding a corner of the cliffs they came presently to a cave in earlier days w bales could have done desperate deeds against smugglers there with miss spratt looking on alas for this unromantic age it was now a place for picnics and a crumpled sheet of newspaper on the sand showed that there had been one there that very afternoon they sat in a corner of the cave out of the sun out of sight of the sea and william prepared to renew his efforts as a conversationalist in the hope of collecting a few ideas as to what the london clubs were talking about he picked up the discarded newspaper and saw with disgust that it was the local herald but just as he threw it down a line in it caught his eye and remained in his mind high tide today williams heart leapt he looked at his watch it was in one hour the waves would be dashing remorselessly into the cave would be leaping up the cliff what time he and miss spratt suppose they were caught by the tide meanwhile the lady despairing of entertainment had removed her hat really she said im that sleepy i suppose the tides safe mr bales it was williams chance quite quite safe he said earnestly its going down hard well then i almost think she closed her eyes wake me up when youve thought of something really funny mr bales william was left alone with romance he went out of the cave and looked round the sea was still some way out but it came up quickly on this coast in an hour in an hour he scanned the cliffs and saw the ledge whither he would drag her she would cling to him crying calling him her rescuer what should he do then should he leave her and swim for help or should he scale the mighty cliff he returned to the cave and gazing romantically at the sleeping miss spratt conjured up the scene it would go like this he thought miss spratt wakened by the spray dashing over her face oh mr bales were cut off by the tide save me w bales lightly tuttut theres no danger its nothing aside great heavens death stares us in the face miss spratt throwing her arms around his neck william save me i cannot swim w bales with waller face trust me angelina i will fight my way round yon point and obtain help aside an englishman can only die once miss spratt dont leave me w bales fear not sweetheart see there is a ledge where you will be beyond the reach of the hungry tide i will carry you thither in my arms and will then at this point in his daydream william took another look at the sleeping miss spratt felt his biceps doubtfully and went on w bales i will assist you to climb thither and will then swim for help miss spratt my hero again and again william reviewed the scene to himself it was perfect his photograph would be in the papers miss spratt would worship him he would be a hero in his city office the actual danger was slight for at the worst she could shelter in the far end of the cave but he would not let her know this he would do the thing heroically drag her to the ledge on the cliff and then swim round the point to obtain help the thought struck him that he could conduct the scene better in his shirt sleeves he removed his coat and then went out of the cave to reconnoitre the ledge miss spratt awoke with a start and looked at her watch it was the cave was empty save for a crumpled page of newspaper she glanced at this idly and saw that it was the local herald eight days old far away on the horizon william bales was throwing stones bitterly at the still retreating sea xiii the portuguese cigar everything promised well for my weekend with charles the weather was warm and sunny i was bringing my golf clubs down with me and i had just discovered and meant to put into practice an entirely new stance which made it impossible to miss the object ball it was this that i was explaining to charles and his wife at dinner on friday when the interruption occurred by the way said charles as i took out a cigarette ive got a cigar for you dont smoke that thing you havent let him go in for cigars i said reproachfully to mrs charles i can be very firm about other peoples extravagances this is one i picked up in portugal explained charles you can get them absurdly cheap out there lets see dear where did i put it i saw it on your dressingtable last week said his wife getting up to leave us he followed her out and went in search of it while i waited with an interest which i made no effort to conceal i had never heard before of a man going all the way to portugal to buy one cigar for a friend here it is said charles coming in again he put down in front of me an ashtray the matches and a and a well a cigar i examined it slowly half of it looked very tired well said charles what do you think of it when you say you er picked it up in portugal i began carefully i suppose you dont mean i stopped and tried to bite the end off have a knife said charles i had another bite and then i decided to be frank why did you pick it up i asked the fact was said charles i found myself one day in lisbon without my pipe and so i bought that thing i never smoke them in the ordinary way did you smoke this i asked it was obvious that something had happened to it no you see i found some cigarettes at the last moment and so knowing that you liked cigars i thought id bring it home for you its very nice of you charles of course i can see that it has travelled well we must do what we can with it i took the knife and started chipping away at the mahogany end the other end the brownpaper end which had come ungummed i intended to reserve for the match when everything was ready i applied a light leant back in my chair and pulled thats all right isnt it said charles youd be surprised if i told you what i paid for it no no you mustnt think that i protested probably things are dearer in portugal i put it down by my plate for a moments rest all ive got against it at present is that its pores dont act as freely as they should ive got a cigarcutter somewhere if no dont bother i think i can do it with the nutcrackers theres no doubt it was a good cigar once but it hasnt wintered well i squeezed it as hard as i could lit it again pressed my feet against the table and pulled now its going said charles im afraid it keeps very reticent at my end the followthrough is poor is your end alight still burning beautifully its a pity that i should be missing all that how would it be if we were to make a knittingneedle redhot and bore a tunnel from this end we might establish a draught that way only theres always the danger of course of coming out at the side i took the cigar up and put it to my ear i cant hear anything wrong i said i expect what it really wants is massage charles filled his pipe again and got up lets go for a stroll he said its a beautiful night bring your cigar with you it may prefer the open air i said theres always that you know we mustnt lose sight of the fact that the portuguese climate is different from ours the things pores may have acted more readily in the south on the other hand the unfastened end may have been more adhesive i gather that though you have never actually met anybody who has smoked a cigar like this yet you understand that the experiment is a practicable one as far as you know this had no brothers no no charles im going on with it but i should like to know all that you can tell me of its parentage it had a portuguese father and an american mother i should say and there has been a good deal of trouble in the family one moment and as we went outside i stopped and cracked it in the door it was an inspiration at the very next application of the match i found that i had established a connection with the lighted end not a long and steady connection but one that came in gusts after two gusts i decided that it was perhaps safer to blow from my end and for a little while we had in this way as much smoke around us as the most fastidious cigarsmoker could want then i accidentally dropped it something in the middle of it shifted i suppose and for the rest of my stay behind it only one end was at work well said charles when we were back in the smokingroom and i was giving the cigar a short breather its not a bad one is it i have enjoyed it i said truthfully for i like trying to get the mastery over a thing that defies me youll never guess what it cost he chuckled tell me i said i darent guess well in english money it works out at exactly three farthings i looked at him for a long time and then shook my head sadly charles old friend i said youve been done xiv a cold world herbert is a man who knows all about railway tickets and packing and being in time for trains and things like that but i fancy i have taught him a lesson at last he wont talk quite so much about tickets in future i was just thinking about getting up when he came into my room he looked at me in horror my dear fellow he said and you havent even packed youll be late here get up and ill pack for you while you dress do i said briefly first of all what clothes are you going to travel in there was no help for it i sat up in bed and directed operations right said herbert now what about your return ticket you mustnt forget that you remind me of a little story i said ill tell it you while you pack that will be nice for you once upon a time i lost my return ticket and i had to pay two pounds for another and a month afterwards i met a man a man like you who knows all about tickets and he said you could have got the money back if you had applied at once so i said give me a cigarette now and ill transfer all my rights in the business to you and he gave me a cigarette but unfortunately it was too late no unfortunately it wasnt he got the two pounds the most expensive cigarette ive ever smoked well that just shows you said herbert heres your ticket put it in your waistcoat pocket now but i havent got a waistcoat on silly which one are you going to put on i dont know yet this is a matter which requires thought give me time give me air well i shall put the ticket here on the dressingtable and then you cant miss it he looked at his watch and the trap starts in half an hour help i cried and i leapt out of bed half an hour later i was saying goodbye to herbert ive had an awfully jolly time i said and ill come again youve got the ticket all right rather and i drove away amidst cheers cheers of sorrow it was halfanhours drive to the station for the first five minutes i thought how sickening it was to be leaving the country then i had a slight shock and for the next twentyfive minutes i tried to remember how much a third single to the nearest part of london cost because i had left my ticket on the dressingtable after all i gave my luggage to a porter and went off to the stationmaster i wonder if you can help me i said ive left my ticket on the dress well we neednt worry about that ive left it at home he didnt seem intensely excited what did you think of doing he asked i had rather hoped that you would do something you can buy another ticket and get the money back afterwards yes yes but can i ive only got about one pound six the fare to london is one pound five and tenpence hapenny ah well that leaves a penny hapenny to be divided between the porter this end lunch tea the porter the other end and the cab i dont believe its enough even if i gave it all to the porter here think how reproachfully he would look at you ever afterwards it would haunt you the stationmaster was evidently moved he thought for a moment and then asked if i knew anybody who would vouch for me i mentioned herbert confidently he had never even heard of herbert ive got a tiepin i said stationmasters have a weakness for tiepins and a watch and a cigarette case i shall be happy to lend you any of those the idea didnt appeal to him the best thing you can do he said is to take a ticket to the next station and talk to them there this is only a branch line and i have no power to give you a pass so that was what i had to do i began to see myself taking a ticket at every stop and appealing to the stationmaster at the next well the money would last longer that way but unless i could overcome quickly the distrust which i seemed to inspire in stationmasters there would not be much left for lunch i gave the porter all i could afford a hapenny mentioned apologetically that i was coming back and stepped into the train at the junction i jumped out quickly and dived into the sacred office ive left my ticket on the dressing that is to say i forgot well anyhow i havent got it i began and we plunged into explanations once more this stationmaster was even more unemotional than the last he asked me if i knew anybody who could vouch for me i mentioned herbert diffidently he had never even heard of herbert i showed him my gold watch my silver cigarette case and my emerald and diamond tiepin that was the sort of man i was the best thing you can do he said walking with me to the door is to take a ticket to plymouth and speak to the stationmaster there this is a most interesting game i said bitterly what is home when you speak to the stationmaster at london i suppose ive a good mind to say snap extremely annoyed i strode out and bumped into youll never guess herbert ah here you are he panted i rode after you the train was just going jumped into it been looking all over the station for you its awfully nice of you herbert didnt i say goodbye your ticket he produced it left it on the dressingtable he took a deep breath i told you you would bless you i said as i got happily into my train youve saved my life ive had an awful time i say do you know ive met two stationmasters already this morning whove never even heard of you you must enquire into it at that moment a porter came up did you give up your ticket sir he asked herbert i hadnt time to get one said herbert quite at his ease ill pay now and he began to feel in his pockets the train moved out of the station a look of horror came over herberts face i knew what it meant he hadnt any money on him hi he shouted to me and then we swung round a bend out of sight well well hell have to get home somehow his watch is only nickel and his cigarette case leather but luckily that sort of thing doesnt weigh much with stationmasters what they want is a wellknown name as a reference herbert is better off than i was he can give them my name it will be idle for them to pretend that they have never heard of me xv a breath of life this is the story of a comedy which nearly became a tragedy in its way it is rather a pathetic story the comedy was called the wooing of winifred it was written by an author whose name i forget produced by the wellknown and as his press agent has often told us popular actormanager mr levinski and played by among others that very charming young man prosper vane known locally as alfred briggs until he took to the stage prosper played the young hero dick seaton who was actually wooing winifred mr levinski himself took the part of a middleaged man of the world with a slight embonpoint down in the programme as sir geoffrey throssell but fortunately still mr levinski his opening words as he came on were ah dick i have a note for you somewhere which gave the audience an interval in which to welcome him while he felt in all his pockets for the letter one can bow quite easily while feeling in ones pockets and it is much more natural than stopping in the middle of an important speech in order to acknowledge any cheers the realisation of this by a dramatist is what is called stagecraft in this case the audience could tell at once that the technique of the author whose name unfortunately i forget was going to be all right but perhaps i had better describe the whole play as shortly as possible the theme as one guessed from the title even before the curtain rose was the wooing of winifred in the first act dick proposed to winifred and was refused by her not from lack of love but for fear lest she might spoil his career he being one of those bighearted men with a hippocket to whom the open spaces of the world call loudly whereupon mr levinski took winifred on one side and told the audience how when he had been a young man some good woman had refused him for a similar reason and had been miserable ever since accordingly in the second act winifred withdrew her refusal and offered to marry dick who declined to take advantage of her offer for fear that she was willing to marry him from pity rather than from love whereupon mr levinski took dick on one side and told the audience how when he had been a young man he had refused to marry some good woman a different one for a similar reason and had been brokenhearted ever afterwards in the third act it really seemed as though they were coming together at last for at the beginning of it mr levinski took them both aside and told the audience a parable about a butterfly and a snapdragon which was both pretty and helpful and caused several middleaged ladies in the first and second rows of the upper circle to say what a nice man mr levinski must be at home dear the purport of the allegory being to show that both dick and winifred were being very silly as indeed by this time everybody but the author was aware unfortunately at that moment a footman entered with a telegram for miss winifred which announced that she had been left fifty thousand pounds by a dead uncle in australia and although mr levinski seized this fresh opportunity to tell the audience how in similar circumstances pride to his lasting remorse had kept him and some good woman a third one apart nevertheless dick held back once more for fear lest he should be thought to be marrying her for her money the curtain comes down as he says goodbye goodbereye but there is a fourth act and in the fourth act mr levinski has a splendid time he tells the audience two parables one about a dahlia and a sheep which i couldnt quite follow and three reminiscences of life in india he brings together finally and for ever these hesitating lovers and best of all he has a magnificent lovescene of his own with a pretty widow in which we see for the first time in the play how love should really be made not boyandgirl prettypretty love but the deep emotion felt and with occasional lapses of memory explained by a middleaged man with a slight embonpoint who has knocked about the world a bit and knows life mr levinski i need hardly say was at his best in this act i met prosper vane at the club some ten days before the first night and asked him how rehearsals were going oh all right he said but its a rotten play ive got such a dashed silly part from what you told me i said it sounded rather good its so dashed unnatural for three whole acts this girl and i are in love with each other and we know were in love with each other and yet we simply fool about shes a dashed pretty girl too my boy in real life id jolly soon my dear alfred i protested youre not going to fall in love with the girl you have to fall in love with on the stage i thought actors never did that they do sometimes its a dashed good advertisement anyway its a silly part and im fed up with it yes but do be reasonable if dick got engaged at once to winifred what would happen to levinski hed have nothing to do prosper vane grunted as he seemed disinclined for further conversation i left him the opening night came and the usual distinguished and fashionable audience including myself such as habitually attends mr levinskis first nights settled down to enjoy itself two acts went well at the end of each mr levinski came before the curtain and bowed to us and we had the honour of clapping him loud and long then the third act began now this is how the third act ends exit sir geoffrey winifred breaking the silence dick you heard what he said dont let this silly money come between us i have told you i love you dear wont you wont you speak to me dick winifred i he gets up and walks round the room his brow knotted his right fist occasionally striking his left palm finally he comes to a stand in front of her winifred i he raises his arms slowly at right angles to his body and lets them fall heavily down again i cant in a low hoarse voice i cant he stands for a moment with bent head then with a jerk he pulls himself together goodbye his hands go out to her but he draws them back as if frightened to touch her nobly goodbereye he squares his shoulders and stands looking at the audience with his chin in the air then with a shrug of utter despair which would bring tears into the eyes of any young thing in the pit he turns and with bent head walks slowly out curtain that is how the third act ends i went to the dress rehearsal and so i know how the accident happened i do not know i suppose prosper was nervous i am sure he was very much in love anyhow this is how on that famous first night the third act ended exit sir geoffrey winifred breaking the silence dick you heard what he said dont let this silly money come between us i have told you i love you dear wont you wont you speak to me dick jumping up winifred i with a great gulp i love you whereupon he picked her up in his arms and carried her triumphantly off the stage and after a little natural hesitation the curtain came down behind the scenes all was consternation mr levinski absolutely furious had a hasty consultation with the author also furious in the course of which they both saw that the fourth act as written was now an impossibility poor prosper who had almost immediately recovered his sanity tremblingly suggested that mr levinski should announce that owing to the sudden illness of mr vane the fourth act could not be given mr levinski was kind enough to consider this suggestion not entirely stupid his own idea having been very regretfully to leave out the two parables and three reminiscences from india and concentrate on the lovescene with the widow yes yes he said your plan is better i will say you are ill it is true you are mad tomorrow we will play it as it was written you cant said the author gloomily the critics wont come till the fourth act and theyll assume that the third act ended as it did tonight the fourth act will seem all nonsense to them true and i was so good so much myself in that act he turned to prosper you fool or theres another way began the author we might and then a gentleman in the gallery settled it from the front of the curtain there was nothing in the programme to show that the play was in four acts the time is the presentday and the scene is in sir geoffrey throssells townhouse was all it said and the gentleman in the gallery thinking it was all over and being pleased with the play and particularly with the realism of the last moment of it shouted author and suddenly everybody else cried author author the play was ended i said that this was the story of a comedy which nearly became a tragedy but it turned out to be no tragedy at all in the three acts to which prosper vane had condemned it the play appealed to both critics and public for the fourth act as he recognised so clearly was unnecessary and would have spoilt the balance of it entirely best of all the shortening of the play demanded that some entertainment should be provided in front of it and this enabled mr levinski to introduce to the public professor wollabollacolla and princess collabollawolla the famous exponents of the bongobongo that fascinating central african war dance which was soon to be the rage of society but though as a result the takings of the box office surpassed all mr levinskis previous records our friend prosper vane received no practical acknowledgment of his services he had to be content with the hand and heart of the lady who played winifred and the fact that mr levinski was good enough to attend the wedding there was in fact a photograph in all the papers of mr levinski doing it xvi the doctor may i look at my watch i asked my partner breaking a silence which had lasted from the beginning of the waltz oh have you got a watch she drawled how exciting i wasnt going to show it to you i said but i always think it looks so bad for a man to remove his arm from a ladys waist in order to look at his watch i mean without some sort of apology or explanation as though he were wondering if he could possibly stick another five minutes of it let me know when the apology is beginning said miss white perhaps after all her name wasnt white but anyhow she was dressed in white and its her own fault if wrong impressions arise it begins at once ive got to catch a train home theres one at i believe if i started now i could just miss it you dont live in these northern heights then no do you yes i looked at my watch again i should love to discuss with you the relative advantages of london and greater london i said the flats and cats of one and the big gardens of the other but just at the moment the only thing i can think of is whether i shall like the walk home are there any dangerous passes to cross its a nice wet night for a walk said miss white reflectively if only i had brought my bicycle a watch and a bicycle you are lucky look here it may be a joke to you but i dont fancy myself coming down the mountains at night the last train goes at one oclock if thats any good to you all the good in the world i said joyfully then i neednt walk i looked at my watch that gives us five minutes more i could almost tell you all about myself in that time it generally takes longer than that said miss white at least it seems to she sighed and added my partners have been very autobiographical tonight i looked at her severely im afraid youre a suffragette i said as soon as the next dance began i hurried off to find my hostess i had just caught sight of her when our dance isnt it said a voice i turned and recognised a girl in blue ah i said coldly cheerful i was just looking for you come along we broke into a gay and happy step suggestive of twin hearts utterly free from care why do you look so thoughtful asked the girl in blue after ten minutes of it ive just heard some good news i said oh do tell me i dont know if it would really interest you im sure it would well several miles from here there may be a tram if one can find it which goes nobody quite knows where up till onethirty in the morning probably it is now i added looking at my watch i was getting quite good at this just on one oclock and raining hard all is well the dance over i searched in vain for my hostess every minute i took out my watch and seemed to feel that another tram was just starting off to some unknown destination at last i could bear it no longer and deciding to write a letter of explanation on the morrow i dashed off my instructions from miss white with regard to the habitat of trams thrown in by her at the last moment in case the train failed me were vague five minutes walk convinced me that i had completely lost any good that they might ever have been to me instinct and common sense were the only guides left i must settle down to some heavy detective work the steady rain had washed out any footprints that might have been of assistance and i was unable to follow up the slot of a tram conductor of which i had discovered traces in twohundredandfiftyfirst street in threethousandeighthundredandninetyseventh street i lay with my ear to the ground and listened intently for i seemed to hear the tingting of the electric car but nothing came of it and in fourmillionth street i made a new resolution i decided to give up looking for trams and to search instead for london the london that i knew i felt pretty certain that i was still in one of the home counties and i did not seem to remember having crossed the thames so that if only i could find a star which pointed to the south i was in a fair way to get home i set out to look for a star with the natural result that having abandoned all hope of finding a man i immediately ran into him now then he said goodnaturedly could you tell me the way to i tried to think of some place near my london to westminster abbey he looked at me in astonishment his feeling seemed to be that i was too late for the coronation and too early for the morning service or or anywhere i said hurriedly trams for instance he pointed nervously to the right and disappeared imagine my joy there were tramlines and better still a tram approaching i tumbled in gave the conductor a penny and got a workmans ticket in exchange ten minutes later we reached the terminus i had wondered where we should arrive but didnt much mind so long as i was again within reach of a cab however as soon as i stepped out of the tram i knew at once where i was tell me i said to the conductor do you now go back again in ten minutes theres a tram from here every halfhour when is the last theres no last backwards and forwards all night i should have liked to stop and sympathise but it was getting late i walked a hundred yards up the hill and turned to the right as i entered the gates i could hear the sound of music isnt this our dance i said to miss white who was taking a breather at the hall door one moment i added and i got out of my coat and umbrella is it i thought youd gone oh no i decided to stay after all i found out that the trams go all night we walked in together i wont be more autobiographical than i can help i said but i must say its hard life a doctors one is called away in the middle of a dance to a difficult case of of mumps or something and well there you are a delightful evening spoilt if one is lucky one may get back in time for a waltz or two at the end indeed i said as we began to dance at one time tonight i quite thought i wasnt going to get back here at all xvii the financier this is how i became a west african mining magnate with a stake in the empire during february i grew suddenly tired of waiting for the summer to begin london in the summer is a pleasant place and chiefly so because you can keep on buying evening papers to read the cricket news in february life has no such excitements to offer so i wrote to my solicitor about it i want you i wrote to buy me fifty rubber shares so that i can watch them go up and down and i added brokerage oneeighth to show that i knew what i was talking about he replied tersely as follows dont be a fool if you have any money to invest i can get you a safe mortgage at five per cent let me know its a funny thing how the minds of solicitors run upon mortgages if they would only stop to think for a moment they would see that you couldnt possibly watch a safe mortgage go up and down i left my solicitor alone and consulted henry on the subject in the intervals between golf and golf henry dabbles in finance you dont want anything giltedged i gather he said its wonderful how they talk i want it to go up and down i explained patiently and i indicated the required movement with my umbrella what about a little flutter in oil he went on just like a financier in a novel ill have a little flutter in raspberry jam if you like anything as long as i can rush every night for the last edition of the evening papers and say now and then good heavens im ruined then youd better try a gold mine said henry bitterly in the voice of one who has tried take your choice and he threw the paper over to me i dont want a whole mine only a vein or two yes this is very interesting i went on as i got among the west africans the scoring seems to be pretty low i suppose it must have been a wet wicket he reef he did a little better in the second innings boffin river they followed on you see but they saved the innings defeat by the way which figure do i really keep my eye on when i want to watch them go up and down both one eye on each and dont talk about boffin river to me is it like that henry i am sorry i suppose its too late now to offer you a safe mortgage at five per cent i know a man who has some well perhaps youre right on the next day i became a magnate the jaguar mine was the one i fixed upon for two reasons first the figure immediately after it was which struck me as a good point from which to watch it go up and down secondly i met a man at lunch who knew somebody who had actually seen the jaguar mine he says that theres no doubt about there being lots there lots of what jaguars or gold ah he didnt say perhaps he meant jaguars anyhow it was an even chance and i decided to risk it in a weeks time i was the owner of what we call in the city a block of jaguars bought from one herbert bellingham who i suppose had been got at by his solicitor and compelled to return to something safe i was a west african magnate my first two months as a magnate were a great success with my heart in my mouth i would tear open the financial editions of the evening papers to find one day that jaguars had soared like a rocket to the next that they had dropped like a stone to there was one terrible afternoon when for some reason which will never be properly explained we sank to i think the european situation had something to do with it though this naturally is not admitted lord rothschild i fancy suddenly threw all his jaguars on the market he sold and sold and sold and only held his hand when in desperation the tsar granted the concession for his new southend to siberia railway something like that but he never recked how the private investor would suffer and there was i sitting at home and sending out madly for all the papers until my rooms were littered with copies of the times the financial news answers the feathered world and home chat next day we were up to and i breathed again but i had other pleasures than these previously i had regarded the city with awe but now i felt a glow of possession come over me whenever i approached it often in those first two months i used to lean against the mansion house in a familiar sort of way once i struck a match against the royal exchange and what an impression of financial acumen i could make in a drawingroom by a careless reference to my block of jaguars even those who misunderstood me and thought i spoke of my flock of jaguars were startled indeed life was very good just then but lately things have not been going well at the beginning of april jaguars settled down at though i stood for hours at the club tape my hair standing up on end and my eyeballs starting from their sockets jaguars still came through steadily at to give them a chance of doing something i left them alone for a whole week with what agony you can imagine then i looked again a whole week and anything might have happened pauper or millionaire no still worse was to follow editors actually took to leaving out jaguars altogether i suppose they were sick of putting in every edition but how ridiculous it made my idea seem of watching them go up and down how blank life became again and now what i dreaded most of all has happened i have received a progress report from the mine it gives the total footage for the month special reference being made to crosscutting winzing and sinking the amount of tons crushed is announced there is serious talk of ore being extracted indeed there has already been a most alarming yield in fine gold in short it can no longer be hushed up that the property may at any moment be placed on a dividendpaying basis probably i shall be getting a safe five per cent dash it all as i said to my solicitor this morning i might just as well have bought a rotten mortgage xviii the things that matter ronald surveying the world from his taxi that pleasant corner of the world st jamess park gave a sigh of happiness the blue sky the lawn of daffodils the mist of green upon the trees were but a promise of the better things which the country held for him beautiful as he thought the daffodils he found for the moment an even greater beauty in the gladstone bags at his feet his eyes wandered from one to the other and his heart sang to him im going away im going away im going away the train was advertised to go at and at ronald joined the easter holiday crowd upon the platform a porter put down his luggage and was then swallowed up in a sea of perambulators and flustered parents ronald never saw him again at amidst some applause the train came in ronald seized a lost porter just put these in for me he said a first smoker all this lot yours sir the three bags not the milkcans said ronald it had been a beautiful day before but when a family of sixteen which joined ronald in his carriage was ruthlessly hauled out by the guard the sun seemed to shine with a warmth more caressing than ever even when the train moved out of the station and the children who had been mislaid emerged from their hidingplaces and were bundled in anywhere by the married porters ronald still remained splendidly alone and the sky took on yet a deeper shade of blue he lay back in his corner thinking for a time his mind was occupied with the thoughts common to most of us when we go away thoughts of all the things we have forgotten to pack i dont think you could fairly have called ronald overanxious about clothes he recognised that it was the inner virtues which counted that a welldressed exterior was nothing without some graces of mind or body but at the same time he did feel strongly that if you are going to stay at a house where you have never visited before and if you are particularly anxious to make a good impression it is a pity that an accident of packing should force you to appear at dinner in green knickerbockers and somebody elses velvet smokingjacket ronald couldnt help feeling that he had forgotten something it wasnt the spare sponge it wasnt the extra shavingbrush it wasnt the second pair of bedroom slippers just for a moment the sun went behind a cloud as he wondered if he had included the reserve razorstrop but no he distinctly remembered packing that the reason for his vague feeling of unrest was this he had been interrupted while getting ready that afternoon and as he left whatever he had been doing in order to speak to his housekeeper he had said to himself if youre not careful youll forget about that when you come back and now he could not remember what it was he had been doing nor whether he had in the end forgotten to go on with it was he selecting his ties or brushing his hair or the country was appearing field by field the train rushed through cuttings gay with spring flowers blue was the sky between the baby clouds but it all missed ronald what could he have forgotten he went over the days that were coming he went through all the changes of toilet that the hours might bring he had packed this and this and this and this he was all right for the evening supposing they played golf he was all right for golf he might want to ride he would be able to ride it was too early for lawn tennis but well anyhow he had put in flannels as he considered all the possible clothes that he might want it really seemed that he had provided for everything if he liked he could go to church on friday morning hunt otters from twelve to one on saturday toboggan or dig for badgers on monday he had the different suits necessary for those who attend a waterpolo meeting who play chess or who go out after moths with a pot of treacle and even in the last resort he could go to bed yes he was all right he had packed everything moreover his hair was brushed and he had no smut upon his face with a sigh of relief he lowered the window and his soul drank in the beautiful afternoon we are going away we are going away we are going away sang the train at the prettiest of wayside stations the train stopped and ronald got out there were horses to meet him better than a car thought ronald on an afternoon like this the luggage was collected nothing left out he chuckled to himself and was seized with an insane desire to tell the coachman so and then they drove off through the fresh green hedgerows ronald trying hard not to cheer his host was at the door as they arrived ronald as happy as a child jumped out and shook him warmly by the hand and told him what a heavenly day it was receiving with smiles of pleasure the news in return that it was almost like summer youre just in time for tea really we might have it in the garden by jove we might said ronald beaming however they had it in the hall with the doors wide open ronald sitting lazily with his legs stretched out and a cup of tea in his hands and feeling already on the friendliest terms with everybody wondered again at the difference which the weather could make to ones happiness you know he said to the girl on his right on a day like this nothing seems to matter and then suddenly he knew that he was wrong for he had discovered what it was which he had told himself not to forget what it was which he had indeed forgotten and suddenly the birds stopped singing and there was a bitter chill in the air and the sun went violently out he was wearing only halfapair of spats three stories xix the making of a christmas story yuletide london at yuletide a mantle of white lay upon the embankment where our story opens gleaming and glistening as it caught the rays of the cold december sun an embroidery of white fringed the trees and under a canopy of white the proud palaces of savoy and cecil reared their silent heads the mighty river in front was motionless for the finger of death had laid its icy hand upon it above the hard blue sky stretching to eternity below the white purity of innocence london in the grip of winter editor come i like this this is going to be good a cold day was it not author very all at once the quiet of the morning was disturbed in the distance a bell rang out sending a joyous pan to the heavens another took up the word and then another and another westminster caught the message from bartholomew the son of thunder and flung it to giles without who gave it gently to andrew by the wardrobe suddenly the air was filled with bells all chanting together of peace and happiness mirth and jollity a frenzy of bells the duke father of four fine children waking in his highland castle heard and smiled as he thought of his little ones the merchant prince turning over in his magnificent residence heard and turned again to sleep with love for all mankind in his heart the pauper in his workhouse up betimes heard and chuckled at the prospect of his christmas dinner and on the embankment robert hardrow with a cynical smile on his lips listened to the splendid irony of it editor we really are getting to the story now are we not author that was all local colour i want to make it quite clear that it was christmas editor yes yes quite so this is certainly a christmas story i think i shall like robert do you know it was christmas day so much at least was clear to him with that same cynical smile on his lips he pulled his shivering rags about him and half unconsciously felt at the growth of beard about his chin nobody would recognise him now his friends as he had thought them would pass by without a glance for the poor outcast near them the women that he had known would draw their skirts away from him in horror even lady alice lady alice the cause of it all his thoughts flew back to that last scene but twentyfour hours ago when they had parted for ever as he had entered the hall he had half wondered to himself if there could be anybody in the world that day happier than himself tall wellconnected a vicepresident of the tariff reform league and engaged to the sweetest girl in england he had been the envy of all little did he think that that very night he was to receive his cong what mattered it now how or why they had quarrelled a few hasty words a bitter taunt tears and then the end a last cry from her go and let me never see your face again a last sneer from him i will go but first give me back the presents i have promised you then a slammed door and silence what use without her guidance to try to keep straight any more bereft of her love robert had sunk steadily gambling drink morphia billiards and cigars he had taken to them all until now in the wretched figure of the outcast on the embankment you would never have recognised the once spruce figure of handsome hardrow editor it all seems to have happened rather rapidly does it not twentyfour hours ago he had been author you forget that this is a short story handsome hardrow how absurd it sounded now he had let his beard grow his clothes were in rags a scar over one eye testified editor yes yes of course i quite admit that a man might go to the bad in twentyfour hours but would his beard grow as author look here youve heard of a man going grey with trouble in a single night havent you editor certainly author well its the same idea as that editor ah quite so quite so author where was i editor a scar over one eye was just testifying i suppose he had two eyes in the ordinary way testified to a drunken frolic of an hour or two ago never before thought the policeman as he passed upon his beat had such a pitiful figure cowered upon the embankment and prayed for the night to cover him the he was er the editor yes author to tell the truth i am rather stuck for the moment editor what is the trouble author i dont quite know what to do with robert for ten hours or so editor couldnt he go somewhere by a local line author this is not a humorous story the point is that i want him to be outside a certain house some twenty miles from town at eight oclock that evening editor if i were robert i should certainly start at once author no i have it as he sat there his thoughts flew over the bridge of years and he was wafted on the wings of memory to other and happier yuletides that christmas when he had received his first bicycle that christmas abroad the merry houseparty at the place of his cambridge friend yuletide at the towers where he had first met alice ah ten hours passed rapidly thus author i put stars to denote the flight of years editor besides it will give the reader time for a sandwich robert got up and shook himself editor one moment this is a christmas story when are you coming to the robin author i really cant be bothered about robins just now i assure you all the best christmas stories begin like this nowadays we may get to a robin later i cannot say editor we must my readers expect a robin and they shall have it and a wassailbowl and a turkey and a christmastree and a author yes yes but wait we shall come to little elsie soon and then perhaps it will be all right editor little elsie good robert got up and shook himself then he shivered miserably as the cold wind cut through him like a knife for a moment he stood motionless gazing over the stone parapet into the dark river beyond and as he gazed a thought came into his mind why not end it all here and now he had nothing to live for one swift plunge and editor you forget the river was frozen author dash it i was just going to say that but no even in this fate was against him the river was frozen over he turned away with a curse what happened afterwards robert never quite understood almost unconsciously he must have crossed one of the numerous bridges which span the river and join north london to south once on the other side he seems to have set his face steadily before him and to have dragged his weary limbs on and on regardless of time and place he walked like one in a dream his mind drugged by the dull narcotic of physical pain suddenly he realised that he had left london behind him and was in the more open spaces of the country the houses were more scattered the recurring villa of the clerk had given place to the isolated mansion of the stockbroker each residence stood in its own splendid grounds surrounded by fine old forest trees and approached by a long carriage sweep electric editor quite so the whole forming a magnificent estate for a retired gentleman never mind that robert stood at the entrance to one of these houses and the iron entered into his soul how different was this mans position from his own what right had this man a perfect stranger to be happy and contented in the heart of his family while he robert stood a homeless wanderer alone in the cold almost unconsciously he wandered down the drive hardly realising what he was doing until he was brought up by the gay lights of the windows still without thinking he stooped down and peered into the brilliantly lit room above him within all was jollity beautiful women moved to and fro and the happy laughter of children came to him elsie he heard some one call and a childish treble responded editor now for the robin author i am very sorry i have just remembered something rather sad the fact is that two days before elsie had forgotten to feed the robin and in consequence it had died before this story opens editor that is really very awkward i have already arranged with an artist to do some pictures and i remember i particularly ordered a robin and a wassail what about the wassail author elsie always had her porridge upstairs a terrible thought had come into roberts head it was nearly twelve oclock the houseparty was retiring to bed he heard the goodnights wafted through the open window the lights went out to reappear upstairs presently they too went out and robert was alone with the darkened house the temptation was too much for a conscience already sodden with billiards golf and cigars he flung a leg over the sill and drew himself gently into the room at least he would have one good meal he too would have his christmas dinner before the end came he switched the light on and turned eagerly to the table his eyes ravenously scanned the contents turkey mincepies plumpudding all was there as in the days of his youth editor this is better i ordered a turkey i remember what about the mistletoe and holly i rather think i asked for some of them author we must let the readers take something for granted editor i am not so sure couldnt you say something like this holly and mistletoe hung in festoons upon the wall indeed even holly and mistletoe hung in festoons upon the wall editor thank you with a sigh of content hardrow flung himself into a chair and seized a knife and fork soon a plate liberally heaped with good things was before him greedily he set to work with the appetite of a man who had not tasted food for several hours dood evening said a voice are you father kwistmas robert turned suddenly and gazed in amazement at the whiterobed figure in the doorway elsie he murmured huskily editor how did he know and why huskily author he didnt know he guessed and his mouth was full are you father kwistmas repeated elsie robert felt at his chin and thanked heaven again that he had let his beard grow almost mechanically he decided to wear the mask in short to dissemble yes my dear he said i just looked in to know what you would like me to bring you youre late arent oo oughtnt oo to have come this morning editor this is splendid this quite reconciles me to the absence of the robin but what was elsie doing downstairs author i am making robert ask her that question directly editor yes but just tell me now between friends author she had left her golliwog in the room and couldnt sleep without it editor i knew that was it if im late dear said robert with a smile why so are you the good food and wine in his veins were doing their work and a pleasant warmth was stealing over hardrow he found to his surprise that airy banter still came easy to him to what he continued do i owe the honour of this meeting i came downstairs for my dolly said elsie the one you sent me this morning do you remember of course i do my dear and what have you bwought me now father kwistmas robert started if he was to play the rle successfully he must find something to give her now the remains of the turkey a pair of fingerbowls his old hat all these came hastily into his mind and were dismissed he had nothing of value on him all had been pawned long ago stay the gold locket studded with diamonds and rubies which contained alices photograph the one memento of her that he had kept even when the pangs of starvation were upon him he brought it from its restingplace next his heart a little something to wear round your neck child he said see thank oo said elsie why it opens yes it opens said robert moodily why its alith sister alith editor ha

opened editor ha again what are you doing here elsie said a voice go to bed child why who is this father kwithmath thithter editor how exactly do you work the lisping author what do you mean dont children of elsies tender years lisp sometimes editor yes but just now she said kwistmas quite correctly author i am glad you noticed that that was an effect which i intended to produce lisping is brought about by placing the tongue upon the hard surface of the palate and in cases where the subject is unduly excited or influenced by emotion the lisp becomes more pronounced in this case editor yeth i thee send her away cried robert without raising his head the door opened and closed again well said alice calmly and who are you you may have lied to this poor child but you cannot deceive me you are not father christmas the miserable man raised his shamefaced head and looked haggardly at her alice he muttered dont you remember me she gazed at him earnestly robert but how changed since we

unnerved by excess i have deliberately broken into this house your house in order to obtain food already i have eaten more than half a turkey and the best part of a plum pudding i with a gesture of infinite compassion she stopped him then let us forgive each other she said with a smile a new year is beginning robert he took her in his arms listen he said in the distance the bells began to ring in the new year a message of hope to all weary travellers on lifes highway it was new years day editor i thought christmas day had started on the embankment this would be boxing day author im sorry but it must end like that i must have my bells editor thats all very well i have a good deal to explain as it is some of your story doesnt fit the pictures at all and it is too late now to get new ones done author i am afraid i cannot work to order editor yes i know the artist said the same thing well i must manage somehow i suppose goodbye rotten weather for august isnt it xx a matteroffact fairy tale once upon a time there was a king who had three sons the two eldest were lazy goodfornothing young men but the third son whose name was charming was a delightful youth who was loved by everybody outside his family who knew him whenever he rode through the town the people used to stop whatever work they were engaged upon and wave their caps and cry hurrah for prince charming and even after he had passed they would continue to stop work in case he might be coming back the same way when they would wave their caps and cry hurrah for prince charming again it was wonderful how fond of him they were but alas his father the king was not so fond he preferred his eldest son which was funny of him because he must have known that only the third and youngest son is ever any good in a family indeed the king himself had been a third son so he had really no excuse for ignorance on the point i am afraid the truth was that he was jealous of charming because the latter was so popular outside his family now there lived in the palace an old woman called countess caramel who had been governess to charming when he was young when the queen lay dying the countess had promised her that she would look after her youngest boy for her and charming had often confided in caramel since one morning when his family had been particularly rude to him at breakfast charming said to her countess i have made up my mind and i am going into the world to seek my fortune i have been waiting for this said the countess here is a magic ring wear it always on your little finger and whenever you want help turn it round once and help will come charming thanked her and put the ring on his finger then he turned it round once just to make sure that it worked immediately the oddest little dwarf appeared in front of him speak and i will obey said the dwarf now charming didnt want anything at all just then so after thinking for a moment he said go away the dwarf a little surprised disappeared this is splendid thought charming and he started on his travels with a light heart the sun was at its highest as he came to a thick wood and in its shade he lay down to rest he was awakened by the sound of weeping rising hastily to his feet he peered through the trees and there fifty yards away from him by the side of a stream sat the most beautiful damsel he had ever seen wringing her hands and sobbing bitterly prince charming grieving at the sight of beauty in such distress coughed and came nearer princess he said tenderly for he knew she must be a princess you are in trouble how can i help you fair sir she answered i had thought to be alone but since you are here you can help me if you will i have a a brother but charming did not want to talk about brothers he sat down on a fallen log beside her and looked at her entranced i think you are the most lovely lady in all the world he said am i said the princess whose name by the way was beauty she looked away from him and there was silence between them charming a little at a loss fidgeted nervously with his ring and began to speak again ever since i have known you you are in need of help said the dwarf appearing suddenly certainly not said charming angrily not in the least i can manage this quite well by myself speak and i will obey then go away said charming and the dwarf who was beginning to lose his grip of things again disappeared the princess having politely pretended to be looking for something while this was going on turned to him again come with me she said and i will show you how you can help me she took him by the hand and led him down a narrow glade to a little clearing in the middle of the wood then she made him sit down beside her on the grass and there she told him her tale there is a giant called blunderbus she said who lives in a great castle ten miles from here he is a terrible magician and years ago because i would not marry him he turned my my brother into a i dont know how to tell you into a a tortoise she put her hands to her face and sobbed again why a tortoise said charming knowing that sympathy was useless but feeling that he ought to say something i dont know he just thought of it it it isnt a very nice thing to be and why should he turn your brother into it i mean if he had turned you into a tortoise of course he went on hurriedly im very glad he didnt thank you said beauty but i dont understand why he knew he could hurt me more by making my brother a tortoise than by making me one she explained and looked at him anxiously this was a new idea to charming who had two brothers of his own and he looked at her in some surprise oh what does it matter why he did it she cried as he was about to speak why do giants do things i dont know princess said charming remorsefully and kissed her hand tell me how i can help you my brother said beauty was to have met me here he is late again she sighed and added he used to be so punctual but how can i help him asked charming it is like this the only way in which the enchantment can be taken off him is for some one to kill the giant but if once the enchantment has stayed on for seven years then it stays on for ever here she looked down and burst into tears the seven years she sobbed are over at sundown this afternoon i see said charming thoughtfully here is my brother cried beauty an enormous tortoise came slowly into view beauty rushed up to him and having explained the situation rapidly made the necessary introduction charmed said the tortoise you cant miss the castle its the only one near here and blunderbus is sure to be at home i need not tell you how grateful i shall be if you kill him though i must say he added it puzzles me to think how you are going to do it i have a friend who will help me said charming fingering his ring well i only hope youll be luckier than the others the others cried charming in surprise yes didnt she tell you about the others who tried i forgot to said beauty frowning at him ah well perhaps in that case wed better not go into it now said the tortoise but before you start i should like to talk to you privately for a moment he took charming on one side and whispered i say do you know anything about tortoises very little said charming in fact then you dont happen to know what they eat im afraid i dont dash it why doesnt anybody know the others all made the most ridiculous suggestions steak and kidney puddings shrimp sandwiches and buttered toast dear me the nights we had after the shrimp sandwiches and the fool swore he had kept tortoises all his life if i may say so said charming i should have thought that you would have known best the same silly idea they all have said the tortoise testily when blunderbus put this enchantment on me do you suppose he got a blackboard and a piece of chalk and gave me a lecture on the diet and habits of the common tortoise before showing me out of the front gate no he simply turned me into the form of a tortoise and left my mind and soul as it was before ive got the anatomy of a tortoise ive got the very delicate inside of a tortoise but i dont think like one stupid else i shouldnt mind being one i never thought of that no one does except me and i can think of nothing else he paused and added confidently were trying rum omelettes just now somehow i dont think tortoises really like them however we shall see i suppose youve never heard anything definite against them you neednt bother about that said charming briskly by tonight you will be a man again and he patted him encouragingly on the shell and returned to take an affectionate farewell of the princess as soon as he was alone charming turned the ring round his finger and the dwarf appeared before him the same as usual said the dwarf preparing to vanish at the word he was just beginning to get into the swing of it no no said charming hastily i really want you this time he thought for a moment i want he said at last a sword one that will kill giants instantly a gleaming sword was at his feet he picked it up and examined it is this really a magic sword it has but to inflict one scratch said the dwarf and the result is death charming who had been feeling the blade took his thumb away hastily then i shall want a cloak of darkness he said behold here it is beneath this cloak the wearer is invisible to the eyes of his enemies one thing more said charming a pair of sevenleague boots thank you that is all today directly the dwarf was gone charming kicked off his shoes and stepped into the magic boots then he seized the sword and the cloak and darted off on his ladys behest he had barely gone a hundred paces before a sudden idea came to him and he pulled himself up short let me see he reflected the castle was ten miles away these are sevenleague boots so that i have come about two thousand miles i shall have to go back he took some hasty steps back and found himself in the wood from which he had started well said princess beauty have you killed him no nno stammered charming not exactly killed him i was just just practising something the fact is he added confidently ive got a pair of new boots on and he saw the look of cold surprise in her face and went on quickly i swear princess that i will not return to you again without his head he took a quick step in the direction of the castle and found himself soaring over it turned eleven miles off and stepped back a pace overshot it again and arrived at the very feet of the princess his head said beauty eagerly i i must have dropped it said charming hastily pretending to feel for it ill just go and he stepped off in confusion eleven miles the wrong side of the castle charming sat down to think it out it was but two hours to sundown without his magic boots he would get to the castle too late of course what he really wanted to do was to erect an isosceles triangle on a base of eleven miles having two sides of twentyone miles each but this was before euclids time however by taking one step to the north and another to the southwest he found himself close enough a short but painful walk with his boots in his hand brought him to his destination he had a moments hesitation about making a first call at the castle in his stockinged feet but consoled himself with the thought that in lifeanddeath matters one cannot bother about little points of etiquette and that anyhow the giant would not be able to see them then donning the magic cloak and with the magic sword in his hand he entered the castle gates for an instant his heart seemed to stop beating but the thought of the princess gave him new courage the giant was sitting in front of the fire his great spiked club between his knees at charmings entry he turned round gave a start of surprise bent forward eagerly a moment and then leant back chuckling like most overgrown men he was naturally kindhearted and had a simple humour but he could be stubborn when he liked the original affair of the tortoise seems to have shown him both at his best and at his worst why do you walk like that he said pleasantly to charming the baby is not asleep charming stopped short you see me he cried furiously of course i do really you mustnt expect to come into a house without anything on your feet and not be a little noticeable even in a crowd i should have picked you out that miserable dwarf said charming savagely swore solemnly to me that beneath this cloak i was invisible to the eyes of my enemies but then we arent enemies smiled the giant sweetly i like you immensely theres something about you directly you came in i think it must be love at first sight so thats how he tricked me oh no it wasnt really like that the fact is you are invisible beneath that cloak only youll excuse my pointing it out there are such funny bits of you that arent beneath the cloak youve no idea how odd you look just a head and two legs and a couple of arms waists he murmured to himself are not being worn this year but charming had had enough of talk griping his sword firmly he threw aside his useless cloak dashed forward and with a beautiful lunge pricked his enemy in the ankle victory he cried waving his magic sword above his head thus is beautys brother delivered the giant stared at him for a full minute then he put his hands to his sides and fell back shaking in his chair her brother he roared well of all the her brother he rolled on the floor in a paroxysm of mirth her brother oh you youll kill me her bbbbbrother her bbbb her bbb her bb the world suddenly seemed very cold to charming he turned the ring on his finger well said the dwarf i want said charming curtly to be back at home riding through the streets on my cream palfrey amidst the cheers of the populace at once an hour later princess beauty and prince udo who was not her brother gazed into each others eyes and beautys last illusion went youve altered she said slowly yes im not really much like a tortoise said udo humorously i meant since seven years ago youre much stouter than i thought time hasnt exactly stood still with you you know beauty yet you saw me every day and went on loving me well er he shuffled his feet and looked away didnt you well you see of course i wanted to get back you see and as long as you i mean if we if you thought we were in love with each other then of course you were ready to help me and so youre quite old and bald i cant think why i didnt notice it before well you wouldnt when i was a tortoise said udo pleasantly as tortoises go i was really quite a youngster besides anyhow one never notices baldness in a tortoise i think said beauty weighing her words carefully i think youve gone off a good deal in looks the last day or two charming was home in time for dinner and the next morning he was more popular than ever outside his family as he rode through the streets of the city but blunderbus lay dead in his castle you and i know that he was killed by the magic sword yet somehow a strange legend grew up around his death and ever afterwards in that country when one man told his neighbour a more than ordinarily humorous anecdote the latter would cry in between the gusts of merriment dont youll make me die of laughter and then he would pull himself together and add with a sigh like blunderbus xxi the seaside novelette may be read on the pier no xcviii a simple english girl chapter i primrose farm primrose farm stood slumbering in the sunlight of an early summer morn save for the gentle breeze which played in the tops of the two tall elms all nature seemed at rest chanticleer had ceased his song the pigs were asleep in the barn the cow lay thinking a deep peace brooded over the rural scene the peace of centuries terrible to think that in a few short hours but perhaps it wont the truth is i have not quite decided whether to have the murder in this story or in no xcix the severed thumb we shall see as her alarum clock a birthday present struck five gwendolen french sprang out of bed and plunged her face into the clump of nettles which grew outside her lattice window for some minutes she stood there breathing in the incense of the day then dressing quickly she went down into the great oakbeamed kitchen to prepare breakfast for her father and the pigs as she went about her simple duties she sang softly to herself a song of love and knightly deeds little did she think that a lover even at that moment stood outside her door heighho sighed gwendolen and she poured the branmash into a bowl and took it up to her fathers room for eighteen years gwendolen french had been the daughter of john french of primrose farm endowed by nature with a beauty that is seldom seen outside this sort of story she was yet as modest and as good a girl as was to be found in the county many a fine lady would have given all her parisian diamonds for the peachlike complexion which bloomed on the fair face of gwendolen but the gifts of nature are not to be bought and sold there was a sudden knock at the door come in cried gwendolen in surprise unless it was the cow it was an entirely unexpected visitor a tall and handsome young man entered striking his head violently against a beam as he stepped into the lowceilinged kitchen good morning he said repressing the remark which came more readily to his lips pray forgive this intrusion the fact is i have lost my way and i wondered whether you would be kind enough to inform me as to my whereabouts gwendolen curtsied this is primrose farm sir she said i fear he replied with a smile it has been my misfortune never to have heard so charming a name before i am lord beltravers of beltravers castle beltravers having returned last night from india i came out for an early stroll this morning and i fear that i have wandered out of my direction why cried gwendolen your lordship is miles from beltravers castle how tired and hungry you must be she removed a lettuce from the kitchenchair dusted it and offered it to him that is to say the chair let me get you some milk she added picking up a pail she went out to inspect the cow gad said lord beltravers as soon as he was alone he paced rapidly up and down the tiled kitchen deuce take it he added recklessly shes a lovely girl the beltraverses were noted in two continents for their hard swearing here you are sir said gwendolen returning with the precious liquid lord beltravers seized the pail and drained it at a draught heavens but that was good he said what was it milk said gwendolen milk i must remember and now may i trespass on your hospitality still further by trespassing on your assistance so far as to solicit your help in putting me far enough on my path to discover my way back to beltravers castle when he was alone he said that sentence again to himself and wondered what had happened to it i will show you she said simply they passed out into the sunlit orchard in an appletree a thrush was singing the gooseberries were overripe beetroots were flowering everywhere you are very beautiful he said yes said gwendolen i must see you again listen tonight my mother lady beltravers is giving a ball do you dance alas not the tango she said sadly the beltraverses do not tang he announced with simple dignity you valse good then will you come thank you my lord oh i should love to that is excellent and now i must bid you goodbye but first will you not tell me your name gwendolen french my lord ah one f or two three said gwendolen simply chapter ii beltravers castle beltravers castle was a blaze of lights at the head of the old oak staircase a magnificent example of the selfridge period the lady beltravers stood receiving her guests magnificently gowned in one of rumpelmeyers latest creations and wearing round her neck the famous beltravers seedpearls she looked the picture of stately magnificence as each guest was announced by a bevy of footmen she extended her perfectlygloved hand and spoke a few words of kindly welcome good evening duchess so good of you to look in ah earl charmed to meet you youll find some sandwiches in the billiardroom beltravers show the earl some sandwiches howdoyoudo professor delighted you could come wont you take off your goloshes all the county was there lord hobble was there wearing a magnificent stud erasmus belt the famous author whose novel bitten a romance went into two editions sir septimus root the inventor of the fireproof spat captain the honourable alfred nibbs the popular breeder of bloodgoldfish the whole world and his wife were present and towering above them all stood lord beltravers of beltravers castle beltravers lord beltravers stood aloof in a corner of the great ballroom above his head was the proud coatofarms of the beltraverses a headless sardine on a field of tomato as each new arrival entered lord beltravers scanned his or her countenance eagerly and then turned away with a snarl of disappointment would his little country maid never come she came at last attired in a frock which had obviously been created in little popley she looked the picture of girlish innocence as she stood for a moment hesitating in the doorway then her eyes brightened as lord beltravers came towards her with long swinging strides youre here he exclaimed how good of you to come i have thought of you ever since this morning there is a valse beginning will you valse it with me thank you said gwendolen shyly lord beltravers who valsed divinely put his arm round her waist and led her into the circle of dancers chapter iii affianced the ball was at its height gwendolen who had been in to supper eight times placed her hand timidly on the arm of lord beltravers who had just begged a polka of her let us sit this out she said not here in the garden yes said lord beltravers gravely let us go i have something to say to you offering her his arm he led her down the great terrace which ran along the back of the house how wonderful to have your ancestors always round you like this cooed gwendolen as she gazed with reverence at the two statues which fronted them venus said lord beltravers shortly and samson he led her down the steps and into the ornamental garden and there they sat down miss french said lord beltravers or if i may call you by that sweet name gwendolen i have brought you here for the purpose of making an offer to you perhaps it would have been more in accordance with etiquette had i approached your mother first mother is dead said the girl simply i am sorry said lord beltravers bending his head in courtly sympathy in that case i should have asked your father to hear my suit father is deaf she replied he couldnt have heard it tut tut said lord beltravers impatiently i beg your pardon he added at once i should have controlled myself that being so he went on i have the honour to make to you miss french an offer of marriage may i hope gwendolen put her hand suddenly to her heart the shock was too much for her fresh young innocence she was not really engaged to giles earwaker though he too was hoping and the only three times that thomas ritson had kissed her she had threatened to box his ears lord beltravers she began call me beltravers he begged beltravers i love you i give you a simple maidens heart my darling he cried clasping her thumb impulsively then we are affianced he slipped a ring off his finger and fitted it affectionately on two of hers wear this he said gravely it was my mothers she was a de dindigul see this is their crest a roeless herring over the motto dans lhuile observing that she looked puzzled he translated the noble french words to her and now let us go in another dance is beginning may i beg for the honour beltravers she whispered lovingly chapter iv exposure the next dance was at its height in a dream of happiness gwendolen revolved with closed eyes round lord beltravers of beltravers castle beltravers suddenly above the music rose a voice commanding threatening stop cried the lady beltravers as if by magic the band ceased and all the dancers were still there is an intruder here said lady beltravers in a cold voice a milkmaid a common farmers daughter gwendolen french leave my house this instant dazed hardly knowing what she did gwendolen moved forward in an instant lord beltravers was after her no mother he said with the utmost dignity not a common milkmaid but the future lady beltravers an indescribable thrill of emotion ran through the crowded ballroom lord hobbles stud fell out and lady susan golightly hurried across the room and fainted in the arms of sir james batt what cried the lady beltravers my son the last of the beltraverses the beltraverses who came over with julius wernher i should say csar marry a milkmaid no mother he is marrying what any man would be proud to marry a simple english girl there was a cheer instantly suppressed from a socialist in the band for just a moment words failed the lady beltravers then she sank into a chair and waved her guests away the ball is over she said slowly leave me my son and i must be alone one by one with murmured thanks for a delightful evening the guests trooped out soon mother and son were alone lord beltravers gazing out of the window saw the cellist laboriously dragging his cello across the park chapter v wedded and now dear readers i am in a difficulty how shall the story go on the editor of the seaside library asks quite frankly for a murder his idea was that the lady beltravers should be found dead in the park next morning and that gwendolen should be arrested this seems to me both crude and vulgar besides i want a murder for no xcix of the series the severed thumb no i think i know a better way out old john french sat beneath a spreading peartree and waited early that morning a mysterious note had been brought to him asking for an interview on a matter of the utmost importance this was the trystingplace i have come said a voice behind him to ask you to beg your daughter i have come cried the lady beltravers to ask you i have come shouted her ladyship to john french wheeled round in amazement with a cry the lady beltravers shrank back eustace she gasped eustace earl of turbot eliza what are you doing here i came to see john french what he asked with his hand to his ear she repeated her remark loudly several times i am john french he said at last when you refused me and married beltravers i suddenly felt tired of society and i changed my name and settled down here as a simple farmer my daughter helps me on the farm then your daughter is lady gwendolen hake a beautiful double wedding was solemnised at beltravers in october the earl of turbot leading eliza lady beltravers to the altar while lord beltravers was joined in matrimony to the beautiful lady gwendolen hake there were many presents on both sides which partook equally of the beautiful and the costly lady gwendolen beltravers is now the most popular hostess in the county but to her husband she always seems the simple english milkmaid that he first thought her ah outofdoors xxii the first of spring there may be gardeners who can appear to be busy all the year round doing even in the winter their little bit under glass but for myself i wait reverently until the nd of march is here then spring having officially arrived i step out on to the lawn and summon my headgardener james i say the winter is over at last what have we got in that big brownlooking bed in the middle there well sir he says we dont seem to have anything do we like perhaps theres something down below that hasnt pushed through yet maybe there is i wish you knew more about it i say angrily i want to bed out the macaroni there have we got a spare bed with nothing going on underneath i dont know sir shall i dig em up and have a look yes perhaps youd better i say between ourselves james is a man of no initiative he has to be told everything however mention of him brings me to my first rule for young gardeners never sow spring onions and new potatoes in the same bed i did this by accident last year the fact is when the onions were given to me i quite thought they were young daffodils a mistake any one might make of course i dont generally keep daffodils and potatoes together but james swore that the hard round things were tulip bulbs it is perfectly useless to pay your headgardener halfacrown a week if he doesnt know the difference between potatoes and tulip bulbs well anyhow there they were in the herbaceous border together and they grew up side by side the onions getting stronger every day and the potatoes more sensitive at last just when they were ripe for picking i found that the young onions had actually brought tears to the eyes of the potatoes to such an extent that the latter were too damp for baking or roasting and had to be mashed now as everybody knows mashed potatoes are beastly the rhubarb border gives me more trouble than all the rest of the garden i started it a year ago with the idea of keeping the sun off the young carnations it acted excellently and the complexion of the flowers improved tenfold then one day i discovered james busily engaged in pulling up the rhubarb what are you doing i cried do you want the young carnations to go all brown i was going to send some in to the cook he grumbled to the cook what do you mean rhubarb isnt a vegetable no its a fruit i looked at james anxiously he had a large hat on and the sun couldnt have got to the back of his neck my dear james i said i dont pay you halfacrown a week for being funny perhaps we had better make it two shillings in future however he persisted in his theory that in the spring people stewed rhubarb in tarts and ate it well i have discovered since that this is actually so people really do grow it in their gardens not with the idea of keeping the sun off the young carnations but under the impression that it is a fruit consequently i have found it necessary to adopt a firm line with my friends rhubarb on arriving at any house for a visit the first thing i say to my host is may i see your rhubarb bed i have heard such a lot about it by all means he says feeling rather flattered and leads the way into the garden what a glorious sunset i say pointing to the west isnt it he says turning round and then i surreptitiously drop a pint of weedkiller on the bed next morning i get up early and paint the roots of the survivors with iodine once my host who for some reason had got up early too discovered me what are you doing he asked just painting the roots with iodine i said to prevent the rhubarb falling out to prevent what to keep the green fly away i corrected myself its the new french intensive system but he was suspicious and i had to leave two or three stalks untreated we had those for lunch that day there was only one thing for a selfrespecting man to do i obtained a large plateful of the weed and emptied the sugar basin and cream jug over it then i took a mouthful of the pastry gave a little start and said oh is this rhubarb im sorry i didnt know whereupon i pushed my plate away and started on the cheese asparagus asparagus wants watching very carefully it requires to be tended like a child frequently i wake up in the middle of the night and wonder if james has remembered to put the hotwater bottle in the asparagus bed whenever i get up to look i find that he has forgotten he tells me today that he is beginning to think that the things which are coming up now are not asparagus after all but young hyacinths this is very annoying i am inclined to fancy that james is not the man he was for the sake of his reputation in the past i hope he is not potting out i have spent a very busy morning potting out the nasturtiums we have them in three qualities mild medium and full nasturtiums are extremely peppery flowers and take offence so quickly that the utmost tact is required to pot them successfully in a general way all the red or reddish flowers should be potted as soon as they are old enough to stand it but it is considered bad form among horticulturists to pot the white james has been sowing the roses i wanted all the pink ones in one bed and all the yellow ones in another and so on but james says you never can tell for certain what colour a flower is going to be until it comes up of course any fool could tell then you should go by the picture on the outside of the packet i said theyre very misleading said james anyhow they must be all brothers in the same packet you might have a brother with red hair says james i hadnt thought of that grafting grafting is when you try short approaches over the pergola in somebody elses garden and break the best tulip you mend it with a hapenny stamp and hope that nobody will notice at any rate not until you have gone away on the monday of course in your own garden you never want to graft i hope at some future time to be allowed even encouraged to refer to such things as the most artistic way to frame cucumbers how to stop tomatoes blushing the homoeopathic method of putting them next to the french beans is now discredited and spring fashions in fox gloves but for the moment i have said enough the great thing to remember in gardening is that flowers fruits and vegetables alike can only be cultivated with sympathy special attention should be given to backward and delicate plants they should be encouraged to make the most of themselves never forget that flowers like ourselves are particular about the company they keep if a hyacinth droops in the celery bed put it among the pansies but above all mind a firm hand with the rhubarb xxiii the coming of the crocus its a bootiful day again sir said my gardener james looking in at the study window bootiful james bootiful i said as i went on with my work you might almost say as spring was here at last like cross your fingers quickly james and touch wood look here ill be out in a minute and give you some orders but im very busy just now thought youd like to know theres eleven crocuses in the front garden then send them away weve got nothing for them crocuses shouted james i jumped up eagerly and climbed through the window my dear man i said shaking him warmly by the hand this is indeed a day crocuses and in the front gar on the south lawn let us go and gaze at them there they were eleven of them six golden ones four white and a little mauve chap this is a triumph for you james its wonderful has anything like this ever happened to you before therell be some more up tomorrow i wont say as not those really are growing are they you havent been pushing them in from the top they were actually born on the estate therell be a fine one in the back bed soon said james proudly in the back my dear james in the spare bed on the northeast terrace i suppose you mean and what have we done in the dutch ornamental garden if i has to look after ornamental gardens and south aspics and all i ought to have my salary raised said james still harping on his one grievance by all means raise some celery i said coldly take the spade and raise some for lunch i shall be only too delighted this here isnt the season for celery as you know well this heres the season for crocuses as any one can see if they use their eyes james youre right forgive me it is no day for quarrelling it was no day for working either the sun shone upon the closecropped green of the deer park the sky was blue above the rose garden in the tapioca grove a thrush was singing i walked up and down my estate and drank in the good fresh air james i called to my headgardener what is it now he grumbled are there no daffodils to take the winds of march with beauty theres these eleven croc but there should be daffodils too is not this march it may be march but tisnt the time for daffodils not on three shillings a week do you only get three shillings a week i thought it was three shillings an hour likely an hour ah well i knew it was three shillings do you know james in the scilly islands there are fields and fields and fields of nodding daffodils out now lor said james did you say lor or liar i asked suspiciously to think of that now said james cautiously he wandered off to the tapioca grove leant against it in thought for a moment and came back to me whats wrong with this little bit of garden this here park he began is the soil its no soil for daffodils now what daffodils like is clay then for heavens sake get them some clay spare no expense get them anything they fancy its too alloovial thats whats the matter too alloovial now crocuses like a bit of alloovial thats where you have it the matter with james is that he hasnt enough work to do the rest of the staff is so busily employed that it is hardly ever visible william for instance is occupied entirely with what i might call the poultry it is his duty in fact to see that there are always enough ants eggs for the goldfish all these prize leghorns you hear about are the merest novices compared with williams proteges then john looks after the staggery henry works the coloured fountain and peter paints the peacocks tails this keeps them all busy but james is for ever hanging about almost seems as if they were yooman he said as we stood and listened to the rooks oh are you there james its a beautiful day who said that first i believe you did them there rooks always make a place seem so homelike rooks and crocuses i say and you dont want anything more yes well if the rooks want to build in the raspberry canes this year let them james dont be inhospitable course some do like to see primroses i dont say but primroses i knew there was something where are they its too early for them said james hastily you wont get primroses now before april dont say now as if it were my fault why didnt you plant them earlier i dont believe you know any of the tricks of your profession james you never seem to graft anything or prune anything and im sure you dont know how to cut a slip james why dont you prune more prune now i should like to watch you wheres your pruninghook you cant possibly do it with a rake james spends most of his day with a rake sometimes leaning on it sometimes working with it the beds are always beautifully kept only the most hardy annual would dare to poke his head up and spoil the smooth appearance of the soil for those who like circles and rectangles of unrelieved brown james is undoubtedly the man as i stood in the sun i had a brilliant idea james i said well cut the croquet lawn this afternoon you cant play croquet today its not warm enough i dont pay you to argue but to obey at the same time i should like to point out that i never said i was going to play croquet i said that we meaning you would cut the lawn whats the good of that why to encourage the wonderful day of course where is your gratitude man dont you want to do something to help how can we let a day like this go past without some word of welcome out with the mower and let us hail the passing of winter james looked at me in disgust gratitude he said indignantly to heaven and theres my eleven crocuses in the front all asinging together like anything on three bob a week xxiv the landscape gardener really i know nothing about flowers by a bit of luck james my gardener whom i pay halfacrown a week for combing the beds knows nothing about them either so my ignorance remains undiscovered but in other peoples gardens i have to make something of an effort to keep up appearances without flattering myself i may say that i have acquired a certain manner i give the impression of the garden lover or the man with shares in a seedcompany or or something for instance at creek cottage mrs atherley will say to me thats an amphilobertus gemini pointing to something which i hadnt noticed behind a rake i am not a bit surprised i say calmly and a gladiophinium banksii next to it i suspected it i confess in a hoarse whisper towards flowers whose names i know i adopt a different tone arent you surprised to see daffodils out so early says mrs atherley with pride there are lots out in london i mention casually in the shops so there are grapes says miss atherley i was not talking about grapes i reply stiffly however at creek cottage just now i can afford to be natural for it is not gardening which comes under discussion these days but landscapegardening and any one can be an authority on that the atherleys fired by my tales of sandringham chatsworth arundel and other places where i am constantly spending the weekend are readjusting their twoacre field in future it will not be called the garden but the grounds i was privileged to be shown over the grounds on my last visit to creek cottage here said mrs atherley we are having a plantation it will keep the wind off and we shall often sit here in the early days of summer thats a weeping ash in the middle theres another one over there theyll be lovely you know whats that i asked pointing to a bit of black stick on the left which even more than the other trees gave the impression of having been left there by the gardener while he went for his lunch thats a weeping willow this is rather a tearful corner of the grounds apologised miss atherley well show you something brighter directly look there thats the oak in which king charles lay hid at least it will be when its grown a bit lets go on to the shrubbery said mrs atherley we are having a new grass path from here to the shrubbery its going to be called henrys walk miss atherley has a small brother called henry also there were eight kings of england called henry many a time and oft one of those nine henrys has paced up and down this grassy walk his head bent his hands clasped behind his back while behind his furrowed brow who shall say what worldschemes were hatching is it the thought of wolsey which makes him frown or is he wondering where he left his catapult ah who can tell us let us leave a veil of mystery over it for the sake of the next visitor the shrubbery said mrs atherley proudly waving her hand at a couple of laurel bushes and a ive forgotten its name now but it is one of the few shrubs i really know and if youre a gentleman said miss atherley and want to get asked here again youll always call it the shrubbery really i dont see what else you could call it i said wishing to be asked down again the patch true i said i mean nonsense i was rather late for breakfast next morning a pity on such a lovely spring day im so sorry i began but i was looking at the shrubbery from my window and i quite forgot the time good said miss atherley i must thank you for putting me in such a perfect room for it i went on warming to my subject one can actually see the shrubs er shrubbing the plantation too seems a little thicker to me than yesterday i expect it is in fact the tennis lawn i looked round anxiously i had a sudden fear that it might be the new deerpark it still is the tennis lawn i asked yes why what about it i was only going to say the tennis lawn had quite a lot of shadows on it oh theres no doubt that the plantation is really asserting itself eleven oclock found me strolling in the grounds with miss atherley you know i said as we paced henrys walk together the one thing the plantation wants is for a bird to nest in it that is the hallmark of a plantation its mothers birthday tomorrow wouldnt it be a lovely surprise for her it would indeed unfortunately this is a matter in which you require the cooperation of a feathered friend couldnt you try to persuade a bird to build a nest in the weeping ash just for this once youre asking me a very difficult thing i said doubtfully anything else i would do cheerfully for you but to dictate to a bird on such a very domestic affair no im afraid i must refuse it need only just begin to build one pleaded miss atherley because mothers going up town by your train tomorrow as soon as shes out of the house the bird can go back to anywhere else it likes better i will put that to any bird i see today i said but i am doubtful oh well sighed miss atherley never mind what do you think cried mrs atherley as she came in to breakfast next day theres a bird been nesting in the plantation miss atherley looked at me in undisguised admiration i looked quite surprised i know i did well well i said you must come out afterwards and see the nest and tell me what bird it is there are three eggs in it i am afraid i dont know much about these things im glad i said thankfully i mean i shall be glad to we went out eagerly after breakfast on about the only tree in the plantation with a fork to it a nest balanced precariously it had in it three paleblue eggs splotched with lightbrown it appeared to be a blackbirds nest with another egg or two to come its been very quick about it said miss atherley of our feathered bipeds i said frowning at her the blackbird is notoriously the most hasty isnt it lovely said mrs atherley she was still talking about it as she climbed into the trap which was to take us to the station one moment i said ive forgotten something i dashed into the house and out by a side door and then sprinted for the plantation i took the nest from the weeping and overweighted ash and put it carefully back in the hedge by the tennislawn then i returned more leisurely to the house if ever you want a job of landscapegardening thoroughly well done you can always rely upon me xxv patball youll play tennis said my hostess absently thats right let me introduce you to miss er um oh weve met before smiled miss ive forgotten the name again now thank you i said gratefully i thought it was extremely nice of her to remember me probably i had spilt lemonade over her at a dance and in some way the incident had fixed itself in her mind we do these little things you know and think nothing of them at the moment but all the time smooth said a voice i looked up and found that a pair of opponents had mysteriously appeared and that my partner was leading the way on to the court ill take the righthand side if you dont mind she announced oh and what about apologising she went on shall we do it after every stroke or at the end of each game or when we say goodbye or never i get so tired of saying sorry oh but we shant want to apologise im sure were going to get on beautifully together i suppose youve played a lot this summer no not at all yet but im feeling rather strong and ive got a new racquet one way and another i expect to play a very powerful game our male opponent served he had what i should call a nasty swift service the first ball rose very suddenly and took my partner on the side of the head sorry she apologised its all right i said magnanimously i returned the next into the net the third clean bowled my partner and off the last i was caught in the slips one love will you serve said miss i wish i could remember her surname her christian name was hope or charity or something like that i know when i heard it i thought it was just as well if i might call her miss hope for this once thank you will you serve said miss hope in the righthand court i use the american service which means that i never know till the last moment which side of the racquet is going to hit the ball on this occasion it was a dead heat that is to say i got it in between with the wood and the ball sailed away over beds and beds of the most beautiful flowers oh is that the american service said miss hope much interested south american i explained down in peru they never use anything else in the lefthand court i employ the ordinary hampstead smash into the bottom of the net after four hampstead smashes and four peruvian teasers love two i felt that another explanation was called for ive got a new racquet ive never used before i said my old one is being pressed it went to the shop yesterday to have the creases taken out dont you find that with a new racquet you er exactly in the third game we not only got the ball over the net but kept it between the white lines on several occasions though not so often as our opponents three love and in the fourth game miss hope served gentle lobs while i at her request stood close up to the net and defended myself with my racquet i warded off the first two shots amidst applause thirty love and dodged the next three thirty forty but the last one was too quick for me and won the cocoanut with some ease game love four its all right thanks i said to my partner it really doesnt hurt a bit now then lets buck up and play a simply dashing game miss hope excelled herself in that fifth game but i was still unable to find a length to be more accurate i was unable to find a shortness my long game was admirably strong and lofty are you musical said my partner at the end of it five love she had been very talkative all through come come i said impatiently you dont want a song at this very moment surely you can wait till the end of the set oh i was only just wondering i quite see your point you feel that nature always compensates us in some way and that as oh no said miss hope in great confusion i didnt mean that at all she must have meant it you dont talk to people about singing in the middle of a game of tennis certainly not to comparative strangers who have only spilt lemonade over your frock once before no no it was an insult and it nerved me to a great effort i discarded for it was my serve the hampstead smash i discarded the peruvian teaser instead i served two piccadilly benders from the righthand court and two westminster welts from the lefthand the piccadilly bender is my own invention it can only be served from the one court and it must have a wind against it you deliver it with your back to the net which makes the striker think that you have either forgotten all about the game or else are apologising to the spectators for your previous exhibition then with a violent contortion you slue your body round and serve whereupon your opponent perceives that you are playing and that it is just one more ordinary fault into the wrong court so she calls fault in a contemptuous tone and drops her racquet and then adds hurriedly oh no sorry it wasnt a fault after all that being where the wind comes in the westminster welt is in theory the same as the hampstead smash but goes over the net one must be in very good form or have been recently insulted to bring this off well we won that game a breeze having just sprung up and carried away by enthusiasm and mutual admiration we collected another five two then it was miss hopes serve again goodbye i said i suppose you want me in the forefront again please i dont mind her shots the bottle of scent is absolutely safe but im afraid hell win another packet of woodbines miss hope started off with a double which was rather a pity and then gave our masculine adversary what is technically called one to kill i saw instinctively that i was the one and i held my racquet ready with both hands our opponent who had been wanting his tea for the last two games was in no mood of dalliance he fairly let himself go over this shot in a moment i was down on my knees behind the net and the next moment i saw through the meshes a very strange thing the other man with his racquet on the ground was holding his eye with both hands dont you think said miss hope two five abandoned that your overhead volleying is just a little severe xxvi ten and eight the only event of importance last week was my victory over henry by ten and eight if you dont want to hear about that then i shall have to pass on to you a few facts about his motorbicycle youd rather have the other i thought so the difference between henry and me is that he is what i should call a good golfer and i am what everybody else calls a bad golfer in consequence of this he insults me with offers of bisques ill have ten this time i said as we walked to the tee better have twelve i beat you with eleven yesterday thank you i said haughtily i will have ten it is true that he beat me last time but then owing to bad management on my part i had nine bisques left at the moment of defeat simply eating their heads off henry teed up and drove a pink spot out of sight henry swears by the pink spot if there is anything of a wind i use either a quo vadis which is splendid for going out of bounds or an ostrich which has a wonderful way of burying itself in the sand i followed him to the green at my leisure five said henry seven said i and if i take three bisques its my hole you must only take one at a time protested henry why theres nothing in baedeker about it besides i will only take one at a time if it makes it easier for you i take one and that brings me down to six and then another one and that brings me down to five and then another one and that brings me down to four there and as you did the hole in five i win well of course if you like to waste them all at the start im not wasting them im creating a moral effect behold i have won the first hole let us be photographed together henry went to the next tee slightly ruffled and topped his ball into the road i had kept mine well this side of it and won in four to five i shant take any bisques here i said two up at the third tee my quo vadis darted off suddenly to the left and tried to climb the hill i headed it off and gave it a nasty dent from behind when it wasnt looking and with my next shot started it rolling down the mountains with everincreasing velocity not until it was within a foot of the pin did it condescend to stop henry who had reached the green with his drive and had taken one putt too many halved the hole in four i took a bisque and was three up the fourth hole was prettily played by both of us and with two bisques i had it absolutely stiff unnerved by this henry went all out at the fifth and tried to carry the stream in two unfortunately i mean unfortunately for him the stream was six inches too broad in the particular place at which he tried to carry it my own view is that he should either have chosen another place or else have got a narrower stream from somewhere as it was i won in an uneventful six and took with a bisque the short hole which followed six up i pointed out to henry and three bisques left theyre jolly little things bisques but you want to use them quickly bisque dat qui cito dat doesnt the sea look ripping today go on growled henry i once did a two at this hole i said as i teed my ball if i did a two now and took a bisque youd have to do it in nothing in order to win a solemn thought at this hole you have to drive over a chasm in the cliffs my ball made a bee line for the beach bounced on a rock and disappeared into a cave henrys pink spot which really seemed to have a chance of winning a hole at last found the wind too much for it and followed me below im in this cave i said when we had found henrys ball and with a lighted match in one hand and a niblick in the other i went in and tried to persuade the ostrich to come out my eighth argument was too much for it and we reappeared in the daylight together how many i asked six he said as he hit the top of the cliff once more and shot back on to the beach i left him and chivied my ball round to where the cliffs are lowest then i got it gradually on to a little mound of sand very delicate work this took a terrific swing and fairly heaved it on to the grass two more strokes put me on to the green in twenty i lit a pipe and waited for henry to finish his game of rackets ive played twentyfive he shouted then youll want some of my bisques i said i can lend you three till monday henry had one more rally and then picked his ball up i had won seven holes and i had three bisques with which to win the match i was a little doubtful if i could do this but henry settled the question by misjudging yet again the breadth of the stream what is experience if it teaches us nothing henry must really try to enlarge his mind about rivers dormy nine i said at the tenth tee and no bisques left thank heaven for that sighed henry but i have only to halve one hole out of nine i pointed out technically i am on what is known as velvet oh shut up and drive i am a bad golfer but even bad golfers do holes in bogey now and then in the ordinary way i was pretty certain to halve one of the nine holes with henry and so win the match both the eleventh and the seventeenth for instance are favourites of mine had i halved one of those he would have admitted cheerfully that i had played good golf and beaten him fairly but as things happened what happened put quite briefly was this bogey for the tenth is four i hooked my drive off the tee and down a little gully to the left put a good iron shot into a bunker on the right and then ran down a hundredyard putt with a niblick for a three one of those difficult downhill putts luck said henry as soon as he could speak ive been missing those lately i said your match said henry i cant play against luck like that it was true that he had given me ten bisques but on the other hand i could have given him a dozen at the seventh and still have beaten him however i was too magnanimous to point that out all i said was ten and eight and then i added thoughtfully i dont think ive ever won by more than that xxvii an inland voyage thomas took a day off last monday in order to play golf with me for that day the admiralty had to get along without thomas i tremble to think what would have happened if war had broken out on monday could a thomasless admiralty have coped with it i trow not even as it was battleships grounded crews mutinied and several awkward questions in the house of commons had to be postponed till tuesday something some premonition of this no doubt seemed to be weighing on him all day rotten weather he growled as he came up the steps of the club im very sorry i said i keep on complaining to the secretary about it he does his best whats that he taps the barometer every morning and says it will clear up in the afternoon shall we go out now or shall we give it a chance to stop thomas looked at the rain and decided to let it stop i made him as comfortable as i could i gave him a drink a cigarette and mistakes with the mashie on the table at his elbow i had in reserve faulty play with the brassy and a west middlesex directory for myself i wandered about restlessly pausing now and again to read enviously a notice which said that c d toppings handicap was reduced from to lucky man at about halfpast eleven the rain stopped for a moment and we hurried out the course is a little wet i said apologetically as we stood on the first tee but with your naval experience you wont mind that by the way i ought to warn you that this isnt all casual water some of it is river how do you know which is which youll soon find out the river is much deeper go on your drive thomas won the first hole very easily we both took four to the green thomas in addition having five splashes of mud on his face while i only had three unfortunately the immediate neighbourhood of the hole was under water thomas the bounder had a small heavy ball which he managed to sink in nine my own being lighter refused to go into the tin at all and floated above the hole in the most exasperating way i expect theres a rule about it i said if we only knew which gives me the match however until we find that out i suppose you must call yourself one up i shall want some dry socks for lunch he muttered as he splashed off to the tee anything you want for lunch you can have my dear thomas i promise you that you shall not be stinted the next green is below sea level altogether im afraid the first in the water wins honours it turned out were divided i lost the hole and thomas lost his ball the third tee having disappeared we moved on to the fourth theres rather a nasty place along here i said the secretary was sucked in the other day and only rescued by the hair thomas drove a good one i topped mine badly and it settled down in the mud fifty yards off excuse me i shouted as i ran quickly after it and i got my niblick on to it just as it was disappearing it was a very close thing well said thomas as he reached his ball thats not what i call a brassy lie its what we call a corkscrew lie down here i explained if you havent got a corkscrew youd better dig round it with something and then when the position is thoroughly undermined oh good shot thomas had got out of the fairway in one but he still seemed unhappy my eye he said bending down in agony ive got about half middlesex in it he walked round in circles saying strange nautical things and my suggestions that he should rub the other eye and blow his nose suddenly were received ungenerously anything youd like me to do with my ears he asked bitterly if youd come and take some mud out for me instead of talking rot i approached with my handkerchief and examined the eye carefully see anything asked thomas my dear thomas its full of turf we mustnt forget to replace this if we can get it out what the secretary would say there hows that worse than ever try not to think about it keep the other eye on the ball as much as possible this is my hole by the way your ball is lost how do you know i saw it losing itself it went into the bad place i told you about its gone to join the secretary oh no we got him out of course i keep forgetting anyhow its my hole i think i shall turn my trousers up again said thomas bending down to do so is there a local rule about it no it is left entirely to the discretion and good taste of the members naturally a little extra license is allowed on a very muddy day of course if oh i see you meant a local rule about losing your ball in the mud no i dont know of one unless it comes under the heading of casual land be a sportsman thomas and dont begrudge me the hole the game proceeded and we reached the twelfth tee without any further contretemps save that i accidentally lost the sixth ninth and tenth holes and that thomas lost his iron at the eighth he had carelessly laid it down for a moment while he got out of a hole with his niblick and when he turned round for it the thing was gone at the twelfth tee it was raining harder than ever we pounded along with our coatcollars up and reached the green absolutely wet through how about it said thomas my hole i think and that makes us all square i mean how about the rain and its just one oclock just as you like well i suppose it is rather wet all right lets have lunch we had lunch thomas had it in the only dry things he had brought with him an ulster and a pair of vardon cuffs and sat as near the fire as possible it was still raining in torrents after lunch and thomas who is not what i call keen about golf preferred to remain before the fire perhaps he was right i raked up an old copy of stumers with the niblick for him and read bits of the telephone directory out aloud after tea his proper clothes were dry enough in places to put on and as it was still raining hard and he seemed disinclined to come out again i ordered a cab for us both its really rotten luck said thomas as we prepared to leave that on the one day when i take a holiday it should be so beastly beastly thomas i said in amazement the one day im afraid you dont play inland golf much i hardly ever play round london i thought not then let me tell you that todays was the best days golf ive had for three weeks golly said thomas xxviii one of our sufferers there is no question before the country of more importance than that of national health in my own small way i have made something of a study of it and when a royal commission begins its enquiries i shall put before it the evidence which i have accumulated i shall lay particular stress upon the health of thomson youll beat me today he said as he swung his club stiffly on the first tee i shant be able to hit a ball you should have some lessons i suggested thomson gave a snort of indignation its not that he said but ive been very seedy lately and thats all right i shant mind i havent played a thoroughly well man for a month now you know i think my liver i held up my hand not before my caddie please i said severely he is quite a child thomson said no more for the moment but hit his ball hard and straight along the ground its perfectly absurd he said with a shrug i shant be able to give you a game at all well if you dont mind playing a sick man not if you dont mind being one i replied and drove a ball which also went along the ground but not so far as my opponents there im about the only man in england who can do that when hes quite well the ball was sitting up nicely for my second shot and i managed to put it on the green thomsons fifty yards farther on was reclining in the worst part of a bunker which he had forgotten about well really he said theres an example of luck for you your ball i didnt do it on purpose i pleaded dont be angry with me he made two attempts to get out and then picked his ball up we walked in silence to the second tee this time i said i shall hit the sphere properly and with a terrific swing i stroked it gently into a gorse bush i looked at the thing in disgust and then felt my pulse apparently i was still quite well thomson forgetting about his liver drove a beauty we met on the green five i said only five asked thomson suspiciously six i said holing a very long putt thomsons health had a relapse he took four short putts and was down in seven its really rather absurd he said in a conversational way as we went to the next tee that putting should be so ridiculously important take that hole for instance i get on the green in a perfect three you fluff your drive completely and get on in what was it five i said again er five and yet you win the hole it is rather absurd isnt it ive often thought so i admitted readily that is to say when ive taken four putts im two up on the third tee thomsons health became positively alarming he missed the ball altogether its ridiculous to try to play he said with a forced laugh i cant see the ball at all its still there i assured him he struck at it again and it hurried off into a ditch look here he said wouldnt you rather play the pro this is not much of a match for you i considered of course a game with the pro would be much pleasanter than a game with thomson but ought i to leave him in his present serious condition of health his illness was approaching its critical stage and it was my duty to pull him through if i could no no i said lets go on the fresh air will do you good perhaps it will he said hopefully im sorry im like this but ive had a cold hanging about for some days and that on the top of my liver quite so i said the climax was reached at the next hole when with several strokes in hand he topped his approach shot into a bunker for my sake he tried to look as though he had meant to run it up along the ground having forgotten about the intervening hazard it was a brave effort to hide from me the real state of his health but he soon saw that it was hopeless he sighed and pressed his hand to his eyes then he held his fingers a foot away from him and looked at them as if he were trying to count them correctly his state was pitiable and i felt that at any cost i must save him i did the corner was turned at the fifth where i took four putts you arent going to win all the holes he said grudgingly as he ran down his putt convalescence set in at the sixth when i got into an impossible place and picked up oh well i shall give you a game yet he said two down the need for further bulletins ceased at the seventh hole which he played really well and won easily aha you wont beat me by much he said in spite of my liver by the way how is the liver i asked your freshair cure is doing it good of course it may come on again but he drove a screamer i think i shall be all right he announced all square he said cheerily at the ninth i fancy im going to beat you now not bad you know considering you were four up practically speaking i gave you a start of four holes i decided that it was time to make an effort again seeing that thomsons health was now thoroughly reestablished of the next seven holes i managed to win three and halve two it is only fair to say though as thomson did several times that i had an extraordinary amount of good luck and that he was dogged by illfortune throughout but this after all is as nothing so long as ones health is above suspicion the great thing was that thomsons liver suffered no relapse even though at the seventeenth tee he was one down and two to play and it was on the seventeenth tee that i had to think seriously how i wanted the match to end thomson at lunch when he has won is a very different man from thomson at lunch when he has lost the more i thought about it the more i realised that i was in rather a happy position if i won i won which was jolly if i lost thomson won and we should have a pleasant lunch however as it happened the match was halved yes i was afraid so said thomson i let you get too long a start its absurd to suppose that i can give you four holes up and beat you it practically amounts to giving you four bisques four bisques is about six strokes im not really six strokes better than you what about lunch i suggested good and you can have your revenge afterwards he led the way into the pavilion now i wonder he said what i can safely eat i want to be able to give you some sort of a game this afternoon well if there is ever a royal commission upon the national physique i shall insist on giving evidence for it seems to me that golf far from improving the health of the country is actually undermining it thomson at any rate since he has taken to the game has never been quite fit xxix chum it is chums birthday tomorrow and i am going to buy him a little whip for a present with a whistle at the end of it when i next go into the country to see him i shall take it with me and explain it to him two days firmness would make him quite a sensible dog i have often threatened to begin the treatment on my very next visit but somehow it has been put off the occasion of his birthday offers a last opportunity it is rather absurd though to talk of birthdays in connection with chum for he has been no more than three months old since we have had him he is a black spaniel who has never grown up he has a beautiful astrachan coat which gleams when the sun is on it but he stands so low in the water that the front of it is always getting dirty and his ears and the ends of his trousers trail in the mud a great authority has told us that but for three white hairs on his shirt upon so little do class distinctions hang he would be a cocker of irreproachable birth a still greater authority has sworn that he is a sussex the family is indifferent it only calls him a silly ass why he was christened chum i do not know and as he never recognises the name it does not matter when he first came to stay with us i took him a walk round the village i wanted to show him the lie of the land he had never seen the country before and was full of interest he trotted into a cottage garden and came back with something to show me youll never guess he said look and he dropped at my feet a chick just out of the egg i smacked his head and took him into the cottage to explain my dog i said has eaten one of your chickens chum nudged me in the ankle and grinned two of your chickens i corrected myself looking at the fresh evidence which he had just brought to light you dont want me any more said chum as the financial arrangements proceeded then ill just go and find somewhere for these two and he picked them up and trotted into the sun when i came out i was greeted effusively this is a wonderful day he panted as he wriggled his body i didnt know the country was like this what do we do now we go home i said and we went that was chums last day of freedom he keeps inside the front gate now but he is still a happy dog there is plenty doing in the garden there are beds to walk over there are blackbirds in the appletree to bark at the world is still full of wonderful things why only last wednesday he will tell you the fishmonger left his basket in the drive there was a haddock in it if youll believe me for masters breakfast so of course i saved it for him i put it on the grass just in front of his study window where hed be sure to notice it bless you theres always something to do in this house one is never idle and even when there is nothing doing he is still happy waiting cheerfully upon events until they arrange themselves for his amusement he will sit for twenty minutes opposite the garden bank watching for a bumble bee to come out of its hole i saw him go in he says to himself so hes bound to come out extraordinary interesting world but to his inferiors such as the gardener he pretends that it is not pleasure but duty which keeps him dont talk to me fool cant you see that ive got a job on here chum has found however that his particular mission in life is to purge his masters garden of all birds this keeps him busy as soon as he sees a blackbird on the lawn he is in full cry after it when he gets to the place and finds the blackbird gone he pretends that he was going there anyhow he gallops round in circles rolls over once or twice and then trots back again you didnt really think i was such a fool as to try to catch a blackbird he says to us no i was just taking a little run splendid thing for the figure and it is just chums little runs over the beds which call aloud for firmness which in fact have inspired my birthday present to him but there is this difficulty to overcome first when he came to live with us an arrangement was entered into so he says by which one bed was given to him as his own in that bed he could wander at will burying bones and biscuits hunting birds this may have been so but it is a pity that nobody but chum knows definitely which is the bed chum you bounder i shout as he is about to wade through the herbaceous border he takes no notice he struggles through to the other side but a sudden thought strikes him and he pushes his way back again did you call me he says how dare you walk over the flowers he comes up meekly i suppose ive done something wrong he says but i cant think what i smack his head for him he waits until he is quite sure i have finished and then jumps up with a bark wipes his paws on my trousers and trots into the herbaceous border again chum i cry he sits down in it and looks all round him in amazement my own bed he murmurs given to me i dont know what it is in him which so catches hold of you his way of sitting a reproachful statue motionless outside the window of whomever he wants to come out and play with him until you can bear it no longer but must either go into the garden or draw down the blinds for one day his habit when you are out of sitting up on his back legs and begging you with his front paws to come and do something a trick entirely of his own invention for no one would think of teaching him anything his funny nautical roll when he walks which is nearly a swagger and gives him always the air of having just come back from some rather dashing adventure beyond all this there is still something and whatever it is it is something which every now and then compels you to bend down and catch hold of his long silky ears to look into his honest eyes and say you silly old ass you dear old silly old ass xxx under entirely new management i know a fool of a dog who pretends that he is a cocker spaniel and is convinced that the world revolves round him wonderingly the sun rises so it may shine on his glossy morning coat it sets so his master may know that it is time for the evening biscuit if the rain falls it is that a fool of a dog may wipe on his mistresss skirts his muddy boots his day is always exciting always full of the same good thing his night a repetition of his day more gloriously developed if there be a sacred moment before the dawn when he lies awake and ponders on life he tells himself confidently that it will go on for ever like this a life planned nobly for himself but one in which the master and mistress whom he protects must always find a place and i think perhaps he would want a place for me too in that life who am not his real master but yet one of the house i hope he would what chum doesnt know is this his master and mistress are leaving him they are going to a part of the world where a fool of a dog with no manners is a nuisance if chum could see all the good little london dogs who at home sit languidly on their mistresss lap and abroad take their view of life through a muff much bigger than themselves if he could see the big obedient dogs who walk solemnly through the park carrying their masters stick never pausing in their impressive march unless it be to plunge into the serpentine and rescue a drowning child he would know what i mean he would admit that a dog who cannot answer to his own name and pays but little more attention to down idiot and come here fool is not every places dog he would admit it if he had time but before i could have called his attention to half the good dogs i had marked out he would have sat down beaming in front of a motorcar and then he would never have known what now he will know so soon that his master and mistress are leaving him it has been my business to find a new home for him it is harder than you think i can make him sound lovable but i cannot make him sound good of course i might leave out his doubtful qualities and describe him merely as beautiful and affectionate i might but i couldnt i think chums habitual smile would get larger he would wriggle the end of himself more ecstatically than ever if he heard himself summed up as beautiful and affectionate anyway i couldnt do it for i get carried away when i speak of him and i reveal all his bad qualities i am afraid he is a snob i confessed to one woman of whom i had hopes he doesnt much care for what he calls the lower classes oh she said yes he hates badly dressed people corduroy trousers tied up at the knee always excite him i dont know if any of your family no i suppose not but if he ever sees a man with his trousers tied up at the knee he goes for him and he cant bear tradespeople at least not the men washerwomen he loves he rather likes the washingbasket too once when he was left alone with it for a moment he appeared shortly afterwards on the lawn with a pair of well i mean he had no business with them at all we got them away after a bit of a chase and then they had to go to the wash again it seemed rather a pity when theyd only just come back of course i smacked his head for him but he looks so surprised and reproachful when hes done wrong that you never feel its quite his fault i doubt if i shall be able to take him after all she said ive just remembered i forget what it was she remembered but it meant that i was still without a new home for chum what does he eat somebody else asked me it seemed hopeful i could see chum already installed officially i said he lives on puppy biscuits he also has the toastcrusts after breakfast and an occasional bone privately he is fond of bees i have seen him eat as many as six bees in an afternoon sometimes he wanders down to the kitchengarden and picks the gooseberries he likes all fruit but gooseberries are the things he can reach best when there arent any gooseberries about he has to be content with the hips and haws from the rosetrees but really you neednt bother he can eat anything the only thing he doesnt like is whitening we were just going to mark the lawn one day and while we were busy pegging it out he wandered up and drank the whitening out of the marker it is practically the only disappointment he has ever had he looked at us and you could see that his opinion of us had gone down what did you put it there for if you didnt mean me to drink it he said reproachfully then he turned and walked slowly and thoughtfully back to his kennel he never came out till next morning really said my man well i shall have to think about it ill let you know of course i knew what that meant with a third doglover to whom i spoke the negotiations came to grief not apparently because of any faults of chums but because if you will believe it of my own shortcomings at least i can suppose nothing else for this man had been enthusiastic about him he had revelled in the tale of chums wickedness he had adored him for being so conceited he had practically said that he would take him do i begged im sure hed be happy with you you see hes not everybodys dog i mean i dont want any odd man whom i dont know to take him it must be a friend of mine so that i shall often be able to see chum afterwards so that what he asked anxiously so that i shall often be able to see chum afterwards weekends you know and so on i couldnt bear to lose the silly old ass altogether he looked thoughtful and when i went on to speak about chums fondness for chickens and his other lovable ways he changed the subject altogether he wrote afterwards that he was sorry he couldnt manage with a third dog and i like to think he was not afraid of chum but only of me but i have found the right man at last a day will come soon when i shall take chum from his present home to his new one that will be a great day for him i can see him in the train wiping his boots effusively on every new passenger wriggling under the seat and out again from sheer joy of life i can see him in the taxi taking his one brief impression of a world that means nothing to him i can see him in another train joyous eager putting his paws on my collar from time to time and saying excitedly what a day this is and if he survives the journey if i can keep him on the way from all delightful deaths he longs to try if i can get him safely to his new house then i can see him well i wonder what will they do to him when i see him again will he be a sober little dog answering to his name careful to keep his muddy feet off the visitors trousers grown up obedient following to heel round the garden the faithful servant of his master or will he be the same old silly ass no use to anybody always dirty always smiling always in the way a clumsy blundering fool of a dog who knows you cant help loving him i wonder between ourselves i dont think they can alter him now oh i hope they cant xxxi a farewell tour this is positively chums last appearance in print for his own sake no less than for yours he is conceited enough as it is but if once he got to know that people are always writing about him in books his swagger would be unbearable however i have said goodbye to him now i have no longer any rights in him yesterday i saw him off to his new home and when we meet again it will be on a different footing is that your dog i shall say to his master what is he a cocker jolly little fellows arent they i had one myself once as chum refused to do the journey across london by himself i met him at liverpool street he came up in a crate the world must have seemed very small to him on the way hallo old ass i said to him through the bars and in the little space they gave him he wriggled his body with delight thank heaven theres one of em alive he said i think this is my dog i said to the guard and i told him my name he asked for my card im afraid i havent one with me i explained when policemen touch me on the shoulder and ask me to go quietly when i drag old gentlemen from underneath motorbuses and they decide to adopt me on the spot on all the important occasions when one really wants a card i never have one with me cant give him up without proof of identity said the guard and chum grinned at the idea of being thought so valuable i felt in my pockets for letters there was only one but it offered to lend me on my note of hand alone it was addressed to dear sir and though i pointed out to the guard that i was the sir he still kept tight hold of chum strange that one man should be prepared to trust me with and another should be so chary of confiding to me a small black spaniel tell the gentleman who i am i said imploringly through the bars show him you know me hes really all right said chum looking at the guard with his great honest brown eyes hes been with us for years and then i had an inspiration i turned down the inside pocket of my coat and there stitched into it was the label of my tailors with my name written on it i had often wondered why tailors did this obviously they know how stupid guards can be i suppose thats all right said the guard reluctantly of course i might have stolen the coat i see his point you you wouldnt like a nice packing case for yourself i said timidly you see i thought id put chum on the lead ive got to take him to paddington and he must be tired of his shell by now it isnt as if he were really an armadillo the guard thought he would like a shilling and a nice packing case wood he agreed was always wood particularly in winter but there were times when you were not ready for it how are you taking him he asked getting to work with a chisel underground underground i cried in horror take chum on the underground take have you ever taken a large live congereel on the end of a string into a crowded carriage the guard never had well dont take him in a taxi instead dont waste him on other people the crate yawned slowly and chum emerged all over straw we had an anxious moment but the two of us got him down and put the lead on him then chum and i went off for a taxi hooray said chum wriggling all over isnt this splendid i say which way are you going im going this way no i mean the other way somebody had left some of his milkcans on the platform three times we went round one in opposite directions and unwound ourselves the wrong way then i hauled him in took him struggling in my arms and got into a cab the journey to paddington was full of interest for a whole minute chum stood quietly on the seat rested his forepaws on the open window and drank in london then he jumped down and went mad he tried to hang me with the lead and then in remorse tried to hang himself he made a dash for the little window at the back missed it and dived out of the window at the side was hauled back and kissed me ecstatically in the eye with his sharpest tooth and i thought the world was at an end he said and there were no more people oh i am an ass i say did you notice id had my hair cut how do you like my new trousers i must show you them he jumped on to my lap no i think youll see them better on the ground he said and jumped down again or no perhaps you would get a better view if he jumped up hastily and yet i dont know he dived down though of course if you oh lor this is a day and he put both paws lovingly on my collar suddenly he was quiet again the stillness the absence of storm in the taxi was so unnatural that i began to miss it buck up old fool i said but he sat motionless by my side plunged in thought i tried to cheer him up i pointed out kings cross to him he wouldnt even bark at it i called his attention to the poster outside euston theatre of the two biffs for all the regard he showed he might never even have heard of them the monumental masonry by portland road failed to uplift him at baker street he woke up and grinned cheerily its all right he said i was trying to remember what happened to me this morning something rather miserable i thought but i cant get hold of it however its all right now how are you and he went mad again at paddington i bought a label at the bookstall and wrote it for him he went round and round my leg looking for me funny thing he said as he began to unwind he was here a moment ago ill just go round once more i rather think ow oh there you are i stepped off him unravelled the lead and dragged him to the parcels office i want to send this by the two oclock train i said to the man the other side of the counter send what he said i looked down chum was making himself very small and black in the shadow of the counter he was completely hidden from the sight of anybody the other side of it come out i said and show yourself not much he said a parcel im not going to be a jolly old parcel for anybody its only a way of speaking i pleaded actually you are travelling as a small black gentleman you will go with the guard a delightful man chum came out reluctantly the clerk leant over the counter and managed to see him according to our regulations he said and i always dislike people who begin like that he has to be on a chain a leather lead wont do chum smiled all over himself i dont know which pleased him more the suggestion that he was a very large and fierce dog or the impossibility now of his travelling with the guard delightful man though he might be he gave himself a shake and started for the door tut tut its a great disappointment to me he said trying to look disappointed but his back would wriggle this chain business silly of us not to have known well well we shall be wiser another time now lets go home poor old chum i had known from a large coat pocket i produced a chain dash it said chum looking up at me pathetically you might almost want to get rid of me he was chained and the label tied on to him forgive me that label chum i think that was the worst offence of all and why should i label one who was speaking so eloquently for himself who said from the tip of his little black nose to the end of his stumpy black tail im a silly old ass but theres nothing wrong in me and theyre sending me away but according to the regulations one must obey the regulations chum i gave him to the guard a delightful man the guard and i chained him to a brake or something then the guard went away and chum and i had a little talk after that the train went off goodbye little dog indoors xxxii physical culture why dont you sit up said adela at dinner suddenly prodding me in the back adela is old enough to take a motherly interest in my figure and young enough to look extremely pretty while doing so i always stoop at meals i explained it helps the circulation my own idea but it looks so bad you ought dont improve me i begged no wonder you have hush i havent i got a bullet on the liver in the campaign of due to over smoking and sometimes it hurts me a little in the cold weather thats all why dont you try the hyperion i will where is it it isnt anywhere you buy it oh i thought you dined at it what do you buy it for its one of those developers with elastics and pulleys and so on every morning early for half an hour before breakfast you are trying to improve me i said suspiciously but they are such good things went on adela earnestly they really do help to make you beautiful i am beautiful well much more beautiful and strong are you being simply as tactful as you can be and graceful it isnt as though you were actually a relation i protested adela continued full of her idea it would do you so much good you know would you promise me to use it every day if i sent you mine why dont you want yours any more are you perfect now you can easily hook it to the wall i suppose i reflected there is a limit of beauty beyond which it is dangerous to go after that either the thing would come off its hook or well said adela suddenly arent i looking well youre looking radiant i said appreciatively but it may only be because youre going to marry billy next month she smiled and blushed well ill send it to you she said and you try it for a week and then tell me if you dont feel better oh and dont do all the exercises to begin with start with three or four of the easy ones of course i said i undid the wrappings eagerly took off the lid of the box and was confronted with apparently six pairs of braces i shook them out of the box and saw i had made a mistake it was one pair of braces for magog i picked it up and i knew that i was in the presence of the hyperion in five minutes i had screwed a hook into the bedroom wall and attached the beautifier then i sat on the edge of the bed and looked at it there was a tin plate fastened to the top with the word ladies on it i got up removed it with a knife and sat down again everything was very dusty and i wondered when adela had last developed herself byandby i went into the other room to see if i had overlooked anything i found on the floor a chart of exercises and returned triumphantly with it there were thirty exercises altogether and the chart gave you a detailed explanation of how to do each particular exercise a photograph of a lady doing it after all i reassured myself after the first bashful glance it is adela who has thrust this upon me and she must have known so i studied it nos and seemed the easiest i decided to confine myself to them for the first of these you strap yourself in at the waist grasp the handles and fall slowly backwards until your head touches the floor all the elastic cords being then at full stretch when i had got very slowly halfway down an extra piece of elastic which had got hitched somewhere came suddenly into play and i did the rest of the journey without a stop finishing up sharply against the towelhorse the chart had said inhale going down and i was inhaling hard at the moment that the towelhorse and two damp towels spread themselves over my face so much for exercise i thought as i got up ill just get the idea tonight and then start properly tomorrow now for no somehow i felt instinctively that no would cause trouble for no you stand on the right foot fasten the left foot to one of the cords and stretch it out as far as you can what officially you do then i cannot say some people can stand easily upon the right foot when the left is fastened to the wall others cannot it is a gift having recovered from my spontaneous rendering of no i turned to no this one i realised was extremely important i would do it twelve times you begin by lying flat on the floor roped in at the waist and with your hands grasping the elastic cords held straight up in the air the tension on your waist is then extreme but on your hands only moderate then taking a deep breath you pull your arms slowly out until they lie along the floor the tension becomes terrific the strain on every part of you is immense while i lay there taking a deep breath before relaxing i said to myself the strain will be too much for me i was wrong it was too much for the hook the hook whizzed out everything flew at me at once and i remembered no more as i limped into bed i trod heavily upon something sharp i shrieked and bent down to see what had bitten me it was a tin plate bearing the word ladies well said adela a week later i looked at her for a long time when did you last use the hyperion i asked about a year ago ah you dont remember the chart that went with it not well except of course that each exercise was arranged for a particular object according to what you wanted exactly so i discovered yesterday it was in very small type and i missed it at first well how many did you do i limited myself to exercises and do you happen to remember what those are for not particularly no well i started with no no you may recall is one of the most perilous i nearly died over no and when i had been doing it for a week i discovered what its particular object was what to round the forearm yes madam i said bitterly i have spent a week of agony and i have rounded one forearm why didnt you try another i did i tried no six times in the pursuit of no have i been shot up to the ceiling by the left foot and what for adela to arch the instep look at my instep why should i want to arch it i wish i could remember which chart i sent you said adela wrinkling her brow it was the wrong one i said there was a long silence oh said adela suddenly you never told me about no pardon me i said i cannot bear to speak of why was it even more unsuitable than the other two i found when i had done it six times that its object was stated to be to remove double chin that however was not the real effect and so i crossed out the false comment and wrote the true one in its place and what is that asked adela to remove the hook i said gloomily xxxiii an insurance act of course i had always known that a medical examination was a necessary preliminary to insurance but in my own case i had expected the thing to be the merest formality the doctor having seen at a glance what a fine strong healthy fellow i was would look casually at my tongue apologise for having doubted it enquire genially what my grandfather had died of and show me to the door this idea of mine was fostered by the excellent testimonial which i had written myself at the companys bidding are you suffering from any constitutional disease no have you ever had gout no are you deformed no are you of strictly sober and temperate habits no i mean yes my replies had been a model of what an assurance company expects then why the need of a doctor however they insisted the doctor began quietly enough he asked as i had anticipated after the health of my relations i said that they were very fit and not to be outdone in politeness expressed the hope that his people too were keeping well in this trying weather he wondered if i drank much i said oh well perhaps i will with an apologetic smile and looked round for the sideboard unfortunately he did not pursue the matter and now he said after the hundredth question i should like to look at your chest i had seen it coming for some time in vain i had tried to turn the conversation to lead him back to the subject of drinks or my relations it was no good he was evidently determined to see my chest nothing could move him from his resolve trembling i prepared for the encounter what terrible disease was he going to discover he began by tapping me briskly all over in a series of doubleknocks for the most part one doubleknock at any point appeared to satisfy him but occasionally there would be no answer and he would knock again at one spot he knocked four times before he could make himself heard this i said to myself at the third knock has torn it i shall be ploughed and i sent an urgent message to my chest for evings sake do something you fool cant you hear the gentleman i suppose that roused it for at the next knock he passed on to an adjacent spot um he said when he called everywhere um i wonder what ive done i thought to myself i dont believe he likes my chest without a word he got out his stethoscope and began to listen to me as luck would have it he struck something interesting almost at once and for what seemed hours he stood there listening and listening to it but it was boring for me because i really had very little to do i could have bitten him in the neck with some ease or i might have licked his ear beyond that nothing seemed to offer i moistened my lips and spoke am i dying i asked in a broken voice dont talk he said just breathe naturally i am dying i thought and he is hiding it from me it was a terrible reflection um he said and moved on byandby he went and listened behind my back it is very bad form to listen behind a persons back i did not tell him so however i wanted him to like me yes he said now cough i havent a cough i pointed out make the noise of coughing he said severely extremely nervous i did my celebrated imitation of a man with an irritating cough hm hm hm hm yes said the doctor go on he likes it i said to myself and he must obviously be an excellent judge i shall devote more time to mimicry in future hm hm hm the doctor came round to where i could see him again now cough like this he said honk honk i gave my celebrated imitation of a sick rhinoceros gasping out its life it went well i got an encore um he said gravely um he put his stethoscope away and looked earnestly at me tell me the worst i begged im not bothering about this stupid insurance business now thats off of course but how long have i i must put my affairs in order can you promise me a week he said nothing he took my wrists in his hands and pressed them it was evident that grief overmastered him and that he was taking a silent farewell of me i bowed my head then determined to bear my deathsentence like a man i said firmly so be it and drew myself away from him however he wouldnt let me go come come i said to him you must not give way and i made an effort to release one of my hands meaning to pat him encouragingly on the shoulder he resisted i realised suddenly that i had mistaken his meaning and that he was simply feeling my pulses um he said um and continued to finger my wrists clenching my teeth and with the veins staring out on my forehead i worked my pulses as hard as i could ah he said as i finished tying my tie and he got up from the desk where he had been making notes of my disastrous case and came over to me there is just one thing more sit down i sat down now cross your knees i crossed my knees he bent over me and gave me a sharp tap below the knee with the side of his hand my chest may have disappointed him he may have disliked my back possibly i was a complete failure with my pulses but i knew the kneetrick this time he should not be disappointed i was taking no risks almost before his hand reached my knee my foot shot out and took him fairly under the chin his face suddenly disappeared i havent got that disease i said cheerily xxxiv getting the needle he was a pale enthusiastic young man of the name of simms and he held forth to us at great length about his latest hobby now ill just show you a little experiment he wound up one that i have never known to fail first of all i want you to hide a needle somewhere while i am out of the room you must stick it where it can be seen on a chair or on the floor if you like then i shall come back blindfolded and find it oh mr simms we all said now which one of you has the strongest will we pushed jack forward jack is at any rate a big man very well i shall want you to take my hand when i come in and look steadily at the needle concentrate all your thoughts on it i on the other hand shall make my mind a perfect blank then your thoughts will gradually pass into my brain and i shall feel myself as it were dragged in the direction of the needle and i shall feel myself as it were dragged after you said jack yes you mustnt put any strain on my arm at all let me go just where i like only will me to go in the right direction now then he took out his handkerchief put it hastily back and said first i shall want to borrow a handkerchief or something well we blindfolded him and led him out of the room then muriel got a needle which after some discussion was stuck into the back of the chesterfield simms returned and took jacks left hand they stood there together jack frowning earnestly at the needle and simms swaying uncertainly at the knees suddenly his knees went in altogether and he made a little zigzag dash across the room as though he were taking cover jack lumbered after him instinctively bending his head too they were brought up by the piano which simms struck with great force we all laughed and jack apologised you told me to let you go where you liked you know he said yes yes said simms rather peevishly but you should have willed me not to hit the piano as he spoke he tripped over a small stool and flinging out an arm to save himself swept two photograph frames off an occasional table by jove said jack thats jolly good i saw you were going to do that and i willed that the flower vase should be spared im getting on i think you had better start from the door again i suggested then you can get a clear run they took up their original positions you must think hard please said simms again my mind is a perfect blank and yet i can feel nothing coming jack made terrible faces at the needle then without warning simms flopped on to the floor at full length pulling jack after him you mustnt mind if i do that he said getting up slowly no said jack dusting himself i felt irresistibly compelled to go down said simms so did i said jack the needle is very often hidden in the floor you see you are sure you are looking at it they were in a corner with their back to it and jack after trying in vain to get it over his right shoulder or his left bent down and focussed it between his legs this must have connected the current for simms turned right round and marched up to the needle there he said triumphantly taking off the bandage we all clapped while jack poured himself out a whisky simms turned to him you have a very strong will indeed he said one of the strongest i have met now would one of the ladies like to try oh im sure i couldnt said all the ladies i should like to do it again said simms modestly perhaps you sir all right ill try i said when simms was outside i told them my idea ill hold the needle in my other hand i said and then i can always look at it easily and it will always be in a different place which ought to muddle him we fetched him in and he took my left hand no its no good he said at last i dont seem to get it let me try the other hand i had no time to warn him he clasped the other hand firmly and from the shriek that followed it seemed that he got it there ensued the perfect blank that he had insisted on all the evening then he pulled off the bandage and showed a very angry face well we explained how accidental it was and begged him to try again he refused rather sulkily suddenly jack said i believe i could do it blindfolded miss muriel will you look at the needle and see if you can will me simms bucked up a bit and seemed keen on the idea so jack was blindfolded the needle hid and muriel took his hand now is your mind a perfect blank said simms to jack it always is said jack very well then you ought soon to feel in a dreamy state as though you were in another world miss muriel you must think only of the needle jack held her hand tight and looked most idiotically peaceful after three minutes simms spoke again well he said eagerly ive got the dreamy otherworld state perfectly said jack and then he gave at the knees just for the look of the thing this is silly said muriel trying to get her hand away jack staggered violently and gripped her hand again please miss muriel implored simms i feel sure he is just going to do it jack staggered again sawed the air with his disengaged hand and then turned right round and marched for the door dragging muriel behind him the door slammed after them there is a little trick of sitting on a chair and picking a pin out of it with the teeth i started simms who was all eagerness to follow the pair and find out the mysterious force that was drawing them upon this trick for jack is one of my best friends when jack and muriel came back from the billiardroom and announced that they were engaged simms was on his back on the floor with the chair on the top of him explaining for the fourth time that if the thing had not overbalanced at the critical moment he would have secured the object there is much to be said for this view xxxv dressing up then you really are coming said queen elizabeth yes i really am i sighed what as i dont know at all something with a cold i leave it to you partner only dont go a black suit what about richelieu i should never be able to pronounce that i confessed besides i always think that these great scientists i should say philos that is of course that these generals er which room is the encyclopedia in you might go as one of the kings of england which is your favourite king william and mary now that would be an original costume i should have dont be ridiculous why not henry viii do you think i should get a lot of partners as henry viii anyhow i dont think its a very becoming figure but you dont wear fancy dress simply because its becoming well that is rather the point to settle are we going to enhance my natural beauty or would you like it er toned down a little of course i could go as the dogfaced man only very well then if you dont like henry what about edward i but why do you want to thrust royalty on me id much sooner go as perkin warbeck i should wear a brown perkin i mean jerkin jack is going as sir walter raleigh then i shall certainly touch him for a cigarette i said as i got up to go it was a week later that i met elizabeth in regent street well she said have you got your things i havent i confessed i forgot who you said you were going as somebody who had black hair i said i have been thinking it over and i have come to the conclusion that i should have knocked them rather if i had had black hair instead of curly eyes and blue hair can you think of anybody for me queen elizabeth regarded me as sternly as she might have regarded well im not very good at history do you mean to say she said at last that that is as far as you have got somebody who had black hair hang it i protested its something to have been measured for the wig have you been measured for your wig well er no that is to say not exactly what you might call measured but well the fact is that i was just going along now only i say where do i get a wig youve done nothing said elizabeth absolutely nothing i say dont say that i began nervously ive done an awful lot really ive practically got the costume im going as harold the boy earl or jessicas last hallo theres my bus ive got a cold i mustnt keep it waiting goodbye and i fled i am going i said as julius csar he was practically bald think how cool that will be do you mean to say cried elizabeth that you have altered again dont be rough with me or i shall cry ive got an awful cold then youve no business to go as julius csar i say now youre trying to unsettle me and i was going tomorrow to order the clothes what you havent i was really going this afternoon only only its early closing day besides i wanted to see if my cold would get better because if it didnt look here ill be frank with you i am going as charlemagne oh charlemagne in halfmourning because pepin the short had just died something quiet in grey with a stripe i thought only halfmourning because he only got half the throne bytheway i suppose all these people wore pumps and white kid gloves all right yes i thought so i wonder if charlemagne really had black hair anyhow they cant prove he didnt seeing when he lived he flourished about you know as a matter of fact wasnt actually his most flourishing year because the radicals were in power then and land went down so now yes or else as winston churchill anyhow i added indignantly a minute later i swear im going somehow hallo i said cheerfully as i ran into her majesty in piccadilly ive just been ordering that is to say ive been going i mean im just going to lets see its next week isnt it for a moment elizabeth was speechless not at all my idea of the character now then she said at last i am going to take you in hand will you trust yourself entirely to me to the death your majesty im sickening for something as it is how tall are you oh more than that i said quickly gents large medium i am then ill order a costume for you and have it sent round theres no need for you to be anything historical you might be a butcher quite blue is my colour in fact i can do you the best end of the neck at tenpence madam if youll wait a moment while i sharpen the knife lets see you like it cut on the cross i think bother theyve forgotten the strop well it may not be a butcher said elizabeth it depends what theyve got that was a week ago this morning i was really ill at last had hardly any breakfast simply couldnt look a poached in the yolk a day on the sofa in a darkened room and bed at seven oclock was my programme and then my eye caught a great box of clothes and i remembered that the dance was tonight i opened the box perhaps dressed soberly as a blackhaired butcher i could look in for an hour or two and help a yellow waistcoat pink breeches and no its not an eiderdown its a coat a yellow pink br i am going as joseph i am going as a humming bird i am going yes thats it i am going back to bed xxxvi the complete kitchen i sat in the drawingroom after dinner with my knees together and my hands in my lap and waited for the game to be explained to me theres a pencil for you said somebody thank you very much i said and put it carefully away evidently i had won a forfeit already it wasnt a very good pencil though now has everybody got pencils asked somebody else the game is called furnishing a kitchen its quite easy will somebody think of a letter she turned to me perhaps youd better certainly i said and i immediately thought very hard of n these thoughtreading games are called different things but they are all the same really and i dont believe in any of them well said everybody what yes i have go on oh i beg your pardon i said in confusion i thought you n is the letter n or m i smiled knowingly to myself my godfather and my godmother i went on cautiously it was n interrupted somebody now then youve got five minutes in which to write down everything you can beginning with n go and they all started to write like anything i took my pencil out and began to think i know it sounds an easy game to you now as you sit at your desk surrounded by dictionaries but when you are squeezed on to the edge of a sofa given a very blunt pencil and a thin piece of paper and challenged to write in five minutes on your knees all the words you can think of beginning with a certain letter well it is another matter altogether i thought of no end of things which started with k or even l i thought of rhinoceros which is a very long word and starts with r but as for i looked at my watch and groaned one minute gone i must keep calm i said and in a bold hand i wrote napoleon then after a moments thought i added nitroglycerine and nats this is splendid i told myself nottingham nobody and noon that makes six at six i stuck for two minutes i did worse than that in fact for i suddenly remembered that gnats were spelt with a g however i decided to leave them in case nobody else remembered and on the fourth minute i added nonsequitur time said somebody just a moment said everybody they wrote down another word or two which isnt fair and then began to add up ive got thirty said one thirtytwo twentyfive good heavens i said ive only got seven there was a shout of laughter then youd better begin said somebody read them out i coughed nervously and began napoleon there was another shout of laughter i am afraid we cant allow that why ever not i asked in amazement well youd hardly find him in a kitchen would you i took out a handkerchief and wiped my brow i dont want to find him in a kitchen i said nervously why should i as a matter of fact hes dead i dont see what the kitchens got to do with it kitchens begin with a k but the game is called furnishing a kitchen you have to make a list of things beginning with n which you would find in a kitchen you understood that didnt you yyyes i said oh yyyyes of course so napoleon i pulled myself together with a great effort you dont understand i said with dignity the cooks name was napoleon cooks arent called napoleon said everybody this one was carrie napoleon her mistress was just as surprised at first as you were but carrie assured her that no im afraid we cant allow it im sorry i said im wrong about that her name was carrie smith but her young man was a soldier and she had bought a life of napoleon for a birthday present for him it stood on the dresser waiting for her next sunday out oh oh well i suppose that is possible go on gnats i went on nervously and hastily of course i know that gnats are spelt with a g they shrieked these werent they had lost the g when they were quite young and consequently couldnt bite at all and cook said that no im afraid not im sorry i said resignedly i had about forty of them on the dresser if you wont allow any of them it pulls me down a lot er then we have nitroglycerine there was another howl of derision not at all i said haughtily cook had chapped hands very badly and she went to the chemists one evening for a little glycerine the chemist was out and his assistant a very nervous young fellow gave her nitroglycerine by mistake it stood on the dresser it did really well said everybody very reluctantly i suppose i went on hastily thats two then nobody of course you might easily find nobody in the kitchen in fact you would pretty often i should say three the next is noon it could be noon in the kitchen as well as anywhere else dont be narrowminded about that all right go on nonsequitur i said doubtfully what on earth its a little difficult to explain but the idea is this at most restaurants you can get a second help of anything for halfprice and that is technically called a follow now if they didnt give you a follow that would be a nonsequitur you do see that dont you there was a deadly silence five i said cheerfully the last is nottingham i must confess i added magnanimously that i am a bit doubtful whether you would actually find nottingham in a kitchen you dont say so yes my feeling is that you would be more likely to find the kitchen in nottingham on the other hand it is just possible that as calais was found engraven on marys heart so oh very well then it remains at five of course you think that as i only had five i came out last but you are wrong there is a pleasing rule in this game that if you have any word in your list which somebody else has you cannot count it and as all the others had the obvious things such as a nutmeggrater or a neck of mutton or a nomlette my five won easily and you will note that if only i had been allowed to count my gnats it would have been fortyfive xxxvii an informal evening dinner was a very quiet affair not a soul drew my chair away from under me as i sat down and during the meal nobody threw bread about we talked gently of art and politics and things and when the ladies left there was no booby trap waiting for them at the door in a word nothing to prepare me for what was to follow we strolled leisurely into the drawingroom a glance told me the worst the ladies were in a cluster round miss power and miss power was on the floor she got up quickly as we came in we were trying to go underneath the poker she explained can you do it i waved the poker back let me see you do it again i said i missed the first part oh i can never do it bob you show us bob is an active young fellow he took the poker rested the end on the floor and then twisted himself underneath his right arm i expected to see him come up inside out but he looked much the same after it however no doubt his organs are all on the wrong side now yes thats how i should do it i said hastily but miss power was firm she gave me the poker i pressed it hard on the floor said goodbye to them all and dived i got halfway round and was supporting myself upside down by one toe and the slippery end of the poker when it suddenly occurred to me that the earth was revolving at an incredible speed on its own axis and that in addition we were hurtling at thousands of miles a minute round the sun it seemed impossible in these circumstances that i should keep my balance any longer and as soon as i realised this the poker began to slip i was in no sort of position to do anything about it and we came down heavily together oh what a pity said miss power i quite thought youd done it being actually on the spot i said i knew that i hadnt do try again not till the grounds a little softer lets do the jampot trick said another girl im not going under a jampot for anybody i murmured however it turned out that this trick was quite different you place a book macaulays essays or what not on the jampot and sit on the book one heel only touching the ground in the right hand you have a box of matches in the left a candle the jampot of course is on its side so that it can roll beneath you then you light the candle and hand it to anybody who wants to go to bed i was ready to give way to the ladies here but even while i was bowing and saying not at all i found myself on one of the jampots with bob next to me on another to balance with the arms outstretched was not so difficult but as the matches were then about six feet from the candle and there seemed no way of getting them nearer together the solution of the problem was as remote as ever three times i brought my hands together and three times the jampot left me well played bob said somebody the bounder has done it i looked at his jampot there you are i said raspberry mines gooseberry a rotten vintage and look at my book alone on the prairie and youve got the mormons wedding no wonder i couldnt do it i refused to try it again as i didnt think i was being treated fairly and after bob and miss power had had a race at it which bob won we got on to something else of course you can pick a pin out of a chair with your teeth said miss power not properly i said i always swallow the pin i suppose it doesnt count if you swallow the pin said miss power thoughtfully i dont know ive never really thought about that side of it much anyhow unless youve got a whole lot of pins you dont want dont ask me to do it tonight accordingly we passed on to the watertrick i refused at this but miss power went full length on the floor with a glass of water balanced on her forehead and came up again without spilling a single drop personally i shouldnt have minded spilling a single drop it was the thought of spilling the whole glass that kept me back anyway it is a useless trick the need for which never arises in an ordinary career picking up the times with the teeth while clasping the left ankle with the right hand is another matter that might come in useful on occasions as for instance if having lost your left arm on the field and having to staunch with the right hand the flow of blood from a bullet wound in the opposite ankle you desired to glance through the financial supplement while waiting for the ambulance heres a nice little trick broke in bob as i was preparing myself in this way for the german invasion he had put two chairs together front to front and was standing over them if that conveys it to you then he jumped up turned round in the air and came down facing the other way can you do it i said to miss power come and try said bob to me its not really difficult i went and stood over the chairs then i moved them apart and walked over to my hostess goodbye i said im afraid i must go now coward said somebody who knew me rather better than the others its much easier than you think said bob i dont think its easy at all i protested i think its impossible i went back and stood over the chairs again for some time i waited there in deep thought then i bent my knees preparatory to the spring straightened them up and said what happens if you just miss it i suppose you bark your shins a bit yes thats what i thought i bent my knees again worked my arms up and down and then stopped suddenly and said what happens if you miss it pretty easily oh you can do it if bob can said miss power kindly hes practised i expect he started with two hassocks and worked up to this im not afraid but i want to know the possibilities if its only a broken leg or two i dont mind if its permanent disfigurement i think i ought to consult my family first i jumped up and came down again the same way for practice very well i said now im going to try i havent the faintest hope of doing it but you all seem to want to see an accident and anyhow im not going to be called a coward one two three well done cried everybody did i do it i whispered as i sat on the floor and pressed a cushion against my shins rather then i said massaging my ankles next time i shall try to miss xxxviii a billiard lesson i was showing celia a few fancy strokes on the billiard table the other members of the houseparty were in the library learning their parts for some approaching theatricals that is to say they were sitting round the fire and saying to each other this is a rotten play we had been offered the position of auditors to several of the company but we were going to see parsifal on the next day and i was afraid that the constant excitement would be bad for celia why dont you ask me to play with you she asked you never teach me anything theres ingratitude why i gave you your first lesson at golf only last thursday so you did i know golf now show me billiards i looked at my watch weve only twenty minutes ill play you thirty up righto what do you give me a ball or a bisque or what i cant spare you a ball im afraid i shall want all three when i get going you may have fifteen start and ill tell you what to do well what do i do first select a cue she went over to the rack and inspected them this seems a nice brown one now then you begin celia youve got the halfbutt put it back and take a younger one i thought it seemed taller than the others she took another hows this good then off you go will you be spot or plain i said chalking my cue does it matter not very much theyre both the same shape then whats the difference well one is more spotted than the other then ill be less spotted i went to the table i think i said ill try and screw in off the red i did this once by accident and ive always wanted to do it again or perhaps i corrected myself as soon as the ball had left me i had better give a safety miss i did my ball avoided the red and came swiftly back into the lefthand bottom pocket thats three to you i said without enthusiasm celia seemed surprised but i havent begun yet she said well i suppose you know the rules but it seems funny what would you like me to do well there isnt much on youd better just try and hit the red ball right she leant over the table and took long and careful aim i held my breath still she aimed then keeping her chin on the cue she slowly turned her head and looked up at me with a thoughtful expression oughtnt there to be three balls on the table she said wrinkling her forehead no i answered shortly but why not because i went down by mistake but you said that when you got going you wanted i cant argue bending down like this she raised herself slowly you saidoh all right i expect you know anyhow i have scored some already havent i yes youre eighteen to my nothing yes well now i shall have to aim all over again she bent slowly over her cue does it matter where i hit the red not much as long as you hit it on the red part she hit it hard on the side and both balls came into baulk too good i said does either of us get anything for it no the red and white were close together and i went up the table and down again on the offchance of a cannon i misjudged it however thats three to you i said stiffly as i took my ball out of the righthand bottom pocket twentyone to nothing funny how im doing all the scoring said celia meditatively and ive practically never played before i shall hit the red hard now and see what happens to it she hit and the red coursed madly about the table coming to rest near the top righthand pocket and close to the cushion with a forcing shot i could get in this will want a lot of chalk i said pleasantly to celia and gave it plenty then i let fly why did that want a lot of chalk said celia with interest i went to the fireplace and picked my ball out of the fender thats three to you i said coldly twentyfour to nothing am i winning youre leading i explained only you see i may make a twenty at any moment oh she thought this over well i may make my three at any moment she chalked her cue and went over to her ball what shall i do just touch the red on the righthand side i said and youll go into the pocket the righthand side do you mean my righthand side or the balls the righthand side of the ball of course that is to say the side opposite your righthand but its righthand side is opposite my left hand if the ball is facing this way take it i said wearily that the ball has its back to you how rude of it said celia and hit it on the lefthand side and sank it was that what you meant well its another way of doing it i thought it was what do i give you for that you get three oh i thought the other person always got the marks i know the last three times go on i said freezingly you have another turn oh is it like rounders something go on theres a dear its getting late she went and left the red over the middle pocket aha i said i found a nice place in the d for my ball now then this is the grey stroke you know i suppose i was nervous anyhow i just nicked the red ball gently on the wrong side and left it hanging over the pocket the white travelled slowly up the table why is that called the grey stroke asked celia with great interest because once when sir edward grey was playing the german ambassador but its rather a long story ill tell you another time oh well anyhow did the german ambassador get anything for it no then i suppose i dont bother but youve only got to knock the red in for game oh there whats that thats a miscue i get one oh oh well she added magnanimously im glad youve started scoring it will make it more interesting for you there was just room to creep in off the red leaving it still over the pocket with celias ball nicely over the other pocket there was a chance of my twenty break lets see i said how many do i want twentynine replied celia ah i said and i crept in thats three to you i said icily game xxxix bachelor relics do you happen to want i said to henry an opera hat that doesnt op at least it only works one side no said henry to any one who buys my opera hat for a large sum i am giving away four square yards of linoleum a revolving bookcase two curtain rods a pair of springgrip dumbbells and an extremely patent mousetrap no said henry again the mousetrap i pleaded is unused that is to say no mouse has used it yet my mousetrap has never been blooded i dont want it myself said henry but i know a man who does henry you know everybody for heavens sake introduce me to your friend why does he particularly want a mousetrap he doesnt he wants anything thats old old clothes old carpets anything thats old hell buy he seemed to be exactly the man i wanted introduce me to your fellow clubman i said firmly that evening i wrote to henrys friend mr bennett dear sir i wrote if you would call upon me tomorrow i should like to show you some really old things all genuine antiques in particular i would call your attention to an old opera hat of exquisite workmanship and a mousetrap of chaste and handsome design i have also a few yards of queen anne linoleum of a circular pattern which i think will please you my james the first springgrip dumbbells and louis quatorze curtainrods are well known to connoisseurs a genuine old cork bedroom suite comprising one bathmat will also be included in the sale yours faithfully on second thoughts i tore the letter up and sent mr bennett a postcard asking him to favour the undersigned with a call at prompt and at prompt he came i had expected to see a bearded patriarch with a hooked nose and three hats on his head but mr bennett turned out to be a very spruce gentleman wearing i was sorry to see much better clothes than the opera hat i proposed to sell him he became businesslike at once just tell me what you want to sell he said whipping out a pocketbook and ill make a note of it i take anything i looked round my spacious apartment and wondered what to begin with the revolving bookcase i announced im afraid theres very little sale for revolving bookcases now he said as he made a note of it as a matter of fact i pointed out this one doesnt revolve it got stuck some years ago he didnt seem to think that this would increase the rush but he made a note of it then the writingdesk the what the georgian bureau a copy of an old twentiethcentury escritoire walnut he said tapping it possibly the value of this georgian writingdesk however lies not in the wood but in the literary associations ah my customers dont bother much about that but still whose was it mine i said with dignity placing my hand in the breast pocket of my coat i have written many charming things at that desk my ode to a bellpush my thoughts on asia my anything else in this room said mr bennett carpets curtains nothing else i said coldly we went into the bedroom and gazing on the linoleum my enthusiasm returned to me the linoleum i said with a wave of the hand very much worn said mr bennett i called his attention to the piece under the bed not under there i said i never walk on that piece its as good as new he made a note what else he said i showed him round the collection he saw the louis quatorze curtainrods the cork bedroom suite the csarian nailbrush quite bald the antique shavingmirror with genuine crack he saw it all and then we went back into the other rooms and found some more things for him yes he said consulting his notebook and now how would you like me to buy these at a large price i said if you have brought your chequebook ill lend you a pen you want me to make you an offer otherwise i should sell them by auction for you deducting ten per cent commission not by auction i said impulsively i couldnt bear to know how much or rather how little my georgian bureau fetched it was there as i think i told you that i wrote my guide to the round pond give me an inclusive price for the lot and never never let me know the details he named an inclusive price it was something under a hundredandfifty pounds i shouldnt have minded that if it had only been a little over ten pounds but it wasnt right i agreed and oh i was nearly forgetting theres an old opera hat of exquisite workmanship which ah now clothes had much better be sold by auction make a pile of all you dont want and ill send round a sack for them i have an auction sale every wednesday very well send round tomorrow and you might er also send round a er cheque for quite so well then good morning when he had gone i went into my bedroom and made a pile of my operahat it didnt look very impressive hardly worth having a sack specially sent round for it to keep it company i collected an assortment of clothes it pained me to break up my wardrobe in this way but i wanted the bidding for my operahat to be brisk and a few preliminary suits would warm the public up altogether it was a goodly pile when it was done the operahat perched on the top half of it only at work today i received from mr bennett a cheque a catalogue and an account the catalogue was marked lots somehow i felt that my opera hat would be lot i turned to it in the account lot six shillings it did well i said perhaps in my heart of hearts i hoped for seven and sixpence but six shillings yes it was a good hat and then i turned to the catalogue lot frock coat and vest dress coat and vest ditto pair of trousers and opera hat and opera hat well well at least it had the position of honour at the end my opera hat was

mistress dorothy the scene is an apartment in the mansion of sir thomas farthingale there is no need to describe the furniture in it as rehearsals will gradually show what is wanted a picture or two of previous sir thomass might be seen on the walls if you have an artistic friend who could arrange this but it is a mistake to hang up your own ancestors as some of your guests may recognise them and

doesnt much matter in the house of somebody or other in the country george turnbull and his old college friend henry peterson are confiding in each other as old friends will over their whiskies and cigars it is about three oclock in the afternoon george dreamily helping himself to a stiff soda henry do you remember that evening at christ church college five years ago when we opened our hearts to each other henry lighting a cigar and hiding it in a fernpot that moonlight evening on the backs george when i had failed in my matriculation examination george yes and we promised that when either of us fell in love the other should be the first to hear of it rising solemnly henry the moment has come with shining eyes i am in love henry jumping up and grasping him by both hands george my dear old george in a voice broken with emotion bless you george he pats him thoughtfully on the back three times nods his own head twice gives him a final grip of the hand and returns to his chair george more moved by this than he cares to show thank you henry hoarsely youre a good fellow henry airily with a typically british desire to conceal his emotion who is the lucky little lady george taking out a picture postcard of the british museum and kissing it passionately isobel barley if henry is not careful he will probably give a start of surprise here with the idea of suggesting to the audience that he knows something about the ladys past or is in love with her himself he is however thinking of a different play we shall come to that one in a moment henry in a slightly dashing manner little isobel lucky dog george i wish i could think so sighs but i have yet to approach her and she may be anothers fiercely heavens henry if she should be anothers enter isobel isobel brightly so ive run you to earth at last now what have you got to say for yourselves henry like a man by jove looking at his watch i had no idea is it really poor old joe waiting dashes out tactfully in a state of incoherence george rising and leading isobel to the front of the stage miss barley now that we are alone i have something i want to say to you isobel looking at her watch well you must be quick because im engaged george drops her hand and staggers away from her isobel why whats the matter george to the audience in a voice expressing the very deeps of emotion engaged she is engaged i am too late he sinks into a chair and covers his face with his hands isobel surprised mr turnbull what has happened george waving her away with one hand go leave me i can bear this best alone exit isobel merciful heavens she is plighted to another enter henry henry eagerly well old man george raising a face white with misery that is to say if he has remembered to put the french chalk in the palms of his hands henry i am too late she is anothers henry in surprise whose george with dignity i did not ask her it is nothing to me goodbye henry be kind to her henry why where are you going george firmly to the rocky mountains i shall shoot some bears grizzly ones it may be that thus i shall forget my grief henry after a pause perhaps you are right george what shall i tell her george tell her nothing but should anything feeling casually in his pockets happen to me if going over them again quickly i do not come back then searching them all including the waist coat ones in desperate haste give her give her give her triumphantly bringing his handkerchief out of the last pocket this and say that my last thought was of her goodbye my old friend goodbye exit to rocky mountains enter isobel isobel why wheres mr turnbull henry sadly hes gone isobel gone where henry to the rocky mountains to shoot bears feeling that some further explanation is needed grizzly ones isobel but he was here a moment ago henry yes

miss prendergast as the curtain goes up two ladies are discovered in the morningroom of honeysuckle lodge engaged in work of a feminine nature miss alice prendergast is doing something delicate with a crochethook but it is obvious that her thoughts are far away she sighs at intervals and occasionally lays down her work and presses both hands to her heart a sympathetic audience will have no difficulty in guessing that she is in love on the other hand her elder sister miss prendergast is completely wrapped up in a sock for one of the poorer classes over which she frowns formidably the sock however has no real bearing upon the plot and she must not make too much of it alice hiding her emotions did you have a pleasant dinnerparty last night jane jane to herself seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty looking up very pleasant indeed alice the blizzards were there and the podbys and the slumphs these people are not important and should not be overemphasised mrs podbys maid has given notice alice who took you in jane brightening up such an interesting man my dear he talked most agreeably about art during dinner and we renewed the conversation in the drawingroom we found that we agreed upon all the main principles of art considered as such alice with a look in her eyes which shows that she is recalling a tender memory when i was in shropshire last week what was your mans name jane with a warning glance at the audience you know how difficult it is to catch names when one is introduced i am certain he never heard mine as the plot depends partly upon this she pauses for it to sink in but i enquired about him afterwards and i find that he is a mr enter mary the parlourmaid mary handing letter a letter for you miss jane taking it thank you mary exit mary to work up her next line a letter i wonder who it is from reading the envelope miss prendergast honeysuckle lodge she opens it with the air of one who has often received letters before but feels that this one may play an important part in her life dear miss prendergast i hope you will pardon the presumption of what i am about to write to you but whether you pardon me or not i ask you to listen to me i know of no woman for whose talents i have a greater admiration or for whose qualities i have a more sincere affection than yourself since i have known you you have been the lodestar of my existence the fountain of my inspiration i feel that were your life joined to mine the joint path upon which we trod would be the path to happiness such as i have as yet hardly dared to dream of in short dear miss prendergast i ask you to marry me and i will come in person for my answer yours truly in a voice of intense surprise jas bootle at the word bootle a wave of warm colour rushes over alice and dyes her from neck to brow if she is not an actress of sufficient calibre to ensure this she must do the best she can by starting abruptly and putting her hand to her throat alice aside in a choking voice mr bootle in love with jane jane my dear the man who took me down to dinner well alice picking up her work again and trying to be calm what will you say jane rather pleased with herself well really i this is mr bootle

alice james my love but what can we do bootle gloomily nothing as a man of honour i cannot withdraw so two lives are ruined alice you are right james jane must never know goodbye they give each other a farewell embrace jane aside they love fiercely but he is mine i will hold him to his promise picking up a photograph of alice as a small child from an occasional table little alice and i promised to

the sill and falls carefully into the drawingroom of beeste hall he is dressed in a knickerbocker suit with arrows on it such as can always be borrowed from a friend and to judge from the noises which he emits is not in the best of training the lights go on suddenly and he should seize this moment to stagger to the door and turn on the switch this done he sinks into the nearest chair and closes his eyes if he has been dancing very late the night before he may drop into a peaceful sleep in which case the play ends here otherwise no sooner are his eyes closed than he opens them with a sudden start and looks round in terror dick striking the keynote at once no no let me out i am innocent he gives a gasp of relief as he realises the situation free it is true then i have escaped i dreamed that i was back in prison again he shudders and helps himself to a large whiskyandsoda which he swallows at a gulp thats better now i feel a new man the man i was three years ago three years it has been a lifetime pathetically to the audience where is millicent now the audience guesses that she is in the makingup room but musnt say so alas he falls into a reverie from which he is suddenly wakened by a noise outside he starts and then creeps rapidly to the switch arriving there at the moment when the lights go out then he goes swiftly behind the window curtain the lights go up again as jasper beeste comes in with a revolver in one hand and a bullseye lantern of apparently enormous candle power in the other jasper in immaculate evening dress i thought i heard a noise so i slipped on some old things hurriedly and came down fingering his perfectlytied tie but there seems to be nobody here turns round suddenly to the window ha whos there hands up blow you he ought to swear rather badly here

have a little light on you brutally now then my man what have you got to say for yourself ha an escaped convict eh dick to himself in amazement jasper beeste jasper so you know my name dick in the tones of a man whose whole life has been blighted by the machinations of a false friend yes jasper beeste i know your name for two years i have said it to myself every night when i prayed heaven that

friends the warders millicent ring the bell dick wresting the revolver from his grasp ha would you now stand over there and listen to me he arranges his audience millicent on a sofa on the right jasper biting his finger nails on the left three years ago lady wilsdons diamond necklace was stolen my flat was searched and the necklace was found in my hatbox although i protested my innocence i was tried found guilty and sentenced to ten years penal servitude followed by fifteen years police supervision millicent raising herself on the sofa dick you were innocent i know it she flops back again dick i was but how could i prove it i went to prison for a year black despair gnawed at my heart and then something happened the prisoner in the cell next to mine tried to communicate with me by means of taps we soon arranged a system and held conversations together one day he told me of a robbery in which he and another man had been engaged the robbery of a diamond necklace jasper jauntily well dick sternly a diamond necklace jasper beeste which the other man hid in the hatbox of another man in order that he might woo the other mans fiance millicent shrieks jasper blusteringly bah dick quietly the man in the cell next to mine wants to meet this gentleman again it seems that he has some old scores to pay off jasper sneeringly and where is he dick ah where is he he goes to the window and gives a low whistle a stranger in knickerbockers jumps in and advances with a crablike movement good here you are allow me to present you to mr jasper beeste jasper in horror twotoed thomas i am

hereby declare that i stole lady wilsdons diamond necklace and hid it in the hatbox of richard trayle and i further declare that the said richard trayle is innocent of any complicity in the affair advancing with the paper and a fountain pen sign please jasper signs at this moment two warders burst into the room first warder there they are he seizes dick twotoed thomas leaps from the window pursued by the second warder millicent picks up the confession and advances dramatically millicent do not touch that man read this she hands him the confession with an air of superb pride first warder

travels or in the tottenham court road or in some cases presented by admiring readers from abroad the furniture is both elegant and commodious william smith editor comes in he is superbly dressed in a fur coat and an expensive cigar there is a blue pencil behind his ear and a sheaf of what we call in the profession typewritten manuscripts under his arm he sits down at his desk and pulls the

it was friday afternoon john blunt leant back in his comfortable chair and toyed with the key of the safe while he tried to realise his new position he john blunt was junior partner in the great london firm of macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton he closed his eyes and his thoughts wandered back to the day when he had first entered the doors of the firm as one of two hundred and seventyeight applicants for the post of officeboy they had been interviewed in batches and old mr sanderson the senior partner had taken the first batch i like your face my boy he had said heartily to john and i like yours replied john not to be outdone in politeness now i wonder if you can spell mortgage one m said john tentatively mr sanderson was delighted with the lads knowledge and engaged him at once for three years john had done his duty faithfully during this time he had saved the firm more than once by his readiness particularly on one occasion when he had called old mr sandersons attention to the fact that he had signed a letter to a firm of stockbrokers your loving husband macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton mr sanderson always a little absentminded corrected the error and promised the boy his articles five years later john blunt was a solicitor and now he was actually junior partner in the firm the firm of which it was said in the city if a man has macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton behind him he is all right the city is always coining pithy little epigrams like this there was a knock at the door of the enquiry office and a prosperouslooking gentleman came in can i see mr macnaughton he said politely to the officeboy there isnt no mr macnaughton replied the latter they all died years ago well well can i see one of the partners you cant see mr sanderson because hes having his lunch said the boy mr thorpe hasnt come back from lunch yet mr peters has just gone out to lunch mr williams is expected back from lunch every minute mr gourlay went out to lunch an hour ago mr beamish tut tut isnt anybody in mr blunt is in said the boy and took up the telephone if you wait a moment ill see if hes awake half an hour later mr masters was shown into john blunts room im sorry i was engaged said john a most important client now what can i do for you mr er masters i wish to make my will by all means said john cordially i have only one child to whom i intend to leave all my money ha said john with a frown this will be a lengthy and difficult business but you can do it asked mr masters anxiously they told me at the hairdressers that macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton was the cleverest firm in london we can do it said john simply but it will require all our care and i think it would be best if i were to come and stay with you for the weekend we could go into it properly then thank you said mr masters clasping the others hand i was just going to suggest it my motorcar is outside let us go at once i will follow you in a moment said john and pausing only to snatch a handful of money from the safe for incidental expenses and to tell the boy that he would be back on monday he picked up the wellfilled weekend bag which he always kept ready and hurried after the other inside the car mr masters was confidential my daughter he said comes of age tomorrow oh its a daughter said john in surprise is she pretty she is considered to be the prettiest girl in the county really said john he thought a moment and added can we stop at a postoffice i must send an important business telegram he took out a form and wrote macmacmacmacmac london shall not be back till wednesday blunt the car stopped and then sped on again amy has never been any trouble to me said mr masters but i am getting old now and i would give a thousand pounds to see her happily married to whom would you give it asked john whipping out his pocketbook tut tut a mere figure of speech but i would settle a hundred thousand pounds on her on the weddingday indeed said john thoughtfully can we stop at another postoffice he added bringing out his fountainpen again he took out a second telegraph form and wrote macmacmacmacmac london shall not be back till friday blunt the car dashed on again and an hour later arrived at a commodious mansion standing in its own welltimbered grounds of upwards of several acres at the front door a graceful figure was standing my solicitor dear mr blunt said mr masters it is very good of you to come all this way on my fathers business she said shyly not at all said john a week or or a fortnight or he looked at her again or three weeks and the thing is done is making a will so very difficult its a very tricky and complicated affair indeed however i think we shall pull it off er might i send an important business telegram macmacmacmacmac london wrote john very knotty case date of return uncertain please send more cash for incidental expenses blunt yes you have guessed what happened it is an everyday experience in a solicitors life john blunt and amy masters were married at st georges hanover square last may the wedding was a quiet one owing to mourning in the brides family the result of a too sudden perusal of macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughton macnaughtons bill of costs as mr masters said with his expiring breath he didnt mind paying for our mr blunts skill nor yet for our mr blunts valuable time even if most of it was spent in courting amy nor again for our mr blunts tips to servants but he did object to being charged the firstclass railway fare both ways when our mr blunt had come down and gone up again in the car and perhaps i ought to add that that is the drawback to this fine profession one is so often misunderstood xlvii the painter mr paul samways was in a mood of deep depression the artistic temperament is peculiarly given to these moods but in pauls case there was reason why he should take a gloomy view of things his masterpiece the shot tower from battersea bridge together with the companion picture battersea bridge from the shot tower had been purchased by a dealer for seventeen and sixpence his sepia monochrome night had brought him an iou for five shillings these were his sole earnings for the last six weeks and starvation stared him in the face if only i had a little capital he cried aloud in despair enough to support me until my academy picture is finished his academy picture was a masterly study entitled roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll and he had been compelled to stop halfway across the channel through sheer lack of ultramarine the clock struck two reminding him that he had not lunched he rose wearily and went to the little cupboard which served as a larder there was but little there to make a satisfying meal half a loaf of bread a corner of cheese and a small tube of chinese white mechanically he set the things out he had finished and was clearing away when there came a knock at the door his charwoman whose duty it was to clean his brushes every week came in with a card a lady to see you sir she said paul read the card in astonishment the duchess of winchester he exclaimed what on earth show her in please hastily picking up a brush and the first tube which came to hand he placed himself in a dramatic position before his easel and set to work how do you do mr samways said the duchess ggood afternoon said paul embarrassed both by the presence of a duchess in his studio and by his sudden discovery that he was touching up a sunset with a tube of carbolic tooth paste our mutual friend lord ernest topwood recommended me to come to you paul who had never met lord ernest but had once seen his name in a hapenny paper beneath a photograph of mr arnold bennett bowed silently as you probably guess i want you to paint my daughters portrait paul opened his mouth to say that he was only a landscape painter and then closed it again after all it was hardly fair to bother her grace with technicalities i hope you can undertake this commission she said pleadingly i shall be delighted said paul i am rather busy just now but i could begin at two oclock on monday excellent said the duchess till monday then and paul still clutching the tooth paste conducted her to her carriage punctually at on monday lady hermione appeared paul drew a deep breath of astonishment when he saw her for she was lovely beyond compare all his skill as a landscape painter would be needed if he were to do justice to her beauty as quickly as possible he placed her in position and set to work may i let my face go for a moment said lady hermione after three hours of it yes let us stop said paul he had outlined her in charcoal and burnt cork and it would be too dark to do any more that evening tell me where you first met lord ernest she asked as she came down to the fire at the savoy in june said paul boldly lady hermione laughed merrily paul who had not regarded his last remark as one of his best things looked at her in surprise but your portrait of him was in the academy in may she smiled paul made up his mind quickly lady hermione he said with gravity do not speak to me of lord ernest again nor he added hurriedly to lord ernest of me when your picture is finished i will tell you why now it is time you went he woke the duchess up and made a few commonplace remarks about the weather remember he whispered to lady hermione as he saw them to their car she nodded and smiled the sittings went on daily sometimes paul would paint rapidly with great sweeps of the brush sometimes he would spend an hour trying to get on his palette the exact shade of green bice for the famous winchester emeralds sometimes in despair he would take a sponge and wipe the whole picture out and then start madly again and sometimes he would stop work altogether and tell lady hermione about his homelife in worcestershire but always when he woke the duchess up at the end of the sitting he would say remember and lady hermione would nod back at him it was a springlike day in march when the picture was finished and nothing remained to do but to paint in the signature it is beautiful said lady hermione with enthusiasm beautiful is it at all like me paul looked from her to the picture and back to her again no he said not a bit you know i am really a landscape painter what do you mean she cried you are peter samways ara the famous portrait painter no he said sadly that was my secret i am paul samways a member of the amateur rowing association it is true but only an unknown landscape painter peter samways lives in the next studio and he is not even a relation then you have deceived me you have brought me here under false pretences she stamped her foot angrily my father will not buy that picture and i forbid you to exhibit it as a portrait of myself my dear lady hermione said paul you need not be alarmed i propose to exhibit the picture as when the heart is young nobody will recognise a likeness to you in it and if the duke does not buy it i have no doubt that some other purchaser will come along lady hermione looked at him thoughtfully why did you do it she asked gently because i fell in love with you she dropped her eyes and then raised them gaily to his mother is still asleep she whispered hermione he cried dropping his palette and putting his brush behind his ear she held out her arms to him as everybody remembers when the heart is young by paul samways was the feature of the exhibition it was bought for by a retired bottlemanufacturer whom it reminded a little of his late mother paul woke to find himself famous but the success which began for him from this day did not spoil his simple and generous nature he never forgot his brother artists whose feet were not yet on the top of the ladder indeed one of his first acts after he was married was to give a commission to peter samways ara nothing less than the painting of his wifes portrait and lady hermione was delighted with the result xlviii the barrister the new bailey was crowded with a gay and fashionable throng it was a remarkable case of shoplifting aurora delaine was charged with feloniously stealing and conveying certain articles the property of the universal stores to wit thirtyfive yards of book muslin ten pairs of gloves a sponge two gimlets five jars of cold cream a copy of the clergy list three hatguards a mariners compass a box of drawingpins an eggbreaker six blouses and a cabmans whistle the theft had been proved by albert jobson a shopwalker who gave evidence to the effect that he followed her through the different departments and saw her take the things mentioned in the indictment just a moment interrupted the judge who is defending the prisoner there was an unexpected silence rupert carleton who had dropped idly into court looked round in sudden excitement the poor girl had no counsel what if he yes he would seize the chance he stood up boldly i am my lord he said rupert carleton was still in the twenties but he had been a briefless barrister for some years yet though briefs would not come he had been very far from idle he had stood for parliament in both the conservative and liberal interests not to mention his own he had written halfadozen unproduced plays and he was engaged to be married but success in his own profession had been delayed now at last was his opportunity he pulled his wig down firmly over his ears took out a pair of pincenez and rose to crossexamine it was the crossexamination which was to make him famous the crossexamination which is now given as a model in every legal textbook mr jobson he began suavely you say that you saw the accused steal these various articles and that they were afterwards found upon her yes i put it to you said rupert and waited intently for the answer that that is a pure invention on your part no with a superhuman effort rupert hid his disappointment unexpected as the answer was he preserved his impassivity i suggest he tried again that you followed her about and concealed this collection of things in her cloak with a view to advertising your winter sale no i saw her steal them rupert frowned the man seemed impervious to the simplest suggestion with masterly decision he tapped his pincenez and fell back upon his third line of defence you saw her steal them what you mean is that you saw her take them from the different counters and put them in her bag yes with the intention of paying for them in the ordinary way no please be very careful you said in your evidence that prisoner when told she would be charged cried to think that i should have come to this will no one save me i suggest that she went up to you with her collection of purchases pulled out her purse and said what does all this come to i cant get any one to serve me no the obstinacy of some people rupert put back his pincenez in his pocket and brought out another pair the historic crossexamination continued we will let that pass for the moment he said he consulted a blank sheet of paper and then looked sternly at mr jobson mr jobson how many times have you been married once quite so he hesitated and then decided to risk it i suggest that your wife left you yes it was a long shot but once again the bold course had paid rupert heaved a sigh of relief will you tell the gentlemen of the jury he said with deadly politeness why she left you she died a lesser man might have been embarrassed but ruperts iron nerve did not fail him exactly he said and was that or was that not on the night when you were turned out of the hampstead parliament for intoxication i never was indeed will you cast your mind back to the night of april th what were you doing on that night i have no idea said jobson after casting his mind back and waiting in vain for some result in that case you cannot swear that you were not being turned out of the hampstead parliament but i never belonged to it rupert leaped at the damaging admission what you told the court you lived at hampstead and yet you say that you never belonged to the hampstead parliament is that your idea of patriotism i said i lived at hackney to the hackney parliament i should say i am suggesting that you were turned out of the hackney parliament i dont belong to that either exactly said rupert triumphantly having been turned out for intoxication and never did belong indeed may i take it then that you prefer to spend your evenings in the publichouse if you want to know said jobson angrily i belong to the hackney chess circle and that takes up most of my evenings rupert gave a sigh of satisfaction and turned to the jury at last gentlemen we have got it i thought we should arrive at the truth in the end in spite of mr jobsons prevarications he turned to the witness now sir he said sternly you have already told the court that you have no idea what you were doing on the night of april th i put it to you once more that this blankness of memory is due to the fact that you were in a state of intoxication on the premises of the hackney chess circle can you swear on your oath that this is not so a murmur of admiration for the relentless way in which the truth had been tracked down ran through the court rupert drew himself up and put on both pairs of pincenez at once come sir he said the jury is waiting but it was not albert jobson who answered it was the counsel for the prosecution my lord he said getting up slowly this has come as a complete surprise to me in the circumstances i must advise my clients to withdraw from the case a very proper decision said his lordship the prisoner is discharged without a stain on her character briefs poured in upon rupert next day and he was engaged for all the big chancery cases within a week his six plays were accepted and within a fortnight he had entered parliament as the miners member for coalville his marriage took place at the end of a month the wedding presents were even more numerous and costly than usual and included thirtyfive yards of bookmuslin ten pairs of gloves a sponge two gimlets five jars of cold cream a copy of the clergy list three hat guards a mariners compass a box of drawingpins an eggbreaker six blouses and a cabmans whistle they were marked quite simply from a grateful friend xlix the civil servant it was three oclock and the afternoon sun reddened the western windows of one of the busiest of government offices in an airy room on the third floor richard dale was batting standing in front of the coalbox with the fireshovel in his hands he was a model of the strenuous young englishman and as for the third time he turned the government indiarubber neatly in the direction of squareleg and so completed his fifty the bowler could hardly repress a sigh of envious admiration even the reserved matthews who was too old for cricket looked up a moment from his putting and said well played dick the fourth occupant of the room was busy at his desk as if to give the lie to the thoughtless accusation that the civil service cultivates the body at the expense of the mind the eager shouts of the players seemed to annoy him for he frowned and bit his pen or else passed his fingers restlessly through his hair how the dickens do you expect any one to think in this confounded noise he cried suddenly whats the matter ashby youre the matter how am i going to get these verses done for the evening surprise if you make such a row why dont you go out to tea good idea come on dale you coming matthews they went out leaving the room to ashby in his youth harold ashby had often been told by his relations that he had a literary bent his letters home from school were generally pronounced to be good enough for punch and some of them together with a certificate of character from his vicar were actually sent to that paper but as he grew up he realised that his genius was better fitted for work of a more solid character his post in the civil service gave him full leisure for his adam a fragment his history of the microscope and his studies in rural campanology and yet left him ample time in which to contribute to the journalism of the day the poem he was now finishing for the evening surprise was his first contribution to that paper but he had little doubt that it would be accepted it was called quite simply love and death and it began like this love o love all other things above why o why am i afraid to die there were six more lines which i have forgotten but i suppose they gave the reason for this absurd diffidence having written the poem out neatly harold put it in an envelope and took it round to the evening surprise the strain of composition had left him rather weak and he decided to give his brain a rest for the next few days so it happened that he was at the wickets on the following wednesday afternoon when the commissionaire brought him in the historic letter he opened it hastily the shovel under his arm dear sir wrote the editor of the evening surprise will you come round and see me as soon as convenient harold lost no time explaining that he would finish his innings later he put his coat on took his hat and stick and dashed out how do you do said the editor i wanted to talk to you about your work we all liked your little poem very much it will be coming out tomorrow thursday said harold helpfully i was wondering whether we couldnt get you to join our staff does the idea of doing aunt miriams cosy corner in our afternoon edition appeal to you at all no said harold not a bit ah thats a pity he tapped his desk thoughtfully well then how would you like to be a war correspondent very much said harold i was considered to write rather good letters home from school splendid theres this little war in mexico when can you start all expenses and fifty pounds a week youre not very busy at the office just now i suppose i could get sick leave easily enough said harold if it wasnt for more than eight or nine months do that will be excellent heres a blank cheque for your outfit can you get off tomorrow but i suppose youll have one or two things to finish up at the office first well said harold cautiously i was in and id made ninetysix but if i go back and finish my innings now and then have tomorrow for buying things i could get off on friday good said the editor well heres luck come back alive if you can and if you do we shant forget you harold spent the next day buying a war correspondents outfit the camel the travelling bath the putties the pith helmet the quinine the sleepingbag and the thousandandone other necessities of active service on the friday his colleagues at the office came down in a body to southampton to see him off little did they think that nearly a year would elapse before he again set foot upon england i shall not describe all his famous coups at mexico sufficient to say that experience taught him quickly all that he had need to learn and that whereas he was more than a week late with his cabled account of the first engagement of the war he was frequently more than a week early afterwards indeed the battle of parsons nose so realistically described in his last telegram is still waiting to be fought it is to be hoped that it will be in time for his aptlynamed book with the mexicans in mexico which is coming out next month on his return to england harold found that time had wrought many changes to begin with the editor of the evening surprise had passed on to the morning exclamation you had better take his place said the ducal proprietor to harold right said harold i suppose i shall have to resign my post at the office just as you like i dont see why you should i should miss the cricket said harold wistfully and the salary ill go round see what i can arrange but there were also changes at the office harold had been rising steadily in salary and seniority during his absence and he found to his delight that he was now a principal clerk he found too that he had acquired quite a reputation in the office for quickness and efficiency in his new work the first thing to arrange about was his holiday he had had no holiday for more than a year and there were some eight weeks owing to him hullo said the assistant secretary as harold came in youre looking well i suppose you can manage to get away for the weekends ive been away on sick leave for some time said harold pathetically have you youve kept it very secret come out and have lunch with me and well do a matine afterwards harold went out with him happily it would be pleasant to accept the editorship of the evening surprise without giving up the governmental work which was so dear to him and the assistant secretarys words made this possible for a year or so anyhow then when his absence from the office began to be noticed it would be time to think of retiring on an adequate pension l the actor mr levinski the famous actormanager dragged himself from beneath the car took the snow out of his mouth and swore heartily mortal men are liable to motor accidents even kings cars have backfired but it seems strange that actormanagers are not specially exempt from these occurrences mr levinski was not only angry he was also a little shocked when an actormanager has to walk two miles to the nearest town on a winter evening one may be pardoned a doubt as to whether all is quite right with the world but the completest tragedy has its compensations for some one the pitiable arrival of mr levinski at the dukes head unrecognised and with his fur coat slightly ruffled might make a sceptic of the most devout optimist and yet eustace merrowby can never look back upon that evening without a sigh of thankfulness for to him it was the beginning of his career the story has often been told since in about a dozen weekly papers halfadozen daily papers and three dozen provincial papers but it will always bear telling again there was no train to london that night and mr levinski had been compelled to put up at the dukes head however he had dined and was feeling slightly better he summoned the manager of the hotel what does one do in this damn place he asked with a yawn the manager instantly recognising that he was speaking to a member of the aristocracy made haste to reply othello was being played at the town theatre his daughter who had already been three times told him that it was very sweet he was sure his lordship mr levinski dismissed him and considered the point he had to amuse himself with something that evening and the choice apparently lay between othello and the local directory he picked up the directory by a lucky chance for eustace merrowby it was three years old mr levinski put on his fur coat and went to see othello for some time he was as bored as he had expected to be but halfway through the third act he began to wake up there was something in the playing of the principal actor which moved him strangely he looked at his programme othello mr eustace merrowby mr levinski frowned thoughtfully merrowby he said to himself i dont know the name but hes the man i want he took out the gold pencil presented to him by the emperor the stationmaster had had a tiepin and wrote a note he was finishing breakfast next morning when mr merrowby was announced ah good morning said mr levinski good morning you find me very busy and here he began to turn the pages of the directory backwards and forwards but i can give you a moment what is it you want you asked me to call on you said eustace did i did i he passed his hand across his brow with a noble gesture i am so busy i forget ah now i remember i saw you play othello last night you are the man i want i am producing oom baas the great south african drama next april at my theatre perhaps you know i have read about it in the papers said eustace in all the papers he might have added every day for the last six months good then you may have heard that one of the scenes is an ostrich farm i want you to play tommy one of the ostriches asked eustace i do not offer the part of an ostrich to a man who has played othello tommy is the kaffir boy who looks after the farm it is a black part like your present one but not so long in london you cannot expect to take the leading parts just yet this is very kind of you said eustace gratefully i have always longed to get to london and to start in your theatre its a wonderful chance good said mr levinski then thats settled he waved eustace away and took up the directory again with a businesslike air and so eustace merrowby came to london it is a great thing for a young actor to come to london as mr levinski had warned him his new part was not so big as that of othello he had to say hofo tsetse which was alleged to be kaffir for down sir to the big ostrich but to be at the st georges theatre at all was an honour which most men would envy him and his association with a real ostrich was bound to bring him before the public in the pages of the illustrated papers eustace curiously enough was not very nervous on the first night he was fairly certain that he was wordperfect and if only the ostrich didnt kick him in the back of the neck as it had tried to once at rehearsal the evening seemed likely to be a triumph for him and so it was with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation that on the morning after he gathered the papers round him at breakfast and prepared to read what the critics had to say he had a remarkable press i give a few examples of the notices he obtained from the leading papers mr eustace merrowby was tommy daily telegraph the cast included mr eustace merrowby times mr eustace merrowby daily chronicle we have no space in which to mention all the other performers morning leader this criticism only concerns the two actors we have mentioned and does not apply to the rest of the cast sportsman where all were so good it would be invidious to single out anybody for special praise daily mail the acting deserved a better play daily news tommy morning post as eustace read the papers he felt that his future was secure true the era careful never to miss a single performer had yet to say mr eustace merrowby was capital as tommy and the stage tommy was capitally played by mr eustace merrowby but even without this he had become one of the men who count one whose private life was of more interest to the public than that of any scientist general or diplomat in the country into eustace merrowbys subsequent career i cannot go at full length it is perhaps as a member of the garrick club that he has attained his fullest development all the good things of the garrick which were not previously said by sydney smith may safely be put down to eustace and there is no doubt that he is the ringleader in all the subsequent practical jokes which have made the club famous it was he who pinned to the back of an unpopular member of the committee a sheet of paper bearing the words kick me and the occasion on which he drew the chair from beneath a certain eminent author as the latter was about to sit down is still referred to hilariously by the older members finally as a convincing proof of his greatness let it be said that everybody has at least heard the name eustace merrowby even though some may be under the impression that it is the trademark of a sauce and that half the young ladies of wandsworth common and winchmore hill are in love with him if this be not success what is li the collector when peter plimsoll the glue king died his parting advice to his sons to stick to the business was followed only by john the elder adrian the younger had a soul above adhesion he disposed of his share in the concern and settled down to follow the life of a gentleman of taste and culture and more particularly patron of the arts he began in a modest way by collecting inkpots his range at first was catholic and it was not until he had acquired a hundred and fortyseven inkpots of various designs that he decided to make a specialty of historic ones this decision was hastened by the discovery that one of queen elizabeths inkstands supposed by the owner to be the identical one with whose aid she wrote her last letter to raleigh was about to be put on the market at some expense adrian obtained an introduction through a third party to the owner at more expense the owner obtained through the same gentleman an introduction to adrian and in less than a month the great elizabeth inkpot was safely established in adrians house it was the beginning of the plimsoll collection this was twenty years ago let us today take a walk through the galleries of mr adrian plimsolls charming residence which as the world knows overlooks the park any friend of mine is always welcome at number fifteen we will start with the north gallery i fear that i shall only have time to point out a few of the choicest gems this is a pontesiori sword of the thirteenth century the only example of the masters art without any notches on the left is a capricci comfitbox if you have never heard of capricci you oughtnt to come to a house like this here we have before us the historic de montigny topaz ask your little boy to tell you about it in the east gallery of course the chief treasure is the santo di santo amulet described so minutely in his vindicia veritatis by john of flanders the original ms of this book is in the south gallery you must glance at it when we get there it will save you the trouble of ordering a copy from your library they would be sure to keep you waiting with some such words as these i lead my friends round number fifteen the many treasures in the private parts of the house i may not show of course the bathroom for instance in which hangs the finest collection of portraits of philatelists that europe can boast you must spend a night with adrian to be admitted to their company and as one of the elect i can assure you that nothing can be more stimulating on a winters morning than to catch the eye of frisby dranger fphs behind the taps as your head first emerges from the icy waters adrian plimsoll sat at breakfast sipping his hot water and crumbling a dry biscuit a light was in his eye a flush upon his pallid countenance he had just heard from a trusty agent that the scutori breastplate had been seen in devonshire his car was ready to take him to the station but alas a disappointment awaited him on close examination the breastplate turned out to be a common risoldo of inferior working adrian left the house in disgust and started on his sevenmile walk back to the station to complete his misery a sudden storm came on cursing alternately his agent and risoldo he made his way to a cottage and asked for shelter an old woman greeted him civilly and bade him come in if i may just wait till the storm is over said adrian and he sat down in her parlour and looked appraisingly as was his habit round the room the grandfather clock in the corner was genuine but he was beyond grandfather clocks there was nothing else of any value three china dogs and some odd trinkets on the chimneypiece a print or two stay what was that behind the youngest dog may i look at that old bracelet he asked his voice trembling a little and without waiting for permission he walked over and took up the circle of tarnished metal in his hands as he examined it his colour came and went his heart seemed to stop beating with a tremendous effort he composed himself and returned to his chair it was the emperors bracelet of course you know the history of this most famous of all bracelets made by spurius quintus of rome in b c it was given by csar to cleopatra who tried without success to dissolve it in vinegar returning to rome by way of antony it was worn at a minor conflagration by nero after which it was lost sight of for many centuries it was eventually heard of during the reign of canute or knut as his admirers called him and john is known to have lost it in the wash whence it was recovered a century afterwards it must have travelled thence to france for it was seen once in the possession of louis xi and from there to spain for philip the handsome presented it to joanna on her wedding day columbus took it to america but fortunately brought it back again peter the great threw it at an indifferent musician on one of its later visits to england pope wrote a couplet to it and the most astonishing thing in its whole history was that now for more than a hundred years it had vanished completely to turn up again in a little devonshire cottage verily truth is stranger than fiction thats rather a curious bracelet of yours said adrian casually my er wife has one just like it which she asked me to match is it an old friend or would you care to sell it my mother gave it me said the old woman and she had it from hers i dont know no further than that i didnt mean to sell it but quite right said adrian and after all i can easily get another but i wont say a bit of money wouldnt be useful what would you think a fair price sir five shillings adrians heart jumped to get the emperors bracelet for five shillings but the spirit of the collector rose up strong within him he laughed kindly my good woman he said they turn out bracelets like that in birmingham at two shillings apiece and quite new ill give you tenpence make it oneandsixpence she pleaded times are hard adrian reflected he was not strictly speaking impoverished he could afford oneandsixpence oneandtuppence he said no no oneandsixpence she repeated obstinately adrian reflected again after all he could always sell it for ten thousand pounds if the worst came to the worst well well he sighed oneandsixpence let it be he counted out the money carefully then putting the precious bracelet in his pocket he rose to go adrian has no relations living now when he dies he proposes to leave the plimsoll collection to the nation having as far as he can foresee no particular use for it in the next world this is really very generous of him and no doubt when the time comes the papers will say so but it is a pity that he cannot be appreciated properly in his lifetime personally i should like to see him knighted lii the statesman on a certain night in the middle of the season all london was gathered in lady marchpanes drawingroom all london that is which was worth knowing a qualification which accounted for the absence of several million people who had never heard of lady marchpane in one corner of the room an ambassador with a few ribbons across his chest could have been seen chatting to the latest american duchess in another corner one of our largest advertisers was exchanging epigrams with a titled newspaper proprietor famous generals rubbed shoulders with postimpressionist artists financiers whispered sweet nothings to breeders of prize poms even an actormanager might have been seen accepting an apology from a royalty who had jostled him hallo said algy lascelles catching sight of the dignified figure of rupert meryton in the crowd hows william a rare smile lit up ruperts distinguished features he was undersecretary for invasion affairs and william was algys pleasant way of referring to the bill which he was now piloting through the house of commons it was a measure for doing something or other by means of a what dyou call it i cannot be more precise without precipitating a european conflict i think we shall get it through said rupert calmly lady marchpane was talking about it just now shes rather interested you know ruperts lips closed about his mouth in a firm line he looked over algys head into the crowd oh he said coldly it was barely ten years ago that young meryton just down from oxford had startled the political world by capturing the important seat of cricklewood e for the tariffadicals as to avoid plunging the country into civil war i must call them this was at a byelection and the liberatives had immediately dissolved only to come into power after the general election with an increased majority through the years that followed rupert meryton by his pertinacity in asking the invasion secretary questions which had been answered by him on the previous day and by his regard for the dignity of the house as shown in his invariable comment come come not quite the gentleman upon any display of bad manners opposite established a clear right to a post in the subsequent tariffadical government he had now been undersecretary for two years and in this bill his first real chance had come oh there you are mr meryton said a voice come and talk to me a moment with a nod to a couple of archbishops lady marchpane led the way to a little gallery whither the crowd had not penetrated priceless correggios tintorettos and g k chestertons hung upon the walls but it was not to show him these that she had come dropping into a wonderful old chippendale chair she motioned him to a blundellmaple opposite her and looked at him with a curious smile well she said about the bill ruperts lips closed about his mouth in a firm line he was rather good at this folding his arms he gazed steadily into lady marchpanes still beautiful eyes it will go through he said through all its stages he added professionally it must not go through said lady marchpane gently rupert could not repress a start but he was master of himself again in a moment i cannot add anything to my previous statement he said if it goes through began lady marchpane i must refer you said rupert to my answer of yesterday come come mr meryton what is the good of fencing with me you know the position or shall i state it for you again i cannot believe you are serious i am perfectly serious there are reasons financial reasons and others why i do not want this bill to pass in return for my silence upon a certain matter you are going to prevent it passing you know to what i refer on the th of may last stop cried rupert hoarsely on the th of may last lady marchpane went on relentlessly you and i in the absence of my husband abroad had tea together at an abc rupert covered his face with his hands i am no fonder of scandal than you are but if you do not meet my wishes i shall certainly confess the truth to marchpane you will be ruined too said rupert my husband will forgive me and take me back she paused significantly will marjorie hale rupert covered his hands with his face will the good miss hale forgive you she is very strict is she not and rich and rising young politicians want money more than scandal she raised her head suddenly at the sound of footsteps ah archbishop i was just calling mr merytons attention to this wonderful botticell she looked at it more closely this wonderful dana gibson a beautiful piece of work is it not the intruders passed on to the supperroom and they were alone again what am i to do said rupert sullenly the fate of the bill is settled today week when you make your big speech you must speak against it confess frankly you were mistaken it will be a close thing anyhow your influence will turn the scale it will ruin me politically you will marry marjorie hale and be rich no rich man is ever ruined politically or socially she patted his hand gently youll do it he got up slowly youll see next week he said it is not meet that we should watch the unhappy rupert through the longdrawn hours of the night as he wrestled with the terrible problem a moments sudden madness on that may afternoon had brought him to the crossroads on the one hand reputation wealth the girl that he loved on the other his own honour and so at least he had said several times on the platform the safety of england he rose in the morning weary but with his mind made up the bill should go through rupert meryton was a speaker of a not unusual type although he provided the opinions himself he always depended upon his secretary for the arguments with which to support them and the actual words in which to give them being but on this occasion he felt that a special effort was required of him he would show lady marchpane that the blackmail of yesterday had only roused him to a still greater sacrifice on behalf of his country he would write his own speech on the fateful night the house was crowded it seemed that all the guests at lady marchpanes a week before were in the distinguished strangers gallery or behind the ladies grille from the press gallery our special wordpainter looked down upon the statesmen beneath him his eagle eye ready to detect on the moment the angry flush the wince or the sudden paling of enemy the grim smile or the lofty calm of friend the rt hon rupert meryton tariffadical member for cricklewood e rose to his feet amidst cheers mr speaker he said i rise er tonight sir hrm to er so much of his speech i may give but urgent state reasons compel me to withhold the rest were it ever known with which bill the secret history that i have disclosed concerns itself the great powers in an instant would be at each others throats but though i may not disclose the speech i can tell of its effect on the house and its effect was curious it was in short the exact opposite of what rupert meryton that promising under secretary had intended it was the first speech that he had ever prepared himself than rupert there was no more dignified figure in the house of commons his honour was proof as we have seen against the most insidious temptations yet since one man cannot have all the virtues he was distinctly stupid it would have been a hopeless speech anyhow but to make matters worse he had in the most important part of it attempted irony and at the beginning of the ironical passage even the tariffadical wordpainters had to confess that it was their own stalwarts who suddenly paled as lady marchpane had said it was bound to be a close thing the liberatives and the unialists of course were solid against the bill but there was also something of a cave in the tariffadical party it was bound to be a close thing and ruperts speech just made the difference when he sat down the waverers and doubters had made up their minds the bill was defeated that the tariffadicals should resign was natural perhaps it was equally natural that ruperts secretary should resign too he said that his reputation would be gone if rupert made any more speeches on his own and that he wasnt going to risk it without his secretary rupert was lost at the general election which followed fortunately he had a grateful friend in lady marchpane she exerted her influence with the liberatives and got him an appointment as governor of the stickjaw islands here with his beautiful and rich wife sir rupert meryton maintains a regal state and upon his name no breath of scandal rests indeed his only trouble so far has been with the stickjaw language a difficult language but one which perhaps fortunately does not lend itself to irony liii the magnate it was in october that the word zinc first began to be heard in financial circles city men pushing their dominoes regretfully away and murmuring zinc in apologetic tones were back in their offices by three oclock forgetting in their haste to leave the usual twopence under the cup for the waitress clubmen glancing at the tape on their way to the smokingroom said to their neighbours zincs moved a point i see before covering themselves up with the times in the trains returning husbands asked each other loudly whats all this about zinc all save the very innocent ones who whispered i say what is zinc exactly the musichalls took it up no sooner had the word zinc left the lips of an acknowledged comedian than the house was in roars of laughter the furore at the collodium when octavius octo in his worldfamous part of the landlady of a boardinghouse remarked i know why my ole mans so late es buying zinc is still remembered in the bars round piccadilly to explain it properly it will be necessary my readers will be alarmed to hear to go back some thirty years this as a simple calculation shows takes us to june it was in june that felix moses a stout young man of attractive appearance if you care for that style took his courage in both hands and told phyllida sloan that he was worth ten thousand a year and was changing his name to mountenay miss sloan seeing that it was the beginning of a proposal said hastily that she was changing hers to abraham youre marrying leo abraham asked felix in amazement ah a gust of jealousy swept over him he licked his lips there was a dangerous look in his eyes a look that was destined in after days to make emperors and rival financiers quail ah he said softly leo abraham i shall not forget and now it will be necessary my readers will be relieved to learn to jump forward some thirty years this obviously takes us to september let us on this fine september morning take a peep into no throgneedle street e c and see how the business of the mother city is carried on on the fourth floor we come to the sanctum of the great man himself mr felix mountenay no admittance is painted upon the outer door it is a name which is known and feared all over europe mr mountenays private detective stands on one side of the door on the other side is mr mountenays private wolfhound murmuring the word press however we pass hastily through and find ourselves before mr mountenay himself mr mountenay is at work let us watch him through a typical five minutes for a moment he stands meditating in the middle of the room kings are tottering on their thrones empires hang upon his nod what will he decide suddenly he blows a cloud of smoke from his cigar and rushes to the telephone hallo is that you jones what are margarine prefs at what no margarine prefs idiot ah then sell keep on selling till i tell you to stop yes he hangs up the receiver for two minutes he paces the room smoking rapidly he stops a moment but it is only to remove his cigarband which is in danger of burning then he resumes his pacings another minute goes rapidly by he rushes to the telephone again hallo is that you jones what are margarine prefs down to now ah then buy keep on buying yes he hangs up the receiver by this masterstroke he has made a quarter of a million it may seem to you or me an easy way of doing it ah but what we must ask ourselves of the great brain that conceived the idea the foresight which told the exact moment when to put it into action the cool courage which seized the moment what of the grasp of affairs the knowledge of men ah can we grudge it him that he earns a quarter of a million more quickly than we do yet mr felix mountenay is not happy when we have brought off a coup for a hundred thousand even we smile gaily mr mountenay did not smile fiercely he bit another inch off his cigar and muttered to himself the words were leo abraham wait this is positively the last row of stars let us take advantage of them to jump forward another month it was october st if that was a sunday then it was october nd anyhow it was october mr felix mountenay was sleeping in his office for once that iron brain relaxed he had made a little over three million in the last month and the strain was too much for him but a knock at the door restored him instantly to his own cool self i beg your pardon sir said his secretary but somebody is selling zinc the word zinc touched a chord in mr mountenays brain which had lain dormant for years zinc why did zinc remind him of leo abraham fetch the encyclopdia britannica quick he cried the secretary a man of herculean build returned with some of it with the luck which proverbially attends rich men mr mountenay picked up the z volume at once as he read the zinc article it all came back to him leo abraham had owned an empty zincmine was his enemy in his clutches at last buy he said briefly in a fortnight the secretary had returned well said mr mountenay have you bought all the zinc that there is yes sir said the secretary and a lot that there isnt he added good he paused a moment when mr leo abraham calls he added grimly show him up at once it was a month later that a haggard man climbed the stairs of no throgneedle street and was shown into mr mountenays room well said the financier softly what can i do for you i want some zinc said leo abergavenny zinc said mr mountenay with a smile is a million pounds a ton or an acre or a gallon or however you prefer to buy it he added humorously leo went white you wish to ruin me i do a promise i made to your wife some years ago my wife cried leo what do you mean im not married it was mr mountenays turn to go white he went it not married but miss sloan mr leo abergavenny sat down and mopped his face i dont know what you mean he said i asked miss sloan to marry me and told her i was changing my name to abergavenny and she said that she was changing hers to moses naturally i thought stop cried mr mountenay he sat down heavily something seemed to have gone out of his life in a moment the world was empty he looked up at his old rival and forced a laugh well well he said she deceived us both let us drink to our lucky escape he rang the bell and then he said in a purring voice we can have a little talk about zinc after all business is still business liv the adventurer lionel norwood from his earliest days had been marked out for a life of crime when quite a child he was discovered by his nurse killing flies on the windowpane this was before the character of the housefly had become a matter of common talk among scientists and lionel like all great men a little before his time had pleaded hygiene in vain he was smacked hastily and bundled off to a preparatory school where his aptitude for smuggling sweets would have lost him many a halfholiday had not his services been required at outsideleft in the hockey eleven with some difficulty he managed to pass into eton and three years later with one would imagine still more difficulty managed to get superannuated at cambridge he went downhill rapidly he would think nothing of smoking a cigar in academical costume and on at least one occasion he drove a dogcart on sunday no wonder that he was requested early in his second year to give up his struggle with the littlego and betake himself back to london london is always glad to welcome such people as lionel norwood in no other city is it so simple for a man of easy conscience to earn a living by his wits if lionel ever had any scruples which after a perusal of the above account of his early days it may be permitted one to doubt they were removed by an accident to his solicitor who was run over in the argentine on the very day that he arrived there with what was left of lionels money reduced suddenly to poverty norwood had no choice but to enter upon a life of crime except perhaps that he used slightly less hairoil than most he seemed just the ordinary man about town as he sat in his dressinggown one fine summer morning and smoked a cigarette his rooms were furnished quietly and in the best of taste no signs of his nefarious profession showed themselves to the casual visitor the appealing letters from the princess whom he was blackmailing the wire apparatus which shot the two of spades down his sleeve during the cooncan nights at the club the thimble and pea with which he had performed the threecard trick so successfully at epsom last week all these were hidden away from the common gaze it was a young gentleman of fashion who lounged in his chair and toyed with a priceless straightcut there was a tap at the door and masters his confidential valet came in well said lionel have you looked through the post yes sir said the man theres the usual cheque from her highness a request for more time from the lady in tite street with twopence to pay on the envelope and banknotes from the professor as expected the young gentleman of hill street has gone abroad suddenly sir ah said lionel with a sudden frown i suppose youd better cross him off our list masters yes sir i had ventured to do so sir i think thats all except that mr snooks is glad to accept your kind invitation to dinner and bridge tonight will you wear the hairspring coat sir or the metal clip lionel made no answer he sat plunged in thought when he spoke it was about another matter masters he said i have found out lord fairlies secret at last i shall go to see him this afternoon yes sir will you wear your revolver sir as its a first call i think so if this comes off masters it will make our fortune i hope so im sure sir masters placed the whisky within reach and left the room silently alone lionel picked up his paper and turned to the agony column as everybody knows the agony column of a daily paper is not actually so domestic as it seems when mother apparently says to floss come home at once father gone away for week bert and sid longing to see you what is really happening is that barney hoker is telling jud batson to meet him outside the duke of westminsters little place at am precisely on tuesday morning not forgetting to bring his jemmy and a dark lantern with him and flosss announcement next day coming home with george is juds way of saying that he will turn up all right and half thinks of bringing his automatic pistol with him too in case of accidents in this language which of course takes some little learning lionel norwood had long been an expert the advertisement which he was now reading was unusually elaborate lost in a taxi between baker street and shepherds bush a goldmounted umbrella with initials j p on it if ellen will return to her father immediately all will be forgiven white spot on foreleg mother very anxious and desires to return thanks for kind enquiries answers to the name of ponto bis dat qui cito dat what did it mean for lionel it had no secrets he was reading the revelation by one of his agents of the skeleton in lord fairlies cupboard lord fairlie was one of the most distinguished members of the cabinet his vein of high seriousness his lofty demeanour the sincerity of his manner endeared him not only to his own party but even astounding as it may seem to a few highminded men upon the other side who admitted in moments of expansion which they probably regretted afterwards that he might after all be as devoted to his country as they were for years now his life had been without blemish it was impossible to believe that even in his youth he could have sown any wild oats terrible to think that these wild oats might now be coming home to roost what do you require of me he said courteously to lionel as the latter was shown into his study lionel went to the point at once i am here my lord he said on business in the course of my ordinary avocations the parliamentary atmosphere seemed to be affecting his language i ascertained a certain secret in your past life which if it were revealed might conceivably have a not undamaging effect upon your career for my silence in this matter i must demand a sum of fifty thousand pounds lord fairlie had grown paler and paler as this speech proceeded what have you discovered he whispered alas he knew only too well what the damning answer would be twenty years ago said lionel you wrote a humorous book lord fairlie gave a strangled cry his keen mind recognised in a flash what a hold this knowledge would give his enemies shafts of folly his book had been called already he saw the leading articles of the future we confess ourselves somewhat at a loss to know whether lord fairlies speech at plymouth yesterday was intended as a supplement to his earlier work shafts of folly or as a serious offering to a nation impatient of levity in such a crisis the cabinets jester in whom twenty years ago the country lost an excellent clown without gaining a statesman was in great form last night lord fairlie has amused us in the past with his clever little parodies he may amuse us in the future but as a statesman we can only view him with disgust well said lionel at last i think your lordship is wise enough to understand the discovery of a sense of humour in a man of your eminence but lord fairlie was already writing out the cheque lv the explorer as the evening wore on and one young man after another asked jocelyn montrevor if she were going to ascot what or to henley what or what she wondered more and more if this were all that life would ever hold for her would she never meet a man a real man who had done something these boys around her were very pleasant she admitted to herself very useful indeed she added as one approached her with some refreshment but they were only boys here you are said freddy handing her an ice in three colours ive had it made specially cold for you they only had the green pink and yellow jerseys left i hope you dont mind the green part is arsenic i believe if you dont want the wafer ill take it home and put it between the sashes of my bedroom window the rattling kept me awake all last night thats why im looking so ill bytheway jocelyn smiled kindly and went on with her ice that reminds me freddy went on weve got a nut here tonight the genuine thing none of your society barcelonas or suburban filberts one of the real cob family the drivingfromthesixthtee insetontheright and newyearsmessagetothecountry touch in short a celebrity who asked jocelyn eagerly perhaps here was a man worrall brice the explorer dont say you havent heard of him or aunt alice will cry heard of him of course she had heard of him who hadnt worrall brices adventures in distant parts of the empire would have filled a book had in fact already filled three a glance at his flat in st james street gave you some idea of the adventures he had been through here were the polished spurs of his companion in the famous ride through australia from south to north all that had been left by the cannibals of the woggawogga river after their banquet here was the poisoned arrow which by the merciful intervention of providence just missed worrall and pierced the heart of one of his black attendants the postmortem happily revealing the presence of a new and interesting poison here again was the rope with which he was hanged by mistake as a spy in south america a mistake which would certainly have had fatal results if he had not had the presence of mind to hold his breath during the performance in yet another corner you might see his favourite mascot a tooth of the shark which bit him off the coast of china spears knives and guns lined the walls every inch of the floor was covered by skins his flat was typical of the man a man who had done things introduce him to me commanded jocelyn where is he she looked up suddenly and saw him entering the ballroom he was of commanding height and his face was the face of the man who has been exposed to the forces of nature the wind the waves the sun the mosquito had set their mark upon him down one side of his cheek was a newly healed scar a scratch from a hippopotamus in its last deathstruggle a legacy from a bison seared his brow he walked with the soft easy tread of the python or the pathan or some animal with a pth in it probably i mean the panther he bore himself confidently and his mouth was a trap from which no superfluous word escaped he was the strong silent man of jocelyns dreams mr worrall brice miss montrevor said freddy and left them worrall brice bowed and stood beside her with folded arms his gaze fixed above her head i shall not expect you to dance said jocelyn with a confidential smile which implied that he and she were above such frivolities as a matter of fact he could have taught her the woggawogga onestep the bimbo the kiyi the jubu the headhunters hug and many other cannibalistic steps which later on were to become the rage of london and the basis of a revue i have often imagined you as you kept watch over your camp she went on and i have seemed myself to hear the savages and lions roaring outside the circle of fire what time in the swamps the crocodiles were barking yes he said it must be a wonderful life yes if i were a man i should want to lead such a life to get away from all this and she waved her hand round the room back to nature to know that i could not eat until i had first killed my dinner that i could not live unless i slew the enemy that must be fine yes said worrall i cant get freddy to see it he is quite content to have shot a few grouse and once to have wounded a beater there must be more in life than that yes i suppose i am elemental beneath the veneer of civilisation i am a savage to wake up with the warcry of the enemy in my ears to sleep with the er barking of the crocodile in my dreams that is life worrall brice tugged at his moustache and gazed into space over her head then he spoke crocodiles dont bark he said jocelyn looked at him in astonishment but in your book through trackless paths she cried i know it almost by heart it was you who taught me what are the beautiful words on the banks of the sleepy river two great crocodiles were barking not barking said worrall basking it was a misprint oh said jocelyn she had a moments awful memory of all the occasions when she had insisted that crocodiles barked there had been a particularly fierce argument with meta richards who had refused to weigh even the printed word of worrall brice against the silence of the reptile house on her last visit to the zoo well smiled jocelyn you must teach me about these things will you come and see me yes said worrall he rather liked to stand and gaze into the distance while pretty women talked to him and jocelyn was very pretty we live in south kensington come on sunday wont you peele crescent yes said worrall on sunday jocelyn waited eagerly for him in the drawingroom of peele crescent her father was asleep in the library her mother was dead so she would have the great man to herself for an afternoon later she would have him for always for she meant to marry him and when they were married she was not so sure that they would live with the noise of the crocodile barking or coughing or whatever it did in their ears she saw herself in that little house in green street with the noise of motorhorns and taxiwhistles to soothe her to sleep yet what a man he was what had he said to her she went over all his words they were not many at six oclock she was still waiting in the drawingroom at peele crescent at sixthirty worrall brice had got as far as peele place at sixfortyfive he was back in peele square again at seven oclock just as he was giving himself up for lost he met a taxi and returned to st james street he was a great traveller but south kensington had been too much for him next week he went back unmarried to the jungle it was the narrowest escape he had had lvi the newspaper proprietor the great hector strong lord of journalism and swayer of empires paced the floor of his luxurious apartment with bowed head his corrugated countenance furrowed with lines of anxiety he had just returned from a lunch with all his favourite advertisers but it was not this which troubled him he was thinking out a new policy for the daily vane suddenly he remembered something coming up to town in his third motor he had glanced through the nineteen periodicals which his house had published that morning and in one case had noted matter for serious criticism this was obviously the first business he must deal with he seated himself at his desk and pushed the bell marked instantly a footman presented himself with a tray of sandwiches what do you want said strong coldly you rang for me sir replied the trembling menial go away said strong recognising magnanimously however that the mistake was his own he pressed bell in another moment the editor of sloppy chunks was before him in todays number said strong as he toyed with a blue pencil you apologise for a mistake in last weeks number he waited sternly it was a very bad mistake sir im afraid we did a great injustice to you know my rule said strong the mistake of last week i could have overlooked the apology of this week is a more serious matter you will ask for a months salary on your way out he pressed a button and the editor disappeared through the trapdoor alone again hector strong thought keenly for a moment then he pressed bell instantly a footman presented himself with a tray of sandwiches what do you mean by this roared strong his iron selfcontrol for a moment giving way i bbeg your pardon sir stammered the man i ththought get out as the footman retired strong passed his hand across his forehead my memory is bad today he murmured and pushed bell a tall thin man entered ah good afternoon mr brownlow said the proprietor he toyed with his blue pencil let me see which of our papers are under your charge at the moment mr brownlow reflected just now he said i am editing snippety snips the whoop the girls own aunt parings the sunday sermon slosh and back chat ah well i want you to take on sloppy chunks too for a little while mr symes has had to leave us yes sir mr brownlow bowed and moved to the door by the way strong said your last number of slosh was very good very good indeed i congratulate you good day left alone hector strong lord of journalism and swayer of empires resumed his pacings his two mistakes with the bell told him that he was distinctly not himself this afternoon was it only the need of a new policy for the vane which troubled him or was it could it be lady dorothy lady dorothy neal was something of an enigma to hector strong he was making more than a million pounds a year and yet she did not want to marry him sometimes he wondered if the woman were quite sane yet mad or sane he loved her a secretary knocked and entered he waited submissively for halfanhour until the proprietor looked up well lady dorothy neal would like to see you for a moment sir show her in lady dorothy came in brightly what nicelooking men you have here she said who is the one in the blue waistcoat he has curly hair you didnt come to talk about him said hector reproachfully i didnt come to talk to him really but if you keep me waiting halfanhour why what are you doing strong looked up from the note he was writing the tender lines had gone from his face and he had become the stern man of action again i am giving instructions that the services of my commissionaire hallboy and fifth secretary will no longer be required dont do that pleaded dorothy strong tore up the note and turned to her what do you want of me he asked she blushed and looked down i i have written a a play she faltered he smiled indulgently he did not write plays himself but he knew that other people did when does it come off he asked the manager says it will have to at the end of the week it came on a week ago well he smiled if people dont want to go i cant make them yes you can she said boldly he gave a start his brain working at lightning speed saw the possibilities in an instant at one stroke he could win lady dorothys gratitude provide the daily vane with a temporary policy and give a convincing exhibition of the power of his press oh mr strong hector he whispered as he rose from his desk to go to her he accidentally pressed the button of the trapdoor the next moment he was alone that the british public is always ready to welcome the advent of a clean and wholesome homegrown play is shown by the startling success of christinas mistake which is attracting such crowds to the kings every night so wrote the daily vane and continued in the same strain for a column clubland is keenly exercised wrote the evening vane over a problem of etiquette which arises in the second act of christinas mistake the great autumn success at the kings theatre the point is shortly this should a woman and so on a pretty story is going the rounds said slosh anent that charming little lady estelle rito who plays the part of a governess in christinas mistake for which manager barodo informs me advance booking up to christmas has already been taken it seems that miss rito when shopping in the purlieus of bond street sloppy chunks had a joke which set all the world laughing it was called between the acts flossie whos the lady in the box with mr johnson gussie hush its his wife and flossie giggled so much that she could hardly listen to the last act of christinas mistake which she had been looking forward to for weeks the sunday sermon offered free tickets to a hundred unmarried suburban girls to which class christinas mistake might be supposed to make a special religious appeal but they had to collect coupons first for the sunday sermon and finally the times of two months later said a marriage has been arranged between lady dorothy neal daughter of the earl of skye and the hon geoffrey bollinger than a successful revenge nothing is sweeter in life hector strong was not the man to spare any one who had done him an injury yet i think his method of revenging himself upon lady dorothy savoured of the diabolical he printed a photograph of her in the daily picture gallery it was headed the beautiful lady dorothy neal the end
