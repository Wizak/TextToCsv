victory conclusion frank merriwells races chapter i horse talk hes a beauty jack diamond uttered the exclamation he was admiring a horse frank merriwell had lately purchased he is agreed danny griswold with his hands thrust deep into his trousers pockets and his short legs set far apart but think of paying a thousand dollars he looks like a racer declared bruce browning who showed unusual interest and animation for a fellow who was known as the laziest man at yale hes got the marks of a swift one asserted diamond walking around the bay gelding which frank merriwell had led out into the middle of the stable floor for inspection he is rangey has clean limbs and a courageous eye i shouldnt wonder if he could cover ground in a hurry i did not buy him for a racer asserted frank i purchased him as a saddle horse purely for my own use and pleasure you must have money to burn chirped griswold your old man must have made loads of it i had an uncle four times removed once who made money but he got arrested when he tried to pass it that reminds me of my father and his partner said browning with apparent seriousness they formed a strange sort of a partnership one of them stayed in new york all the time while the other remained in california in this manner they managed always to have plenty of money between them oh goodness gasped diamond if you fellows keep this up i shall want to get away if you want to get a weigh well try to find some scales for you chuckled griswold his eyes twinkling they say dan dormans father has plenty of money said frank ive heard so admitted browning but dorman is too mean to make much of a drain on the old mans pile thats right nodded griswold why he is so mean that in the winter when his hair gets long he wets it thoroughly and then goes out in the open air and lets it freeze what does he do that for so he can break it off and save the price of a haircut say cried diamond desperately i thought you fellows were talking about a horse no yawned browning were talking about a jackass every one but jack seemed to appreciate this for they all grinned well said the lad from virginia merriwell has brought out his horse for us to inspect and i move we do so after this is over you may talk of anything you please it is rather remarkable that you should pay such a price for a mere saddle horse declared browning i simply kept my promise smiled frank your promise exactly what promise the one i made to myself when this horse enabled me to overtake a runaway that was dragging winifred lee to danger and possible death this is the animal on which i pursued the runaway and i took him without asking leave of the owner i vowed that if this horse enabled me to catch and stop the runaway before miss lee was harmed i would own the creature if it took my last dollar he added and that cried griswold trying to strike a dramatic attitude that is true love well i dont know as i blame you merriwell admitted bruce winifred lee is a stunning girl but it strikes me that the owner of the horse swindled you a bit of additional color had risen to franks cheeks and he looked strikingly handsome the boys knew it would not do to carry the joke about winnie lee too far and so they refrained the man who owned the horse did not want to sell him at any price explained frank i induced him to set a price that he thought would settle me and then i snapped him up so quickly it took away his breath i should think your guardian would have kicked at throwing up a thousand for such a purpose he did laughed frank looking at diamond who showed a little confusion you remember that jack rattleton and myself went on to springfield to meet him a few days ago and got arrested for kidnaping a baby chuckled griswold that was a corker we didnt do a thing to you fellows when you got back here thats right admitted jack dolefully not a thing you simply marched us through the streets and onto the campus with a band and banners and made a stunning show of us well said frank professor scotch my guardian was so glad to get out of the scrape when the judge discharged us that he gave up the thousand without a flutter thats how i got the money well yawned browning now you have the horse youll find him an expensive piece of furniture it takes money to take care of em and feed em diamond had been inspecting the gelding from all sides surveying him with the air of one who knows something about horses and he now asked has the creature a pedigree old man sure nodded frank its pedigree is all right i have it somewhere but i dont care so much for that oh i dont know it may prove of value to you some day how well you may take a fancy to enter nemo in a race or two what then if he should win youll want his pedigree i suppose that is right but i am no sportsman of the turf that is professional amateur sports are good enough for me honest horse racing is one of the grandest sports in the world cried jack with flashing eyes honest horse racing laughed griswold whats that where do you find anything like that oh there is such a thing there may be but people are not used to it thats why i do not think much of horse racing declared frank there are too many tricks to it to suit me oh there are tricks to any sort of sport very few to college sports if a man is caught at anything crooked it means ruin for his college career and he is sure to carry the stigma through life i tell you college sports are honest and that is why they are so favored by people of taste and refinement people who care little or nothing for professional sports the public sees the earnestness the honesty and the manhood in college sports and contests and the patrons of such sports know they are not being done out of their money by a fake prize fighting in itself is not so bad but the class of men who follow it have brought disgrace and disrepute upon it fights are fixed in advance by these dishonest scoundrels and the man who backs his judgment with his money is likely to be done out of his coin by the dirtiest kind of a deal what makes me sore said diamond is that some sensational newspapers should send professional bruisers to witness our college football games and denounce them as more brutal than prize fights that makes me a trifle warm under the collar admitted browning but i dont suppose we should mind what that class of papers say their motto is anything for a sensation and the intelligent portion of the newspaper readers is onto them these papers have faked so many things that they carry no weight when they do tell the truth i wouldnt mind putting nemo into a race just to see what sort of stuff there is in him admitted frank why dont you do it cried diamond eagerly i wouldnt want to enter him in any of the races around here take him to new york no those races are beyond my limit all i want to do is try him for my own satisfaction then run him into the mystic park races at bethany you can do that quietly enough thats so said browning you can do that without attracting too much attention to yourself well all go up and see the race declared griswold it will be great sport do it old man but where can i get a jockey i can trust youll have to scrub around for one and take chances no cried merriwell as a sudden thought struck him i can do better than that how i have the fellow who a colored boy at home he is fond of horses has he ever ridden in a race twice did he win once my uncle who kindly left me his fortune was a crank on fast horses and he owned a number of them toots could ride some of them that would allow nobody else to mount them uncle asher had horses in the races every year but he was often done by his jockeys he knew it well enough but he found it impossible to get the sort of jockey he wanted toots begged to ride a race but he was a little shaver and uncle was afraid finally one day just before a race was to come off uncle asher discovered that his jockey had sold out at the last moment he fired the fellow and was forced to let toots ride or withdraw his horse toots rode and won the next time he rode he might have won but the horse was doped hes just the chap you want nodded jack with satisfaction put nemo into the bethany races and let toots ride him ill think of it said frank a hostler approached the group howdy do mr merriwell sir he said one of your friends called to see your horse this morning sir one of my friends cried frank in surprise who was it he gave his name as diamond sir jack diamond merriwell immediately turned on jack and asked hello how about this did you call to see nemo this morning not much exclaimed jack this is the first time i have been here the hostler is mistaken you must have misunderstood your visitor grody said frank he could not have given his name as jack diamond for this is jack diamond here the man stared at jack and then shook his head thats not the feller he declared of course not your visitor must have given you some other name not on your life returned grody promptly he said his name was jack diamond sir and i will swear to that well this is somewhat interesting came grimly from frank what did he do grody he looked nemo over sir looked nemo over how in what way why i offered to take nemo out of the stall but he said no not to bother as he only wished to glance at the horse he went to the stall which same i showed him and looked in the door wasnt locked for i had just been cleanin the stall out he opened the door and stood there some little time first thing i knew he was gone i went and looked into the stall and he was examinin nemos feet he seemed wonderful interested in the horse and i saw by the way he acted he knew something about horses the interest deepens observed frank go on grody when he came out of the stall he says to me says he merriwell has struck a right good piece of horseflesh there says i in the best of my judgment he has sir says he i understand he paid a fancy figure for the gelding something like a thousand he told me says i if he told you that i have no doubt he told you correct sir then says he does he mean to race him that says i bein a friend of mr merriwell is something what you should know as well as i or better then he says says he horses is mighty uncertain property for you never can tell what may happen to them in this i agreed with him but there was something about him i didnt like much then he went away frank whistled this is highly interesting exclaimed frank what did this fellow look like grody can you describe him well i looked him over rather careful like sir but i dont know as i can describe him particular except that he had on a checked suit and wore a red necktie in which were a blazer genuine or to the contrary i know horses but im no judge of diamonds he was smooth shaved and his jaw were rather square and his hair short the eyes of him never looked straight at me once somehow i didnt think he were a student for he made one or two breaks in the words he said that made his talk different from your students he didnt have that sort of real gentleman way with him neither frank turned to his friends now what do you suppose this business means fellows he asked it means crookedness declared diamond rather excitedly i am dead sure of that it looks that way admitted browning but what sort of crookedness can it mean asked frank bewildered what is the game that will develop later but there is some kind of a game on be sure of that asserted jack if not why should anybody come here and give a fictitious name that gives the whole thing away look out frank all your enemies are not sleeping well it is time they let up on me said merriwell seriously they have brought nothing but disaster and disgrace on themselves thus far and some of them are looking for revenge mark what i say i am tired of being bothered and harassed by petty enemies exclaimed frank i have had considerable patience with the fellows who have worked against me but there is a limit thats right and they would have reached the limit with me long ago declared diamond well it is like this jack said frank it is almost always true that not all of a mans enemies are bad fellows to begin with you remember that you were my enemy and now we are friends and this is not the first time such a thing has happened with me well if a man were bucking against me i do not think i would wait to see how he would turn out before i bucked back oh i am not in the habit of doing that you will remember that i bucked back pretty hard in your case jack did remember it and he felt that merriwell was capable of holding his own with his foes you will do well to look out for your horse all the same said diamond thats right grunted browning if i were in your place merriwell id watch out pretty sharp i will said frank ill have toots come on here and keep watch over nemo most of the time when he is not here grody can take his place if i have an enemy who thinks of stealing my horse hell have hard work to accomplish his design unless he does it before you get things arranged said griswold put him up merriwell and lets get out i am going for a ride said frank put the saddle on him grogan will see you later fellows if you are going now well wait till you leave yawned browning theres no reason why we should tear our clothes hurrying away you are not liable to tear your clothes doing anything laughed frank chapter ii an adventure on the road grody soon had nemo saddled and bridled the horse was eager to be away as he showed by his tossing head fluttering nostrils and restless feet whoa boy said frank soothingly dont be so impatient well get away in a moment he swung into the saddle the stable doors rolled open and away sprang the gelding the remaining lads hurried out of the stable to watch frank ride grody accompanying them he seems like he were a part of the horse declared the hostler admiringly that young gentleman were born to handle horses he were he is indeed a graceful rider nodded diamond i am sure he did not learn in any riding academy for he rides naturally the riding academies all turn out riders with an artificial and wooden style there is no more distressing sight than the riders to be seen in central park new york almost any afternoon they bounce around in the saddle like a lot of wooden figures and it is plain enough that many of them do not bounce because they want to but because they think it the proper thing southerners ride naturally and gracefully mr merriwell rides like a southerner he rides like buffalo bill said browning with an effort bill is the best rider i ever saw diamond was watching merriwell and the horse a queer look on his face finally he exclaimed by jove theres something the matter with nemo what is it asked griswold i didnt notice anything the horse shows a suspicion of lameness asserted jack you have good eyes to detect it observed browning doubtingly i cant see that anything is the matter with the horse ill wager he goes lame before merriwell returns if he does i shall think you have great discernment merriwell turned a corner and disappeared come fellows said griswold lets shuffle along merriwell is altogether too generous declared diamond as the trio walked away in what way asked browning with his enemies i know you and i were both enemies to him in the beginning and he threw us down hard thats all right but there are enemies you have to hold down merriwell didnt do a thing to hartwick exclaimed griswold grinning he scared the fellow so he ran away from college and nobody knows where he went yes but merriwell gave him the opportunity to skip and escape the disgrace that must follow public exposure of his acts some fellows would have exposed him and brought about his expulsion thats right chirped griswold merriwell was as generous with hartwick as he could be with such a fellow he might have used him much worse than he did and do you fancy hartwick thinks any more of merriwell for not exposing him publicly asked jack oh i dont know well i will wager that he does not more than that ill venture that hartwick wherever he may be cherishes a fierce desire for revenge and longs for the day when he will be able to get back at frank merry will hear from that chap again and there the subject was dropped frank enjoyed the ride upon nemos back for the horse seemed intelligent and something of a comrade the boy talked to his mount as if the animal could understand every word he uttered he had ridden beyond the limits of the city before he noticed that nemo was limping the least bit whats the matter old fellow asked frank with concern have you hurt yourself some way nemo shook his head it almost seemed that the animal was answering the question in the negative you must have stepped on a stone merriwell declared why you are really beginning to limp in earnest frank immediately dismounted after having decided it was nemos left hind leg or foot that was lame ill make an inspection and see if i can discover what is the matter said the boy anxiously he examined both of the horses hind feet but could not see that anything was wrong if that rascally shoer has blundered in his work hell not get another chance at you boy merriwell declared after patting nemos neck and fondling the fine creature a bit frank mounted once more but nemo limped worse than ever this is singular muttered the perplexed lad i dont understand it at all theres something wrong for a fact he watched the horse and decided that he had made no mistake in locating the lameness in the left hind leg again he dismounted and made an examination and again the result was far from satisfactory i wish you might speak and tell me what is the matter said frank in dismay ill have you examined without delay by somebody who knows his business he rode slowly into the outskirts of the city of a sudden there was a rattle of wheels and a clatter of hoofs behind him he turned and looked back to see a carriage coming along the road at a reckless rate two persons were seated in the carriage and the horse was covered with sweat why are those fools driving like that muttered merriwell are they drunk or is it a matter of life or death get out of the road the command was hoarsely shouted and frank reined aside having no desire to get in the way of the reckless driver once more the boy on the horse turned to look back drunk sure enough he decided and they are two young fellows too students on a tear perhaps the occupants of the carriage had been drinking heavily but they were not so drunk that they did not recognize the boy in advance when he turned in the saddle the second time hey rolf exclaimed the one who was not driving its merriwell thats what it is cried the driver i havent seen him for some time but i know his face too well to ever forget it hes out on his new horse sure run him down run him down throw him off nows our chance the driver was just intoxicated enough to be utterly reckless of consequences and he snarled hang me if i dont do it and then when they were very near the boy and the horse he suddenly reined toward frank with the intention of running into merriwells mount in another moment there might have been a grand smash there on the road but frank had caught the words run him down and he gave nemo a light cut with the whip at the same time pulling him still farther into the ditch nemo was not used to the whip and he leaped like a flash such a spring would have unseated any but a most expert rider but the boy in the saddle seemed to move as a part of the horse into the ditch they went and past them spun the carriage containing the two reckless young men the carriage came very near upsetting it careened and spun along on two wheels threatening to hurl its occupants into the ditch for the driver had reined the horse back toward the middle of the road both clung on for life dont blame me muttered merriwell through his teeth you were looking for a smash but the carriage did not go over it righted at last one of the young men looked back and shook his fist at the boy on the horse and then away they went in a cloud of dust if that was not evan hartwick i am greatly mistaken exclaimed frank as he reined nemo back into the road so he is back here as soon as this i know what that means he is looking for revenge on me frank had seen the face of the driver as the carriage spun past and he added hartwicks companion is somebody i know i did not obtain a fair look at him but great scott it was the card sharp rolf harlow harlow was a fellow who had entered harvard but had not completed his second year there leaving suddenly for reasons not generally known a yale man by the name of harris familiarly known as sport because of his gambling inclinations had known harlow and had introduced him to a number of yale students harris and harlow were both poker players but they claimed that they played the game merely for amusement a number of harris acquaintances had been induced to enter into the game and there had been some very hot sittings no one seemed to suspect that harlow was crooked for he almost always lost although he never lost large sums harris won almost continually he seemed to be the luckiest fellow in the world in drawing cards he would hold up one ace on a large jackpot and catch two more aces and a small pair it seemed the greatest kind of bull luck harry rattleton merriwells roommate was following the game frank tried to induce him to keep away but it was without avail then frank seemed to take an interest in the game and it was not long before he proved that harlow was a card manipulator and caught him at one of his tricks that finished harlows career at plucking yale fruit and the fellow left new haven suddenly harris had remained under a cloud of suspicion since that time as there seemed very little doubt but he had been in league with harlow and they had divided the plunder between them the proof had not been sufficient to incriminate harris but it had been enough to make him unpopular and cause him to be shunned he had seemed to take this very meekly but some of merriwells friends declared that harris had not forgotten or forgiven and that he would strike back at frank if the opportunity ever presented now harlow was back in new haven and hartwick who had been forced to leave college to escape expulsion was also there that meant something hartwick harlow and harris the three hard tickets they are birds of a feather all they need is ditson to make a most delectable quartet so muttered frank merriwell as he gazed at the receding cloud of dust frank began to realize that there was more trouble in store for him i shall not deal gently with that gang this time he declared with a hardset face this little adventure has put me on my guard and i dont propose to let them have much fun with me those two fools were just full enough to drive right into me with the hope of doing me an injury without a thought of their own necks they might have been thrown out and killed but they did not hesitate because of that the one thought was to do me some way any way hartwick always was a desperate fellow but i did not fancy harlow could be such a chap however he was driving that horse and the way he drove was proof enough that he is careless of life and limb at times for some time frank paid very little attention to nemo but the lameness of the horse became so pronounced at last that he could not help observing it once more that worries me old fellow he admitted with a troubled face it is something i cant understand he rode slowly back to the stable it was growing dark when he arrived at the stable a strange man was standing outside as frank rode up the man looked keenly at the boy and the horse and then as the doors rolled open followed into the stable horse is lame eh he said questioningly i didnt notice that when he went out he wasnt lame then was he frank paid not the least attention to this question the man was a stranger and the boy did not care to talk with him i spotted that horse when yer rode out young man the stranger persisted fine lookin critter just the kind ive been wantin some time for a saddle horse whose critter is it grody said frank utterly ignoring the man i want you to see if you can tell what ails nemo he is lame in one of his hind feet he was taken that way after i had been out a while i think it possible there is something the matter with the way he is shod will you look after him without delay to be sure sir ill not fail sir said grody then the horse belongs ter you does it asked the strange man coming forward and addressing frank in a pointblank manner i am a horseman and i know all about critters if theres anything the matter and there seems to be i can tell what it is in five minutes shall i make an examination young man no sir came sharply from merriwells lips i do not propose to have strangers fooling around my horse i do not know you sir so your offer is respectfully declined chapter iii teaching a rascal a lesson now hold on young man dont be so fast said the stranger you do not know me now and i dont blame yer fer not wantin anybody yer dont know doing anything fer yer horse but heres my card professor james colbath and now i know you have heard of me i am one of the greatest veterinary surgeons in the country frank ignored the card and the man began to show signs of anger this is no bluff he exclaimed its on the level i have nary doubt but i can find out whats the matter with the critter in five minutes and if i dont give yer a square deal i dont want a cent for my services thats all he would have lifted one of nemos feet but frank cried drop that i tell you i dont want you and i wont have you get away from this horse the man growled and stiffened up all right he said somewhat savagely i did think of trying to buy the critter off yer but youre too flip if the animal stays lame dont blame me although frank had seemed to pay very little attention to the stranger he was inspecting him closely he saw the man had pulled his hat down over his eyes and wore his coat collar turned up he had a black beard that concealed his features to a great extent grody was also looking the stranger over closely he fancied he detected a familiar sound in the mans voice the light in the stable was rather dim and that served to make the inspection of the boy and the hostler rather unsatisfactory all at once grody started as if struck by a sudden idea as soon as possible he whispered in franks ear that mug is the same chap that were here this afternoon sir the same chap what chap the one what gave his name as diamond no you said that fellow had no beard i dont believe this mans beard is all right frank was aroused he fancied that he saw a ray of light the fellow who had called himself professor colbath turned away he had heard the hostler whisper and he caught franks question immediately he showed a desire to get out leaving the horse to grody frank quickly placed himself before the stranger saying hold on a minute i dont know but ill talk with you a little no yer wont growled the man im done tryin to talk with a fresh youngster like you im done with you well i am not done with you franks voice rang out sharp and stern what do you want asked the man uneasily i want to see your face well look at it and when yeve seen it ill proceed to smash yours i dont take no insolence from a kid take off your hat i will nit and that beard take it off yere crazy cried the man as he started back am i frank gave a spring and a grab with both hands one hand snatched away the cap and the other tore off the black beard which indeed proved to be false the man uttered an exclamation of rage and struck at frank who dodged the blow is this the fellow grody cried frank the same mug declared the hostler excitedly well thats all i want to know burst from frank as he flung the hat and beard to the floor so you were monkeying around my horse today you fakir well what you need is a pair of good black eyes and i propose to give them to you snap off came the boys jacket in a twinkling and he still stood between the unmasked man and the door the man who was a coarselooking young ruffian ground his teeth and uttered some violent language git out the way he snarled im a fighter and ill kill yer i can put yer ter sleep with one punch merriwells blood was thoroughly stirred and he felt just like teaching the fellow a lesson although a youth in years frank was as my old readers know a trained athlete and he could handle his fists in the most scientific manner i am going to give you a chance to put me to sleep he shot back i see your dirty game from start to finish you are a fakir of the worst sort and you tried to work me you did something to my horse to make him lame and you thought you would get a fat pull out of me for doctoring him instead of that you have run your head into a bad scrape and it will be damaged when you get it out you talk big for a kid why i can blow yer over with my breath it is strong enough but i dont go over so easy up with your hands if you are such a fighter im coming for you all right if yere bound to have it come on the man put up his guard and then merriwell went at him while grody gasped for breath thinking the college lad could be no match for the young ruffian there were a few swift passes and then frank went under the fellows guard and gave him a terrific uppercut on the chin that was a staggerer and the boy followed it up while the man was dazed punk biff two blows one on the body and the other fairly in the eye the second blow nearly knocked the man down and it made him as fierce as a famished tiger snarling like an enraged beast he tried to close in on the lively lad oh let me get hold of you he grated ill crush the life out of ye frank avoided the rush by stepping aside and gave the fellow another body blow as he passed body blows however were not as effective as they should have been on account of the fellows clothing and merriwell quickly decided to waste no more energy in that manner the man turned and went for frank again this time the boy did not try to get out of the way but he met his antagonist squarely and gave him a heavy one in the other eye that ought to make them mates said frank with a laugh you wont know yourself when you look in the glass tomorrow morning perhaps itll teach you better than to try any of your rackets on a boy you cant always tell what you are getting up against the mans teeth could be heard grinding together he was so furious that he quite lost his head then frank sailed in to finish the affair as soon as possible grody held his breath nearly bursting with astonishment and admiration oh say he chuckled i never saw a youngster what were that fellows match hes hot stuff the hostler could scarcely believe it possible that merriwell was giving the scoundrel a firstclass whipping but this became more and more evident with each passing moment in fact frank was struck just once during the entire encounter and that was a glancing blow on the forehead which he scarcely noticed he thumped the rascal to his hearts satisfaction and then knocked him flat with a roundarm swing that landed on the jaw the ruffian lay on the floor and groaned when he started to get up merriwell exclaimed there i think that will do you for tonight when you want some more of the same just come fooling around my horse he caught the man by the shoulders yanked him to his feet ran him to the door and booted him out of the stable having done this frank turned back and coolly put on his coat there grody he said i feel better i think it is possible i have given that rascal a lesson he will not forget in a hurry the hostler stared and then he cried mr merriwell sir you are a wonder if as how you were to go inter ther ring youd make some of the duffers hustle that were the neatest job what i ever see it was not so much of a trick declared frank the fellow is strong ill warrant but he is too heavy on his feet and too slow in his movements there are scores of fellows in college who can polish him off i will allow i never knowed you college chaps were able to fight like that before i knowed some of you were for fighting among yourselves all right but i didnt think you could go up against a regler scrapper its a part of the education at yale smiled frank and ive found it comes in handy occasionally the man who cant fight his way through this world in one manner or another gets walked over by chaps who are not his equal in any other way i do not believe a man should fight only at the proper time but when he has to fight i hold that he should be able to do a good turn at it well you can do your turn all right sir now grody nemo must receive proper attention i am sure that fellow did something to make the horse lame what he did i cant tell i dont see how he did it without getting his brains kicked out grody hesitated and then he said mr merriwell sir i wants to tell ye something all right grody go on i didnt tell all what happened in the stall today when that bloke were here oh you didnt no sir what called my attention to the fact that he had gone inter the stall were a racket what sort of a racket nemo kicked and squealed sir and i heard the man speaking to him then i ran over and looked in what was the rascal doing grody he were examinin nemos feet sir and that was when he got in his dirty work cried frank angrily im afraid i didnt thump him as much as he deserved i feel like hunting him up and giving him a few more chapter iv birds of a feather in a little back room of a saloon three young men were sitting they were talking earnestly for all that two of the three showed they had taken altogether too much liquor to be entirely sober were glad to see you sport one of the drinkers declared well i am glad to see you harlow old man and you too hartwick although we were never friendly before you left yale so suddenly that was my fault admitted hartwick huskily i didnt know enough to pick out the right sort of pals i trusted too much to ditson hes no good now there is where you make a mistake asserted sport harris quickly i know ditson has no nerve but he hates the same fellow we hate and he is good to do the dirty work we can make use of him hartwick i dont know anything about him confessed harlow no he hasnt the nerve to play poker and so you did not get acquainted with him when you were here i dont know that he hates merriwell so much growled hartwick you remember that ditson blowed everything to merriwell and that is why i was forced to skip oh id like the satisfaction of punching the face off the dirty little traitor but what caused ditson to blow he says you misused him i choked the cad a little that is all but there was something back of that declared harris what led you to choke him oh we had a little trouble he was trying to squeeze me too hard and i wouldnt stand for it trying to squeeze you yes how well i dont mind telling you you know i tried to mark merriwell for life by punching my foil through the mask that protected his face while we were engaged in a fencing bout i had prepared my foil for that in advance by fixing the button so i could remove it and by sharpening the point of the foil i wanted to spoil the fellows pretty face the most malignant hatred was expressed in hartwicks words and manner he went on i tried the trick but did not succeed ditson carried off the foil and kept it he would not give it up although he promised to a hundred times he used it to aid in blackmailing me when he asked me for money i did not feel like refusing him for he could throw me down hard by turning the foil over to merriwell but he carried the thing too far one night when i was in a bad mood he tried to squeeze more money out of me he had been living in luxury for some time while i was broke almost continually i kicked and refused to give up then he had the insolence to threaten me with exposure i lost my head and choked him directly after that he turned like a viper and blowed everything to merriwell that was my downfall i had to skip is there any reason why i should not hate the sneak no i do not wonder that you are sore on him but he did not make anything out of the trick didnt make anything why he forced me out of college that was not the main thing he was looking for then what was he hoped to get in with merriwell and he fancied merriwell would think him a fine fellow for blowing well well he made a mistake in frank merriwell for merriwell despised him all the more although he did nothing to injure ditson he does not recognize ditson at all and now ditson is more eager than before to do merriwell an injury all the same ditson cant be trusted not unless he is so deep in the game that it means ruin for him to blow then he is caught as i said in the first place he is a good man to do the dirty work that we do not want to touch i think harris is right nodded harlow and you may get a chance to even up with ditson by throwing him down when we have fixed merriwell nicely but you want to remember you are going up against a bad man in frank merriwell warned sport i do not care to be forced out of yale of course not said hartwick and harlow you fellows have not so much to look out for you can do things that would be beyond me we made a bluff at doing something today growled hartwick we were out for a drive and we came upon merriwell he was on his new horse and we tried to run him down but he got out of the way i dont know but it is a good thing he did confessed harlow if we had struck him thered been a general smashup i was driving and we were making the old nag hit a hot pace we came near going bottom up as it was you must have been badly rattled exclaimed harris oh i dont know laughed hartwick harshly weve been up against it for the past three days eh harlow thats what nodded the card sharp hartwick is a hard man to follow he can kill more stuff than anybody i ever saw well said harris i have asked ditson to come in here this evening i took a chance on it for i thought we could get rid of him easily enough if we didnt want him he is liable to be along at any moment harlow looked at a handsome watch a quarter to ten he said he ought to be around soon if he is coming at all he will be whered you get that ticker old man oh i took it off a sucker in a game ill have to soak it if i dont strike some sort of graft pretty soon im getting down to hard pan i suppose you are all right hartwick questioned harris you can call on your old man and make him give up any time well i guess not i havent been able to get a dollar out of the old duffer since i left college he is icy toward me and he says i can go it for myself and be hanged thats pleasant what have you been doing to gather in the coin why confound it havent i formed a partnership with harlow i dont know anything about card tricks but he works all of that and i win the money he gives me the hands to do it on you see if there is suspicion aroused the poor suckers take to watching me and they are unable to catch me at anything crooked our only trouble is to find the right sort of fruit for plucking we generally pretend we are strangers to each other sometimes we have a little disagreement over the table just to fool the fools all the more thats firstrate laughed harris i wish the gang here was not onto harlow i could get you some ripe plums and thats what made me so sore on merriwell growled harlow but for that fellow wed be right in it now oh i want to soak him some way and soak him hard and well find a way to soak him too growled hartwick lets have another round fellows he pushed a button and a waiter appeared drinks were ordered when they were brought ditson came in with the waiter hello roll called harris glad you came along mr ditson mr harlow i think you have met the other gentleman ditson started and turned pale when he saw hartwick who was glowering at him oh yes mr ditson has met me said evan significantly we do not need an introduction ditson seemed on the point of getting out in a hurry but harris arose and took him by the arm its all right he assured sit down roll what sort of a game is this hesitatingly asked ditson keeping his eyes on hartwick have you fellows got me in here to do me up nothing of the sort not but id like to do you and do you good confessed hartwick but harris wont have it no said sport i hold that we are all united by our hatred for a common foe and we cannot afford to be anything but friends all the same it was a dirty deal you gave me ditson growled evan who seemed to be longing to pick a row with the newcomer you forced me into it declared ditson weakly forced you yes how was that you know well enough you set on me like a mad tiger and ill bet you would have choked me to death in your room if you hadnt been seized with one of your attacks of heart trouble i was afraid of you and i had to do something to protect myself so you blew the whole thing to merriwell that was a brave trick but i understand merriwell has turned you down in great shape since that well he hasnt used me right admitted ditson sometimes i think id like to kick the wind out of him but i know i cant do it you may have the chance to take the wind out of him said harris sit down old man and we will talk matters over what are you drinking bring me a sherry flip waiter ordered ditson seeing the waiter had paused outside then he sat down in a chair offered him saying if theres any sure way of doing merriwell up im in for it but i give it to you straight that i am sick of trying to do him and having him come out on top its got to be a sure thing this time or i dont touch it beyond a thin partition in a room next to the one occupied by the four plotters sat a man who had a cut and bruised face and a pair of swollen black eyes this man had been drinking heavily a bottle of whiskey and a glass sat on the little table before him he was alone in the room he had seemed to suddenly lose all interest in the whiskey and he was leaning against the board partition with his ear close to a crack intently listening to the talk of the four lads in the next room the man had heard frank merriwells name spoken and that was the first thing to attract his attention to what the occupants of the next room were saying thats the fellow muttered the man hoarsely hes the one what gave me these beautiful peepers and pretty mug ill give him something worse than this before long then he decided to listen wonder if them chaps is his friends ill jest see what theyre sayin about him it was not long before the man was able to hear enough to satisfy him that the lads in the next room were anything but friends of frank merriwell and he listened with fresh eagerness he heard ditson come in with the waiter and caught much of the conversation that followed then ditson sat down and the plotters lowered their voices that settles it exclaimed the man im goin right in there and see if they dont want to take me inter the gang them college ducks will be jest the fellers to help me in gettin back at frank merriwell he got up left the little room and went around to the door of the other room without stopping to knock he opened the door and walked in hwaryer he saluted as the four lads stared at him in amazement my names mike hogan and i want ter join in with ther push get out of here you bum cried hartwick fiercely you are intruding on a private party hold hard young feller returned the fellow who had given his name as mike hogan dont call me a bum im onto your curves and there aint no reason why you and me shouldnt be friends friends exclaimed hartwick friends well i prefer to choose my friends and you didnt make much of a success when you chose a young gent here what is named ditson keep yer seat press the button harlow and well have this fellow thrown out came savagely from hartwicks lips wait a minute before you press the button urged mike hogan do you see this face yes its a peach now aint it you can consider yourself lucky if it isnt worse than that when you get out of here my man dont my man me young feller i dont like it do yer know who give me this face and these two beautiful eyes no and we well ill tell yer who it was it was a feller what goes by the name of frank merriwell well he did a firstclass job commented harris that really looks like some of merriwells work he done it nodded mike nacherlly i aint got no love to speak of for him well i was in the room next to this just now and as i was leanin against the partition i happened to overhear what you chaps was sayin in here from what i heard i judged you didnt love this merriwell none to brag about and i says to myself mike if you want to get even them is the boys to hitch fast to then i got right up and came in here without bein invited i hope youll excuse me gents but i couldnt help it under the circumstances i had a sort of fellerfeelin for you chaps and i thought mebbe we might arrange some sort of a deal together that would do this merriwell and do him for keeps im not a chap with much education but ill bet anything i can hate just as hard as you fellers and if theres anybody i hate on the earth its frank merriwell there now gents you have heard what i have ter say and i hope youll tumble ter ther fact that i am on the level this is no case of stringing i want ter pay back that feller for these two black eyes and this mug mebbe you can help me to do it and i can help you to square yerselves with him at the same time if that is right why shouldnt we kinder go into partnerships for a short period i put the question to yer and you can do as ye please the quartet at the table looked at one another inquiringly and doubtingly they seemed to hesitate if this man tells the truth and i should judge that he does he may be of service to us and we to him said sport harris thats right nodded harlow if merriwell gave him that mug and those beautiful eyes i dont wonder that he wants to get square hartwick was silent he was looking mike hogan over and he was thinking is it possible i have fallen to the point where i have to take such a fellow as a comrade no it will not be as a comrade we can use him as a tool perhaps and that is what we will do if we use him at all sit down invited hartwick suddenly rising and offering mike his chair ill get another i want to hear just how you came by those eyes hogan sat down at the table and hartwick brought a chair from a corner we are all anxious to hear how you came by those eyes declared harlow some gent order drinks and i will tell ye never mind he cried as he saw them look at each other knowingly as if they thought he was trying to work them for liquor ill order myself dont you think for a second that im broke then he flung a small roll of bills on the table before them reached past harlow and pressed the button when the waiter appeared he said give these gents anything they want pete wot if they orders champagne grinned pete winking at the boys then bring it dern ye snarled hogan as he grabbed up the roll of money and thrust it at the waiter take the pay out of that and gimme the change drinks were ordered and quickly brought hogan paid for them and gave the waiter a quarter as a tip how about it pete he asked am i all right yere all right mike declared the waiter promptly and the young gents will find that anything you says sticks then he went out now said hogan before i begin i want to tell you chaps this im on the make that is how i happened to get up against this chap merriwell i heard that he paid a cool thousand for that horse of his and i kinder admitted that a boy who could pay that sum for a horse must be in circumstances that would permit him to burn money in an open grate such a chap was worth my attention i know horses from their hoofs to the tips of their ears there aint much of anything i dont know about em and i knew merriwell must be stuck on the horse for which he paid a thousand plunks well gents ill tell ye my scheme i kinder thought it would be easy to play the horse doctor and work merriwell for a good pot all that was necessary was to make something ail the horse then i went round to the stable where he keeps the critter after i had first learned the name of one of merriwells friends i wanted to get at the horse and i knew it wouldnt be easy unless i appeared to be on the inside track with merriwell i went round and said i was this friend of merriwell and in that way i got into the stall with the horse dont you care what i done to make that horse lame but i done it all right when merriwell rode out this afternoon the critter went to limpin under him when he came back to the stable i was there but i had changed my clothes and i wore a beard i introduced myself as a horse doctor and offered to cure his horse or not to charge him a dollar if i cured the critter which i could do easy i meant to charge him a hundred dollars and i thought hed be fool enough to pay it without a kick that shows you didnt know the kind of a fellow you were trying to fool said harris i found that out all right he wouldnt make any talk with me then when i got hot and was going away he suddenly took a notion to stop me the first thing i knew he had snatched off my hat and beard and the hostler recognized me as the same chap as was in to see the horse this afternoon i didnt feel alarmed then mike went on for merriwell is a young chap and i know something about fighting that is i thought i knew something about it im not sure about that now i told him to get out of the way or i would do him up i saw my scheme was busted but i felt sure itd be some time before hed find out what ailed his horse that young fool didnt seem at all scared of me he wouldnt get out of the way and let me go but he put himself in my way and then we had it when we got through i found that i had it and i had it bad there aint no need to tell just what happened take a look at my mug and youll see for yourself that young cuss can fight like a tiger but now im goin to get level with him and dont you fergit it ill make him sorry that he ever gave mike hogan a pair of black eyes ill never be satisfied till i have done him the worst kind of a turn i heard you chaps talkin and it struck me that we might pull together to do him dirt thats why i came right in what do you say to it the boys looked at each other and then they nodded approval youll do said harris you may prove a very valuable man for us chapter v what a hair can do at his first opportunity to get away from recitations the following day frank took diamond and rattleton and hastened down to the stable to find out how nemo was coming along grody who had just saddled a horse for a gentleman met frank and the expression on his face was anything but reassuring well how is the pony this morning asked merriwell anxiously just as lame as he were sir answered grody ive been tryin to find out what it were that happened to him but i cant sir did you take him to the shoer the first thing this morning and have his feet examined as i directed i did that sir and what did the shoer say he located the lameness in the same foot what we said were lame sir and he took off the shoe but he said as how it were all right and no fault of the shoeing he didnt know but a nail might have gone too deep sir but he found that were not it this was anything but satisfactory and frank showed it by his face well he said you know i told you to summon dr cobb if it proved something beyond the shoeing and that were what i done sir and the doctor could not tell what ailed the horse the doctor has not come yet sir he were busy when i send the message to him but he said here he is now sir a rig drew up at the door and a short stubbed redbearded man stepped out this man entered the stable with a quick step and called to the hostler well grody did you telephone me yes sir i did sir said the hostler quickly important case you said yes sir very important wheres the horse ill bring him right out sir the hostler hastened to do so and dr cobb looked keenly at nemo walk him around directed the doctor grody obeyed just a bit lame commented the doctor it may be a slight strain it doesnt seem to be much but it grows worse when he is taken out on the road said frank it was very bad yesterday afternoon the doctor glanced at the boy your horse he asked yes sir when did you first notice he was lame yesterday afternoon had him out this morning grody took him to the shoer thats all what did he say said there was nothing the matter with the way nemo is shod perhaps he lied didnt want to hurt his business did he do anything yes he reset the shoe on the lame foot hum horse may be all right by tomorrow or next day i do not think he will doctor eh why not because i have reasons to believe he was made to go lame is that so well now the matter becomes more interesting what causes you to think anything of the sort frank explained and the doctor listened attentively to his story this is worth investigating he declared i know a few of the tricks of these fellows and i think ill find out what was done to your horse if anything was done the boys watched the doctor with great interest they saw him examine the lame leg from the knee down in doing this he put on a pair of spectacles nemo was nervous he seemed afraid the doctor would hurt him and it was not found easy to make him stand at last dr cobb uttered a sharp exclamation bring my case which you will find under the seat in my carriage grody he directed grody hastened to obey have you found out what the matter is doctor frank anxiously asked i believe so but i am not sure yet jack and harry came near eager to learn what had been done to lame the horse the doctor opened his case and took out some tweezers do you see this hair here he asked having brushed the fetlock aside and taken the end of a hair in his fingers the boys saw it but wondered what that hair could have to do with the lameness of the horse it is not the right color declared the doctor you see it is white instead of being the color of the other hairs here despite himself frank felt his anger rising how could the color of a hair make the horse lame did the man take him for a fool because he was a boy the three boys exchanged glances and harry made a threatening gesture at the back of the doctors head i see the hair is white sir said frank his voice cold and hard but i scarcely think a white hair could make my horse go lame i know i am a boy but i do not like to be taken for a fool the doctor looked up and saw the indignation expressed on the faces of the three lads then he chuckled in a singular way and said wait till i get through young man i do not take you for a fool ordinarily but you can easily make a fool of yourself over this matter he had taken the short white hair which was very coarse in his fingers having separated it from the others notice the peculiar place where this hair seems to grow he directed it is not a part of the fetlock but the fetlock hid it from view i am going to pull this hair out but first i want you to notice that there is another hair it seems on the other side of the ankle and it is just like this see it the boys saw it in a moment you wont see it declared the doctor as he adjusted the tweezers getting a careful grip on the end of the hair here it comes then he quickly drew it out and nemo started a bit but was quieted by grody young man said the doctor look at this this hair appeared to be about an inch in length but now it is three inches long it is not broken off and yet it has no root i will guarantee there is not another hair on this horse like it i will guarantee it did not grow on this horse i will guarantee it was what made this horse lame and i do not want my fee if this horse shows any lameness two hours from now the boys were astonished as their faces indicated but doctor i do not understand cried frank you must explain how could a hair i will explain its an old trick but one seldom tried this hair came from the tail of a white horse it was threaded into a long keen needle the fellow who got at your horse yesterday was an expert with one jab of that needle he passed the hair through the flesh just back of this cord it went in at one side and came out on the other after that while he was pretending to look at the horses feet he clipped off the ends and the hair was left in there it could remain a day or so without doing any particular injury but it was bound to make the horse lame as soon as he used that leg much if it had been left there permanently it might have ruined the horse that is all young man why was a white hair chosen doctor the fellow felt sure it would not be noticed and yet he could quickly locate it by its color when the time came for him to cure your horse of its lameness once more the boys looked at each other and this time it was plain they realized there were some things they did not know doctor said frank promptly i wish to beg your pardon i believe i said something rather hastily but now i wish to say that you know your business thoroughly the doctor smiled and closed his case i have been in the business all my life he said but i expect to continue to learn something new about it as long as i live i will say that i doubt if i should have seen what was the matter with your horse if you had not told me of the fellow you believed had lamed him and how the horse kicked up a racket when the man was in the stall that set me to looking for tricks and i found the hair frank offered to pay the doctor but he refused to take it then saying heres my card young man if your horse is all right this afternoon you may send me five dollars you may need me again some time then he strode out of the stable flung the case under the seat scrambled into his carriage caught up the reins and away he went in a hurry well may i be farred and tethered i mean tarred and feathered cried harry rattleton i never saw anything like that before nor i confessed jack diamond its astonishing i have learned something today that i never knew before i never would have dreamed that a hair could lame a horse in that way you want to look out for nemo now said harry and not let that chap get at him again i mean to asserted frank i have sent for my colored boy toots to come on and keep watch here when grody is unable to do so till he gets here grody i want you to watch nemo like a hawk i hardly think the whelp will try another trick but there is no telling i gave him a bad thumping but not half what he deserved cried diamond chapter vi prince and the eavesdropper nemos lameness seemed to vanish as if by magic and frank was well satisfied grody took the utmost care of nemo till toots arrived the colored boy was delighted to come on to new haven and as he was a lover of horses his new occupation suited him very well when frank could not find time to take the horse out for his daily exercise toots did it one evening a party of students gathered in diamonds room he had invited them there to show them his new bulldog diamond had a fad and it was dogs his dog had caused trouble between diamond and merriwell early in their college career by taking a strip out of franks trousers that dog had received mortal injuries in a fight and now diamond had another dog isnt he a beauty cried jack as he displayed the uglylooking brute look at that head and those jaws he comes from a line of gladiators what do you call him diamond asked ben halliday prince put not thy trust in princes croaked dismal jones is he kind asked bandy robinson oh he has a sunny disposition assured jack smiling a sunny disposition chirped griswold from the top of the table upon which he had climbed so that he might be out of the way by that i presume that you mean he will make it hot for any other dog he may tackle hold on danny old man cried jack reprovingly havent i treated you right not lately but if youve got any beer in the coop you can that gives me a pain cried robinson you must have been eating window glass chuckled griswold thats how you happen to feel the pane you ramed little bunt i mean you blamed little runt exclaimed rattleton catching danny by the neck if you keep up this reckless punning youll receive a check some day i hope so was the instant retort im broke and i sent to the governor for one today let him alone harry advised merriwell laughing you simply make him worse by talking to him thats the only thing i have against griswold declared jack he will pun in the most reckless manner at all times some of his jokes are not what they are cracked up to be like the eggs we used to get down at mrs harringtons when we were freshmen grinned griswold even the vilest sinner may repent and be forgiven came solemnly from dismal jones theres a faint ray of hope for griswold but its mighty dim declared robinson once more attention was given to jacks dog and diamond pointed out the animals fine features when are dogs at their best asked halliday seriously in winter griswold instantly put in there are no flies on them then smother him howled robinson wildly smother time cackled danny as he slipped off the table and dodged around a chair to get out of reach halliday caught up a pair of scissors and pretended to sharpen them looking at griswold as if he meant to shed his gore what are you going to do asked danny going into the scissorsgrinding business its great when things are dull it was plain that danny could not be suppressed and so the boys tried to ignore him prince was admired some more and then halliday picked up a banjo put it in tune and sang a song your voice is somewhat off color tonight old man observed robinson and i think you skipped a bar you dont know him cried griswold instantly i was out with him last night and he didnt skip any then almost every other fellow in the room grabbed up something and threw it at danny who could do nothing but shield his face and take the pelting he received diamond is a dog crank and merriwell is a horse crank said robinson by the way i hear you think of racing your horse this spring merriwell who told you that asked frank who told me oh i dont know is it a secret i think i have heard several fellows speak of it oh i dont know as it is a secret said frank i may try him in some small country race if i get a good opportunity but i am not likely to have much of a chance between baseball rowing and my studies im kept pretty busy the only wonder to me is that you get time to study at all declared halliday i never before saw a fellow who could carry on so many things at the same time and make successes of them all i hear two more men have been dropped a class said diamond thats right sighed jones dorman and street have departed hence may peace go with them poor old easy exclaimed robinson he was a fine fellow but he was altogether too easy he wouldnt skin and he couldnt keep up with the push there are some other fellows who are bound to go sooner or later observed rattleton i can name several both harris and ditson are bound to get it in the neck said griswold they are skinners of the worst kind thats right agreed halliday ditson is an expert at it he spends more time and ingenuity in concocting schemes to fool the examining tutor or professor than it would take to learn his subjects ten times over sures youre born exclaimed jones why he has his finger nails cuffs and the palms of his hands covered with writing and diagrams every time he knows he is to be called up and in this way he always succeeds in making a clean rush harris knows something about photography said halliday and he is continually making minute pictures of diagrams and writing which he arranges on little tabs which he can hold in his palm he seldom flunks but hell trip some time hanged if i can see why fellows should work so hard to fool tutors or professors when they might learn all that was required of them without half the trouble cried harry that is easy enough to explain smiled merriwell harris is a natural gambler he delights in excitement and danger and he actually enjoys taking such desperate ventures well there is something in that laughed rattleton i never regarded it that way before ill be fanged if there isnt hascination in it no ill be hanged if there isnt fascination in it its too bad this matter was mentioned fellows said merriwell with pretended seriousness i regret it very much why asked robinson curiously notice how excited rattleton has become over it hes not quite such a sport as harris but he had rather take chances on anything than eat and its ten to one hell be skinning within a week sometimes a fellow has to skin declared griswold did you ever danny asked diamond did i well i have a patent scheme of my own what is it asked rattleton eagerly why i have a box of chalk crayons which i bought for myself i have soaked them in alum water till they are hard and i usually have several of them about my person they are covered with diagrams and everything that may prove interesting or necessary but i want to tell you something i never use em unless i am driven to the wall by that he means the blackboard laughed halliday and you were talking about harris and ditson being skinners came reproachfully from jones my dear young man there is a place that burneth with fire and brimstone that is reserved for liars chuckled danny jones beware any moment may be your next thats right agreed jones sadly i am sure i shall not live to see another day if i die tonight gentleman said merriwell death is a grave subject to jest upon youd better bury it thats all right put in robinson if he catches cold any of us may go to coffin ill not undertaker pun murmured rattleton then there was a deathlike silence and the lads all looked at one another reproachfully lets change the subject cried diamond speaking of ditson i believe he claims to have blue blood in his veins says his ancestors came over on the mayflower and were among the first to settle in this country they may have settled said griswold but none of his family has ever settled since that time they owe everybody that will trust them ditson has stuck his friends right and left since coming to yale till he has not a friend left said robinson why he owed hartwick several hundred dollars when hartwick left declared diamond just the same hartwick is back in new haven and in is chummy with ditson again asserted jones merriwell displayed some interest how do you know he is chummy with ditson he asked i have seen them together that means something cried rattleton excitedly those pads are cotting i mean those cads are plotting you want to look out for trouble merry i will exclaimed frank ditson is treading on dangerous ground if he makes a break ill descend on him i have been easy with a chap of his treacherous nature quite long enough too long burst fiercely from diamond if i had been in your place id ended mr ditsons career long ago i dont know what the fellows can do to injure me said frank theyll find some way to give it to you if you dont watch out said rattleton perhaps one of them hired that fellow to lame your horse perhaps so you think a great deal of that horse said jack you want to be constantly on your guard or something will happen to it toots is on the watch and any one will have hard work getting the best of that darky he is about as sharp as they make em he is a very clever coon admitted harry and he seems to know his business still you cant tell what may happen i wouldnt have anything happen to nemo for worlds i dont quite understand why i think so much of that horse but he is a wonderfully intelligent creature dont tell that you care so much for him if your enemies were to find it out they would scheme to fix nemo id have no mercy on the person that injured that horse whats the matter with your dog jack asked robinson he is acting in a very queer manner prince was sniffing at the door whining and growling while the hair on his neck bristled in a significant manner diamond got up and quickly approached the door in a moment he flung it open and out shot prince there was a sound of swiftly retreating feet a clatter on the stairs a scramble a shout of pain or fear and a sudden blow quick fellows cried jack excitedly prince has found an eavesdropper they rushed out they sprang down the stairs and at the foot they found the dog apparently in a dazed condition but with a piece of cloth in his mouth good dog cried jack where is he prince growled and chewed away at the piece of cloth he got away said frank he must have struck prince with a heavy cane or a club for we heard the blow the dog was stunned but he held fast to this piece of the fellows trousers after him spluttered rattleton he may not be able to get away well try to capture him but the effort was vain the eavesdropper had made good his escape after a little time the boys all came back to diamonds room they found jack examining the piece of cloth which he had taken from the bulldog with no small difficulty it is from somebodys trousers said jack seriously whoever the sneak was hell have to buy a new pair he hit prince a frightful blow behind the ear but the good old fellow held fast to this trophy if wed nabbed the fellow we wouldnt have done a thing to him not a thing cried griswold see if any of you fellows recognize this piece of cloth as belonging to the clothing of any chap you know invited diamond they all examined it if i mistake not said dismal jones this came from a certain section of a certain individuals trousers and the section to which i refer is located about eight inches south of the back strap and the fellow exclaimed robinson the fellow is roland ditson finished rattleton in that case said diamond merriwells enemies have received a good tip concerning his fondness for nemo you will have to be doubly careful about that horse after this frank chapter vii the plot if roland ditson was the person from whose trousers the piece of cloth had been torn he took good care to destroy what he had retained of the breeches without delay for they were never again seen in his possession the figure on the cloth was not pronounced enough to distinguish it in a manner to make it absolute proof that it came from a garment owned by roland nevertheless diamond accused ditson of listening at his door but roll vigorously denied that he had done so diamond told him he was a naturalborn prevaricator and let it go at that but ditson was watched like a hawk by the boy from virginia for jack felt sure the fellow was up to crookedness frank merriwell knew that if ditson had been listening to the conversation that was taking place in that room his enemies must know in what light he regarded nemo this caused frank to caution both toots and grody to redouble their vigilance in watching over and caring for the splendid creature don yo worry about me marser frank assured the darky lad dats de fines hawse dat dis chile ebber seen an ise gwan ter watch ober heem lek he wus de apple ob mah eye i have decided to enter nemo in the mystic park races at bethany toots merriwell declared and i think ill let you ride him my boy toots showed two rows of gleaming ivories and beamed with the greatest delight if yer done dat marser frank ise gwan ter win on dat hawse jes ez shore ez yeh bawn sar he cried ise done rid dat critter enough teh know hes a wondah sar dat hawse is wuf a forchune sar if you win toots i may give you a chance to ride him in some races later in the season if i don win dat race i done hope i nebber dror annodder bref sar cried the darky boy excitedly datll show yo what yo kin do at de coney islan races if yos gwan ter gamble on dat hawse yos a dead sho winnar sar i am not much of a gambler toots but i may back nemo for a little something yoll win marser frank if dis darky ebber knowed what he wus talking about yoll win franks enemies seemed remarkably quiet but something told him that every move he made was watched this was true and they soon knew exactly what races he intended to enter nemo for and that the darky was going to ride the horse one night harris hartwick harlow ditson and mike hogan met in the saloon where they had first formed a combine against merriwell they were there by appointment called together by hartwick who seemed to have assumed the leadership hartwick was taking no chances on any thin partitions and so he secured a little back room in the place where it seemed that nothing could be overheard by any one who might chance to be watching them drinks were ordered and when they were brought and the waiter had departed hartwick said gentlemen we may as well get down to business at once i have called you together to make arrangements for striking a blow at our common enemy well i think its erbout time growled mike hogan ive been wantin ter do something fer a long while but you have kept holdin me back you have been too much on the jump my friend said hartwick scowling if wed let you gone it alone youd had merriwell on his guard and that would have ruined everything it strikes me that merriwell is on his guard now observed harris he acts as if he knew there was something in the wind well he doesnt know what i dont know about that either he guards that horse as if the animal was worth its weight in dollar bills which comes entirely from the fact that hogan here tried to knock the horse out once declared harlow i dont know about that either said hartwick but i want to say one thing here and now if theres any one of this party who is playing double and carrying information to merriwell hed better order his own coffin without delay for he is bound to be found out and well throw him cold in a minute he looked at ditson in a most significant manner as he said this but roll showed no signs of guilt well whats yer plan of war boss asked hogan impatiently dont get in too much of a hurry scowled hartwick we know merriwell intends to enter nemo in the mystic park races at bethany yes that is the time to get at him how he has money to burn get him to back nemo for large sums for any of the first three positions give him all sorts of odds if necessary but get him to chuck up the dough and then beat him out thats all right growled hogan but wheres the dough comin from what is shoved up against his good stuff let me alone for that said hartwick significantly i know a way to get it and well have it i wish we might get merriwell to stake his entire fortune on that horse wed end his career at yale harris laughed id like to know how you are going to get so much money hart he cried why i had to lend you twenty as capital the last game of poker you entered dont let anything worry you if you dont know all about it sport advised hartwick youve got your twenty back havent you yes well you cant kick all right but im afraid your scheme wont work out very well it will just as hard if we can depend on mike here to make sure merriwells horse does not win watcher want me ter do asked mike doctor the animal at the last moment if you cant buy off the jockey thats easy but where does my share of ther profits come in you shall have your share dont you worry well have that all arranged in advance then that goes i am with yer gents what are the rest of us to do asked harris there will be something for all of us to do ditson must continue to play the spy on merriwell and thats the most dangerous job of all cried roll you know what came near happening to me the night i found out merriwell intended to put nemo in the mystic park races i was nearly chewed up by diamonds dog but you escaped with your life said harris because i took that cane with the loaded end if it hadnt been for that the infernal dog would have eaten me i hit him an awful blow it would have killed any other dog well said harlow well strike a different kind of a blow directly one that will do more than lay out a dog chapter viii taking chances it was the day of the spring races at mystic park and bethany was filled with strangers horsemen sporting men sightseers touts racetrack gamblers women in gay attire and all the different kinds of persons usually seen at a country horse race in the state of connecticut were on hand a number of yale lads had come up to bethany to attend the races the most of them were friends of frank merriwell some of his enemies were there also frank had brought nemo up himself and he scarcely slept the night before the races he felt that there was danger in the air nemo had been entered in the free for all and his name was on the bills frank had been informed that he would be given odds that his horse did not take a purse he had received an anonymous letter ridiculing him for thinking of entering such a horse he had been taunted and told that he dared not stake money on nemo merriwell knew well enough that there was a plot afloat and it seemed that the scheme was to make him lose money on his horse if he had been timid he would have hesitated about backing nemo for anything but the ones who had been taunting him had reckoned well on his mettle and they had succeeded in pricking his pride and arousing him frank had seen nemo work on a track with toots in the saddle he had timed the horse repeatedly and he felt confident that nemo could not fail to take a position if he were in proper form when he entered the race frank sent for money he demanded it his guardian did not feel like refusing as he remembered that his last effort to suppress frank had resulted in a most painful train of incidents the culmination being his arrest for kidnaping a baby he sent frank a check for the sum desired when bethany was reached merriwell was approached by a tall thin man who wore a prince albert coat and looked like a parson this man introduced himself as john baldwin and he proved to be very smooth frank knew in a moment that the stranger was trying to catch him for a sucker he felt like knocking the man down but instead of that he bet three hundred and fifty dollars against a thousand dollars that nemo would take a purse in the free for all john baldwin departed apparently looking for other bloods who wished to take flyers but frank was to see baldwin again the man came back and in the most sneering manner possible offered to let him out of his bet for fifty dollars he told frank that nemo was a dead one and could not even crawl the result was that merriwell bet the man five hundred even that nemo would take a purse and there were but three purses in the free for all after baldwin departed the second time frank regretted that he had not booted the insolent fellow never mind thought the lad ill win his cash all right in the morning there was a row in the stable where nemo was kept toots was found vigorously punishing a flashily dressed negro tek dat yo dirty brack nigger shouted toots as he smashed the other fellow on the nose yo caynt com roun dis chile wid none ob yere swinuations an yore offers ob money to throw de race ill kick part ob yore panjaloons clean out frough de top of yore hade yo brack son ob a gun the colored boy fought like a furious tiger and the other fellow after trying to strike back a few times took to his heels leaving a smashed silk hat behind him whats the matter toots asked frank who had rushed to the scene of the conflict accompanied by others mattah sar cried toots fiercely why dat brack whelp come call me out ob de stall har an he says to me says he if yo pulls nemo so he don take a purse it am wuff two hundred dollars to yo an he flashes his roll ob bills in mah face i didnt wait fo no mo conwersashun sar but i jes soaked him a dandy under der ear good boy toots laughed frank youre all right well wen dey fools roun dis chile dey strikes hot stuff grinned the boy frank knew now that there was a job to knife him in the race rattleton and diamond were on hand and they took turns in helping toots keep guard over nemo merriwell was angry he went out looking for john baldwin when he found baldwin he offered to bet all the money he had about him that nemo would take either the first or the second purse baldwin snapped at the bet in a manner that showed he believed he had a soft thing youll go back to yale broke he sneered dont let that worry you returned frank coolly it strikes me that the fellow who is furnishing you with cash stands a chance of dropping something you say that very mildly youre scared now if i had more money about my clothes id put it all up that shows what an easy thing you are ill take your paper against my good money and now you dont dare do a thing how much do you want to risk that way any sum you like ill go you for five hundred done frank had made the original selection of stakeholder and he had chosen a man who was interested in the track but was known to be perfectly square this choice had proved satisfactory to baldwin once more this man was hunted up and he felt it his duty to caution frank the boy simply smiled dont lose any sleep about me mr davis said frank quietly it isnt necessary twenty minutes after this bet was made john baldwin informed evan hartwick good cried hartwick fiercely if i get hold of that piece of paper ill use it to ruin frank merriwell at yale i can do it nemo must be fixed for fair then he rushed away oh well said baldwin with a satisfied smile i dont care which way the wind blows now i have made my commission on this work today and i have nothing to lose if those fellows slip up in their plans it wont be my funeral then he lighted a cigar and strolled away rattleton and diamond watched nemo closely permitting toots to get an hours sleep then the colored boy came out feeling first rate and merriwell showed up to take his friends to have something to eat by jove he exclaimed with a happy laugh one of you fellows will have to loan me the money to settle for the feed ive staked every cent on nemo and i havent enough left to purchase a sandwich whew whistled diamond havent you been plunging pretty steep old man oh i dont know smiled frank well have money to start a conflagration with when we return to new haven i think so agreed jack but there are slips now toots said frank we are going to leave nemo in your care for a short time you know what i expect of you yes sar an you may pend on me sar all right my boy come on fellows away the three went arm in arm laughing and joking like the lighthearted fellows they were ten minutes after they left toots decided to give nemo some water he stepped out of the stall for a bucket as he picked it up he fancied he heard a suspicious sound inside the stall and he hurried back when the colored boy stepped into the stall he saw a toughlooking young man in a plaid suit offering nemo an apple it was mike hogan gwan frum dat hawse man shouted toots as he flung the bucket straight at mikes head the bucket struck hogan knocked him down and he lay stunned almost beneath the feet of frank merriwells racer an hour later the starters flag had fallen and the free for all at mystic park had begun among the spectators were three lads who were excitedly watching the beginning of the race they were hartwick harlow and harris if that horse is doctored im a fool declared harlow his eyes fastened on frank merriwells nemo he must be he must be palpitated hartwick whose eyes were bloodshot and whose face was flushed so that it betrayed he had been drinking heavily nemo starts all right said harris in an agitated voice i should not wonder if harlow were right hartwick my boy then hogan has betrayed me came gratingly from hartwick if he has ill have his life where is the fellow asked harlow he should be on hand thats right where is he echoed harris he has not reported but he was sure he would not fail said hartwick he had everything fixed with one of the stablemen and he said he knew he could get into nemos stall all the same ill wager that frank merriwell will come out on top again fluttered harris it is just his luck perhaps he has outwitted us in some way no no exclaimed hartwick with sudden satisfaction see see there already nemo is dropping behind black boy pawnee is in the lead fanny d is second lightfoot is third and now black boy has pushed ahead of nemo ha ha ha everything is all right hogan has done his work and the stuff is beginning to tell on merriwells racer at just the right time well send the fellow back to yale penniless and then i will jump on him with his paper ill expose him as a racetrack gambler a fraud a swindler ill ruin his college career as he ruined mine but ill not be satisfied then ill hound him till he is weary of his life ill make him remember the day he dared lift his hand against evan hartwick i can feel his blow now it left a mark on my cheek that mark is not there now but the scar is on my heart nothing can cure it but full and absolute reprisal this is my first triumph hartwick almost frothed at the mouth and his reddish eyes glared as if there were a glowing furnace within his passionate soul evans companions looked at him with awe and harris shivered a bit drawing a little away the passions of the revengeful lad had been wonderfully aroused by the liquor he had taken and he showed at his very worst just then toots does not seem to be pushing nemo as he might muttered harlow the boy is taking it easy if i did not know the attempt had failed i should think he had been bought off pawnee cant hold the lead declared harris i am willing to bet all i have that he will not take the race hang pawnee snarled hartwick i do not care which horses secure the purses if merriwells animal is not one of them well it begins to look as if you were safe came with some satisfaction from harlow black boy is the favorite and he is crawling now already he is neck and neck with lightfoot hartwicks hand shook as he adjusted the field glasses he held and brought them to bear on the racing horses its all right i know its all right he muttered hoarsely lightfoot is holding the lead on nemo frank merriwells horse is fifth and the animal will not hold out to get around the track i believe nemo is swaying now the horses behind are gaining ha ha how it will wring merriwells heart to see his beauty come in last this is early cautioned harris they have just reached the quarter now wait till they pass us before you begin to count your chickens old man the spectators grew excited as the racing horses swung around the halfmile track and came flying down toward the judges stand on their first round men waved their hats and cheered the white handkerchiefs of women were fluttering black boy black boy he is the winner for a thousand roared a big man in the grand stand fanny d fanny d shouted another she is taking the lead this was true pawnee as harris had declared proved unequal to the task of holding the lead in the second quarter fanny d crept alongside and gradually forged ahead for all that black boys rider used whip and voice poor old lightfoot was steadily losing ground and hartwick ground his teeth as he saw nemo come into fourth place still it did not seem that merriwells horse had made a spurt and then as the horses came thundering down the track a sudden change seemed to come over the black boy on nemos back he leaned far forward and appeared to be talking into nemos ears which were laid almost straight back he cut the air with his whip but the lash did not fall on the glossy coat of the handsome animal look palpitated harlow see nemo the creature has awakened that horse is all right hartwick i believe merriwell will secure third money after all not on your life ground forth evan his eyes glaring the creature is doing his best now as the foremost racers shot past the judges stand at the expiration of the first half it was seen that fanny d had taken the lead away from pawnee while black boy was steadily gaining although nemo had shown a streak of speed he had not grown dangerous but now came the time when the mettle of the racers was to be tested black boy responded nobly to whip and voice he went ahead in a marvelous manner he was soon nose and nose with pawnee and then he took second place with his nose at fanny ds flank but there was another change again the black boy on the back of frank merriwells racer leaned forward and talked into the ears of the horse and then came a spurt that caused hundreds of spectators to gasp with amazement pawnee struggled nobly to hold third place but nemo passed him and evan hartwick nearly choked with fury then it was seen that nemo was gaining on the others he crept up beside black boy till they were nearly even and thus the two animals passed fanny d at the end of the third quarter when the home stretch was reached black boy was leading by a neck with nemo second and fanny d third evan hartwick was nearly beside himself with rage the language that came from his lips cannot be printed here in vain his companions tried to calm him he cursed them both and struck at them then the voice of another person was heard i slipped on the trick boss they caught me and they didnt do a thing to me not a thing my head was near broke and they made me take a bite outer ther apple i was tryin to feed ther horse itd killed me if theyd made me eat ther whole of the apple im sorry but it was mike hogan his brutal face pale and drawn if he were indeed ill and a bloody handkerchief tied about his head your head was near broken snarled hartwick you bungling fool ill finish the job and then he hit mike in the face with his fist they grappled and fell and as the other lads were trying to pull them apart there came a great shout that announced the race was over the crowd was heard cheering which won was the question harlow paused to ask nemo came in first by a full length replied a spectator then hogan was dragged off hartwick who lay pallid and still on his back looking as if the end had come for him two nights later a jolly party gathered in frank merriwells room to offer him congratulations there were speeches songs toasts and jests how much will you take for nemo now merriwell asked jack diamond i want to buy him and send him south to my father you cant laughed frank your father hasnt money enough to buy the dear old boy but what are you going to do with him asked rattleton you must think of the future not now smiled merriwell tomorrow is my queens birthday and i am thinking of the present bruce browning loafed into the room heard the news fellows he asked no what is it cried several voices hartwicks been arrested arrested what for for robbing his own father of seven thousand dollars he knew how to get at the old gentlemans dough and he swiped it several days ago hes been burning money since then was the robbery committed before the mystic park races asked frank sure my boy then that explains why the mysterious man in black followed me up and drove me into so many bets he had hartwicks money and hartwick was behind the entire game well all his plots miscarried and he got it in the neck at last which served him right declared jack diamond with satisfaction chapter ix a strong accusation after the great horse race matters moved along smoothly for some time frank worked hard over his studies and made fine progress he did not dare race nemo again for the college authorities would not permit it in the face of what had been said about betting frank had gotten rid of some of his enemies for the time being but there were others those who could not stand it to see him become such a general hero one evening a crowd of these gathered in a resort known as jacksons all had been drinking freely and it was not long before every tongue was loosened in the crowd were several students that my old readers have met before they included a hotheaded lad named tom thornton a fussy fellow called puss parker and fred flemming willis paulding andy emery and tad horner earlier in the evening they had met at moreys but found they could not talk privately there as the place was filled with students then thornton had given them the tip to go down to jacksons a place sometimes patronized by the students although it did not exclude the general public jacksons was known as a joint and very few of the college lads cared to have it known that they ever went there but it was a place where a private room could be obtained in which to drink gamble or carouse and for this reason it appealed to a certain class of students it was in this place that frank had exposed the gambler rolf harlow and broken up the game by which harlow and harris were bleeding a certain number of lambs in getting together his party thornton had chosen the ones who seemed to have sympathy with himself and fred flemming or held a grudge against frank merriwell merriwells name had not been mentioned until all had indulged very freely in wine thornton being the most generous in blowing off then came a discussion about college sports over which all had grown more or less heated at length merriwells name was mentioned and then thornton declared frank a cad by jawve drawled willis paulding allowing cigarette smoke to escape from his mouth as he spoke i agree with you thornton dont yer now i nevah could bear that fellaw merriwell tad horner gave a sniff merriwell would feel bad if he knew it observed tad sarcastically it would break him all up that would not make the least difference to me my dear fellaw declared willis who was too dense to catch the sarcasm i have nevah twaveled awound with him i have noticed that grinned tad you have permitted him to avoid you in a most astonishing manner what have you against merriwell thornton asked parker i didnt know you were so down on him you both played on the football team last fall and merriwell made a record for himself by winning the game for yale said andy emery thornton laughed sneeringly showing his perfect white teeth merriwell is always making a record for himself at something he returned id rather have his luck than be born rich if any other fellow on the team had obtained the ball at that particular moment he could have gone through princetons line as well as merriwell did for yales interference was simply marvelous and a clear road was given the runner emery shook his head i think your memory is slightly at fault old man he said i am sure merriwell bowled over at least one man and dodged one or two others besides going down the field like a wild engine with princetons fastest runner at his heels and unable to tackle him oh it is not all luck with merriwell thornton as you would acknowledge if you were not prejudiced you talk as if you are stuck on the fellow snarled tom in his most cutting manner but you know i am not i have held away have had nothing to do with him and that is the reason why i invited you down here tonight so well i thought there was something more in the wind than a simple discussion of athletics whats up dont be in a hurry well come to that presently have another drink all around this is on me push the button horner i want to order more fizz this is too much sighed tad as he pressed the button that communicated with an electric bell at the bar if we do not let up well be in rocky shape in the morning the waiter appeared and the wine was ordered when the waiter went out after serving the order he left the door communicating with the next room standing open gentlemen cried thornton lifting his glass of sparkling fizz heres to a break in merriwells luck may it come soon all drank i cant quite agree with thornton that it is all luck said puss parker lowering his halfemptied glass it is not luck that enables merriwell to pitch on the ball team oh i dont know exclaimed tom if heffiners arm had not been in bad condition merriwell would not have obtained the opportunity when he did if he had not obtained it then he might not have obtained it at all for there are several other fellows who can twirl quite as well as he they think they can but i have my doubts this kind of talk did not satisfy thornton and he snapped i must say i didnt suppose you were one of that cads sycophants parker i fancied you had more stamina than that next thing youll be saying that when his horse won the free for all at mystic park it was something more than luck from what i have heard i presume there was a great deal of luck connected with that affair but that is outside college sports i did not see the race but i have heard that all sorts of tricks were tried to put merriwells horse out of the race so his friends have reported but i take no stock in it if he ever enters that horse in another race he will lose his socks betting on the beast we were talking of rowing a short time ago said emery lets return to our mutton thornton was kicking because merriwell has made a try for the eight and seems to stand a good show of getting there i dont see where thorntons growl comes in he cant pull an oar but flemming can came quickly from tom and he was sure of a position on the eight till merriwell went for a place like pierson who captained the ball team last season collingwood seems to be stuck on merriwell thats why he has thrown flemming down but i thought merriwells ideas about rowing did not correspond at all with collingwoods ideas said tad horner with unusual gravity when merriwell was captain of the freshman crew he introduced the oxford oar and the oxford stroke he actually drilled a lot of dummies into the use of the oar and into something like the genuine english stroke everybody acknowledged it was something marvelous and one newspaper reporter had the nerve to say that the freshmen had given the varsity crew a pointer oh yes grated thornton bitterly the newspapers have advertised merriwell at every opportunity remember what a howl they made when he stopped that runaway horse and rescued fairfax lees daughter any one would have thought the fellow had done a most marvelous thing and since then he has been taken into the very swellest new haven society and he is lionized as if he were something more than a mere snob it makes me sick there is still some mystery about the fellow said parker how did he happen to know so much about the oxford stroke ive heard that he was at oxford long enough to thoroughly acquaint himself with the english methods answered emery and it has been reported that the fellow has traveled all over the world said horner his rooms are decorated with all sorts of strange weapons trophies and skins of wild animals which it is said he gathered in his travels bah sneered thornton i have my doubts about his ever being at oxford and i take no stock at all in the rest of that guff it is barely possible that he may have been over to england but the yarn about his having traveled in south america africa and europe is the biggest sort of rot well let it go as rot said horner you must acknowledge that he did something most astonishing with that freshman crew we did not have the least idea in the world that they could beat us but we were not in the race on the home stretch oh we thought we had a soft thing thats all if wed dreamed we had a hard race coming wed won all right that may be but i am not so sure still if merriwell could do so much with a lot of freshmen what might not be done if the same methods were used with the varsity crew bah cried thornton again that sort of rot makes me sick bob collingwood has his own ideas and he will not accept suggestions from any one although i think he was a fool to throw down flemming for merriwell flem did great work on the football team and he is in condition to make a special effort at rowing this spring while merriwell is obliged to play ball as well i dont see how merriwell does so many things and does them so well confessed tad horner oh he is one of the chaps who has the nerve to try anything and will stumble through anything after a fashion nine times out of ten those fellows are never heard from after they leave college the fellow who takes some branch of athletics at college and sticks to it is likely to select some line of business when he has graduated and stick to that he is not diving into everything and making a success of nothing but merriwell seemed to be diving into everything and making a success of everything he is put up differently than most fellows he showed his caddishness in introducing the english oar and stroke when he was captain of the freshman crew he would ape things english and in that line he makes a failure at least by jawve that is wight dont yer now drawled willis paulding who had visited london once on a time and endeavored to be awfully english ever since he has not cawt the english air and expression dont yer understand he aw makes a wegular failyaw of that deah boys oh say cried tad horner dont pile on the agony quite so thickly paulding it is nauseating merriwell may not try to ape english manners and speech said thornton but he is a cad just the same and the friends he has made here at yale are a lot of thinblooded whitelivered creatures look at them there is bruce browning once called king of the sophomores but cowed and bested by merriwell to be afterward dropped a class there is jack diamond a boastful southerner he forced merriwell to fight but fawned about merriwells feet like a cur when whipped you lie sir by the open door a supple wellbuilt darkfaced lad sprang into the room his eyes were flashing and his teeth came together over his words with a click it was jack diamond himself chapter x a fight against odds diamond great scott heres trouble the lads about the table sprang to their feet giving utterance to these exclamations willis paulding was the only one who did not say anything and he failed to speak because the sound seemed to stick in his throat diamonds manner showed that he was fully aroused by what he had overheard and that he meant fight was evident the hot blood of the old south was pulsating in his veins and flaming darkly like a danger signal in his face pointing straight at tom thornton jack slowly and distinctly said his manner showing the struggle he was making to hold himself in check mr thornton you are a liar more than that mr thornton you know you are a liar thornton quailed a bit and then in sudden fury he flung back and you are an eavesdropper jack diamond eavesdroppers seldom hear good of themselves the muscles of the virginians face twitched and his clinched hands were quivering by accident i overheard what you were saying he declared i was looking for a friend and so came into this place which i seldom visit i was told a party of students had gathered here and as i entered the room adjoining i heard my name spoken by you i heard you declare that like a cur i fawned about merriwell when he had whipped me and i say it again cried thornton hotly it is the truth your boasted southern courage is a sham you have shown that diamond walked forward to the table mr thornton he said you are among friends and i am alone but i brand you as a liar as he uttered the words he picked up a partly emptied glass of wine and dashed the contents in thorntons face there he cried dashing the glass to the floor i have expressed myself you cannot mistake my meaning sir thornton whipped out a handkerchief and wiped the liquid from his eyes then he dropped the handkerchief and caught up a winebottle with which weapon he leaped at jack parker caught thorntons uplifted arm just in time to keep him from trying to break the bottle over diamonds head do you want to kill him exclaimed puss excitedly yes snarled thornton i will kill him pray do not interfere with the fellow mr parker urged jack his voice shaking with passion i will take care of myself youd better get out of here came fiercely from parker you have no business here i have business in any place where i am lied about and insulted sir let him alone and i will agree to give him all the fight he desires now for the first time fred flemming stepped forward he was a big fellow and was known to be a fierce fighter with the inclinations of a bully i think well give you a thumping before we let you go diamond just to teach you a lesson he said in a most insolent manner ive wanted to get at you or your friend merriwell for some time you you get at merriwell flung back jack why hed do you up with his right hand tied behind him you think so because he did you well i am going to break your face and then merriwell may pick it up if he dares he threw off his coat in a moment and then came at jack crying to the others close the door dont let anybody in here till i have fixed this sneak as i will fix merriwell when i get at him close the door willis paulding started to obey but before he could swing the door shut it was flung open with such violence that willis was sent tumbling to the floor into the room leaped frank merriwell and he placed himself between diamond and his wouldbe assailant wait a moment flemming he said with the utmost selfpossession it is not necessary for you to waste your energies on mr diamond it was a most dramatic tableau as every lad stood motionless and staring for some seconds there was a strong contrast between diamond and merriwell jack was literally quivering with passion while frank actually smiled serenely into flemmings face as if he thoroughly enjoyed the situation but those who knew merriwell best said that in times of trouble he was the most dangerous when he smiled so you are around flemming finally growled how did you happen in here were you playing the eavesdropper also i happened to be passing the saloon and i thought i saw my friend diamond come in here explained frank calmly i wondered what could bring him into such a place and so i entered likewise they said he had come back here i came also that is how i happened to arrive at precisely the right moment youll find it was precisely the wrong moment cried flemming close and fasten the door boys well jump on these two cads and do them up now and at once come on i dont know but it will be a good time to settle a few old scores with them said emery becoming aroused it will do them good to show them they can be licked that goes shouted puss parker six to two three to one laughed frank oh well thats not so bad come on my brave fellows well do our best to make it interesting eh jack oh all i want is a chance at thornton panted the virginian willis paulding was quivering with excitement he thought he saw his opportunity and he lost no time in improving it he had hated merriwell from the first but never had he dared do anything to injure frank now grasping his heavy cane he slipped forward and came up behind merriwell swish crack the cane cut through the air and fell on merriwells head dropping the lad in a senseless heap to the floor it was a cowardly blow but it put merriwell out of the fight in a twinkling for he was stunned so this is the way you fight cried diamond wheeling about and leaping at willis who gave a scream and vainly tried to escape jack caught the fellow grasped him by the ears and flung him back against the wall thump thump thump jack banged the head of the helpless wretch against the wall till it seemed that pauldings skull would crack willis tried to scream for help but with the very first thump his tongue was caught between his teeth and he nearly bit it in two blood gushed from his mouth and he sunk in a limp heap to the floor as jack released him diamond turned quickly but not in time to escape flemming whose heavy fist caught the virginian behind the ear down jack went as he tried to get up flemming kicked him over the sound of the fight had aroused those in the front of the saloon and several came hurrying in the door had not been closed as flemming had directed and the curious ones gained easy admission to the room among the foremost was plug kirby a tough of the town whom frank had once whipped he saw frank stretched on the floor and he hoarsely demanded who done that job who hit me friend merriwell show me der blokie an ill punch der face offen him instanter thrusting out his chin kirby glared around at the boys at best he was an uglylooking scoundrel with a bullet head and a bulldog neck so you are one of merriwells friends sneered flemming that speaks well for merriwell wats dat snarled plug advancing on fred dat merriwell is white ter ther bone an i sticks by him see dis gang has done him dirt an im goin ter punch der mugs offen der whole of yer merriwell should be proud of his friends cried flemming scornfully it is plain that he has been very careful in his selection an its plain ter me dat merriwell has been took foul else yer neverd knocked him out dis way ive been up aginst him an he could lick dis whole gang if he had a square deal then kirby pointed straight at flemming and fiercely exclaimed i tink youre der bloke wat done him dirt im goin ter knock der packin outer youse me fine chap he rushed at fred who caught up a chair and struck at kirbys head plug dodged caught hold of the chair and wrenched it from flemmings grasp right here is where i cleans out der place he shouted he swung the chair aloft and the boys made a rush to get out of the room whiz the chair flew through the air striking fred flemming between the shoulders knocking him down instantly then the police came in suddenly and clubbed kirby into a helpless condition while all the others with the exception of merriwell and diamond escaped from the place jack was examining franks wound when they were both placed under arrest what is this for demanded the young virginian what have we done to merit arrest why didnt you take those fellows who got the better of us in such cowardly ways dont ask questions growled one of the officers youll have a chance to answer a few when yer come before the judge in the morning those words filled diamond with a feeling of terror he knew what it would mean if they were brought up before a magistrate in the morning it would become known that they had been arrested in a place like jacksons and in company with a ruffian of plug kirbys stamp kirby would claim that frank merriwell was his friend and that would settle everything jack saw that it meant disgrace and expulsion for himself and merriwell flemming and thornton would be triumphant jack was very proud and it made him writhe with anguish when he thought how heavily such a blow would fall upon his parents for a moment he was quite overcome jackson came into the room he was greatly excited and he begged the officers to let the prisoners go for he knew unpleasant attention would be attracted toward his place if it became publicly known that two students had been arrested there its time we pinched somebody in this joint said one of the policemen theres been more crooked jobs put up here than anywhere else in the city you oughter lose yer license jackson and i rather think yer will this time jackson had ordered the door closed to keep out the curious crowd that had been attracted by sounds of the conflict one of the bartenders was standing guard over the door the saloonkeeper drew one of the policemen aside and spoke earnestly and excitedly to him the officer shook his head and replied weve overlooked things that went on here till it wont do no longer jackson there has been complaints against this joint and yere lucky that we dont pull the whole shootingmatch the other officer now took a fair look at merriwell who was sitting up and feeling tenderly of his head why hello exclaimed the policeman i tink i knows you hello magoon returned frank rather faintly i hope you didnt hit me that crack over the head with your stick i do know yer cried the officer yere ther boy what stopped ther horse and saved fairfax lees girl youre all right my friend there says were arrested magoon how about it we didnt know it was you but ther job is done now said the policeman apologetically well cant this matter be fixed up asked frank anxiously you know what it will mean to me if i am pulled up before a magistrate in the morning everything will come out and then ill be expelled from college thats rocky admitted magoon but what can i do i cant let you off without lettin the others go well why shouldnt you let my friend diamond go we were up against six fellows and it seems that we got the worst of it those chaps are the ones who should be arrested but we didnt catch em you caught us because we had been foully knocked out by the crowd declared jack we were taken at an advantage and did not have any kind of a show now are we to suffer while the ones who were to blame go free you made a big mistake in coming into this kind of a joint declared the officer severely and you were arrested at the same time with plug kirby a tough of the lowest order thats what gits you in a hole if we lets you go weve got to let him go then diamond explained how kirby happened to be in the room and frank added light to the matter by telling how he came to know the thug who had been hired to whip him once on a time but who had received a severe thumping instead and that is how it happens that he claims you for his friend asked magoon grinning you hammered friendship into him thats right said frank he has been ready to do anything for me ever since that night well i must say thats the first thing i ever knowed about plug kirby that made me feel like goin easy with him and he was fighting for you against the crowd ill have a word with murphy two of the officers drew aside while the third stood guard at the door after a few moments jackson was called up by magoon and the trio spoke in low tones frank was keeping watch of all that passed and he saw jackson take something out of his pocket and slip it into murphys hand that lets us out jack said merriwell guardedly jackson has fixed it with the officers if youre right we are dead lucky muttered diamond it began to look as if we were booked for our walkingpapers which would have pleased certain young gentlemen who do not admire us very much they would have held a jubilee over it with you out of the way flemming would have gone on the crew he has suddenly come to hate you because he thinks you have shut him out from that position scarcely do i settle with one set of enemies before another rises up to make it interesting for me said frank i believe i have more enemies than any other fellow at yale and you have more friends any man who is as popular as you is certain to have enemies you arouse the envy of the weak and shallow and the jealousy of those who would become your rivals but are incompetent to become your equals at the same time you are able to command a larger following than any fellow at yale you are a leader in everything and it is certain that you will be able to make your choice of the junior societies next year it is no more than natural that you should have bitter foes who desire your downfall well my enemies have not succeeded very well with their plots thus far if we get out of this scrape all right ill give my attention to this new gang who have rallied around fred flemming for he is evidently the leader yes he is the leader and tom thornton is his first officer if you give your attention to flemming i will look after mr thornton is that settled it is settled good now well see if jackson has fixed matters one of the policemen was having a talk with plug kirby kirby seemed rather sullen and obstinate i werent doin notting to git me head tumped like dis he muttered sulkily me frien merriwell was bein jumped by a gang an i went in fer ter back him up you cops lets der gang git off an den yer pinches us i dont care wot yer do wid me an i dont make no promises go on wid yer deal here frank merriwell stepped in you profess to be a friend of mine kirby he said dats wot i am pal nodded the tough then show it if i am pulled up before a magistrate it is pretty sure that ill be expelled from college which will be rough on me if you are my friend you will agree to keep your mouth shut about this affair if you are my enemy you will refuse well pal if yer puts it dat way i cant refuse yer i did kinder reckon youd stan by me when i was hauled up an i tought your influence might fix tings but if its der way you say ill take me medicine an never open me trap is dat satisfactory you have not been placed under arrest at all understand that demanded officer murphy sure and you know nothing about a row in this place catch on sure youre doing this for your friend merriwell see sure thats all well have a drink all around on jackson and ill club the head off you kirby if you blow anything frank took seltzer while the others drank beer or whiskey according to their fancy ten minutes later merriwell diamond and kirby were let out of jacksons by the back door when they were at some distance from the saloon frank turned to the bruiser and said diamond tells me that you got into this trouble by attempting to defend me kirby i am sure i appreciate it but i had rather you would drop calling me your friend you can do me more harm that way than any other all right nodded plug gloomily dat goes i know i aint in your class an i dont want ter do yer no hurt all der same if i git a chance ter fight fer yer any time ill do dat frank appreciated the kindness of the big bruiser whose admiration he had won by giving him a severe thrashing all right kirby he laughed i certainly cant object if you want to fight for me there have been times when i could have found you quite useful in pitting you against ruffians who had tried to injure me are you down on your luck nowadays well rudder well heres a v go play you are a millionaire kirby eagerly grasped the fivedollar bill which frank passed him earnestly exclaiming if youse aint der whites young cove what i ever seen im a liar if yer wants me ter do up der whole gang as was aginst yer ternight jest you say so id like der job if i need you ill let you know assured frank goodnight plug doffed his battered hat goodnight young gent may ye alwus prosper an may old nick take yer enemies as frank and jack walked toward their rooms in south middle the virginian observed you are the strangest fellow i ever saw merriwell when you do make a friend he is ready to go through fire for you and you make friends of all sorts and conditions of persons your friends are as firm and unwavering as your enemies are virulent and dangerous and still i seldom seek the friendship of any one declared merriwell if they wish to be my friends i accept them for what they show themselves to be if they choose to be my enemies well and good let them look out for themselves tonight i have found that a new combine of enemies has risen against me i know them all and i shall treat them as they deserve chapter xi a matter of speculation frank spent an hour every afternoon in the gymnasium where he took such exercise as he considered best always spending at least a few minutes of the time on one of the rowing machines a great deal of speculation had been aroused by bob collingwoods determination to take merriwell upon the varsity crew it was known that collingwood was a thorough believer in the american oar and american stroke as opposed to the shorterbladed oxford oar and the longer english stroke collingwood had ever seemed thoroughly satisfied with yale methods and he had expressed his scorn of the oxford method of placing the seats on alternate sides of the boat it was generally presumed that frank merriwell was thoroughly english in his ideas and beliefs and it was thought that he was altogether too set to give up what he fancied was right even though he might get on the crew by so doing still some one had been forced to give in and there was much speculation about it then came the rumor that yale was to have an english coach and the tongues of the gossips began to wag furiously its a great triumph for frank merriwell cried danny griswold to a party of friends gathered in the gym danny was flushed and perspiring from recent violent exertions on the bars some of the group about him were in training suits and some were in street dress also a triumph for good old umptyeight declared ben halliday with satisfaction how is that asked bandy robinson why answered halliday it was the freshman crew of umptyeight that under merriwells instructions adopted the oxford oar and stroke and defeated umptyseven at saltonstall do you see vanity vanity quoth dismal jones with the air of a methodist preacher of old times they who exalt themselves in high places shall be cast down beware of false pride and the swelled head oh you are always croaking exclaimed lewis little i think it is a mistake to run off onto english methods said burn putnam harvard has done that and theyll say we are following harvards example what if they do say so yawned bruce browning lazily what do we care so long as we win the race at new london but we cant win this year declared walter gordan who had been swinging the clubs and was flushed from the exertion it strikes me it is a crazy scheme to attempt to change the oars and the stroke at this late day harvard has been hammering away at her crew since last fall and it will be in perfect trim when the new london race comes off while yales crew will be all broken up if this change of methods occurs this seemed logical and not a few were ready to agree with gordan harry rattleton came up and the lads appealed to him at once you are merriwells roommate said robinson and you should know if it is true that yale is going to change her oars and stroke for the oxford oar and stroke harry grinned mysteriously why should i know all this just because i am merriwells roommate he asked do you think he knows everything he tells me i mean do you think he tells me everything he knows of course not but hed be sure to tell you this for you know he introduced english methods with umptyeight last year and he must be rather proud if collingwood has given in that those methods are preferable to the old yale ways if merry were proud of anything youd never know it by his words or manner said harry he is not given to boasting oh of course not cried little impatiently we all swear by frank merriwell but what we wish to know is if he has induced collingwood to adopt the oxford oar and stroke well youll have to ask merriwell for i will tell you frankly that i dont know the longer i room with him the less i pry into his affairs and if he knows collingwoods plans he has not seen fit to reveal them to me that is all gentlemen that was anything but satisfactory as the faces of the assembled lads plainly indicated well it cant be long before we find out cried robinson in disgust if yale has whiffled about at this late hour it will show reprehensible weakness and lack of policy harvard is bound to win then she will crow they have won the annual debate right along so that my old fogy uncle declares all the brains are in harvard if they win the spring race hell decide that brawn is going to harvard as well as brain and yale is in the decline they never won anything fair declared halliday why ive heard they have men out west all the while searching for new debaters they claim that harvard dont care to go in for athletics but takes a leading stand in all intellectual pursuits such as debating and chess chess is certainly a highly intellectual pursuit drawled browning if i had entered harvard i should take an interest in it debating is too trying the exertion of standing on ones feet and talking is very severe if you would take a little more exertion you might get some of the flesh off you said putnam how did you happen to get fat so suddenly browning old man oh he fell off the roof one day and came down plump chuckled griswold mischievously here here here exclaimed rattleton making a grab at danny who dodged and slipped out of the way you want to let up on that young fellow i have tried to reduce my weight by dieting said bruce with apparent seriousness ive been in the habit of eating a juicy tenderloin steak twice a day but i gave that up and tried cheap fifteencent steaks instead how did you find it asked little oh pretty tough answered browning with a sly wink this isnt what we were talking about broke in walter gordan impatiently if those harvard willies win from us this spring it will be a frightful blow for old eli if they win it will come from collingwoods shallying about asserted deacon dunning who had just joined the group merriwells ideas may be all right but it is too late to adopt them this season i am merriwells friend but i believe fred flemming should have been retained on the crew by taking in merriwell it may upset everything flemming is a good man and merriwell already has more than he can properly attend to now you are getting me cot under the hollar i mean hot under the collar exclaimed rattleton his eyes snapping i want to ask you a question mr dunning when have you known frank merriwell to make a failure of anything he has attempted oh he has been wonderfully successful i grant that and i do not doubt but he would have made a good man had he been taken on the crew last fall he will make a good man anyway and you can bet on that cried harry it is not necessary that there shall be a change of methods because merry has been taken on the crew although he believes in the superiority of the oxford oar and stroke he may not think it good policy to attempt to make a change now but that is not all merry makes a good leader but he is also a good follower and it is his theory that utter obedience is due superiors ill wager that he will not intrude his ideas on collingwood if he does not regulate his stroke with that of the rest of the crew he will soon be dropped and flemming or some other fellow will have his oar all this talk you are making is mere speculation and i advise you to wait a while till you know what you are talking about having thus delivered himself rattleton turned away at this moment frank entered the gymnasium to take his regular exercise he was accompanied by jack diamond who had been seen with merriwell very often of late immediately the group of sophomores decided that one of their number should ask merriwell pointblank if a change to the english methods was contemplated the choice fell on bandy robinson who did not relish his job much robinson approached frank with no little hesitation and something about his manner seemed to betray his object for merriwell read his thoughts go back directed frank grimly go back and tell them that they will find out all they want to know by waiting then he entered one of the dressingrooms and robinson retreated muttering its no use merriwell seems to know just what a person is thinking about he is one of the jolliest fellows in the world and at the same time when he takes a fancy one of the most unapproachable chapter xii the challenge merriwell and diamond entered a dressingroom together the moment the door closed behind them frank laughed shortly ill wager that i hit the nail on the head that time he said the moment i saw that knot of fellows talking so excitedly i decided they were speculating concerning the change on the crew and my eyes told me they had deputized robinson to question me so i did not give him the chance the dropping of flemming and your acceptance in his place has created a stir said jack it is generally thought that you will ruin everything with your english ideas that shows how little they know me smiled merriwell as he threw off his coat i almost fancy it is generally believed that i go in for english methods simply because they are english you fancy rightly merry the majority of the fellows believe that a cloud came to franks face i do not care to be misunderstood to such an extent he said i am no anglomaniac i am american to the bone i have traveled some and i prefer this country above all other countries on the face of the earth i was at oxford long enough to witness the races and make an investigation of their methods i believe that in the matter of rowing the english are more advanced than the americans this is not strange for they have been at it longer now although i claim to be thoroughly american i try not to be narrow and pigheaded simply because a thing is american i do not believe it must therefore be superior to everything else in the world but i am bound to defend it till i find something by which it is excelled if americans will adopt the english oar and the english stroke i am confident that in a very few years they will so improve upon them that they will be able to give points to our cousins across the pond you are indeed broadminded and liberal merriwell said diamond with admiration it was you who first convinced me that northerners no longer hold a feeling of enmity against southerners till i met you the word yankee seemed to me to be a stigma a name to be applied in derision to the people of the north to my astonishment i found you were proud to be called a yankee and then you explained to me that foreigners applied the name to all nativeborn americans you explained to me that in the early days of this country when northerner and southerner fought for one common cause freedom and independence all who opposed the tyranny of our oppressors were termed yankees i remember the night when we sat up till two in the morning talking of these things you did not tell me anything i had not considered before but you revealed things to me in a new light you showed me the north and south bound by ties of blood and i think you aroused in me a broader feeling of patriotism than i had ever before known the cloud passed from merriwells face as his companion spoke and as diamond finished frank reached out and took his hand you are from the south i from the north he said in his most charming manner yet we are brothers in the north and in the south there are those who still entertain sectional feelings and prejudices but the time will come when all this will pass away i think it is fast passing declared jack it is nodded frank so far as sectional feelings go there should be no north no south no east no west we are all united under one flag the most beautiful of all flags the star spangled banner we are all citizens of one country the greatest and grandest the sun ever shone upon we should be ready at any time to lay down our lives for our flag and our country diamonds eyes flashed and it seemed that the noble look on frank merriwells face was reflected in jacks his blood was stirred by the grandest of all emotions patriotism looking at the virginian at that moment no one could for an instant doubt his courage and his loyalty i believe we should pay more attention to the early history of our country when north and south were united against a common foe continued frank that is what will arouse true patriotism massachusetts had her tea party but virginia had her washington jack diamond bared his head merriwell he said with great earnestness the greatest enemies of our country are those who try to arouse sectional feeling i am sure of that quite right said frank in the north and in the south there are cheap fellows and cads who pose as gentlemen you and i have had a few experiences with some of them and it seems that there are others i presume you mean flemming thornton and their crowd flemming is the leader and his enmity against me has been aroused because i have been taken on the crew in his place i did not seek the position and i was surprised when collingwood called on me to take it you were no less surprised than others for collingwood has always maintained that yales methods are superior to those of oxford and he knows you believe quite the opposite it is a matter of speculation if he intends to change to the english methods at this late hour frank smiled collingwood is not a fool there will be no change already i am in training to perfectly acquire the yale stroke this was both a surprise and a relief to jack who had feared that collingwood had decided on the change and that in case harvard won merriwell would be blamed to a certain extent i am glad merry exclaimed diamond his eyes gleaming if yale wins and we square matters with flemming and thornton i shall be perfectly satisfied i am hoping to get at mr flemming this afternoon said frank grimly how is that he spends some time in the gym every day and i timed my visit today in order to catch him here but what can you do here asked the virginian wonderingly you cant fight him in the gym i do not want to fight him no cried jack in astonishment then what do you mean to do flemming considers himself the champion wrestler at yale i hope to wrestle with him hope to wrestle exclaimed diamond still more astonished why even if you were to throw him it could give you very little satisfaction frank smiled mysteriously do you think so he inquired well we shall see when you are ready we shall go out i will wrestle with you and you shall throw me well be near flemming at the time that will give him an opportunity to pass some remarks if he so desires if he does so you may be sure i will lose no time in picking them up i am tired of fighting and i hope to finish this chap in another way if you finish him by wrestling with him i shall consider it a marvel i am afraid you have misjudged your man merry hell not be finished so easily we shall see are you ready then come on they left the dressingroom frank in advance as they came out they were regarded with some interest by the knot of sophomores who were still talking of the surprising change that had been made on the crew as he passed the lads frank called pleasantly to them and they greeted him in return and the manner in which this was done would have betrayed to a keeneyed stranger that merriwell was something more than an ordinary man at college franks keen eyes detected flemming at the ladders that is first rate he muttered the turf is nearby a few moments later frank was engaged in casting the shot near where fred flemming was exercising on the ladders at about the time frank fancied flemming would finish frank gave jack the signal and they were soon struggling in what seemed to be a goodnatured wrestling match diamond was really supple and catlike on his feet and he possessed more than common strength but he was not frank merriwells match for besides being a natural athlete frank had developed himself in every way so that he was really a wonder for a youth of his years the struggle between frank and jack quickly attracted a number of spectators to the spot and merriwell was well pleased to see flemming come down from the ladders and approach accompanied by tom thornton it seemed that the battle between the wrestling lads became fiercer and fiercer but at last jack secured a sudden advantage and merriwell went down heavily bah fred flemming was heard to say those fellows remind me of two awkward cubs neither knows the rudiments of scientific wrestling one leap brought frank merriwell to his feet another leap carried him before flemming who was turning away wait a moment sir said frank his voice cold clear and distinct i believe you consider yourself something of a wrestler flemming merriwell had appeared before him so suddenly that fred started back involuntarily then angry with himself at the recoil his lips curled scornfully and he surveyed the other lad in the most haughty and insolent manner get out of my way he cried harshly i will not be bothered by you the same old smile the smile that was so dangerous crept over merriwells face you think you will not be bothered by me he said his voice smooth and soft but you deceive yourself you have taken a fancy to bother me to revile me behind my back even to make false statements concerning me for you have said that i sought your position on the crew and obtained it by underhand means in the presence of these witnesses you have stated that i am a most bungling wrestler that is something you cannot deny i do not wish to deny it you are not a wrestler you know nothing of the art and you claim to be a wrestler yes i can wrestle then here and now i challenge you to wrestle me at sideholds catchasyoucan and arms end the winner of two out of three falls to be acknowledged the best man and hugh heffiner to be the judge if you refuse to wrestle i will brand you as a blower and a braggart a fellow not fit to be accepted in the society of gentlemen your answer flemming your answer chapter xiii the wrestling match flemming turned pale and trembled with suppressed passion while his hands were clinched and he glared at merriwell as if he longed to strike the lad who had dared face him and fling such an insulting challenge in his teeth he tried to speak but the words were choked back in his throat he felt that merriwell was seeking retaliation and for that reason had purposely worded his challenge in a manner calculated to cut him deeply shame came from the lips of tom thornton still the lad who had given the challenge smiled i am meeting mr flemming as he would meet me said frank calmly i am using the sort of language he would not hesitate to apply to me of course i feel that i am lowering myself in doing so but it is absolutely necessary in some cases to place ones self on the level of an unscrupulous enemy in order to meet and defeat him all this was said with coolness and distinctness and it was as if frank were deliberately sinking the knife deeper in flemmings writhing body it seemed to be more than flemming could endure for he lost control of himself and would have leaped toward frank you insolent hound he cried through his set teeth merriwell stood with his hands at his side making no move but he saw that flemmings friends had grasped him and were holding him in check steady flem my boy fluttered thornton remember where you are i will strangle him wait you cant do it here let me go thornton is right declared andy emery who had placed himself between the two foes you cannot fight him here old man then fix it so i can fight him somewhere anywhere i could murder him you will have to wrestle him yes said thornton you will have to do that fred or his friends will believe you are afraid then i will wrestle him and i will break his back you must calm down before you attempt it and you must promise to wrestle fairly according to rules that will give me no chance to get square for this insult you can show your superiority by throwing him which you will do as you are an expert wrestler and for all of the other things he does so well no one ever heard that merriwell could wrestle then the next time you meet him outside college bounds you can force him to apologize emery nodded thornton is right flemming he said then with a mighty effort fred seemed to gain control of his anger and he calmly said all right i will wrestle him but i shall not be gentle with him although i promise not to foul him be as rough as you choose as long as you keep within bounds then it was that frank merriwell was heard saying to the friends who had gathered around him it may seem that i have opened myself to criticism by my manner in challenging this person but i call you all to witness that he was the first to be insulting by his manner of criticising the friendly bout between mr diamond and myself that however was not the beginning had not flemming given me other cause i should not have challenged him in such a manner i have sought neither his friendship nor his enmity but he has seen fit to regard me as an enemy i can honor an honest foe who meets me man to man but not one who takes a mean advantage of me on my head i now bear a bruise where i was felled by a heavy cane in the hands of one of flemmings friends when he with five companions set upon diamond and myself i always endeavor to square all my accounts with friends and foes and i shall balance the books with flemming fred forced a scornful laugh a very fine speech he cried i assure you merriwell you shall have the opportunity to square matters i could wish something somewhat more businesslike than a mere wrestling match but that may come later if you have as much nerve as you wish persons to think you possess to begin with ill show you that i spoke the truth when i said you know nothing of the art of wrestling i am satisfied to have hugh heffiner for judge and referee merriwell had chosen heffiner because he knew hugh was a square man and they were not at all chummy so he could not be accused of having selected a person who would favor him heffiner was in the gymnasium and had been attracted by the struggle between merriwell and diamond so he had overheard all that passed between frank and fred diamond was standing at one side his arms folded a look of satisfaction on his face for all of flemmings reputation as a wrestler diamond felt sure that merriwell was making no false moves he knew frank too well to think he would deliberately challenge his enemy to wrestle without feeling certain of his own ability to accomplish his defeat flemming was eager for the struggle while merriwell was calm and deliberate in his movements flemmings friends gathered about him giving him advice then frank was not a little astonished to find tad horner at his side and heard the little junior say look here merriwell i want you to understand that i am not your enemy although appearances may be against me you were one of the flemming gang at jacksons i acknowledge it but with shame said tad and to franks surprise the little fellow colored deeply at the same time you will remember that i did not lift a hand against you you are a white man merriwell and i think you all right frank was impressed by tads sincerity thank you he said it is not necessary for every fellow who dislikes me to be a rascal i am sure that all of flemmings friends are not rascals it is quite probable that a great many honest fellows think me in the wrong but i am glad to know that you who were present at jacksons do not think so tad retired quite satisfied with this he had long admired merriwell and he felt it his duty to come out on this occasion and express himself openly he did not mind that flemming and his friends regarded him with anger and scorn arrangements for the wrestling match were soon made and then the two lads faced each other on the turf flemming was tall and solid with broad shoulders and a back of which he was particularly proud he was heavier than merriwell there was not a single ounce of superfluous flesh on frank merriwell he was a mass of bone and sinew splendidly formed and supple as a young panther in every movement and pose there was indescribable grace and at the same time a suggestion of wonderful strength and selfreliance flemming was bold and confident he had made a special study of wrestling and he knew all the tricks employed by experts he had seen merriwell and diamond wrestling and he felt certain that his adversary and rival would be an easy thing it chanced that the under holds in the first match fell to flemming which made him certain in his own mind that he would have no trouble in throwing the lad he hated the signal was given and the enemies advanced and secured holds then heffiner gave the command and the struggle began in the twinkling of an eye flemming tried the crossbuttock but it seemed that merriwell had been expecting just such a move for he passed his left leg behind freds right and through in front of freds left then the force of flemmings surge seemed to lift both lads off their feet down merriwell goes cried thornton triumphantly but it seemed that in the act of falling frank whirled in the air and brought his rival under this however had been planned from the very instant that fred made the first move to accomplish the crossbuttock and franks locktrip had brought it about by lifting the other lad from the ground by a whirling movement flemming struck fairly on his shoulders with merriwell across his body and heffiner cried first fall for merriwell exclamations of astonishment broke from the spectators instead of a struggle of some moments this fall had seemed to come about in the twinkling of an eye but what was most astonishing was that flemming was flat on his back at the bottom when the lads struck the ground although it had appeared that he had successfully accomplished the crossbuttock it is certain that very few of those who witnessed the affair had the least idea how merriwell had accomplished this but they saw that he was the victor in the first contest jack diamond seldom smiled but now he did so and the expression of satisfaction on his face was complete who said merriwell was going down squealed danny griswold in delight somebody fooled himself that time thornton bit his lip muttering some fierce exclamation beneath his breath of them all no person was more astonished than fred flemming he lay dazed and wondering scarcely able to realize that he was flat on his back and his enemy across his chest frank arose hastily his face quite calm and expressionless he did not betray satisfaction or triumph but his manner indicated that what had happened was no more than he had fully expected he had confidence in himself which any one must have to be successful but still he was not overconfident which is a fault quite as much as timidity flemming sat up he had felt himself lifted from his feet with a twisting movement and he had felt himself whirled in the air but still he could not understand how the feat had been accomplished shame caused the hot blood to rush into his face and he ground his teeth together his whole body quivering it was an accident it must have been an accident he told himself i tried to throw him so heavily that i overreached myself the look on merriwells face cut him like a keen knife and made him feel a fierce longing for the next tussle they actually think he threw me when i threw myself was his thought but i will undeceive them in a moment next time i will drive him into the earth beneath me therell be no further miscalculation thornton was at the side of his friend how in the world did you happen to let him take a fall out of you in that manner whispered tom in extreme disgust flemmings lips curled bah he returned he did not do it no but you were thrown explain that i was not thrown yes you were my dear fellow heffiner has given merriwell credit for winning the first fall i made a misjudgment in the amount of strength i should use on the fellow and i turned myself in the air declared fred is it possible of course it is hissed flemming who saw the incredulity in the face of his friend he is even easier fruit than i imagined thornton brightened up somewhat although not fully satisfied you must not let him accomplish it this time i tell you he did not accomplish it before came bitterly from the crestfallen and furious youth i will convince you of that in a moment see the fellow stand there with that lordly air as if he had actually accomplished something i will take all of that out of him this is catch as we can and i will break his back injure his back in some way and he will not be able to hold the place that belongs to you on the crew that is right panted flemming his eyes glittering and his teeth showing a fellow with a sprained back is no good at an oar why thornton my boy merriwell has played right into my hands he has given me the very opportunity i most desire and ill be a chump if i neglect it if he is not taken to his room on a stretcher it will be necessary for some of his friends to aid him i know a hug that will take the stiffness out of his spine and make him lame for a month give it to him fluttered tom with returning confidence fix the cad this time so he will not be able to wrestle any more i will rest assured of that this is my opportunity in five minutes the starch will be taken out of him flemming was confident far more confident than he would have been had he dreamed that merriwell had turned him in the air and brought him underneath in the first fall in his mind he saw merriwell groaning on the ground saw him assisted to his room saw him helpless in bed and attended by a physician but what gave flemming the greatest satisfaction was the vision of collingwood humbly asking him to again resume his place on the crew the place now given to frank merriwell it seemed remarkable to fred that he had not planned to engage the lad he hated in a wrestling match and so injure him in such a manner that he would be unable to row on the crew but no less remarkable it seemed was the fact that he had been challenged to wrestle by merriwell and thus given the opportunity he most ardently desired the only thing that marred his satisfaction at that moment was that merriwell had apparently by accident seemed to have acquired the honor of having thrown him in the first struggle gentlemen said heffiner are you ready the antagonists stepped forward and signified their readiness the spectators fell back this time it is catch as you can said yales famous pitcher any kind of a hold is fair is that understood it is nodded merriwell certainly bowed flemming giving frank a scornful look very well gentlemen prepare to clinch ready go chapter xiv plotting fun like a panther merriwell sprang forward but he halted quite as suddenly and stood erect careless and disdainful flemming came forward in a crouching posture he believed he saw his opportunity and with a gasp of satisfaction he darted in and caught the lad he hated about the body this time it was not flemmings intention to throw merriwell too suddenly he wanted a little time to wrench franks back and then he would cast his foe writhing and helpless at his feet tom thornton saw that fred had obtained the hold he sought and he mentally exclaimed this time there will be no blunder jack diamond no longer smiled he saw that flemming had obtained what seemed to be a great advantage and his face was filled with concern it was careless of merriwell to give the fellow such a hold thought jack flemming is sure to be the victor this time there was a look of intense satisfaction on fred flemmings face as he made firm his clasp about merriwells back and then just as flemming was ready to give a bearlike hug something happened franks right arm was bent so that his forearm came directly under freds chin while his left arm was clasped across freds shoulders behind his back merriwell gave a sudden surge drawing flemming close with his left arm and thrusting back the fellows head by pressing his right arm under his enemys chin in the twinkling of an eye flemmings wind was shut off and his neck seemed to crack beneath the strain he made a mad effort to hurl merriwell to the ground but he had delayed the attempt a moment too long frank merriwell well knew how dangerous was the trick he had played upon his enemy he knew that he could break flemmings neck in that manner if he desired to do so and he was careful not to make the sudden pressure too intense flemming could not breathe and his eyes started from his head his strength seemed to leave his body and his struggles to throw the lad he hated were weak and ineffectual he was like a child in the hands of frank merriwell the spectators stared in astonishment and diamond gasped great cжsar merry purposely let flemming get that hold break away flem break away cried tom thornton quivering with excitement but flemming could not break away for he had not sufficient strength to do so foul shouted emery starting forward as if he would part the combatants in a moment jack diamonds arm was extended and pressed across emerys breast holding him back like a bar of iron there is no foul in this match came exultantly from the lips of the virginian that was stated at the beginning flemming made one last feeble struggle and then the two lads went down together with fred under they fell heavily and merriwell came down on his enemy with his full weight a moment later frank arose on the turf fred flemming lay white and still his eyes closed bring some water calmly directed the victor i think mr flemming has been stunned this fall settles the match decided hugh heffiner frank merriwell has won by throwing flemming two times in succession permit me to congratulate you mr merriwell for it is apparent that you are as expert in the art of wrestling as you have proved yourself to be in the other things you have attempted thank you said frank simply as he accepted heffiners hand jack diamond whispered in tom thorntons ear it is your turn next diamond called on merriwell that evening you are a dandy old man cried the virginian admiringly you got back at flemming in great shape they say he has been weak as a rag ever since you dropped him the second time and it is pretty certain he will hold you in respect hereafter i shall be satisfied if he will let me alone said frank quietly i have no grudge against him but the fellow who has not the nerve to fight his way in this world gets left life is a battle from start to finish and the hardest fighter is the winner true nodded jack my mother was one of the gentlest women in the world continued merriwell thoughts of strife and contention distressed her to her a personal encounter was brutal and vulgar and she instructed me never to fight unless absolutely compelled to do so as far as possible i have tried to remember her teachings i have not found it possible to do so at all times as my enemies would ride over me if i did when i see that a foe is determined to force me into an encounter then i become the aggressor in another thing my mother was at fault many times she told me never to strike the first blow she was wrong often the first blow wins the battle if a person sees there is certain to be an encounter he should do his best to get in the first blow and make it a good one then he should not be satisfied to let it rest there till his enemy has recovered but he should follow it up that is my belief and you are right old man you have a level head i never saw another fellow like you merriwell and i doubt if there is another in the world frank laughed you flatter me diamond not at all ah but you do i know my own failings i wonder what they are do not think for a moment that i have no failings i have studied my own nature and i have discovered them as far as possible i seek to remedy them to myself i am a very ordinary sort of fellow i know it jack the man who can see no flaws in himself is an egotist a cad and a shallow fool as soon as he is perfectly satisfied with himself he ceases to progress he deteriorates that is true among my friends i see many things worthy of emulation you my dear diamond are not aware of your own fine qualities and that will do merry cried jack blushing i am sure that i try to be a gentleman my father was a true southern gentleman there can be no doubt of that you show your breeding in every way a natural gentleman will be a gentleman under any circumstances he carries the air about him and nothing can disguise it jack sat down you have squared your score with flemming he said but i have a little matter to settle with thornton i am wondering how i shall settle it thornton is flemmings satellite it would be cruel to use him roughly but i will not let him off he should be taught a lesson look here jack i have a scheme what is it lets put up a racket on him what sort of a racket oh one out of which we can get some sport and humiliate him at the same time i am sure you do not want to fight with the fellow i have been thinking that i would be ashamed to have an encounter with him exactly so now i know you are not much of a fellow for pranks but i hope you will agree to this little scheme of mine state it said jack rather doubtfully well you know thornton considers himself something of a masher he gets stuck on every pretty girl who smiles on him yes danny griswold is a daisy as an impersonator of girls you know he is to play a girls part in one of the entertainments to be given in the fall he has done the trick before and he sent home for his outfit a week ago yesterday while rattleton and i were cramming for recitations the door opened and a stunning blonde walked into the room she seemed confused when she saw us begged our pardon and said she was looking for her cousin danny griswold she had entered the wrong room by accident harry offered to show her to dannys rooms but she said she could find the way still she was in no hurry to go and i began to be rather nervous for i did not fancy the idea of having a young lady without a chaperon visit us i feared it would become known and we would receive a reprimand she was decidedly giddy and she sat on the arm of the easychair there and giggled and said it must be so nice to be a boy and go to yale after a while i began to smell a rat i got up and took a closer look at her say she was gotten up in great shape it was that little imp griswold well what is your scheme asked jack smiling it is to put griswold onto thornton let danny rig up and see what he can do its ten to one thornton will think he has a new mash and then we can have any amount of sport with the fellow jack looked more doubtful than ever i dont see how that is getting square with him he declared if the game works you can pretend to be in love with the same girl you can challenge thornton to mortal combat he wont dare meet you then you can expose him and if that will not be getting even with him i dont know how you can get even this scheme did not exactly meet diamonds approval and frank found it difficult to induce him to agree to it at last however merriwell succeeded well have barrels of fun out of this laughed frank i feel in need of a little fun to wake me up chapter xv thorntons mash tom thornton was alone in his room when there came a knock on the door come in called tom without turning his head or taking his feet down from the table on which they were resting as he had been out late the night before he was not in a very agreeable mood he had sent for his tailor some time before and he supposed it was the tailor who had knocked and entered at his command well here you are at last tom growled ive waited long enough for you too you are slower that molasses in midwinter i suppose you want to know what ails me now well ill tell you that last pair of trousers you made me are too short in the waist and too full around the bottoms thats whats the matter id be mobbed if i should show myself in them now dont tell me they are all right ill just try them on right before you and let you see great jupiter what have i been saying he had turned his head and he saw a vision that electrified him and brought his feet down from the table with a thump just within the room a very pretty girl was standing and she was staring at him in a halffrightened halfamused manner i i i beg your puppuppardon stammered thornton jumping up confused and flustered i didnt know i i thought it was my tailor and you nearly frightened the senses out of me by growling at me in that way giggled the girl why i thought you were a great horrid bear and you were going to eat me if i were a bear i couldnt ask for a daintier meal said tom gallantly oh my laughed the girl what a difference i am bound to even matters if possible thats it then you did not really mean what you just said after all the smile vanished from her face and she seemed a bit offended oh yes i did i vow i did exclaimed tom hastening to repair the break you see i am all broken up by the surprise i i didnt think of seeing a young lady here alone i suppose not i am looking for my cousin mr griswold griswold griswold why i have heard of him yes he is a soph youll find him over in south middle this is welch hall oh dear then i was misdirected i was told id find him here somewhere i beg your pardon sir oh dont mention it miss er miss darling my name is grace darling and i have come down to spend a week in new haven you see i am from the country i should say so thought thornton and as fresh as they make em but she is pretty yes she is a genuine stunner a sort of wild flower she is so innocent and unsophisticated i presumed you were not familiar with yale or you would not be in the dormitories without a chaperon said thornton aloud it is all right though he hastened to declare as she seemed to shrink back i will escort you over to south middle and help you find your cousin my name is thornton thomas thornton you are very good mr thornton but i think i can find danny all right i will not put you to the trouble oh it will be no trouble not the least in the world i assure you still i dont know what danny would think even though your company would be very pleasant i dare not accept it without a proper introduction mr mr thornton this was said in the most coquettish manner possible and tom thornton felt his heart beating proudly ive struck her all right he told himself i mustnt let it slip ill improve the opportunity so he talked to her in his most fascinating manner and was bold enough to express a hope that he might see her again to which she replied that he might and when she left tom was in a state of delighted satisfaction thoroughly pleased with himself thornton was inclined to boast of his conquests and it was not long before he had told several of his friends about the corking pretty girl who had wandered into his room and i caught her without a struggle he declared repeatedly country girl and rather unsophisticated but a regular rustic rose no a regular daisy cousin of some fellow over in south middle her name never mind i am not giving things away she is going to stay down a week and gave me her promise that i should see her again but she intends to be strictly proper although she does not know much of city ways for she declared that i must be properly introduced to her before she would make an appointment with me oh its dead easy when you know how tad horner was thorntons roommate grace darling had chosen an occasion when tad was not in and thus had found tom alone tom boasted of his conquest to tad who grinned and tried to chaff him about his charming country girl did she have hayseed in her hair asked tad its not that kind of a lady horner theyll all be envious of me she is a stunning blonde and her innocent country ways make her all the more attractive she has such eyes and such teeth her lips are very inviting my dear boy its just the sort of a mouth a fellow longs to kiss and if i do not sip nectar from those ruby lips before she returns to her country home ill be dead slow wow whooped tad sip nectar that beats thornton this rural maiden has knocked you silly wait till you see her and you will not wonder my boy ill go something you do not see her again oh but i have her promise ah she was giving you a jolly youll see cried tom piqued just wait a while two days passed and thornton began to think he would not hear anything from his mash then came an invitation to spend an evening at winnie lees and winnie hinted that among her guests there was to be a young lady from the country who wished to apologize for intruding upon mr thornton in his room its grace darling thought tom exultantly she will be introduced to me and she must be of fine people to be accepted as a guest at miss lees for the lees belong to the йlite of the town oh gracie is all right if she is from the country on the evening of the party tom arrayed himself in his finest used perfumery liberally too liberally on his handkerchief and his clothes and set out with a light heart for miss lees as old readers know winnie lee and frank merriwell were very friendly as winnie was of a lively disposition and enjoyed a joke thoroughly it was not difficult for frank to induce her to aid him in carrying out his plan winnie was all the more ready to do so because she disliked tom thornton who had made himself offensive by having declared that he could catch her without a struggle if he so desired but she was not his style this had been repeated to winnie and she had treated thornton with the utmost disdain since hearing it but frank had urged her to consent to invite tom to the party that the joke might be carried out and she finally had consented for a moment thornton wondered when he received the invitation and then he decided that grace darling must have induced miss lee to offer it tom little dreamed of the surprising events that were to take place before the evening was passed chapter xvi another challenge thornton found merriwell diamond rattleton and browning were among winnie lees guests this he had expected however and he was resolved to notice them as little as possible willis paulding was there and tad horner came later much to toms surprise as he had not known tad had been invited there were a number of jolly girls and thornton was not long in looking around for grace darling when tom finally discovered her to his disgust she was chatting with jack diamond in a cozy corner which was almost shut off from the rest of the room by portiиres hang that fellow thought thornton he has been introduced to her and he has lost no time in getting in his work as soon as diamond left the girl tom hastened to find winnie lee of whom he requested an introduction to miss darling oh yes said winnie laughing she spoke of you but i had almost forgotten i trust you will find her very entertaining mr thornton i am sure i shall said tom we have seen each other you know but have not been introduced and she is very particular about that being bred in the country she is not fully conversant with the ways of the world but she knows an introduction is the proper thing and she insists on that there she is miss darling was seen chatting with a number of young gentlemen and ladies who had gathered about her the group scattered as winnie and tom came up miss darling saw them and timidly held her fan before her face peering over it shyly mr thornton laughed winnie lee it gives me the greatest pleasure to introduce you to miss darling tom bowed profoundly while the girl giggled and made a courtesy winnie lee laughed more than ever at a distance frank merriwell and jack diamond were watching will you see winnie lee softly exclaimed merriwell she is nearly exploding with laughter she cant hold it it will be a miracle if thornton does not tumble all the others are laughing said jack they had to get away when thornton was introduced he will be crazy when he finds out how he has been fooled frank was laughing oh yes hell tear his hair the story is bound to circulate dont give him too much time with griswold before you get in your work and challenge him horner is in the game and he has agreed to help it along thornton will murder horner it will be remarkable if they do not suddenly cease to room together have you brought the pistols you bet everything is ready willis paulding must be involved we must soak him as well as thornton there go thornton and his mash toward the cozy corner you must intrude before it becomes too warm for griswold or he is liable to give the whole snap away in the meantime thornton had expressed his delight at meeting his charmer again and had led her away to the very cozy corner in which he had seen her chatting so vivaciously with jack diamond once in the corner the girl ensconced herself in the shadow of the portiиres and for the first time the fan dropped from her face this is charming declared thornton in his most fascinating manner ever since i first saw you i have dreamed of an occasion like this miss darling the girl giggled oh you are such a flatterer mr thornton she returned leaning toward him not at all declared tom as apparently by accident his hand fell on hers and remained there i am telling you the truth since that hour when fate led you to my room i have thought of you almost constantly by day and i have dreamed of you at night your face has been before my eyes continually her head was bowed so he could not see her eyes he felt her hand quiver in his clasp oh i am not doing a thing was his mental exclamation she cant resist me he grew bolder with amazing rapidity he seemed to fancy that he could do so with this unsophisticated country girl without being called down miss darling he murmured leaning yet nearer to her and holding her hand with both of his own do you believe in love at first sight she giggled again why i dont know she confessed i do declared tom i did not till i met you but since that delightful moment i have oh rot the girl seemed to say eh exclaimed thornton in astonishment what did you say i said i think not was the laughing answer my cousin has told me all about college fellows and how they pretend to be all broken up over a girl but are giving her the dead jolly all the time tom gasped for the girl rattled off slang as if thoroughly familiar with it but this dampened thorntons ardor for no more than a moment i never give any one a jolly miss darling he declared trying to appear sincere miss darling he murmured what a sweet name and it suits you so well do you think so laughed the girl i do i do palpitated thornton it will be a lucky fellow who can call you his darling if i might mr thornton you are presuming this is too much then jack diamond suddenly appeared and asked did you call for aid miss darling i was about to do so declared the girl mr thornton has been very presuming and forward then mr thornton shall answer to me came sternly from jacks lips if he is not a coward he will come outside tom turned pale and stammered he felt like refusing to go outside but he feared the girl would think him a coward then he looked around and his eyes fell on willis paulding yes i will go out with you he said miss darling seemed to be overcome with fear dont kill him jack she whispered so she addressed diamond as jack that fired thornton till he longed to strangle the virginian lead on he exclaimed i will follow they left the room thornton calling to willis who followed them wonderingly diamond had made a signal to merriwell and frank was not far behind diamond led the way to the garden it was a moonlight night and seemed almost as light as day mr thornton said diamond sternly you have grossly insulted a young lady friend of mine it is my duty to protect her i challenge you to fight me the weapons to be pistols the place here and the time now your answer sir your answer thornton turned pale and hesitated he knew nothing of dueling and therefore did not know that being the challenged party it was his privilege to name the weapons the time and the place in a moment he found tad horner at his elbow where tad had come from and how he happened to be there tom could not conceive but tad was on hand and he whispered take him up old man take him up he is a regular fireeater in his mind he thinks you will squeal if he finds you will fight he is sure to back out he hasnt any real nerve if he does fight ill fix it all right for i will see that the pistols are loaded with blank cartridges after the first shot i will demand that the duel cease thus you will get the reputation of having fought a duel without incurring any danger to yourself thornton was pleased with the scheme he wished to be considered a daredevil sort of fellow and he felt that it would give him a great reputation if he fought a real duel sir he said turning to diamond i accept your challenge and i shall do my best to shoot you through the heart five minutes later came the question gentlemen are you ready all ready answered both diamond and thornton i will count three and then give the word said frank merriwell distinctly one despite himself willis paulding felt his flesh creep and heard his teeth chatter thornton was shaking even though he had been assured by tad horner that there were no bullets in the pistols diamond was cool as an iceberg the bright moonlight seemed to show a look of deadly determination on his face confound him thought thornton quaking hed as lief fight a duel as eat hang those southerners they do not know what it is to be afraid two counted merriwell the duelists raised their weapons and seemed to take careful aim three fire at that instant there was a scream and a female figure sprang out from the shadows and rushed before jack just as thornton pulled the trigger there was a single report and the female figure dropped to the ground although diamond tried to catch her in his arms thornton the smoking pistol in his hand stood staring as if turned to stone good gracious gasped willis paulding you have shot somebody thornton deah boy there must have been some mistake said tad horner it seems that there was a bullet in your pistol tom thornton hurried forward and looked down at the fallen girl whose eyes were closed and whose face seemed ghastly pale in the white moonlight it is miss darling came hoarsely from tom i have killed her dont let the murderer escape cried diamond sternly seize him and his second they are both guilty excuse me fluttered willis paulding i think i will go right away dont yer now then he took to his heels and ran as if pursued by a hundred officers of the law thornton was scarcely less terrified and he slipped away into the shadows while the others were gathered around the fallen girl when both willis and tom were gone the girl suddenly sat up and burst into a peal of boyish laughter there cried the voice of danny griswold didnt i do that all right i wouldnt be surprised if thorntons hair turned gray but im going to get out of this rig as soon as possible these corsets are killing me i cant get a full breath you little rascal laughed frank merriwell as he gave griswold a shake you are a born actor and you have given tom thornton a shock that he will not get over for some time to say nothing of willis paulding if it cures thornton of bragging about his mashes ill be satisfied said tad horner but im afraid hell never forgive me ill have to make a hustle and find him before he does something desperate ill tell him miss darling simply fainted and was not injured at all goodnight fellows see you later then he hastened away well jack said frank addressing diamond it strikes me that you and i are more than square with mr flemming and mr thornton i think that is right admitted the virginian with a grim smile chapter xvii pure grit all other college sports seem to grow dim in comparison with the great spring race it is the crowning athletic event of the season the vast gathering of people at new london occurs but once a year and the only event to be compared with it is the annual football game in new york new london for a week before the race is filled with old grads fathers of yale men who are interested in boating college lads mothers of students sisters and sweethearts at eastern point the fort griswold house is thronged with persons of this sort the pequod is overflowing on the broad piazzas old classmates meet and talk over former victories and defeats there they watch the thronging craft upon the river every one talks boating whether he knows anything about it or not willie off the yacht is there togged in flannels and making a desperate struggle to roll in his gait for a week at least he is a waterman with the salt flavor in everything he says or does and the girls the girls they too dress in flannels and yachting caps and they try to talk knowingly about strokes oars and the crew but they are charming every one of them yale and harvards quarters are on the left bank near gales ferry many of the old oars are permitted to visit the crew the great coachers are there they are regarded with awe and respect for surely they know everything there is to know about racing the race comes off at five in the afternoon by midday the town is full and every train brings fresh throngs of laughing girls and boisterous students all are decorated with the blue or the crimson flags are everywhere and there are horns in abundance at the docks the great sound steamers are moored and they are packed with sightseers there are numberless yachts on the river all decorated with gay colors and thronged with gay parties within the boathouse preparations were being made for the race collingwood was giving final instructions to his men bastow an old coach was surveying each and every one in the most critical manner possible they were handsome fellows these men of the crew their flesh was brown and firm and their eyes were bright they had broad backs and powerful shoulders collingwood looked troubled it was evident there was something on his mind fred flemming in a new spring suit is talking with popkay the little cox some wonder that flemming who had been dropped for merriwell should be there among the spectators on a certain yacht are tom thornton and willis paulding they are watching for the crew to appear and as they watch thornton says something that betrays a knowledge of flemmings presence in the boathouse ill go you two to one that flem rows after all he declares do you dare take me paulding by the way you say that i should think you were betting on a sure thing dont yer now drawled willis i am asserted tom i have it straight that merriwell is not in trim and will be laid off flemming was called to quarters at the last moment itll be a corker on merriwell if he is not allowed to row by jawve yes it will give me no end of satisfaction that fellow put up the grace darling job on me and diamond helped him to carry it out i have been a guy for the whole college ever since danny griswold told down at moreys how he fooled me some day ill wring that little rats neck they never could have worked the game if horner hadnt helped them of course not but i have cut clear of horner we have separated and i never give the fellow a look when we meet like the other fools he is stuck on merriwell and he thought he was doing something cunning when he helped them work the horse on me if merriwell doesnt row youll have a chance to get back at them you can say you knew it all the time old chappie oh he wont row today and ill rub it in when i get the opportunity within the boathouse at this very moment bob collingwood was saying to frank merriwell you cannot row in the race today merriwell you are out of condition frank turned pale if you say i cant row that settles it he said huskily but i think you are making a mistake i can row and ill prove it if you will give me the chance you shall have no cause to complain of me but i know you are not fit to pull an oar you have tried to conceal it from me but i know you have a felon on your hand am i right you are right calmly admitted frank but give me a chance and i will row for all there is in me even if it takes my arm off at the shoulder collingwood looked into merriwells eyes and what he saw there caused him to say all right my boy you shall row if we lose by it if we lose the race it will not be my fault returned merriwell the harvard cheer broke from a thousand throats as the harvard crew came down the stream and arrived first at the start yale followed almost immediately and two students who were on a trim little yacht craned their necks and glared at the men in the boat something like a groan escaped the lips of tom thornton and willis paulding declared i dont see flemming but merriwell is there yes grates tom he has managed to keep his place somehow well that settles it harvard will win orders were shouted and then it was seen that both crews were set the men their brown backs gleaming in the afternoon sunshine were reaching forward at arms length ready for the first stroke a voice was heard commanding them to make ready then came the cry go there was a pistol shot and both boats darted forward the fourmile race to the railway bridge piers of new london had begun in an instant the great crowd set up a wild cheering and colors fluttered everywhere away went the boats side by side harvards style of rowing had changed completely from that of the previous year when her boat had jumped at every stroke now her crew bent with a long sweep that sent the boat through the water with a steady motion yale used a shorter and more snappy stroke the men seemed to have more life at the start but it was the kind of a stroke that was sure to pump away their energy to a great extent in a long race but collingwood was crafty he knew that it would be an easy thing to take the life out of his men by steep work at the beginning and he doubted if the advantage thus gained could be held to a certain extent he regulated yales speed by that of its rival in his heart collingwood feared harvards new style of rowing he was not willing to acknowledge that anything english could be superior to anything american and yet he remembered how the freshmen of umptyeight coached by merriwell had adopted something like the oxford stroke and had won the race from the sophomores at lake saltonstall he also remembered merriwells hand and he feared the fellow must give out before the finish if yale could hold her own till near the end collingwood hoped to win by a spurt outside of merriwell he felt that the crew was in perfect condition he was sure the men were superior to those in the harvard boat harvard begins to gain that strong steady stroke is telling it looks as if the crimson lads were going to pull away from the blue with ease collingwood does not allow himself to get excited in the least he keeps his men steadily at work husbanding their strength as far as possible rah rah rah harvard harvard roared the crowd frank merriwell was working perfectly with the rest and no one could imagine from his appearance that every stroke seemed to drive a keen knife from his wrist to his elbow his face was very pale but that was all at the end of the first mile harvard was two lengths in advance and seemed to be gaining still yale worked steadily showing no signs of excitement or alarm the crowds on the yachts were waving hats and handkerchiefs and flags they cheered and yelled and hooted like human beings gone mad it was a scene of the wildest excitement it had become plain to all despite the fact that harvard had a lead that the race was to be a stern one yale was out to win if such a thing lay in the wood when the second mile was passed harvard was still another length in advance but yale was beginning to work up steadily forcing harvard to a more desperate struggle to hold her advantage when the two and a half mile flag was passed it was seen that yale had begun to creep up still she was not dangerous her friends were encouraged however and the sound all yale men love the yale yell could be heard above the roaring of the crowd that sound seemed to put fresh life and heart into the yale crew at the beginning of the last mile harvard was scarcely two lengths in advance it was a wonderful race the excitement was at the highest pitch the harvard crew although it had started out so beautifully had not the stamina to endure the strain no was pulling out of the boat while no showed signs of distress yale begins to spurt her men are working like machinery no one could dream that one of them was suffering the tortures of a being on the rack and still such was the truth a hundred times it seemed to frank merriwell that he must give out a hundred times he set his teeth and vowed that he would die before he would weaken no one could know the almost superhuman courage and fortitude which enabled him to keep up and continue his work in the proper manner those who watched the crew closely fancied that he worked with the utmost ease for all of the long pull collingwood had forgotten merriwells felon he was reckoning on the final spurt to bring old eli to the front harder and harder he worked his men now the uproar along the river was deafening the prow of the yale boat was at harvards stern and then yale began to creep along by harvards side no of the harvard crew reeled on his seat then he braced up and went at it again but he was not in stroke the faces of both crews were set they were like gladiators battling for their very lives in the yale boat was one who seemed to be growing blind and numb in his heart he was praying for strength as earnestly as he would have prayed for the salvation of his soul only a few moments more he must hold out the boats were side by side and the excitement was simply indescribable such a finish was unprecedented it was a race to be remembered for all years to come to be spoken of with pride and discussed with wonder then came the moment when collingwood drove his men for all there was in them he was pitiless and yale shot into the lead the line was crossed then cannons boomed and whistles shrieked but in the yale boat was one whose ears were deaf to all this tumult of sound frank merriwell had fallen in the bottom of the boat in a dead faint but yale yale had won chapter xviii after the boat race breka co ax co ax co ax breka co ax co ax co ax o up o up paraboleau yale yale yale rah rah rah yale imagine a thousand fulllunged hearty healthy american lads shouting this cry in unison it was a sound never to be forgotten by those who heard it the victorious blue fluttered everywhere harvard had made a gallant fight and it had been nobodys race almost to the finish the yale crew proved superior but it won purely by brawn and stamina old oars confessed that up to the last half mile harvard had shown better coaching and had seemed to establish the superiority of the oxford oar and stroke over american methods but old eli had seemed to feel that it would be a lasting disgrace to be vanquished by anything about which there was an english flavor the spirit of bunker hill and was aroused and the defenders of the blue were willing to die in the struggle if such a sacrifice could bring victory it was not the first time that pure grit had won against odds as the yale boat crossed the line frank lay deaf to all the tumult of applause his eyes closed but still with his pale face set in a look of mingled pain and unyielding determination its merriwell exclaimed bob collingwood i had forgotten him his words were drowned by the roaring of the excited thousands and the shrieking of the whistles the prow of the yale boat was turned toward the bank it was necessary to avoid the craft that came rushing about on every side but the shore was soon reached hold her steady cried collingwood somebody dash water into merriwells face the command was obeyed and in a moment frank opened his eyes it was at the moment when the yale cheer was pealing from a thousand throats and the look of pain on merriwells face changed to one of satisfaction and joy did we win he huskily asked collingwood nodded his flushed face beaming pride in his big blue eyes you bet he answered its hard to beat old eli i am satisfied gasped merriwell his eyes drooped and he seemed on the verge of going off into another swoon throw more water on him pitilessly directed collingwood it was done and frank started up gasping here here exclaimed a man on the bank give him a pull at this it will fix him all right he stooped down and held out a flask what is it asked frank its the best brandy money can buy was the answer it was passed to frank but he pushed it away shaking his head i never touch liquor he declared i do not want it but it will not hurt you now it will do you good declared the man who owned the flask i can get along without it but i shall be offended if you do not take it frank looked sharply at the man he saw a suntanned individual who wore a widebrimmed hat and was dressed in clothes which were worn and appeared to have been made for service rather than for fit and elegance there was something piercing about the mans dark eyes and something about the beardless face that impressed it upon the boys memory there was a small purple scar on the mans chin and frank noted this although he might have overlooked it easily in that hasty glance then you will have to be offended sir said frank firmly i do not wish to appear rude but i never drink under any circumstances and i will not begin now the man drew back after the flask was returned to him the last look he gave the boy was peculiar as frank could not tell whether it was one of satisfaction or anger in a moment this man was forgotten the boat slipped out to the clyde the little steam yacht that was to take the victorious crew back to quarters the exhausted rowers were lifted on board amid renewed cheering and the trip up the river began it was a triumphant procession all along the line the clyde which was decorated with blue was received with cheers and shrieking whistles men waved hats and flags pretty girls fluttered handkerchiefs and pennants squads of students gave the yale cheer at intervals and two scores of boats crowded with students and friends accompanied the boat that carried the victorious crew the jubilant yale men sang songs of victory and cheered till their throats ached and they were hoarse on board the clyde were jack diamond and harry rattleton when merriwell was lifted to the deck he found himself clasped in harrys arms and the dear fellow laughed and cried as he hugged his roommate to his breast i never dought youd threw it i mean i never thought youd do it cried harry brokenly i thought that hand would knock you out sure how could you do it merry old boy it must have been awful i saw you keel over when the line was crossed but you never havered a ware wavered a hair till the race was over frank smiled a bit a fellow can do almost anything if he sets his determination on it he said but i came near not having the opportunity to try how was that collingwood found out about my hand i am afraid you said something about it harry not a word save to diamond and not to him till after the race began well coll found it out some way and he came near laying me off for flemming who was on hand and now i understand a few things i heard this morning broke in diamond emery and parker were offering to bet that flemming would row today how much did you fake em tor i mean take em for cried harry i didnt know but some of the men had given out or something so i did not take them at all i did not imagine for a moment that they thought flemming was going to row in merrys place collingwood came up he was bundled from his ears to his heels merriwell was in a sweater and coat hows your hand old man asked bob his eyes gleaming oh it is giving me a jolly time grinned frank grimly it isnt doing a thing mr merriwell said collingwood earnestly i want to tell you frankly that today you made the greatest display of pure grit that it has ever been my fortune to witness i did not believe it possible you could hold out through the race with that hand and i meant to lay you off for flemming although i regretted doing so as he has not been working with us of late and i felt that the change would weaken the crew when you told me square and straight that it would be no fault of yours if the race were lost i decided to keep you after that i felt that i was making an error but it was too late to change now i know it was no error and i wish to say that i am sure you aided materially by your splendid work to win others of the crew came up merriwell was surrounded by friends and admirers diamond whispered in his ear you should be happy old man for you have triumphed over your enemies and the story of your heroic work will be known to all yale by monday then collingwood led frank below for a rub down chapter xix the yale spirit at the boathouse there was a scene of riotous jollification it was impossible to exclude the overjoyed friends of the crew they crowded in and expressed their unbounded delight in almost every imaginable manner there was a popping of corks and fizz began to flow freely now that the great race was over the crew were no longer in training and they were allowed to drink as much of the wine as they liked it was forced upon them from all sides merriwell was almost mobbed by the fellows who were determined that he should drink champagne with them you cant refuse now old man shouted charlie creighton i saw it all and no one suspected there was anything the matter with you just to think that you rowed the race with a felon on your hand it is marvelous and i won a cool five hundred on old eli whoop if you refuse to take a drink of champagne with me ill call you out and shoot you through the liver pad he was wildly waving a bottle of mumms about his head as he made this excited speech but merriwell did refuse and he did it with a firmness that showed them all that he could not be induced to drink queer chap that merriwell commented charlie creighton addressing his chum paul hamilton never knew him very well but ive seen enough of him to know hes the clean white stuff even if he is a temperance crank in the year and a half that he has been here said hamilton he has made a greater record in athletics than any other man ever made in twice that time and think of his rowing the race today with that hand and then fainting the moment he knew the line was crossed and yale had won i tell you creighton that fellow is all sand every bit of him thats what he is nodded creighton he is running over with the true yale spirit i tell you my boy old yale bears mighty men come lets kill this bottle of fizz which i got off the ice expressly for merriwell confound him then they lost little time in opening the bottle and swallowing its sparkling contents bob collingwood was overwhelmed with congratulations he said very little before the crowd but to a particular friend he declared it is one of the marvels of the year that we won today harvard outrowed us for fully threequarters of the course and she would have finished in the lead if her crew had been as stocky as ours their stroke is easier on a man than ours then you acknowledge at last that the oxford stroke is superior to the american eagerly questioned the friend i have acknowledged nothing yet but i fear ill be forced to the jubilant fellows were making the boathouse ring with songs of victory about twenty flushed lads were roaring how can they ever beat us how can they beat old yale we down em when they meet us you bet we never fail weve got em so they fear us in every contest fair and soon theyll not come near us because they will not dare chorus then give us a cheer for old eli a cheer for our gallant crew she has won and she wins forever with her noble boys in blue poor harvard falls before us she is not in the game so swell the merry chorus old elis won again it was a gallant battle my boys who wear the blue but you they cannot rattle no matter what they do there were other songs and in the midst of all this rejoicing a crowd of pretty girls accompanied by chaperons came into the boathouse among them was winnie lee who lost no time in finding frank and congratulating him i knew you would win frank i knew you would she exclaimed her bright eyes sparkling why you are talking as if i rowed the whole race he said laughing and blushing well im sure theyd never won without you she declared thats like a girl of course yale would have won anyhow how can they beat us at this moment collingwood came up accompanied by a gentleman who carried a case in his hand here merry old boy cried the captain of the crew ive brought a doctor to look after that hand of yours what is the matter with your hand asked winnie anxiously oh nothing much assured frank carelessly nothing much only there is a bad felon on it said collingwood a felon and you rowed with a felon on your hand oh frank winnie looked at him with added admiration showing in her eyes thats what he did nodded collingwood it was the greatest display of grit ive ever seen do you wonder he flopped over in a dead faint when we crossed the line at the finish the doctor looked at franks hand which was now badly inflamed after a thorough examination the physician glanced up at frank and observed if you were able to row with this hand i rather think youd endure burning at the stake by a band of indians without uttering a murmur you dear fellow cried winnie with girlish enthusiasm i feel just like giving you a good hug then frank blushed more than ever the doctor opened his case and proceeded to dress merriwells hand while the physician was thus employed frank was somewhat surprised to observe at a little distance the same man who had offered him a drink of brandy as he was recovering from his swoon at the close of the race this man was watching the boy in a strange manner but the moment he saw he was observed he quickly turned away franks curiosity was aroused i wonder who he is and what he wants here thought the boy how did he get in here anyway he seems to take a remarkable interest in me and i cant say that i like it the man walked away and mingled with the throng in a short time franks hand was cared for and the doctor gave directions for future treatment of the felon it is bound to trouble you for some time and you will find it very painful he said after what you have done today i doubt if you sleep much tonight i dont care if i do not sleep for a week so long as yale won declared the boy you have the true yale spirit said the doctor approvingly yale men carry that unconquerable spirit out into the world and that is why old eli turns out so many successful men in all walks of life i think there is no fear as to your future my boy thank you sir said merriwell simply chapter xx spurning a bribe i would like to speak with you frank felt a touch on his shoulder and the words sounded in his ear he turned quickly and found himself face to face with the mysterious stranger it happened that at that moment they were alone nearly all the throng having gathered about three fellows who with banjo mandolin and zither were making some lively music what do you want asked frank rather suspiciously the man beckoned for him to come aside i have something i wish to say to you and i do not care to be overheard by others he declared well i wonder what sort of a snap this is thought merriwell he hesitated a moment and then curiosity to know what the stranger had to say overcame him and he followed the man to a corner of the room the stranger was very mysterious in his manner you are a likely sort of youngster he said in a rather noncommittal way is that what you wish to tell me asked frank sharply steady young colt dont be in too much of a hurry it doesnt pay to be in a hurry none whatever franks impatience increased he did not like the strangers manner for there was something crafty and insinuating about it if any one were watching us hed be sure to think we were putting up some sort of a crooked game thought merriwell my time is valuable he said aloud then you cant make more out of it than you can by spending it gabbling with the crowd the mans manner was offensive but franks curiosity caused him to hold himself in check and listen to what the stranger should say you are interested in other sports besides rowing i reckon said the unknown inquiringly yes baseball yes i have heard that you pitch on the varsity nine that is right the man assumed a more cautious air than ever and lowered his voice still more i allow that the man who pitches can throw a game if he wants to franks dislike for the stranger increased rapidly he can throw a game if he is crooked and dirty enough to do such a mean thing came with spirit from the lad that is putting it a heap rough deprecatingly declared the man every galoot is out for the dust it is the way of the old world as you will find before you have hoofed it much farther along the trail of life well what are you driving at yale won the race today and i reckon shes got glory enough to last her a while go on the last ball game of the series between yale and harvard comes off next week it does yale has won one and harvard one that is right yale stands a right good chance of winning the deciding game she is pretty sure of winning and i have a pot of dust on harvard i can get odds that yale will win so i can stake more money frank fancied that he saw the strangers game and he felt his anger rising rapidly but with a great effort he held himself in control and pretended that he did not understand the boy looked the man over from head to heels he was making a study of the unknown already he had decided by the mans appearance and language that he was a westerner or wished to be considered such frank was not absolutely certain that the fellow was not masquerading as a man from the west as merriwell remained silent after the strangers last statement he went on if there is any way of knowing as how harvard will win i can stake my rocks on her and pull off a good thing still frank was silent you can see that plain enough cant you youngster demanded the man seeming to grow impatient and restless before the lads steady piercing gaze any one should be able to see that was the cold answer then all ive got to do in order to make a stake is to fix it so that harvard is dead sure of winning how can you fix it i dont see but one way how is that make it worth something to the yale team to throw the game to harvard i can afford to do that i reckon but ive got to find the right man to do the trick franks jaws seemed to grow square and hard and there was a dangerous fire in his eyes the stranger did not appear to discern this however for he went on it rather strikes me that the pitcher has the best chance to do the little turn i want done and thats why ive come to you now dont go off halfcocked hold hard and hear me chirp every young fellow at college needs money and they need a right good bit of it too i dont allow that you are any exception now i reckon i can show you how you can make a smart bit of a pile and do it dead easy nobody but you and me will ever know you did it at all and there isnt any danger that well preach about it none whatever make a square statement as to what you want commanded frank finding it difficult to keep his voice from quivering and feeling that his cheeks were burning with the angry blood that had surged into them thats what ill do youngster if you will pitch that game so harvard will win ill give you a thousand dollars in cold cash now i reckon you understand me i think i do came icily from frank you want me to sell the game for a thousand dollars you put a small price on my honor sir a small price you talk as if a thousand were nothing hang me if i ever saw a youngster of your caliber perhaps you think im fooling perhaps you think i wont pay look here ill make it two thousand dollars and ill give you a thousand in advance that is a square deal as you must allow then he took a huge roll of bank notes from his pocket some were new bills while some were worn and soiled he rapidly counted off a thousand dollars in ten twenty fifty and one hundred dollar bills this money he thrust into merriwells hands saying there you have it and that binds the bargain between us ill give you the other thousand directly harvard wins and i collect my wagers im a man of my word i reckon it is settled frank looked at the money making sure it was genuine he quickly satisfied himself on that point it was all right never before had such a bribe been offered merriwell and for some seconds he stood with the money in his unbandaged hand feeling somewhat dazed and doubtful put it out of sight whispered the stranger dont let em see you have it give me your promise that you will throw the game to harvard i shall not pitch that game said frank no no sir why not my hand will not be in condition as you should know true it is my left hand but ill not be able to bat with it even if i could pitch but you would throw the game if you could pitch no cried merriwell fiercely letting his outraged indignation flame forth what do you take me for i am no sneak and traitor and not for ten thousand dollars not for a hundred thousand dollars not to save my very life would i do such a dastardly thing you have made a mistake in your man take back your dirty money i would not touch a dollar of it for the world it would contaminate me then he flung the roll of bills straight into the face of the astonished man as the man stooped to pick up the money which had fallen at his feet frank caught him by the collar with his well hand yanked him up and started him on a run for an open window clinging to the money the stranger uttered a protest at such rude treatment but he was unable to turn about or break away although he tried to do so headlong through the window frank pitched the fellow giving him a powerful kick to help him along there was a cry of pain and rage and the man disappeared this act of franks had been noted by the others within the boathouse and it created no little wonder and excitement harry rattleton came running up spluttering hello frank muts the whatter i mean whats the matter oh nothing in particular answered merriwell quietly i simply fired a scoundrel thats all what was he up to old man demanded bob collingwood in a tone that indicated that he was sorry not to have taken a hand in the little fracas did he try to do you no but he is trying to do yale how is that frank explained briefly telling of the bribe offered by the mysterious stranger a circle of lads had gathered about merriwell and they listened with rising anger to his words cries of astonishment and rage broke from their lips when frank told of the truly astonishing bribe which the unknown had offered my only regret concluded frank was that i did not have two good hands with which to handle the rascal and my regret is that i was not there to handle him for you cried jack diamond i wonder how the fellow got in here exclaimed collingwood ill have to inquire into that he cant be far away cried one of the angry lads lets get out and nab him come on come on was the general cry and there was a rush for the door but the unknown had not lingered in the vicinity of the boathouse he was not found which made it plain that he had taken to his heels as soon as he landed outside the window too bad growled collingwood a good soak in the river is what hed got if wed caught him chapter xxi on the special train some of the lads felt like staying in new london and making a night of it but this was strictly against rules and those who did so took a desperate chance of getting into trouble by it after the race there was a general rush for the trains and those bound west over the n y n h h were crowded later on there was a special train for the yale crew and their friends as this train was not exclusive and it was generally known that it would be run large numbers of students waited for it and it was quite as crowded as the trains which had preceded it the car containing the victorious crew was a scene of wild merrymaking the eight muscular lads who had pulled off another victory for old eli were gathered in the middle of the car and surrounded by admiring friends who cheered and sang and smashed one anothers hats and played the very old nick with one another beer wine and whiskey had been brought on board the train and it was urged upon the crew danny griswold was in his glory about half the time he was perched upon the shoulders of the crowd and it was observable that he did not refuse anything that was offered him in the way of a liquid still for all that he drank so much and mixed his drinks he did not seem to get any worse off than he had been when the train started from new london charlie creighton climbed upon the backs of two seats and made a speech hark ye noble sons of old eli he began with a spreadeagle gesture that came near causing him to lose his balance and fall off headlong this is the great day when we can get up on our hind legs and make the welkin ring with war whoops of victory today we stand with one foot on princetons neck and the heel of the other foot gouging into harvards back they have bitten the dust before us oh mighty warriors in blue they have fallen like autumn leaves before a gale we have carried our colors on to victory in many a mad scrimmage but never have we done a better job than we did this day during the greater part of the race it looked as if harvard would take our scalps we who watched the awful struggle felt our blood turn cold with fear then when we looked upon the calm face of our captain cheers we took heart and hoped like clockwork he was handling his men and his calm confidence gave them heart they saw he did not fear the result and when he began to drive them for the final spurt every one of that noble band responded like the greatest of heroes more cheers then it was that yale began to crowd harvard then it was that the harvard crew showed how the pressure was telling on them then it was that the backers of old eli who were watching the struggle became confident that we were still in it and would pull off the race after all then old yale crept into the lead the spurt being admirably timed so that our boat crossed the line just in time to make old eli again the winner and to whom is honor due for this you know collingwood collingwood roared the jubilant crowd in the car hurrah for dear old bob then they cheered and cheered and then they called for a speech from dear old bob collingwood was lifted to his feet he protested that he could not make a speech but they would not be satisfied till he had said something and so he cried well boys we did them and we did them good this was better than a long speech and it produced the most unbounded enthusiasm when the excitement had abated somewhat collingwood arose again and motioned for silence in a moment he was receiving the full attention of every one every man on the crew deserves praise began bob hooray for the croll hew i mean the whole crew shouted harry rattleton smashing his new straw hat over bandy robinsons head but there is one who deserves especial commendation collingwood added there was a breathless silence and all eyes were turned on frank merriwell who flushed beneath this sudden attention there was one man on the crew who was not in condition to row in the race today and i came very near letting him out now i am glad i did not for although he had a bad felon on his left hand there was no man of the crew who pulled a stiffer stroke or showed more lasting powers till the finish was reached he fainted then it is true but it was because of the frightful pain in his hand and arm and i wish you to remember that he did not faint till the victory was won merriwell rah rah rah not even bob collingwood himself received a greater ovation frank was seized he was lifted aloft he was perched on the shoulders of his friends and then there was a general howl for a speech frank felt himself thrill from his hair to his toes his eyes were dimmed with moisture even though he laughed in his bosom there was a choking sensation of gratitude and love for his comrades and the admiring throng around him he forgot that he had a single foe at yale that he had a foe in all the wide world boys he said somewhat brokenly i did my best for dear old yale that is all that was all he said it was enough it seemed to touch a chord in every breast and there was a ring of patriotism in the cheering that followed heres to good old yale drink it down heres to good old yale drink it down heres to good old yale shes so hearty and so hale drink it down drink it down down down it seemed that every person in the car joined in singing this song the enthusiasm was running higher and higher in every heart the yale spirit grew deeper and stronger during that ride from new london to new haven the students who were there never forgot that scene never forgot how they thrilled with love for old yale the hardships and struggles of college days were forgotten the triumphs and joys alone were remembered but with it all it is certain that the result of the race had disappointed no harvard man more than it did fred flemming at the last moment he had been overjoyed to learn that merriwell had a bad felon on one of his hands which it seemed must debar him from rowing in the great race flemming had kept himself in condition as far as possible and he lost no time to let collingwood know that he could be called on in case of emergency that he would be called on seemed almost certain for he was notified to be on hand at yales quarters before the time set for the race to begin he had been on hand ready to strip off in a moment and had seen collingwood talking earnestly with merriwell then to his inexpressible astonishment he had been told that merriwell would row after all from that moment flemming hoped and prayed that yale would lose the race he would have given almost anything in his power to give had frank merriwell been unable to row to the finish but merriwell had finished the race and yale had won flemmings friends who had bet that he would row in the race had lost money and they were sore also it was bitter gall for flemming and tom thornton to pretend to rejoice over yales victory but they dared not do otherwise it happened that they waited till the special train left for new haven and they were on that train and in the car which carried the victorious crew occasionally they cheered with the others to keep up appearances but for the most part they remained seated in a corner at one end of the car and talked in low tones how was it that collingwood happened to retain the fellow for all of his hand asked thornton referring to merriwell ask me something easy exclaimed flemming i am sure he intended to fire the fellow but i think merriwell begged to be given a show and collingwood did not have the nerve to chuck him off collingwood must be soft oh i dont know i think that cad merriwell must be a hypnotist by the way he gets around some fellows i dont want to have anything further to do with him oh youve lost your nerve since merriwell and griswold put up that girl job on you and diamond drew you into a bogus duel that was enough to make any fellow lose his nerve rats you may say rats but you dont know how you would have felt if you had been in my place just as the word was given to fire and i pulled trigger griswold dressed as a girl rushed between us i fired and with a frightful shriek he fell then i ran forward and looked at him the moonlight made him look deathly white and i felt sure i had shot him ill never forget the sickening sensation that came over me at that moment the hangmans noose seemed to dangle before my eyes i dropped the pistol and rushed away to my room i think i was stunned for horner found me sitting on a chair and staring blankly at the wall about an hour afterward then he said the girl had not been shot at all but had fainted say flem my boy it is utterly impossible for me to tell the feeling of thankfulness and relief that rushed over me i felt just like getting right down on my knees and thanking providence but i didnt for tad horner was watching me all the time and i saw the laughing devil in his eyes then within two days i found myself the guy of the whole college and finally it all came out that grace darling was danny griswold in his theatrical rig and i had been played for a blooming guy by merriwell and diamond assisted to a certain extent by horner my own roommate and the only decent thing you ever did about it was to quit horner cold youve never seemed to have sand enough to make an effort to get back at merriwell i decided that merriwell is a bad man to monkey with thats rot its his reputation that frightens you im going to watch my chance to get even with him so am i young man whispered a voice in flemmings ear fred whirled swiftly and saw close at his shoulder a rather roughappearing smoothfaced man who wore a widebrimmed hat and was weathertanned as if by much exposure eh exclaimed the college lad who are you one who has a good reason to dislike that fly chap mr frank merriwell was his answer flemming was suspicious why should you hate merriwell he asked because he kicked me was the fierce reply he kicked you then you are the man he fired out of the boathouse i heard about that little affair i am the man you should have known better than to try to bribe merriwell to throw any sort of game or race to harvard that chap is so honest that he has wings sprouting under his clothes he said you pushed a thousand dollars at him i did i put it into his hand and he flung it into your face yes curse him then he threw me out of the window well you do seem to have a reason for disliking him what would you do to him if you got a good chance ask me what i wouldnt do all i want is the chance can you keep your mouth closed you bet your dust i never peach then you may be just the kind of a man i am looking for i want somebody with nerve the trouble with the fellows in college who hate merriwell is that they do not dare butt up against him they are afraid of him well im not afraid of any man living let alone a mere boy hes nothing but a tenderfoot waugh hear them shouting over him muttered thornton see they have lifted him on their shoulders one would think he alone won the race today then frank was heard to make the brief speech which elicited such hearty applause it is sickening growled flemming pale with jealous rage it is nodded the stranger it makes me want to give him back the kick he gave me if you stick to me i promise you that you shall have a good opportunity said flemming you may bet your rocks that ill tie to you pard assured the unknown ill help you to get square and you can help me frank merriwell will have to keep his eyes open if he dodges us both chapter xxii the fight on the train it happened that as he was perched on the shoulders of his friends and admirers frank merriwell saw flemming and thornton in the further end of the car merriwell would not have given his enemies more than a passing glance but it occurred that he saw and recognized the man who was talking to flemming it is the scoundrel who tried to bribe me muttered frank angrily and he is with flemming and thornton i fancy i smell a mouse then he forced his friends to put him down and the moment he was on his feet he hastened along the aisle toward the end of the car having called diamond to follow him the plotters saw frank coming and the expression on his face told them that there was a storm brewing by jove fluttered thornton in alarm he looks as if he means to thump somebody although he did not show it flemming was not a little alarmed by merriwells angry appearance several of the students gathered about the crew saw there was something in the wind and they followed merriwell and diamond down the crowded aisle halting within a short distance of his enemies frank pointed straight at the stranger and cried there he is take a good look at him boys that is the creature who tried to bribe me to throw the ball game to harvard his words rang through the car and were heard by every one the uproar and excitement that followed was quite unexpected by frank a wild shout of anger broke from the college lads and there was a scramble for that end of the car mob the wretch thump him choke him dont let him get away these cries broke from the crowd of lads who strove in mad haste to get at the stranger great christopher gasped tom thornton in terror im going to get out of this its altogether too hot for me then he tried to slip away flemming did not know what to do the manner of the angry lads was alarming and he saw no reason why he should defend a man who was quite unknown to him but the stranger did not wait to be defended with a wild shout that was like the war whoop of an indian he leaped up and lunged straight into the crowd striking out right and left in less than ten seconds a general fight was taking place in that end of the car jack diamond who had a grudge against tom thornton collared tom as he was trying to slip away hold on cried the virginian you cant play the sneak in that way i saw you talking with that scoundrel did you and flemming set him on to bribe merriwell i dont know anything about it protested tom struggling let go diamond well not in a hurry returned jack i dont know where the money came from but i believe you and flemming tried to ruin merriwell by bribing him to throw a game and then exposing him if that was the trick you fooled yourselves frank merriwell is not that kind of a fellow with a fierce exclamation thornton struck savagely at jacks face but diamond dodged the blow oh you will will you he cried and then he gave thornton a terrible thump between the eyes in another moment they were at it fiercely although flemming was a big fellow with a reputation as a bully harry rattleton had not hesitated to lay hands on him youre a chine fap i mean a fine chap shouted harry so you are concerned in this attempted bribery get out snarled flemming ill break your nose break it invited rattleton ill try to do a little something while you are about it flemming waited to say not another word but quick as a flash he did strike harry a heavy blow on the jaw rattleton was staggered but he held on to flemming a moment later both were swept down by the rush of the crowd it was something of a blind fight and it waged with great fierceness although in an aimless manner for some moments several of the windows in the car were broken bob collingwood waded into the midst of the struggling mass of human beings scattering them with his powerful arms and crying here stop this senseless scrapping where is the fellow who tried to bribe merriwell where indeed all looked around for him but he was gone in some manner he had made his escape in the midst of the tumult he must be on the train cried frank he cant escape from the train till it stops here i have his coat he left it in my hands when the crowd tore us apart merriwell held up the garment he must be in the car back of this declared collingwood i want to see him i want to get a fair look at his face id like to do something else to his face shouted another student think of any one offering a yale pitcher money to throw a game to harvard this brought a mad howl from the angry students rattleton and flemming had been torn apart during the struggle and thornton and diamond were separated but not until jack had thumped the fellow he disliked and done it several times both flemming and thornton were forgotten the excited students rushed out by the open door and crowded into the rear car which was the only one on the train to which the unknown man could have escaped where is he was the hoarse shout that went up as the angry boys packed into the car they looked desperate and dangerous as if they were thirsting for human blood at the farther end of the car a man in his shirtsleeves crouched and muttered well derned if i expected to kick up this sort of a rumpus ive seen all kinds of mobs but i will allow that this reminds me of a regular judge lynch crowd and no mistake never judged a lot of youngsters would get stirred up this way any whatever theyre on a regular rampage he kept out of sight as far as possible feeling that it was the most healthy thing to do where is he demanded collingwood who was just ahead of merriwell where is the man who belongs to this coat he must have come in here did a man in his shirt sleeves come in here yes yes replied several what has he been doing doing roared dear old bob flushed with anger why he is the creature that tried to bribe merriwell it seemed that this piece of business was generally known for collingwoods words produced a roar of indignation down at the rear end of the car a young man stood up and shouted this way here he is he cant get away then it seemed that the students all spotted their game at the same moment and there was a fierce scramble for that end of the car the hunted man saw them coming and a desperate look settled on his face id as lief fall into the clutches of a whole tribe of apache indians he gasped theyre after my scalp for sure he leaped to the door and tore it open stop rang out the voice of frank merriwell you cannot escape for you will be killed if you leap from the train the man hesitated one moment he saw the college lads rushing down the aisle and then although the train was making a speed of at least forty miles an hour he descended the steps collingwood and merriwell came out through the open door as they reached the platform they saw the man clinging in the darkness at the foot of the steps he was in a crouching position his hands clasping the iron holds in the gloom his face seemed fully as white as the sleeves of his shirt which fluttered in the breeze for heavens sake dont jump cried frank collingwood tried to grasp the man by the arm as he did so the mysterious man dropped from the steps instantly disappearing in the darkness hes gone gasped frank horrified yes he is gone said collingwood hoarsely thats the end of him for surely he was killed when he struck the ground chapter xxiii seen again for two days frank scanned all the newspapers for an account of the finding of the body of an unknown man somewhere on the line of the n y n h h r r but he looked in vain well that is remarkable merriwell decided i cant understand it if that fellow escaped it is a miracle and if he escaped i believe i shall hear from him again he finished the spring term was drawing to a close but two more events were to transpire before the coming of the long summer vacation there was the final ball game with harvard and then the great intercollegiate athletic tournament at madison square garden in new york the latter affair to be the great college event of the year frank was entered for several of the contests in new york but his hand although improving would not be in condition to allow him to play ball again that season as for the coming vacation his plans were not perfected as yet some of his friends were going to bar harbor some contemplated spending the summer quietly at home some were going abroad for a flying trip and many had expressed themselves as quite undecided as to the manner in which they would pass the summer months frank had boldly proposed a bicycle journey across the continent but all his friends with the exception of diamond had considered the proposition a joke diamond grew enthusiastic over it urging merriwell to carry out the plan even though but two of them should make the jaunt franks plan embraced a party of at least four possibly more what made rattleton believe that merriwell was joking was that frank had soberly asked bruce browning the reputedly laziest man at yale to make one of the party bruce came near fainting with horror at the mere mention of such a thing my dear merriwell he gasped is it possible that you take me for a candidate for a lunatic asylum do you think that i am on the verge of lapsing into complete idiocy or are you simply trying to have a little sport at my expense nothing of the sort my dear fellow i assure you said frank i am in sober earnest about getting up a party to make the trip across the continent and i think it would be a fine thing for you if you were to make one of the company bruce was reclining on a couch in merriwells room at the time lazily puffing away at a cigarette he languidly reached out his hand and felt for franks wrist permit me to examine your pulse old fellow he murmured if you are not trying to work some kind of a horse on me you must be in a bad way ah he said knowingly with his thumb and finger on franks wrist i thought so pulse irregular flutters like an old rag in the wind flesh hot and dry eye changing and unsteady dryness in your throat and general vacancy in your stomach what you need is a tonic and you need it bad you should take whiskey it may be the only thing that will save you from an utter breaking up of the nervous system or premature death the premature death will happen if you try to jolly me any more i shall carry a gun with me constantly hereafter and it will not cost too much of an effort to point it in your direction and pull the trigger frank laughed i know you are almost too lazy to draw your breath he said and i also know that the best thing that could happen to you would be just such an expedition as i have proposed however i suppose it is useless to waste my breath talking to you and so i will drop it but for all of brownings refusal to be one of the party frank did not give up the project of a trip across the continent from ocean to ocean during the summer vacation but almost immediately other matters occupied his attention one night he was spending an evening in town with a jolly party of students the others were drinking beer and ale while merriwell took nothing but ginger ale or bottled soda as they were leaving traegers frank caught a glimpse of the face of a man who seemed to be waiting for them to come out for one moment merriwell stopped as if turned to stone and then with a hoarse shout of recognition he leaped after the man who had slipped away the others followed frank and they soon pursued him around a corner where they found him standing still and staring about in a disappointed manner what is it old man asked paul hamilton why did you give that whoop and then chase yourself around here in such a lively fashion it was not myself i chased declared frank it was quite another party i assure you but he has given me the slip for i can see nothing of him who was it the man who tried to bribe me to throw the last ball game to harvard that fellow exclaimed all the lads excitedly are you sure dead sure asserted frank confidently i saw his face fairly in the light in front of traegers when we came out then he was not killed in the leap from the train cried diamond how did he escape ask me something easy exclaimed frank i never expected to look on that mans face again unless i looked on it as a corpse confound him exploded harry rattleton id like to hake his break i mean break his head what does he want around here frank was silent there was a grim look on his face and it was plain that he had been not a little disturbed by the sight of the mysterious stranger the boys turned toward college discussing the queer actions of the unknown as they walked along one or two of them fully believed the man must be a lunatic that night as frank and harry were preparing for bed the former declared that strange man is about as large a mystery as i ever ran across he is beginning to be a decided nuisance what do you make of him anyway that he is a westerner or wishes to be thought such his language betrays that and he is the last man i could dream would be staking enough money on a game of college baseball to be able to offer a bribe of two thousand dollars to make sure that the game would result in his favor by jove cried rattleton if any other fellow but yourself had told me that a stranger had made them such an offer and had forked over onehalf cash in advance i should have considered him a looming byer no a blooming liar and you would not be to blame for thinking so to me it seems like a dream but i know it actually happened well what is he hanging around new haven for ill give it up unless he hopes to get at heffiner or dad hicks one of whom must pitch the game at springfield hell get used rough if he pushes his dirty dough at either heffiner or hicks cried rattleton i think so nodded frank i believe they are loyal to dear old yale and nothing can buy their honor most yale men are there may be one or two sneaks who would sell out as there are black sheep in every flock i dont believe flemming would be above such a trick oh i dont know i do not wish to think that bad of flemming i know he is my enemy and i believe he hates me so he would do almost anything to injure me but i do not wish to think that a fellow like him even would stoop to such a dastardly trick as to betray old yale you always think every fellow is white till you are convinced to the contrary beyond the shadow of a doubt i had rather believe all men honest and deceive myself in that manner than to suspect everybody and thus think that one honest man was a rogue harry regarded frank in a queer manner slowly shaking his head but saying nothing more for all that they had been friends and roommates for a year and a half rattleton was forced to confess to himself that there still remained many things about merriwell that he could not understand that frank was shrewd harry knew and yet merriwell sometimes seemed to deliberately deceive himself by thinking that certain fellows were honest when he should have known better it seemed the hardest thing in the world for frank to be convinced that any fellow was thoroughly bad even though that person might be an enemy who had endeavored in numerous ways to do him an injury merriwell seems to come out all right in everything thought rattleton but it would not be the luck of any other fellow who dared take the chances he does chapter xxiv two warnings the morning after the evening when frank saw the mysterious stranger in front of traegers he received a warning note through the mail it read as follows be constantly on your guard your enemies are plotting to do you serious injury i shall do what i can to foil them but you had better watch out it was unsigned and the handwriting was cramped and awkward as if the person who wrote it was not accustomed to handle a pen well i wonder what sort of a game this is cried frank in disgust it is a fake pure and simple rattleton was at his side what is it asked harry read that invited frank thrusting the anonymous warning into the ready hands of his friend harry glanced it over and then whistled softly rot he cried anybody can see thats lot on the nevel i mean not on the level but what sort of a game is it questioned frank in perplexity if it was an appointment to meet somebody somewhere or even a warning to stay away from some place i could see something in it but the mere statement that enemies are plotting to injure me doesnt indicate much in this case it seems to indicate that somebody fakes you for a tool no takes you for a fool spluttered rattleton franks face grew scornful that somebody may find out that it is not entirely healthy to try crooked games with me he grimly said i believe i see through the trick what is it then this bogus warning will be followed by another the other will go a little further than this then will come the third which will be the one intended to draw me into some sort of a trap oh the game is too thin harry looked into his roommates face and saw that frank merriwell was aroused at last what are you going to do asked rattleton i am going to have a few words with fred flemming at the first opportunity i have been easy with flemming for i could not believe the fellow all bad even though he had tried to injure me but if he is going to hire a ruffian like this unknown man to try to work my ruin i shall draw the lines on mr flemming he is rich but that will not save him they say he has money to burn i dont care if he is a monte cristo he cannot ride over me with all his money and i do not believe that a scoundrel will be tolerated at yale after his villainy is exposed even though he may be rich and have influential parents and connections what do you think the game is as to that i am more or less at sea but i believe that the bribe which was offered me to throw the ball game to harvard was a trap meant to work my undoing flemming must have known your hand would not permit you to play in that game so he could not have been in that piece of business my dear boy i do not fancy i was expected to pitch that game it was thought that i would keep the money that money was marked this man would have gone forth and blowed that he had bribed me he would have told what marked money he had given me i should have been cornered perhaps arrested then searched you see what that would have meant the marked money would have been found on my person it would have been exactly as the stranger had described it it is certain that somebody was watching and saw him give me the money that person would have testified against me then frank merriwells college career would have come to a sudden termination in some ways it was a bungling plot and in others it was crafty enough but a cool thousand that was an awful roll to push at a fellow it was a bold and desperate stroke and the fact that such a sum was offered shows that the one who put up the job knew i could not be bought with a petty amount he did not know that it made no difference whether it was one dollar or one million i would not sell my honor and betray dear old yale for any sum you have other enemies besides flemming yes thornton he doesnt count for he lacks nerve whom do you mean harris does not love you it will be a long time before sport harris will venture to lift a hand against me again for the memory of the fate of his comrade hartwick is too vivid before him hartwick brought disgrace and ruin on himself by trying to injure me he was forced to leave college and then when he came back to new haven and put up that racetrack job on me he finished his own downfall by robbing his father in order that he might have a sum of money to stake against me feeling sure i must lose directly after that race he was arrested what was done about that matter was he sent to prison no his father would not press the case but i have heard that the old mans heart is broken by hartwicks actions the worthless rascal was the apple of the old mans eye his father had expected to see him go through college and graduate with flying colors the disgrace has bowed the father with grief and it is said he cannot live long then hartwick will get all his money no the old man has made a will that cuts evan off with a very small sum the rest of the money and estate goes to other relatives and to charity and evan hartwick brought all this on himself by his dastardly attempts to injure you it should be a warning to others it is an old saying that the way of the transgressor is hard but it seems to take human beings a long time to become convinced that it is absolutely true frank kept his eyes open and waited for the second warning which he felt sure would come he was not mistaken for it came near night a boy appeared at franks door and handed over a sealed envelope which he explained he had received from a man with a heavy beard he said he had been paid a quarter of a dollar to deliver it frank tore it open and read you will be invited to go to the theatre tonight do not go your enemies will be on the watch for you oh i knew it was coming cried frank scornfully it is a flimsy trick it actually disgusts me harry was out and merriwell was alone later harry came in accompanied by diamond browning griswold and creighton i say old man cried charlie creighton addressing frank we have something on for tonight and we want you to take a hand you may take a few rotten eggs or decayed vegetables with that hand if you like grinned griswold frank remembered the second warning of the party creighton was the only fellow he did not know very well and if there was an enemy among them creighton must be the man frank resolved to show no suspicion whats up he asked tonight cried griswold dramatically the curtain will go up on one of the greatest tragedies ever enacted on any stage nit hush whispered creighton mysteriously whisper it softly uncle toms cabin is in town with two little evas two marks three real siberian bloodhounds bred in new jersey and a jackass the jackass is the manager of the company grinned griswold i presume you have heard of that immortal play uncle toms cabin mr merriwell questioned creighton methinks i have assured frank methinks is good nodded creighton it has a fat sound eh grunted browning who already had deposited his corpulent body on the couch did anybody speak to me ah mr browning said creighton i think you said as we were coming along that you have had the pleasure of seeing uncle toms cabin yes i said so then permit me to inquire if you have ever seen ten nights in a barroom no grunted bruce but i have seen ten barrooms in a night here hold up cried griswold promptly that belongs to me and i have used it on everybody i could hit with it never mind murmured browning it is a good thing so well have to move it along seriously said diamond there is a crummy uncle toms cabin company at a cheap theatre in town and creighton has purchased a box he wants us to go along thats the idea acknowledged charlie all the fellows are onto it and there will be two or three hundred yale boys there we wont do a thing to the hamfatters frank smiled he saw that it would be an opportunity for any amount of sport he was sure and the mere thought of it made him eager to go but he remembered the warning it was most remarkable that the invitation to the theatre had followed so closely after the receipt of the note from the unknown of course youll go old fellow cried creighton who saw that merriwell was hesitating of course he will cried rattleton merry is always in for a little racket of this sort he is always foremost in anything of the kind said diamond that is why i want him in my box smiled creighton oh we wont do a thing in that box not a thing i have ordered plenty of fizz on ice and oh but you do not drink fizz do you merriwell no said frank but i am no temperance crank and i do not make myself offensive by trying to convince everybody else that men who do drink are fools college lads should have brains enough to know what they want and what they do not want and it is impertinent for any fellow to go around trying to make good templars of men who enjoy a glass of beer or wine now and then creighton impulsively grasped franks hand merriwell he cried by example you are the best possible temperance lecture and you will make more converts by keeping still than by preaching there may be something in that admitted frank i knew a parson once on a time who never mentioned religion unless some one broached the subject except when he was in the pulpit his name was lamfear he did not go around with his face drawn down asking everybody if they had received salvation and loved the lord i admired him more than any parson i ever knew and i used to go to his church sundays to hear him preach he was a good man although he seemed to enjoy seeing boys play baseball and skate and coast and fly kites i remember that one time he put on skates himself and took a spin on the river with the boys and girls now i know that man did more good by keeping still about religion than he could have done had he dinned it into the ears of everybody he met every one saw he was a good man for his daily life told that all the young folks admired him as much as they disliked another old parson who was forever talking about the wickedness of the world and the goodness of the lord and collaring persons everywhere to ask them why they did not attend church oftener good old parson lamfear may his tribe increase well said griswold well let parson lamfear rest what we want to know is if you are with us tonight to go or not to go that is the burning question murmured browning as still stretched on his back he struck a match lighted a cigarette dropped part of the match on his chin and gave a howl of pain frank suddenly made up his mind ill go he said chapter xxv the theatre party it was a gay party that left south middle that evening and started for the theatre merriwell had not said a word to rattleton concerning the receipt of the second warning a spirit of sheer reckless defiance led him to accept the invitation to the theatre even though he had not wished to spend his time that evening in such a manner this may be a jolly he told himself if i were to stay away the fellows would have a horse on me sure creighton had a beautiful tenor voice and as they started out beneath the elms he sang i shot an arrow into the air it fell to earth i know not where danny griswold seemed to take a fiendish delight in giving a humorous twist to anything sentimental and so he interrupted with the next day a man came around and sold me dead dog at a dollar a pound if that were original i wouldnt mind said creighton but you got it from some star vaudeville performance you little runt thats where i get all my gags frankly confessed griswold i store them up for use and they come in handy some time some time when you spring a stale joke i shall be led to assassinate you declared bruce browning impossible cried griswold that would be a crime well whats the odds you are too fat to commit a crime how is that it is difficult for fat persons to stoop to anything low you know you seem to find considerable amusement because i am somewhat overweight said bruce with attempted severity not at all chirped danny some men are well enough in their weight but this doesnt apply to coal dealers say griswold called rattleton whats the average fate for a wool no i mean the average weight for a fool a simple ton replied the little fellow quick as a flash frank clapped danny on the back good boy he exclaimed laughing rattleton didnt get ahead of you that time it is hard for anybody to get ahead of me declared griswold i am really a lively man in a footrace for my father is a watchmaker and he has given me instructions in the business i fuffuffuf fail to see huhhuhhow that applies said joe gamp a lad with a serious impediment in his speech why you see i have learned how to make good time chuckled danny gamp roared with laughter he was a big rawboned hulking fellow from new hampshire and his laugh was like the braying of a mule creighton had invited gamp to the theatre for the amusement the country lad would provide hell break the performers all up if he ever gets started laughing said charlie to merriwell when he gets going in good style nothing will stop him there was something about the country boy that merriwell liked frank quickly decided that joe was a bighearted honest fellow such a blunderheels that he was certain to provoke ridicule and yet thoroughly worthy and deserving in laughing gamp opened his mouth to the widest extent he suddenly closed it and clapped his hand to his jaw jeerusalem he gasped there guggugguggoes that old aching tuttuttooth of mine i was careless to let the night air guggugget into it why dont you have it pulled out asked diamond im going to have it puppuppuppulled and all the rest of my tuttuttarnel teeth just as soon as i can afford the money to bubbuy a new set declared gamp honestly why spend your money in such a foolish way said griswold with apparent seriousness save the dentists bill i know a dog that will insert a full set of teeth free of charge open flew gamps mouth again and his braying laugh caused a passing pedestrian to dodge so suddenly that he jumped from under his own hat say exclaimed charlie creighton getting hold of griswold save those till we get to the theatre then you can set him going and well have sport cant save them declared danny they have to come when the opportunity offers and so they went on their way to the theatre laughing and joking singing snatches of college songs and having a jolly time generally creighton had made no mistake in saying a large number of college lads would be present it seemed that there were at least two hundred in the theatre and it was apparent that they were there for a racket the moment creightons party entered the box a tall young man in the first row of orchestra seats arose and faced the house soberly saying ladies and gentlemen this is a most auspicious not to say suspicious occasion it is probable that many of you were not aware that we were to be honored tonight by having the privilege of witnessing the performance in company with royal personages but such is the fact the party that has just entered the box on the right is the prince of chowchow who is accompanied by the duke of dublinstout the earl of easytogetajag the emperor of buginhishead the high mogul of whooperup the chief pusher of whangdoodleland and the great muckamuck of hogansalley gentlemen it is your privilege to salute them then every college boy in the house arose and bowed with great gravity toward the box well this is sure to be a hot time laughed merriwell delighted you bet it is assured charlie creighton well make simon legree regret that he is living an usher came down the aisle and remonstrated with the tall student the tall student replied to the usher with exaggerated politeness declaring that he meant no harm but that he had felt it his duty to inform the audience that such distinguished personages were in the box then when the tall young man sat down as if by a prearranged signal there was a wild outburst of applause stamping of feet whistling catcalls and so forth the musicians came out and began to put their instruments in tune they composed an orchestra carried with the troupe and were as rattleton forcibly expressed it decidedly on the bum some of the musicians seemed to dread what was coming for they looked pale and agitated they know that some of the overripe vegetables and stale henfruit which the audience may toss at the performers is liable to fall short smiled merriwell having tuned up after a fashion the orchestra began to file away at some sort of a medley griswold rolled his eyes and said i am carried away with the music as the monkey who was perched on the handorgan remarked it was with the utmost difficulty that the assembled students repressed a desire to uplift their voices and drown the sounds which came from the wretched orchestra but they felt that it would not do to alarm the players by too great a demonstration and so the only interruptions to the overture were a few catcalls at last the curtain rolled up and the play began an ominous silence seemed to hang over the audience the actors were nervous at first but as the silence continued and offensive demonstrations were not immediately made they gained courage and swung into their parts with as much enthusiasm and ability as possible it is possible that the sight of two or three policemen at the back of the house gave the performers courage the officers had been called in to overawe the college lads in case they became too demonstrative at length in a very pathetic part of the first act griswold leaned over to joe gamp and whispered it is very touching isnt it yes said the country boy chokingly it mummummummakes me fuffuffuffeel like thththunder he nearly blubbered outright for he had never seen many plays having found it necessary to spend his money with the greatest care as he was confined to a certain allowance to take him through college and uncle toms bible said danny it reminds me of a conundrum how was the ark propelled dudduddarned if i know by a noah of course explained griswold gamp caught his breath and then he lay back and roared haw haw haw ahaw ahaw ahaw this roar of laughter coming as it did at a solemn and pathetic point in the play was most startling uncle tom came near collapsing on the stage and the other actors were so disturbed that they got tangled in their lines the students caught on and there was an immediate burst of applause that swelled louder and louder this died away most suddenly and unexpectedly and joe gamp was heard to shout in his endeavor to make griswold hear by jiminy that was a good one ahaw ahaw ahaw ahaw the lad from the country went off into another paroxysm of laughter pressing his hands to his sides and shutting his eyes utterly unconscious for the moment of his surroundings of a sudden joe remembered that he was at the theatre his mouth came together with a snap his eyes flew open and he ceased to laugh and stiffened up with a frightened look on his face the change was so ludicrous that the entire audience was convulsed and the actors could not help laughing from that moment the play progressed under difficulties in the scene where the slaves were being sold at auction some of the students began to pepper the actors with peashooters doing it cautiously so that they would not be spotted in the act every time marks would open his mouth to say seventyfive he would be struck by one or more peas which were fired with force sufficient to make them sting like hornets seventywow whoop yelled marks clapping a hand to the side of his face and suddenly dancing an original cancan five hundred cried legree seventyfi weeeow stop it somebody is shooting things at me marks had been spotted on the end of his long nose to which he was wildly clinging with both hands as he pranced around the stage whats the matter growled legree in a guarded tone unable to understand what had happened have you gone crazy you fool stand up and bid then he cried six hundred seventyfive hornets and blisters finished marks as he was nailed by three or four peas i cant stand this its too much he bolted off the stage legree looked dismayed and then he advanced to the footlights and addressed the audience ladies and gentlemen he said i trust you will excuse the gentleman who is playing the part of marks he has not been well for several days and he is somewhat troubled with hallucinations of course we know his troubles are all imaginary and yeeeow im shot a pea had struck him squarely between the eyes and he started back so suddenly that he sat down on the stage as if he had been knocked off his feet ahaw ahaw ahaw roared the voice of joe gamp and the audience joined in the shout of laughter chapter xxvi trapped there was an uproar in the theatre which the ushers and the police were unable to quell for some time the curtain was rung down and then after a short wait the manager came out and said the show would go on if the audience would behave he threatened to have the persons who were using the peashooters arrested and this threat was greeted by hisses and catcalls after a while however the curtain went up once more and the play proceeded in a tangle of real siberian bloodhounds gumption cutes marks topsies little evas escaping slaves slave hunters and general excitement and confusion it was plain that the actors feared further trouble and they were rushing through their lines eager to get off the stage as soon as possible the bloodhounds were cheered by the students and peppered with peas when topsy declared she nebber was born but jes growed some one inquired the name of the fertilizer used in her rearing when the jackass appeared a solemn voice from some uncertain part of the theatre called the attention of the audience to the leading actor of the colossal aggregation little eva was invited to exhibit her wings the college boys were irrepressible and yet they did not do anything to absolutely break up the show although joe gamps hawhaws came near proving disastrous several times a policeman came down to the box and threatened to arrest joe but he was pacified by creighton who had a decidedly smooth way of fixing things frank merriwell remained quiet until near the end of the play enjoying the sport the other fellows were making at last however he decided to produce some amusement himself frank was a very good amateur ventriloquist although he seldom practiced the art now however he saw his opportunity little eva was on her deathbed and the mourners were assembled about all at once one of the mourners seemed to say this business is on the bum every one started and stared the actors were astounded and the audience amused then the death agony went on until another of the watchers by evas side observed it makes me sick the manager was heard to hiss from the shelter of the wings ill make you sick when you come off oh go fall on yourself you old cheat the actor seemed to fling back then little eva in her death agony apparently remarked give it to the old duffer he owes me six weeks salary and ill quit dying right now if the ghost doesnt walk immediately this brought laughter and hearty applause from the college lads when the applause had subsided uncle tom apparently observed he cant get ahead of me ive put an attachment on the jackass this was more than the excitable manager could stand and he rushed onto the stage shaking his fist at uncle tom and crying confound you i dont owe you a cent you obliged me to pay up before you would go on tonight and then he nearly collapsed when he realized what his anger had led him to do and say the college lads arose from their seats and cheered standing in the front of the box charlie creighton shouted this is the best part of the show fellows lets give em one now all together then the yale yell pealed forth and little eva came near dying in reality from heart failure this broke up the show entirely and the curtain came down with a rush while the frightened orchestra made haste to disappear from behind the curtain the manager shouted that the show was over and the laughing tumultuous students hurried out of theatre well merriwell said charlie creighton how have you enjoyed the evening immensely laughed frank it was a regular sussussuscircus declared joe gamp never had so much fuffuffuffuffun in all my bubborn days we had them on a string like a kite murmured bruce browning and thats what made them soar chuckled griswold just as the street was reached frank gave a slight exclamation and quickly forced his way through the crowd toward a man who was near at hand that man was the mysterious stranger the unknown seemed to be watching merriwell for he whirled about and hastened away the moment frank started in his direction oh i want to get my hands on that fellow grated frank the man did his best to escape but merriwell was close after him the stranger hurried along a street and frank broke into a run then the unknown glanced over his shoulder and started to run himself hold on commanded frank that made the stranger run the faster frank followed but could see nothing of the person he was pursuing he must have dodged into a doorway decided the lad no here is where he went down this alley the mouth of a dark alley was before him and he plunged into it he did not go far before he decided that further pursuit was folly and he turned back hes slippery muttered the boy but ill catch him some time if he continues to shadow me dark forms appeared at the mouth of the alley and a hoarse whisper came to merriwells ears he went in here and the alley is blind so he cant get out do him and do him dirty for all that frank had been often in desperate peril something about this situation chilled him to the heart the uncanny darkness the unknown alley his creeping foes coming down upon him possibly with deadly intent all served to make him feel weak and helpless for the moment there are times when the bravest heart shrinks with dread and for all that frank was a lad with remarkable nerve it is not strange that he felt a thrill of fear at that moment it is claimed that men have lived who never knew the meaning of the word fear and it is possible that this may be true but in case they ever were placed in situations of extreme peril such persons must have been lacking in some of the essential elements that compose a human being we think of them as deficient in certain ways wanting in the finer qualities and naturally coarse and brutish it is the person who experiences fear and conquers it by his own determination to do so who is the greatest hero one of the bravest generals america has produced a man who had the reputation of being utterly fearless once was asked if he ever had been afraid while in battle no sir was his reply never in battle but sometimes just before going into an engagement i have felt it necessary to keep my teeth clinched to prevent my heart from jumping out of my mouth still the men whom he commanded never knew that he experienced a single thrill of fear he conquered his trepidation by his wonderful will power and always in battle he appeared perfectly unaware that there was the least danger indeed he was sometimes criticised for his apparent recklessness in exposing himself to deadly peril frank merriwell never courted peril and he avoided danger when he could do so in a manly way and without lowering his own sense of dignity once engaged in a dangerous encounter or forced into a position of peril franks blood arose and he seemed to be seized by a reckless disregard of his personal safety then it was that he laughed in a singular manner and his enemies had learned that he was the most dangerous when that laugh sounded from his lips as he heard those unknown foes creeping down upon him in the darkness of the alley frank crouched close to the ground and felt about with his hand for some weapon of defense fear suddenly gave place to anger and he longed to retaliate on his enemies he knew well enough that the men creeping down upon him were hired tools chosen by his foes to do him severe bodily injury oh for a club a stone anything he thought but his hand found nothing that suited his need at that moment the cautiously advancing men came nearer and nearer he could hear them whispering to each other and they seemed to block the entire width of the narrow alley he could not make out their number but he was sure there must be several of them can yer see him jake no an i cant hear him neither but hes here somewhere and they say hell fight look out fer him frank heard these whispered words and then without realizing that he was about to do so he laughed there were hoarse cries curses and blows a savage struggle suddenly was begun in the dark alley frank had hoped to break through the line of his foes by his sudden rush but he was not successful although his hard right fist knocked a man down with his first blow then he received a shock that seemed to cause a thousand bright lights to flash before his eyes and he knew he had been struck on the head with some sort of weapon the boy staggered uttering hoarse exclamations his assailants like beasts of prey sprang upon him give it to him cried a voice with new strength frank twisted and squirmed in doing so he threw his head from side to side and it chanced that he succeeded in saving it from the blows which were intended to render him helpless those blows many of them at least fell on his shoulders and his back with benumbing force he forgot that his left hand was not yet well but he used it as freely and as vigorously as his right and once more something like a laugh came from his lips hear him hissed one of the ruffians why hes a perfect young fiend but frank could not long hold his own against such odds some of the blows aimed at his head fell glancingly but they were enough to rob him in a measure of his strength he tried to tear away and then he was felled to the ground merriwell felt that the jig was up with him they had him at their mercy at last then it was that a surprising thing happened with encouraging cries two men came through the darkness and attacked the boys assailants that the new arrivals on the battlefield were armed with heavy clubs was apparent and they used them mercilessly on the ruffians this attack was unexpected by franks assailants and they could not meet it immediately they turned and fled pursued by one of the men who had set upon them just then apparently disturbed by the sounds of the fight some person came to a nearby window with a lighted lamp the light shone out into the alley and fell on frank merriwell and one of the men who had saved him plug kirby gasped frank sitting up dats wot me boy cried the bruiser cheerfully an i kinder tink we didnt git round any too quick neider you came just in time be yer hurt much youngster asked kirby anxiously assisting frank to arise i think not got a few cracks and was upset but that is all where is the man who was with you he whooped it along after der gang kinder tink he wanted ter ketch one of der blokes an hold him fer der perlice ter pinch who was he dunno what cried frank astonished dont know who was with you when you came to my aid well i dunno his name youngster and thats on der level frank was eager to ask more questions but plug said wed best push outer dis dunno wotll happen if we stays here too long der gang might come back so they hurried out of the alley frank receiving some assistance from kirby as he was rather dizzy when he tried to walk when the street was reached no one seemed to be in the immediate vicinity shall we wait for your friend asked merriwell naw answered plug he aint likely ter come back a short time later they were seated at a table in a nearby resort and frank was treating kirby frank had examined his own injuries and discovered they were not serious although it was likely that he would be sore about the head and shoulders from the bruises he had received now tell me urged frank who was with you when you came to my assistance i am eager to know i tole yer dat i dont know der coves name but i do know dat he is all right an on der level well how is that you do not know his name never asked

smiled a bit realizing that he had indeed made a firm friend of this bruiser who had once tried to whip him but had received a severe drubbing instead dey didnt want ter shove up against me kirby went on an dey got out right away den a man walks up ter me and he says i was all right an he blows me he continues ter blow me an ask me questions about you arter a while he asks me if i would fight fer

i was wid as was in a doorway nigh der alley all der time skipped back fer me an we jumped right down inter der alley takin some heavy canes wot we had wid us all der time you know wot happened arter dat frank was puzzled and mystified he asked plug to describe the mysterious man and kirby did so this added to franks wonderment for the description tallied with that of the stranger who had tried to bribe him to throw a ball game to harvard but that it could be the same man even though everything indicated that it must be frank could not believe that night after going to bed frank lay awake for hours thinking of the stranger and the mystery which surrounded him chapter xxvii an emissary from the west frank was determined to solve the mystery of the unknown man he did not tell rattleton everything concerning his adventure of the previous night although he was forced to explain that he had been in an encounter and that he did not know who his assailants were the theatre party had wondered greatly at franks sudden disappearance and frank confessed that he had followed the mysterious unknown who had given him the slip that fellow is playing the shadow on you frank cried harry indignantly hes up to some sort of crookedness he must bear a charmed life or he would have been killed the night he jumped from the new london special said frank he decided it was best to take chances by jumping rather than to fall into the hands of old elis sons and i think he was right creighton came around to inquire how it happened that merriwell disappeared so suddenly the previous evening since the boat race creighton had sought merriwells company although he had scarcely given frank any attention before that creighton was a prominent society man and had considerable influence at yale his friendship was of value to any fellow on whom he saw fit to bestow it his father was rich and charlie spent money freely as his whims dictated not even those with whom he was not on friendly terms however could justly accuse him of being a cad awfully jolly time last night yawned creighton it was rather kiddish but it is a relief to play the boy once in a while it capped the whole business when the actors themselves finished the fun by giving the manager away in the last act frank smiled but did not explain his connection with the crowning event of the evening jove im hungry charlie declared come on merriwell and rattleton well go down to bobs and have a chop he would not take no for an answer and so a few minutes later the trio crossed the campus creighton in the middle his arms locked with those of the other lads all were laughing and joking in a lighthearted manner creighton took them directly to a restaurant that was famous for its chops they ordered charlie and harry taking ale with their food just as the chops were brought on a man came in and took a seat at a table nearby this man was dressed in a new suit of store clothes and wore a full beard he gave his order to the waiter in a low tone and then began perusing a paper behind which his face was almost entirely hidden rattleton happened to sit so that he naturally looked toward the man and several times he caught that individual peering over the top of the paper it did not take harry long to note that the person with the paper seemed to be watching frank merriwell suddenly franks roommate arose and with two swift steps he was at the mans side without a word harry caught the gentleman by the beard which he gave a sharp jerk the beard came off in harrys hand it was false look frank cried rattleton pointing at the smoothshaven face exposed it is the mysterious man who has been following you about it was in truth the mysterious unknown and frank was on his feet in a twinkling resolved not to let the man escape till he had given a full explanation of his remarkable conduct to merriwells surprise the stranger showed no desire to run away but sat smiling serenely up at him calmly observing do not excite yourself mr merriwell there is no reason for it i have completed my business in a most satisfactory manner and i am now ready to explain everything to you it is an explanation which i expect and demand said frank coldly it is no more than fair that i should have one as you have shown yourself my persistent enemy and that without any just cause that i know of you are mistaken returned the man instead of your enemy i have been your firm friend from the very first i fail to see how you can make that out i will call at your rooms this evening and give you a full explanation no cried frank promptly you will give me an explanation here and immediately i do not think you will press me to that was the calm assertion i might speak of affairs of a personal and family nature you you speak of such affairs to me now it strikes me that you are attempting a bluff sir but it will not work the stranger reached into his pocket and took out something which he held up before franks eyes this he said with confidence will convince you that i speak nothing but the truth my fathers ring gasped frank yes bowed the man it is the ring that led him to one of the richest mines in the southwest he said that it would simply be necessary for me to show it to you and you would know that he sent me shall i call this evening mr merriwell if you please sir said frank bowing respectfully the boys were surprised but frank said he would explain some time later that evening the stranger called as he had said he would frank had taken pains to run harry out of the room so they were quite alone the boy locked the door as a precaution against unwelcome interruptions the mysterious man introduced himself as david scott the confidential agent of charles merriwell franks unfortunate father who had spent the best years of his life and separated himself from his family and friends in the mad search after phantom fortune at last charles merriwell had struck it rich and he was now a very wealthy man but he was broken in health and he often feared for his reason as charles merriwell had been eccentric and unfathomable all his life while poor thus he remained now that he was rich of late he had been seized by a conviction that he could not live long and it was his desire to make a will that would give almost his entire wealth to his son but before he made such a will mr merriwell decided to know just what sort of a young man his son had become as he did not feel like leaving his mine and going east to investigate he sent his confidential clerk david scott in his instructions to scott charles merriwell showed the peculiarities of his character he provided the agent with plenty of money and instructed him to thoroughly probe the inward character of the youth about which he was to acquire information scott was instructed to discover all of franks bad habits and to determine if the lad could be led astray by evil influence or in any other manner the agent had carried out his instructions to his complete satisfaction and he complimented the blushing boy on his integrity of character and sterling manhood scott explained how he had pretended to ally himself with franks foes and thus had heard the plots against the boy he had sent frank the warnings and he had secured the aid of plug kirby to aid him in beating off merriwells ruffianly assailants i scarcely think you will be troubled any more by your enemies declared scott i had a session with them last night after the failure of their attempt on you and i sent the varmints scurrying for tall timber in a hurry i told them that i was your friend and not your enemy and that i would come up as a witness against them if you saw fit to prosecute them then they begged me to keep still and agreed to let up on you for good and all if i wouldnt chirp i made the galoots no promises for hours frank and scott sat and talked of charles merriwell his health his mine and his plans and when the man departed it was with a letter from frank merriwell to charles merriwell in his possession the next evening frank received a call which surprised him greatly what it was the next chapter will tell chapter xxviii friends or foes thump bang thump bang open this door thumpety thump bang bang bang open this door or i will dake it brown i mean i will break it down harry was excited hold on a moment cant you cried the laughing voice of frank from within the room harry was pressing against the door with one hand having rained the heavy blows upon it with the other hand which was clinched in a most threatening manner the door flew open with a suddenness that precipitated rattleton into the room with a headlong rush and plunged him plump into the stomach of a young man who happened to be in the way ugh wow bump bump both went down clasped in each others arms two other lads stood staring at the fallen ones they were frank merriwell and fred flemming tom thornton was the unfortunate who stood in the way of rattletons headlong rush and harry quite unintentionally had struck thornton a smart blow with his clinched fist at that moment it did look as if the excited lad had rushed into the room with the premeditated purpose of hitting tom here here break away cried merriwell sharply not much panted tom in excitement and anger think im going to let him go so he can hit me again catch hold flemming ordered frank catch hold of your friend and well part them he grasped rattleton by the collar as he spoke but fred made no move to pull thornton away seeing this merriwell obtained a firm hold on the collars of both harry and tom and with a surprising display of strength wrenched them apart yanked them to their feet and held them at arms length steady now he cried as they seemed to betray a desire to get at each other quit it he struck me cried thornton it was antirely excidental no entirely accidental declared harry flourishing his arms tom dodged well you act as if you are trying to bring about another accident he said i know you hit me intentionally and ill make you pay for it too bah you cant make me pay for anything flung back harry his anger aroused by thorntons words do you think you can run around punching fellows in this way without getting it back youll find you are mistaken you were in my way when i came in i didnt have time to get out of your way well whats all this about anyway demanded frank are you fellows trying to settle some sort of a score it looks to me said flemming stiffly as if mr rattleton took advantage of our presence in this room to strike thornton well what are you chaps here for anyway demanded harry that is what i would like to know we dont run in your class and so hold up old man interrupted merriwell promptly mr flemming and mr thornton called to see me about a personal matter i thought so declared rattleton and i decided you would get the worst end of it as they were two to your one and the door was locked if they are here to do you count me into it ill take care of this fellow thornton while you polish off flemming we did not come here to fight said fred haughtily didnt exclaimed harry in surprise then what sort of a game are you up to for i know it is something crooked flemming tossed his head mr rattleton he said your language is very offensive to me had to glear it i mean glad to hear it shot back rattleton rudely i didnt want you to misunderstand me mr merriwell said fred turning to frank i think we had better go our business was with you and mr rattleton seems determined to raise a quarrel with us as you know we did not come here to quarrel and regarding mr rattleton as your friend we will endeavor to overlook his behavior and insulting language but we cannot forget it added thornton giving harry a fierce look it will be remembered i am sure i dont want you to forget it flung back rattleton come tom urged flemming we will go goodday mr merriwell frank released thornton who followed flemming from the room simply pausing at the door to say goodby mr merriwell goodby smiled frank and then when the door had closed behind them frank dropped into a chair and laughed softly but heartily well i fail to fee anything sunny about it i mean i fail to see anything funny about it growled rattleton prancing fiercely up and down the room if youll tell me where the laugh comes in ill snicker just to keep you company the whole thing is very funny laughed merriwell why you were eager to hammer thornton and the fellow was afraid you would for all the bluff he put up it would have given me great satisfaction to thump him confessed harry for i know it is exactly what he deserves what were they up to anyway thats what puzzles me i expected to find that they had done you up oh nothing of the sort but they were up to some crooked game i know it i thought they had fastened the door so that they could do the job without being interrupted ha ha ha laughed frank that explains why you looked as if you were literally thirsting for gore when you lunged into the room and grappled with thornton did i hit him you had your fist clinched and you may have given him a slight rap in your excitement well i did not give him that rap intentionally if i had hed found something entirely different by jingoes i may get the chance to show him the difference some time youd better drop it old man eh drop it thats what i said harry and that is what i meant my boy but why i dont think i understand you those fellows are your enemies and that makes them mine they have been my enemies but we have had a peace conference the dickens and we buried the hatchet well i didnt suppose you could be fooled so easy i knew they were up to some sort of a game i knew it well what sort of a game do you think it was theyre trying to fool you trying to make you think they are ready to bury the hatchet while they are still waiting to hit you behind your back whenever they can thats the kind of chaps they are they cant fool me if they can you if they can lull you into carelessness till their opportunity comes they will drive the knife into you and sink it deep dont mink im thisted i mean dont think im twisted i am dead certain of the sort of cattle im talking about you will be playing right into their hands if you get the idea that they have let up on you in the least when they get a good chance youll get it in the neck well harry you may be right but i have reasons to believe that flemming is anxious to call a truce just at present he made a serious mistake when he tried to enlist david scott against me scott found out all of flemmings plots and secured enough evidence of the fellows rascality to cause his expulsion from yale if it were made public well it should be made public immediately oh i dont know about that expulsion from college might mean the ruin of flemmings future if he keeps on hell do that whether he is expelled or not if he does it himself i shall not have it on my conscience if i were to bring about his expulsion and he went to the dogs i might blame myself for it thinking he would have done differently had he remained here do you catch on i catch on that you are dead easy with your enemies till they force you to down them for good but when they do compel me to down them i will acknowledge that you always do a good job said rattleton with an approving grin mr scott believed that i should be severe with flemming and thornton admitted frank but i knew that thornton was dragged into the business by flemming without having any real heart for what he was doing if i were to expose flemming it would implicate thornton and that seemed too much of a retaliation i thought the whole matter over carefully and decided to give the fellows a chance then mr scott went to them and nearly frightened the life out of them by saying he meant to expose them to the faculty that brought them to their knees immediately rattleton expressed his satisfaction by a vigorous pantomime finally continued frank when they had begged and promised mr scott agreed to let up on them if they would come to me offer apologies and give me their pledge to let me alone in the future and that is how they happened to be here today yes why was the door locked i locked it to prevent any of the fellows from dropping in on us while we were talking the matter over well jones told me he had seen those chaps come in here and i decided they were looking for bother so i made a hustle to get here when i found the door locked i was sure they had you in a corner and so i threatened to break it down if it was not opened without delay and when it was opened you came in like a raging lion well i was ready for any scrim of a shortage i mean any sort of a scrimmage you showed your readiness laughed frank i have the word of those fellows that they will let me quite alone if i drop the past i wouldnt believe either of them under oath you are a doubter anyway well wait and see what will occur chapter xxix talk of a tour there was a rap on the door which immediately popped open and in bobbed a head thatched with carroty hair upon which was perched a crumpled cap a freckled jolly face was wrinkled into a cheerful grin and a voice that was made up of bubbles and hollows cried hello chaps i just looked in to see if you were doing well as the cook said to the lobster when she lifted the saucepan lid come in stubbs invited frank promptly come in and make yourself as big a nuisance as possible no need to tell me to do that piped the lad at the door as he bounced into the room i always make myself a nuisance wherever i am it is my policy he was a little shortlegged fellow with a rolypoly body and twinkling eyes good nature bubbled out all over him at a glance you could see he was the sort of chap who would try to be merry under almost any circumstances this was bink stubbs a lad with whom frank and harry had recently become acquainted frank had picked him up because of his merry ways and quaint sayings of the wise and humorous order have you fellers got any smokers asked bink as he deposited himself on a chair no we havent got any smokers answered harry and the last time you were here bruce browning said you swiped a whole package of cigarettes from him stubbs tried to look horrified and then cried well ill be hanged as the picture said when it found the cord was tied to it you know neither of us smoke said merriwell i know you pretend you do not but i dont know that you are not bluffing when you say so whats that do you mean to insinuate that i am lying why ill step on you stubbsie in that case my days are numbered as the calendar said to the blotter there was a sound of voices outside the door and then with very little ceremony three lads came filing into the room there were browning diamond and griswold get up you little villain said bruce as he collared stubbs and yanked him off the easychair dont you know enough to let other folks have a chance to sit down you lazy little rascal and then with a sigh of relief bruce deposited his corpulent form on the chair stubbs bristled up as if he meant to fight then seemed to change his mind and shook his head and remarked such things are bound to a cur as the dog said when he looked at the tin can that was tied to his tail the boys were welcomed by frank and harry and merriwell said im glad you fellows dropped in i want to find out how many of you are going to take that bicycle trip across the continent during the summer vacation jeewhiskers grinned danny griswold think of bruce browning the champion lazy man at yale riding a bicycle across the continent the exertion of riding across the campus would utterly prostrate him um grunted bruce its singular that small things annoy one worst oh yes returned danny promptly even a little mosquito bores me frightfully say griswold piped stubbs thats a bad habit to get into whats a bad habit to get into demanded danny bristling up resentfully that suit of clothes you have on said stubbs whimsically its a miserable fit well youll have a bad fit if i get after you exclaimed griswold hotly youre a base fraud and an impostor you are trying to steal my thunder by reading the same comic papers that i do if you keep this up youll use up all of my original jokes oh well said stubbs cough up a cigarette and ill let you forgive me im dying for a whiff griswold hesitated and then flung a package of cigarettes at bink who skillfully caught them extracted one closed the package and tossed it back a moment later the little chap had lighted the cigarette and as he deposited himself at full length on a tigerskin rug he puffed out a great whiff of smoke and murmured now i have something to blow about as the cyclone said when it lifted a house and barn into the next state speaking about clothes said browning languidly did you see goldstein the tailor today rattleton yes i saw him nodded harry and did you tell him i said i would settle that little bill sure thats kind of you did he seem convinced he said he was was what convinced that you lied this provoked a laugh when the laughing had ceased griswold sagely observed it is remarkable that man is the only animal that can lie standing up say you chaps called frank drop this sort of chatter and answer my question how many of you are in for spending the summer vacation in a bicycle trip across the continent youll have to excuse me said griswold as he followed stubbs example and lighted a cigarette im going down to bar harbor and play tennis on my vacation i cant endure tennis drawled browning i should say not too much exertion for you it is not that i dont like to be around where others are playing it dont why not because it is so noisy noisy christmas how do you make that out why you cant play it without a racket said browning griswold staggered and clutched at his heart what papers have you been reading he gasped diamond spoke up for the first time ill tell you what ill do merriwell ill go on this bicycle trip across the continent if i can secure my mothers consent will you cried frank eagerly then see her as soon as possible i couldnt ask for a better fellow than you harry thinks he can go and that makes three of us well do the trick even if we cant get another fellow is it agreed it is agreed if i can get my mother to agree to it assured jack well lets talk about another matter said bruce the tournament at madison square garden is right upon us are you on for anything merriwell yes answered frank i shall take part in several contests how about the mile run questioned diamond i believe yates is in for that said merriwell thats something i want to speak to you about drawled bruce frank was rather surprised as browning had taken very little interest in athletics of late during his early days at yale bruce had been a pusher in athletic matters being at that time an athlete himself as he kept himself in form and held back the threatening development of flesh by the severest sort of training but bruce could not continue to resist the temptations of his appetite and it became more and more difficult for him to keep in trim as long as he was a freshman he had done so but when he became a sophomore he gradually abandoned the struggle still he had remained active as a leader and had been known at one time as the king of the sophomores his final effort at training had been when he put himself in condition to meet merriwell in a fourround hardglove contest the bout had been pronounced a draw but browning afterward acknowledged that he must have been knocked out had it continued to a finish from that time brownings interest in athletic matters waned he lost ambition in that line and he soon became so overburdened with flesh that nothing save a question of life or death could have induced him to go into training it was not so very long before bruce was known as the champion lazy man at yale all that he seemed to care about was to eat drink smoke and loaf he seldom was known to grind and his attempts at skinning were pitiable failures then he was dropped a class and as he still stuck to yale he found himself arrayed with merriwell and the fellows whom he at one time had regarded as enemies in that class merriwell was regarded as a leader in athletic matters and bruce seldom mentioned anything of the kind now however to merriwells surprise he displayed sudden interest in the great intercollegiate tournament to be held in madison square garden new york directly at the close of the spring terms in the various contests yale was to be represented by her best men there had been some uncertainty concerning the one who would wear yales colors in the mile run but the belief grew that duncan yates a junior would be the one finally settled on by the committee in charge of the matter why dont you go into that race browning old sylph grinned danny griswold you would astonish the public some time ill sit on you runtie growled bruce stubbs remarked that will settle it as the sugar observed when the egg dropped into the coffee rattleton threw a slipper at bink who grunted as it struck him in the ribs but serenely continued to smoke his mottled face wrinkled into a quaint grimace what is it that you want to say about the mile race browning asked frank his curiosity aroused i want to say that i do not believe yates is the proper man to represent old eli he is fast and he has a record its no use to talk about his record why not orton of u p lays over him and this will be a case of yale against the field better men than orton may show up yates may break his own record that word may is all right but it can be applied both ways he may not theres van tassle said diamond he claims to be a recordbreaker a recordbreaker sniffed griswold why that fellow couldnt break an egg thats right nodded rattleton he breaks records with his mouth dont talk about him well there are others laughed frank name a few of them invited browning with more animation than he had displayed for some time theres hickson hes stiff in the joints as you know walter gordan hes no stayer that fellow can run but he has not the sand to make himself a winner he thinks himself the biggest thing on ice said rattleton by the way broke in griswold what is the biggest thing on ice the profit promptly answered stubbs and then he made a scramble to get out of griswolds way its no use i cant shine when that chap is around exclaimed danny with attempted seriousness he has an answer for all my conundrums that makes me think of one for you piped bink who was now perched on the back of a high chair like a monkey why is a duel a quick affair answer it yourself ill never tell well a duel is a quick affair because it takes only two seconds to arrange it there wont be a duel in this case grunted browning but therell be a coldblooded murder if you kids keep on ill assassinate you both frank laughed oh let them go it bruce he said it seems to amuse them and it doesnt harm anybody else i think browning is right about yates declared diamond he is not the proper man to represent yale in that race whom would you suggest asked frank frank merriwell by all means now that is folly said merriwell seriously i fail to see why it is folly cried browning you are the man i have had in my mind all along but i have no record to the winds with your records what we want is a man who can run hell make a record why do you think i can run i have seen you run and i have heard the fellows tell about your speed that is enough in your case frank shook his head it is not enough he contradicted i know i have a record as a base runner in a ball game but the best base runners are not always able to make good showings in races besides that base running is dash work and this is a case of running a mile there is a vast difference thats all right spluttered harry quickly you can mun a rile i mean run a mile with the best of em ive seen you on a long run when was that when we had that turkey chase you led us all and it didnt bother you a bit then after you made the run out into the country and back pierson got after you before you could get to our rooms you ran away from him and held on to the turkey that settled in piersons mind that you could hustle along all right and it had something to do with his giving you a place for a trial on the ball team that is true frank was forced to confess have you ever been in any races asked diamond oh i took part in some races when i was at fardale academy what did you do in them i believe i won but you must remember that i had no such rivals to go against as will be found at the tournament and you were in no such condition as you are now is that right frank was forced to confess that it was then browning tried to pin frank down and make him answer the question whether he did not have confidence enough in himself to believe he could race duncan yates for a mile of course i could race him smiled frank but the matter of winning is another question well i believe you are the man to run for yale in that race said browning and i am going to use my influence to see that you and not yates are entered that is settled and it is no use for you to make any objections chapter xxx a hot run soon it became evident that bruce browning had not lost his oldtime push entirely when there was something to arouse him he could bestir himself and get to work in a marvelous manner as long as it was not necessary for him to again go into training browning knew paul pierson who was one of the committee of arrangements for the coming tournament and he knew that pierson was well aware of frank merriwells general ability bruce had heard pierson express a belief that merriwell was one of the persons who by sheer determination and sand as well as ability was bound to win in almost everything he attempted bruce went to pierson immediately after leaving merriwells room pierson was one of the sort who seldom said much and browning left him without knowing whether he had made an impression or not late that afternoon however pierson accidentally met frank who was crossing the campus i say merriwell said paul in his abrupt manner can you run some answered frank sententiously hum grunted pierson then he looked frank all over as if he had never seen him before and was taking his physical measure you keep yourself in the very best condition all the time i see he finally observed well i seldom do anything to abuse myself are you in training for a race not exactly how long would it take for you to put yourself in condition possibly a week what are you good for a short dash or a long run i think i can do either fairly well fairly well does not go at yale as you know merriwell you must do things exceptionally well you are altogether too modest if something had not brought you out nobody could have known you could do anything at all you have been pushed in various ways by others but you fail to push yourself oh i do not go about blowing my own horn said frank smiling you will find youll have to blow your own horn when you go into business or my brother is a liar he keeps hammering at me that the man who does not blow his horn is the fellow who gets left to a large extent it is that way here at yale the fellow who keeps still and sits back gets left thats my sermon im not going to say any more now get into training for a long run ill come round at nine this evening and go you a sprint of a mile or two just to see how you show up that was all pierson turned and sauntered away without another word frank whistled softly and smiled this is brownings work he muttered pierson takes things for granted how does he know i will take any part in a race he does not ask if i will but he tells me to go to work and get into shape he is coming round tonight to see how i show up all right at ten minutes of nine that evening paul pierson rapped on the door of merriwells room and was invited to walk in he was in a rig for running and he immediately said come come get out of those duds merriwell you are to run with me tonight how far from one to five miles as i take a fancy oh well i wont change my clothes for a little thing like that said frank carelessly youd better declared paul im going to give you a hustle and youll find you can keep up better if you are in a suitable rig ill take the chances of keeping just as i am piersons teeth came together with a click he did not like that although he tried not to show it the fellow thinks he can outrun me on a long pull as he happened to do so for a short distance once on a time he thought ill see if i can fool him pierson considered himself an excellent longdistance runner although he seldom took part in races realizing that good though he was there were still better men frank had on a loose thin shirt and a lightweight suit of clothes he caught up a cap and announced that he was ready to go with paul they went out and soon were crossing the campus having arrived at a point quite outside the college grounds paul paused and said we will start from here and make a run out into the country i will set the pace going out but when we turn to come back it will be a case of the best man gets home first the termination of the run will be your room that is satisfactory nodded frank far away a band of jolly students were singing stars of the summer night their melodious voices making sweet music beneath the great elms the soft breath of june came across the campus seeming to gently bear the words of the beautiful song to their ears are you ready asked pierson sharply all ready then here we go they were off shoulder to shoulder although frank had not seemed to prepare for the run he had put on his running shoes feeling that he might absolutely need them along the streets of new haven they went attracting but little attention as it was not an uncommon sight at that season to see some of the college lads taking a night run in that manner they passed a group of fellows who were standing beneath a street light near a corner here softly exclaimed one of the group who are these chaps the entire party turned to take a look at the runners its pierson and merriwell what did i tell you yates exclaimed fred flemming a ring of satisfaction in his voice well may i be kicked growled duncan yates as he started after the two lads who had passed and were scudding along the street at a steady trot flem seldom makes a mistake murmured tom thornton but merriwell is not in his rig said andy emery the fourth one of the group that doesnt make any difference declared flemming he is taking a run with pierson and that proves what i told yates you all know how that chap undermined me on the crew i dont say that he cant row mind you i do not claim that i could have done any better than he did but i do claim that he is full of such sneaking underhand tricks and i knew he was trying for something when i saw him stop pierson on the campus today yates was silent staring along the street down which the two runners had disappeared come old man cried flemming slapping yates on the back lets go into moreys and sit down where we can have a drink and talk this matter over duncan shook his head i wont go in there he said why not i am in training you know and somebody would see me drinking there that would kick up some talk well will you go anywhere yes ill go somewhere that we can sit down in a quiet room where there is no chance that fellows who know me will drop in i feel just like having something i know the very place declared flemming come on then the quartet moved away flemming leading in the meantime merriwell and pierson had continued on their way as had been agreed pierson set the pace at first he ran along at a gentle trot but by the time the outskirts of new haven were reached he had begun to increase his speed now he thought ill put merriwell to the test and i do not fancy he will be in condition to make a very hot run on the return faster and faster went paul and still the lad at his side kept there with apparent ease with their clinched hands held close to their breasts and their heads thrown back they ran on and on there was a slice of a moon in the western sky shedding a thin white light over the world from far to the south came the shrill whistle of a locomotive cutting through the air like a keen knife the road which pierson had selected was one over which there was considerable travel and it was in very fair condition without appearing to do so paul slyly kept watch of merriwell wishing to see just how frank stood the strain he was forced to acknowledge that for a time at least merriwell was standing it very well oh he is endeavoring to show me how easy he can do it mentally exclaimed paul wait wait a bit i think i will give him a hot push for a bit faster and faster ran pierson and soon he was rather gratified to hear frank beginning to breathe heavily yes although paul had hoped that merriwell would show up well he did feel a momentary sense of satisfaction when it seemed that he was making the pace a hot one for his companion then frank began to lag he did not fall far behind paul and still he seemed unable to keep his place at piersons side i wont do a thing to him coming back decided paul browning was dead wrong the fellow is capable of short dashes but he is not the man for a long run i am rather sorry at last he decided that they had gone far enough into the country and so he turned about without stopping calling to frank now for the hustle into town and lets see what you are made of my boy i am going to run away from you as if you were standing still i wouldnt do that flung back merriwell as he wheeled about somehow it seemed to paul that there was a touch of sarcasm in the way frank uttered the words that aroused the committeeman still more and he retorted no you wouldnt do it because you couldnt but i am going to all right laughed frank i dont suppose there is any danger that somebody will steal me for my beauty if you leave me alone out here in the country go ahead and run away from me goodby goodby then pierson did run he skimmed over the ground in a wonderful manner but the sound of running feet clung close behind him and when he glanced over his shoulder merriwell was still there hanged if he doesnt hold on well mentally exclaimed paul then as he glanced around it began to seem that merriwell was running with still greater ease than he had at any previous time somehow it appeared as if he was keeping close behind pierson without any particular effort youre doing well paul finally flung over his shoulder can you keep it up i think so was the halflaughing answer i am holding myself in so that i can make an attempt to follow you a short distance when you get ready to run away from me great smoke thought paul is he guying me or does he fancy i have not been doing my best after a little he confessed i am beginning to think that wont be an easy trick merriwell you will not be far behind when we reach your room at this frank suddenly came up beside paul judging by the way you talk you are somewhat out of wind he said not at all declared pierson then i presume you are in condition for a little dash oh of course but you may beat yourself out if you crowd yourself too hard think so sure better not oh i think ill chance it come on old man lets tear up some dust then frank spurted pierson set his teeth and made a desperate effort to keep up but despite his determination not to fall behind he found that merriwell was steadily and surely drawing away come on called frank in a rather tantalizing manner it cant be that you are going to let me run away from you paul did not answer whats the matter called frank again are you ill still no answer well you are not sociable at all laughed the lad in advance tauntingly i dont seem to like your company and so i think i will move along goodby with that pierson could see that the tantalizing fellow actually made an increase of speed confound him grated paul i believe he was fooling me all along when he seemed to be having a hard time to keep up all that panting and heavy breathing was put on it was decidedly humiliating to be jollied in such a manner but paul found he could not hold his own with frank and he finally gave up the struggle still he continued to run on thinking that the lad ahead would use up his wind by such a burst of speed and believing there was a possibility of overtaking merriwell before south middle was reached this did not happen however and when paul burst into franks room he found rattleton there listening to a funny story that merriwell was telling and merriwell he had his feet resting comfortably on the top of a table while he lay back in an easychair looking remarkably cool as if he had not lately made a run of several miles more than that he had changed his clothes as the suit he had on was not the same he had worn during the run paul staggered in and dropped limply on the couch staring at frank as if he saw a ghost look here merriwell he panted what are you made of are you run by steam oh no laughed frank i beg your pardon for leaving you in such a manner but you know you had become so very unsociable that i had to do pierson made a weak gesture and interrupted with dont apologize for that it was the agreement that one should run away from the other if possible on the way back you had a right to do it what is all this about asked rattleton in a mystified manner what have you fellows been doing dont you know cried paul amazed no i dont know declared rattleton frank walked into the room a short time ago went into his bedroom took a sponge bath and changed his clothes and we have been telling stories since then took a sponge bath shouted pierson popping bolt upright jerusalem you talk as if he had been here half an hour i will admit that this beats anything i ever experienced then he flopped down on the couch again as if utterly overcome chapter xxxi an incentive to win paul pierson had made a discovery that night and before he left he told frank merriwell to put himself into condition to enter one of the races at the madison square garden tournament in new york you seem to be in pretty good condition now he said with a grim smile but you know whether you can improve your condition or not if you can do it for you are liable to be pitted against men who will give you a decidedly hotter time than you have ever struck all right said frank quietly youll find that i shall be in shape and ill do my best to be a credit to old yale you have been a credit to yale ever since the day you entered college said pierson sincerely tonight has settled one thing in my mind i believe you are a wonder in almost anything in the way of athletics oh not a wonder said frank but you can be sure that i am bound to do my level best in anything i attempt i know it i am not sure ill be able to get you on but i am going to try to run you into the onemile race we have some men for the shorter dashes but do not seem to have but one man besides yourself who can be considered for the mile run he has been in training for some time and the committee had nearly decided on him now i am satisfied that you are the better man but ill have to satisfy the others i want you to bear witness that i have not worked to fill the place of any other fellow it might be better for yale if you would work for such things growled pierson you will not find other fellows holding back if any chap is capable of filling your place at anything you may be sure he will fill it and hell never stop to consider your feelings about the matter that is rust jite i mean just right cried rattleton approvingly well i am going to my rooms and take a rub down said paul goodnight fellows goodnight mr pierson when the door had closed behind paul rattleton executed a grotesque dance on the carpet whoop he softly cried didnt i knock him silly when i pretended not to know anything about the run this evening oh wheejiz er jeewhiz he nearly fainted when i told him you calmly walked into the room took a sponge bath put on another suit and then we had been telling stories you rascal cried frank laughing and giving harry a shake that was all your own work i didnt know you were thinking of running such a bluff on him never thought of it myself till he came in chuckled harry between us we managed to get you out of your other clothes give you a quick rub and jump you into a fresh suit before pierson showed up it has been a very enjoyable evening smiled frank as he again deposited himself on the easychair if i had planned to have sport with pierson i could not have worked it better you should have heard me panting and puffing along behind him on our way out you should have heard him bidding me goodby when we started to come back and then you should have heard me asking him if he was ill when i got ready to leave him harry laughed in the heartiest manner as his imagination supplied the picture it is too good he cried and you will go into the mile run sure browning caused pierson to tackle you it seems that i have done pretty well in athletic matters this spring said frank and i was rather indifferent concerning the matter of taking any prominent part in the tournament at madison square however if i can do anything to uphold the standard of old eli i want to do my best frank if you run in that race you will win came soberly from harrys lips i shall stake every dollar i can rake on you if you do win ill have enough cash to take me through the summer vacation we have planned the door had been softly opened and the most of rattletons speech was overheard by a third person who now exclaimed and im going to bank my cash on you merriwell if you win ill ill why hang me ill make that trip across the continent with you it was bruce browning who advanced into the room are you in earnest about that bruce asked frank you bet i am in earnest was the assurance you will try to pump a bicycle from new york to san francisco try it confound it i tell you ill do it if you win the mile run for old yale then said frank i have a double object to work for and i am going to win if it is in my body to do so rattleton was astonished to see browning show so much animation why you actually appear like your old self he exclaimed bruce sat down tell me about it he invited speaking to frank some of the fellows said they saw you and pierson chasing yourselves and i caught what rattleton was saying just as i came in frank told bruce all about the night run and a lazy smile spread over the fat lads round face as he listened thats one on pierson he exclaimed he thinks he is unequalled when it comes to a longdistance run and ill wager something that you have fixed him so he will fight to get you into that race i can see him bidding you farewell ha ha ha and then i can see him when you took your turn ha ha ha bruce laughed in a hearty manner and for some time they talked over the events of the evening what sort of a fellow is yates asked frank ive never met him to have a talk with him oh he isnt half bad answered bruce in a somewhat noncommittal manner i presume he will feel injured if i am chosen to run instead of him what if he does thats none of your business chapter xxxii the run to the station the final ball game of the series between harvard and yale was to take place at springfield the day of the game arrived and there was an exodus from yale there was a rush for the last train by which the college lads could reach springfield in time to witness the whole of the game on their way to the station frank and harry fell in with jack diamond and danny griswold weve got to hurry said diamond glancing at his watch there is no time to waste if we want to catch the train they soon overtook flemming emery and yates these fellows were in the company of several other lads among whom were two of the committee of arrangements for the tournament you fellows seem to be in a great rush one of the party called to frank and his friends you had better rush a little if you want to catch the train flung back griswold ah said andy emery with an undisguised sneer its merriwell and his trainers they are putting him in condition to beat the field in that race he expects to enter go him to the station yates exclaimed one of the lads accompanying duncan just show him he doesnt know how to run yah flung back griswold quick as a flash yates knows better than to try that where would he be when merriwell reached the station buying his ticket inside sneered emery in return that aroused jack diamond who flushed hotly and turned on andy ill go you ten even that merriwell beats yates to the station platform he flashed producing a roll of bills this is business take me if you have the nerve oh ill take you cried emery and when the business is over ill take your money too he promptly produced a tendollar bill and the money was quickly thrust into the hands of a stakeholder who was chosen by mutual agreement it strikes me you men are pretty swift said yates in a manner that showed his disapproval how do you know i will run sh warned flemming youll have to run now or theyll say you were afraid to go against merriwell it was plain that yates did not feel at all pleased by the situation but he said if i must run i will and ill beat the fellow but i dont care about getting into a sweat just now never mind that said emery in yates ear if you beat merriwell to the station it is pretty sure that you spoil his show for getting into the mile run this is your chance to do that little job so dont let it slip frank had said very little it was not easy to tell if he felt satisfied or displeased over the situation the party turned a corner and came in view of the station here is a good starting point said emery does it satisfy you diamond perfectly bowed jack then thats all right are you going to run fellows i leave that entirely to mr yates said frank quietly oh ill go you and ill do you exclaimed yates as he tore off both coat and vest and flung them at flemming who caught them that started rattleton who excitedly cried ill tet you ben dollars i mean ill bet you ten dollars you dont do it yates paid no attention to this but flemming said ill have to go you rattleton put up the tenner the money was quickly posted and then the rivals stood side by side with their coats and vests removed ready for the word merriwell seemed quiet and indifferent as if it were an event of no particular moment while on yates face there was a look that plainly showed he was determined to settle all dispute by winning the dash to the station one of the committee had been chosen to give the word and he stepped out sharply calling ready the lads leaned forward over the scratch in the dirt which had been drawn by somebodys heel go away shot the rivals like leaping fawns they seemed like two foxes and the crowd of lads who broke away in pursuit resembled a pack of hounds it was a hot dash and for some time the boys were running side by side neither seeming to have an advantage wait a bit panted emery at diamonds side youll soon see yates spurt and leave merriwell what do you think merriwell will be doing while yates is spurting asked jack sarcastically hell seem to be standing still will he wait and see the rivals were drawing near the station and still it seemed that they were keeping side by side now they are spurting yes they were spurting for the finish but to the amazement of yates friends a single bound had seemed to carry frank merriwell two yards in advance of the other runner and this advantage merriwell maintained in another moment the station would be reached and the race must end seeing this andy emery was bitterly grinding out an exclamation of rage and disgust suddenly yates seemed to trip and fall heavily he tried to spring up but seemed to be hurt and he was struggling to rise when flemming reached the spot and lifted him to his feet are you hurt asked several as they gathered around duncan not much he answered rather thickly but i lost the dash by that fall rats muttered harry rattleton he had lost it before he fell i was ready to make the final spurt which would have carried me ahead of merriwell at the finish declared yates oh it is a case of beastly luck growled andy emery it is the way everything turns in merriwells favor he never wins except it is by cold luck oh come off chirped danny griswold youre sore thats all ails you shut up or ill wring your neck you cant catch me you know taunted the little fellow as he skipped out of reach on the station platform merriwell was quietly waiting the arrival of the others fanning himself with his handkerchief it happened that bruce browning was at the station and he had seen the race between the rivals in his ponderous manner he hurried to congratulate frank yates was a fool to try it declared bruce his round face seeming to expand into one broad grin he might have known what would happen i see crockett and gibbs two of the committee with the fellows they witnessed the whole business and it must have settled matters in their minds i wish yates had not fallen said frank with regret he did not fall accidentally and you can bet your greasy coin on that it was plain enough then you think just what that he saw he was beaten and fell so that he might make a claim that you outran him by accident i had the lead yes and he could not have recovered and overtaken you in a week but that makes no difference allee samee i rather fancy yates will not fool anybody very much the knot of fellows now approached the station where there was a great throng of yale lads who had seen the race yates was very pale but there was a burning light in his eyes he advanced straight to frank and distinctly said mr merriwell you beat me this time through an accident but i will run you again and ill win frank bowed with the utmost courtesy mr yates he said you will find me willing and ready to run with you any time whoopee squealed danny griswold turning a handspring thats business straight from headquarters here comes the train was the cry then there was a scramble for tickets and for seats on the train chapter xxxiii enemies at work it happened that merriwell and his friends entered the smoker they found bink stubbs curled up in a corner puffing away at a cigarette you seem to be well fixed stubbs said frank and the little fellow cheerfully returned oh ive got a snap as the bear said when he stepped into the steel trap then room was made for a jolly little party in the corner and all the fellows who smoked lighted up cigarettes or cigars ive got ten more to put on the game today cried rattleton gleefully and i took it out of flemming that is what pleases me the most jack diamond smiled it pleases me to say that i pulled a sawbuck out of emery he said he squirmed a little but it was too late to squeal well all come back with our clothes stuffed with money declared browning yale is sure to win today and that will put lots of fellows on their feet some of the boys have soaked everything they could rake together to get money to put on the game for heffiners arm is in great form and he says he will make monkeys of the harvard willies speaking about hocking things said bandy robinson i let my unc have a dozen white shirts among other things if yale doesnt win i wont have a shirt to my name thats nothing declared ben halliday nonchalantly as he blew out a big whiff of smoke ive soaked my entire wardrobe save what i have on my back but willis paulding did the slickest trick to raise the wind paulding cried diamond id never dreamed he could do anything very smooth he did just the same last year when merry pitched the deciding game of the series paulding felt sure harvard would win and he stuck on em every last rag of money he could rake and scrape well yale won and willis was busted he was forced to tell his old man the whole truth before he could get money enough to let him out of new haven for the summer more than that the old man has taken precautions to prevent willis from having any money to waste in betting this year he has all of willis bills sent to him to settle and keeps his son horribly short of filthy just as hard willis found out that the governor had told his tailor to make the boy all the clothes he wanted that was enough willis ordered six suits at fifty dollars each and he soaked every one of them at ten each as soon as he got them so you see paulding is provided with plenty of coin for this little racket and he says he is going to put every red he has on old yale last year cured him of betting against his own colors if willis thought of that scheme himself he has more brains in his head than i fancied smiled diamond tell you how i made a strike chirped danny griswold you know ive been writing a few things and giving them away to the papers well the governor heard of it and he decided i was making a fool of myself so he sat down and fired a shot at me he called my attention to the fact that johnson said the man who writes for anything but money is a fool this is the way i answered dear gov i observe you say some chap by the name of johnson says the man who writes for anything but money is a fool i quite agree with mr johnson please send me one hundred dollars that must have hit the old boy about right for he sent me fifty danny ended with a gleeful chuckle and the listening lads laughed thats pretty good for you nodded bink stubbs but speaking about clothes reminds me that i had a little lunch in a restaurant last evening and i found a button in the salad i called the waiters attention to it and he calmly said thats all right sir its part of the dressing now he has broken loose cried danny griswold there is no telling what sort of a rusty old gag hell try to spring if we only had a few stale eggs for him bink grinned as he observed theres nothing like poached eggs as the nigger said when he robbed the hencoop diamond proposed a song and soon the boys were at it when they had finished one song browning soberly observed it seems to me that there is one song which would be particularly appropriate for this season when all of us are soaking something in order to raise the wind what is it shouted several voices solomon levi in another moment the merry lads were shouting my name is solomon levi my stores on salem street thats where you buy your coats and vests and everything thats neat ive secondhanded ulsterettes and everything thats fine for all the boys they trade with me at a hundred and fortynine chorus oh solomon levi tra la la la poor sheeny levi tra la la la la la la la and if a bummer comes along to my store on salem street and tries to hang me up for coats and vests so very neat i kick that bummer right out of my store and on him sets my pup for i wont sell clothing to any man who tries to hang me up thus the rollicking lads spent the time as the train rolled along bearing them to witness the great ball game of the season with harvard again and again frank merriwells friends expressed regret because his hand on which there had been a felon prevented him from taking part in the game they could not forget that he had pitched the deciding game between yale and harvard the previous year and had won it frank had also done some good work during the present season and sporting papers all over the country had declared that he was one of the very best college twirlers this however was hugh heffiners last year at yale and without doubt the coming game was the last he would ever pitch for old eli until merriwell appeared heffiner had been yales mainstay in the box and his admirers declared that it was pretty sure that a long time would elapse before he would have a worthy successor but heffiner was overworked and he came near throwing his arm out as it was he strained his arm so that he was utterly unable to pitch at all then it was that it was found necessary to find somebody to assist the change pitcher dad hicks in his work hicks was good for four or five innings but he was unable to keep up the strain through an entire game paul pierson captain and manager of the yale nine had seen merriwell do some pitching for the freshmen and he resolved to give frank a trial piersons judgment was not at fault and merriwell quickly proved that he was worthy to become heffiners successor of course there was much regret because frank could not be on the bench at least ready to go into the game if needed but all seemed to feel confident that heffiner would make his last game for yale a hot one he had done some marvelous work and as he declared himself in prime condition there was no reason why he should not hold harvard down on this occasion while merriwell was surrounded by friends in the smoker and the boys were having a decidedly jolly time duncan yates was getting into a decidedly ugly mood in the adjoining car when yates thought of his failure to beat his rival in the dash to the station he ground his teeth and muttered bitter curses and he was egged on by fred flemming and andy emery tom thornton had joined the group but he said very little and when he found an opportunity he whispered in flemmings ear better go slow remember the promise we gave merriwell if he finds out we are working against him it will go hard with us he wont find it out i hate him too much to keep still if i can arouse another fellow against him give me your flask yates has killed all i have in mine thornton took a whiskey flask from his pocket and slipped it into flemmings hand then he left for he did not wish merriwells friends to see him in such company flemming and emery made a pretense of drinking with yates but they did not take much yates however continued to hit the bottle hard his face became flushed and his eyes glowed as flemming continued to tell him of merriwells underhand work that fellow did me dirt declared flemming in this same sneaking way he had me dropped from the crew this spring and got on in my place thats right agreed emery he has a way of influencing such men as he can get at and he is using his influence to get the committee to throw you over and he cant run with you anyway said flemming it is possible that he can lead you in a short dash like the race to the station today but he would not be in it in a long run that race was one of his tricks asserted emery i believe the job was put up by him how asked yates huskily why he saw you in company with the rest of us and he thought he stood a good show of outrunning you for a short spurt so he had diamond and rattleton make the talk that they did to bring the race about if that was not crooked i dont know what you could call it nodded flemming he sprung it on you when you were not suspecting and he led you to go against him for a short run in which he is at his best all the time he knew he was not your match for a long race that doesnt make a bit of difference to him not a bit said andy he is not looking for the good of old yale but he is looking to get into the big race at the tournament he has been lucky in everything he has tried and he is depending on his luck to win the race and acquire further glory for himself lets have another drink all round suggested flemming as he produced thorntons flask once more yates took several swallows emery and flemming pretended to drink in a hearty manner but they allowed very little whiskey to go down their throats this drink seemed to be the one that aroused yates to action he suddenly jumped to his feet and there was a fierce look on his face as he cried come on what are you going to do asked flemming quickly thrusting the flask into his pocket i am going to find frank merriwell came hoarsely from yates lips chapter xxxiv baseball there was a crush in the rear end of the smoker a crowd had gathered there and the lads were singing shouting laughing and making merry in various ways some fellows were sitting on the backs of the seats the trainmen could not drive them down it was useless to try with such a set of lads danny griswold was astride the shoulders of dismal jones who was the only solemnlooking man in the car occasionally jones would break out in his peculiar campmeeting revivalists style and would deliver fragments of a sermon on the frivolous things of the world each time he was quickly suppressed however into the midst of this jolly crowd came a lad whose face was flushed and whose eyes were gleaming strangely his lips curled back over his set teeth and he seemed to quiver with a strange eagerness let me through he growled forcing his way along there is a fellow here i want to see there was something in his voice that caused them to give him room to advance till he was standing directly in front of frank merriwell then his hands clinched and as he tried to speak he choked with passion so that words failed him a sudden hush came over the throng for they saw that there was trouble impending its yates somebody muttered the words and they seemed to break the spell that had fallen on the enraged lad who was glaring at frank yes it is yates he snarled i suppose all you fellows are frank merriwells chums but that makes no difference to me he stopped a moment but he did not take his eyes from franks face he seemed to be gathering himself for the supreme effort merriwell he said his voice shaking you are a sneak every one expected frank would leap to his feet and strike yates but he did nothing of the kind the hot blood rushed to his face and then fled away again leaving him cold and pale about his firm jaws there was a sudden hardening and in turn he showed his teeth mr yates he said you are not complimentary i do not mean to be to such a fellow as you yates shot back you are insulting i am if the truth can be considered an insult i demand an explanation i do not propose to waste any breath in giving explanations to such as you you know why i say you are a sneak you know you are a sneak frank merriwell laughed that laugh was a warning that he was dangerous diamond knew it rattleton knew it they held themselves ready to make room when frank merriwell saw fit to act you put yourself in a bad light by calling a man a sneak and then refusing to tell why you call him that said frank yates did not know merriwell very well and that laugh had not sounded a warning to him instead it really seemed that frank was frightened and he had laughed to conceal the fact it is my conviction he cried that you are not only a sneak but you are also a coward if that is not enough i will make it still more forcible quick as a flash he struck frank in the face with his clinched fist a gasp came from those who witnessed this act there was no time given for further words like a leaping panther frank merriwell shot up and alighted on duncan yates he clutched yates in his strong grasp snapped him off his feet swung him into the air the spectators had fallen back in a wild sort of scramble to get out of the way thus enough room was made for merriwell to act it was a warm day and the car door was open almost before any one could tell what frank thought of doing he leaped out through the doorway and with the lad who had delivered the blow still poised above his head seemed on the verge of hurling yates from the flying train stop frank diamond shouted the words cries of horror broke from the lips of the other spectators of the scene but strangely enough none of them made a move to prevent merriwell from carrying out his apparent purpose if merriwell flung yates from the train the unfortunate lad who had aroused franks wrath must be instantly killed at first when he had felt himself clutched yates had struggled but to his amazement he seemed like a child in the grasp of the infuriated athlete as frank reached the platform and poised yates aloft the latter seemed to realize his peril and fear robbed him of nerve and strength he was limp and helpless in merriwells grasp and then almost as quickly as frank had caught the lad up he lowered him to his feet again merriwell laughed but this time there really seemed to be something of amusement in the sound if i had dropped you off mr yates you must have been injured he said and his voice was soft and gentle yates gasped jee chattered bink stubbs that was a regular hairraiser as the fellow said when he finished the bloodandthunder story yates swayed and caught at the iron rail the flush had gone out of his face which was ashengray better go into the car said merriwell you seem rather unsteady and you might fall off here without a word yates steadied himself by taking hold of the side of the door and entered the car merriwell followed taking out his handkerchief and pressing it lightly to the spot on his cheek where a slight bruise marked the spot that had felt the enraged lads fist the witnesses of this scene seemed to breathe freely for the first time they stared at frank as if his marvelous display of strength had been a revelation to them yates had plenty of friends as he had never seemed a bad sort of fellow but the fact that he had struck merriwell while the latter was sitting down was against him hes been drinking one declared merriwell could not have handled him that way otherwise did merriwell really mean to throw him off asked another there were some murmurs of disapproval at franks action but the expressions of astonishment and admiration for his display of strength drowned all other sounds yates turned and looked at frank but he seemed unable to express his feelings by means of words jack diamond was flushed with rage it would have served the fellow right if merriwell had dropped him off declared the hotblooded southerner andy emery was near at hand but he had been unable to give yates any assistance when the latter was grasped by frank good heavens he kept repeating as he stared at frank merriwell in a manner that showed his unutterable amazement it was plain that such a display of strength had been a revelation to him and from that time emery was bound to regard merriwell with renewed respect mr yates said frank quietly this is no place to settle any quarrel that has arisen between us but i wish to say before witnesses that i consider you entirely in the wrong and certainly you owe me an apology you may not think so now but i believe you will think so in time that was all he returned to his seat and sat down yates seemed to hesitate and then turned away accompanied by emery flemming had kept himself in the background during the entire affair when the train reached springfield yates was in no condition to go to the ball ground he had taken too much whiskey to carry and his pretended friends flemming and emery were forced to get him out of sight as soon as possible that ought to be a settler for him said diamond a fellow who is in training for a race cant afford to get loaded yale men had heavily backed their own club to win and it seemed that the majority of the harvard crew was trying to put money on the blue it was expected by harvard that merriwell would pitch the deciding game for the actual condition of his hand had been kept a secret and harvard feared merriwell to himself frank confessed that he could pitch the game as his hand was in fairly good condition but such improvement had not been expected and it had been arranged that he should do no twirling besides that it was heffiners last game for yale and taking into consideration the record he had made it seemed no more than right that he should be placed in the box the usual crowd had gathered to witness the game and there was the usual display of flags yale was overconfident harvard was hopeful but filled with fears the game began and for three innings yale had the advantage the sons of old eli were jubilant and they made the air ring with their cheers and songs at the end of the third inning it was seen that harvard must make a change if it had any hope of winning yedding the great cambridge pitcher was rocky he could not find the plate and he was hammered when he did get em over some yale man with an inclination to rhyme had composed some doggerel verse which about twenty lads were singing to some sort of mongrel tune poor harvard she can talk thats all at other things shell balk well beat her in a walk hurrah hurrah hurrah poor harvards lost her grip thats so shes let the pennant slip weve done her up this trip hurrah hurrah hurrah it is altogether too early in the game to crow declared frank merriwell several things may happen before the ninth inning is over oh weve got the game nailed solid now declared bruce browning in a satisfied way robinson will be able to get his shirts out of soak in the fourth inning harvard sent a new pitcher into the box it was coulter who as a freshman had pitched against merriwell coulter was nervous and rather wild at first but he puzzled the yale men who could not hit him when he did get them over the plate if he steadies down he will prove to be a bad man said frank soberly this is his first trial on the regular team and he is not at his best just now yale secured one score in the fourth inning while harvard retired with her third whitewash in the fifth there was a change coulter did steady down in a most astonishing manner for he sent the yale men to the bench in onetwothree order that seemed to give harvard new life and when she came to bat she showed a determination to do something right there was where heffiner took a streak of wildness and harvard scored three times coulter kept up his work in the sixth by allowing but one short single to be taken off his delivery and no yale man got further than second base then it seemed that harvard came to the plate with a determination to pound it out the defenders of the crimson jumped on heffiners curves and the way they banged the leather gave the yale crowd symptoms of heart failure a single a twobagger and a homer in quick succession caused heffiner to develop a bad case of rattles and it seemed that harvard would never let up there was consternation in the yale ranks when harvard tied the score with but one man out and that consternation threatened to become a panic when two more scores came in old man hicks was set at work warming up although it was felt that he must be a desperate resort when harvard scored again hicks was sent into the box the change seemed to work well for harvards score getting was brought to an abrupt termination but yale was in a desperate situation for at the beginning of the seventh harvard was three scores in the lead merriwell had been on the point of going down and offering to do what he could to check harvards wild career but it seemed that old man hicks had done that and so he sat still but yale could not score coulter seemed to feel that the opportunity of his life had arrived and he sent the spaldings over the plate with all sorts of twists the yale men could not make fair and satisfactory connections with the ball so no man reached home hicks was lucky and he succeeded in scattering the hits which with fine support enabled him to retire harvard with another gooses egg the eighth inning was disastrous for the blue although yale won a score by hard base running when harvard took her turn she seemed to fathom dad hicks delivery and for a short time he was treated quite as bad as heffiner had been at the end of the eighth inning harvard was six scores ahead and it was plain that the game was lost for yale scores of sadfaced yale spectators were heard expressing regret that frank merriwell had not been used in the game some of the wearers of the blue left the field immediately unwilling to witness the termination of the game with despair set upon their faces the yale men went to the bat ready to fight to the last gasp but coulter was also determined not to let slip any of the glory he had won and all yales efforts to score were fruitless the game ended with harvard still six in the lead phil coulter was the hero of harvard that night while poor hugh heffiner returned to new haven with his heart almost bursting with disappointment chapter xxxv kidnaped well down harvard in everything at the tournament was the angry resolve of the disappointed yale crowd who returned to new haven to find no band and no great gathering of cheering students awaiting them at the station among them all not excepting hugh heffiner himself no one felt worse about the defeat than did frank merriwell in his heart he blamed himself for not going to the manager of the yale team and offering his services in case of emergency he knew it was possible he might not have been able to save the game but still the possibility that he might have done so bore heavily upon him but frank did not dream that his enemies would make capital out of the fact that he had not taken any part in the game he did not know they were saying he had kept among the spectators where he could not be found when things seemed to turn against yale merriwell didnt dare pitch any part of that game they were saying he was afraid and he knew it would dim his glory if harvard won he has his record and you wont see him pitching out any games in order to pull yale out of a hole but yates had ruined his chance of running in the mile race at the tournament by getting full on the train directly after the next meeting of the committee of arrangements frank was notified that he had been chosen to represent yale each night frank took a run out into the country he was determined to put himself in the very best condition possible this practice of merriwells was generally known and he was watched with interest by friends and foes the time for the tournament drew near arrangements for all the contests had been completed the end of the spring terms had come commencement was over and another class had been showered with sheepskins in all the doings of this busy time of the college year merriwell took little part as he was putting himself in shape to do his best at the tournament and the time he had to spare from grinding was given to hard physical work then he went down to a summer cottage on the sound the cottage was located near southport and there he continued his training taking long runs into the country the day before the great tournament came at last that afternoon frank took his last run in training he waited till near evening and then jogged gently out along the country road it was dusk when he turned back toward the cottage where he knew bruce browning rattleton and diamond were loafing on the veranda and awaiting his reappearance as he was passing through a small patch of woods a cord that was strung across the road about six inches from the ground tripped him and he fell heavily frank was stunned by the shock before he could recover dark forms rushed out and flung themselves upon him frank realized that he had been attacked and he tried to make a fight of it but the shock of the fall had taken away his strength and then he found there were three against him work lively growled a hoarse voice hes worse than a tiger in a scrap his hands were twisted about behind his back and held there while a cord was bound about them in a remarkably brief space of time he was rendered helpless then franks feet were bound and he was forced to submit to the tying of a blindfold over his eyes before this was accomplished however he saw the three men through the gloom and discovered that all wore masks to hide their faces when frank was blindfolded the man who had given all the commands and who seemed to be the leader said bring out the team franks ears told him that one of the men went away and soon by the sound the boy decided that a team was being brought from some place in the woods where it had been concealed what sort of a job is this thought the captive lad it seems to be a case of real highwaymen right here in connecticut and still they do not seem like highwaymen for then they would have robbed me and let me go they are up to something else he soon found that his captors meant to remove him from the spot for he was lifted from the ground and tossed into the bottom of the wagon like a sack of grain then the men climbed in the horses were whipped up and away they all went after a drive of at least two hours during which frank had several times asked where they were taking him and had been repeatedly cautioned to shut up the team came to a halt frank was glad of it for much of the distance had been made over rough roads and he had been several times menaced in order to keep him quiet and once choked into silence by two of the men who sat upon him while they passed another team frank was taken from the wagon his feet were set at liberty and he was marched into some sort of a building there said the hoarse voice of the leader hes safe and solid here through the blindfold there was a glow of light and then the cloth was removed from his eyes frank found himself in a rough room to which there seemed to be no windows and but one door in the room there was a table a broken chair and a rude sort of bed one of the two men who had brought him into the room coolly sat down astride the chair and stared at frank his eyes gleaming by the flaring light of the tallowdip that burned on the table set down invited the man making a motion toward the bed we offer our visitors the upholstered furniture out of courtesy make yourself at home dont care if i do returned the boy with equal coolness but in order for me to be thoroughly comfortable it will be necessary for me to have my hands free sorry i cant accommodate ye just now but i want to have a talk with yer first set down frank obeyed well he observed i suppose i might as well as long as i do not seem to have much to say about it but id like to know what this little game is thought youd be kinder curious said the man with a hoarse laugh well ye see its this way weve heard so much about you that we thought wed kinder like the pleasure of your company for a day or two and so we brought you over here a day or two frank gasped for breath as a sudden light dawned upon him if he were held there for a single day he would not appear at madison square garden to take part in the tournament this is the work of my enemies he mentally cried they have hired these ruffians to kidnap and hold me till the tournament is over cжsars ghost i never dreamed such a thing could be done in this quiet part of the new england states chapter xxxvi the tournament the interior of madison square garden was decorated with the colors of a dozen colleges and was aglow with hundreds of bright lights the rows of seats tier upon tier were packed with people the private boxes were all taken a band was playing a lively air and the tournament was on down in the great cleared space young men from the various prominent colleges of the country were struggling for victory in the athletic feats on the programme at times some wellknown amateur contestant was greeted by cheers as he appeared or accomplished a feat that was plainly remarkable the favorites were greeted by the yells of the colleges which they represented as they were seen preparing for some difficult attempt it was a scene of the greatest excitement and enthusiasm pretty girls were there in large numbers their faces glowing with admiration for the young men who were struggling like gladiators down in the modern arena the swell set of new york occupied the boxes fathers and mothers sisters and brothers cousins and aunts of the contestants were on hand watching with eagerness for the appearance of those in which their interest centered in some instances the parents of the young men engaged in the contests were plainly from the country their manners their dress their language indicated this it was a wonderful occasion for them and their hearts almost ceased beating when the favorite for whom they were watching showed himself and made his brave effort in some trial of strength and skill happy were they if he acquitted himself nobly the blue of old yale dominated one great section of seats and when a yale man won in some of the contests hundreds upon hundreds of stronglunged young men arose to their feet and sent the college slogan pealing forth while that great mass of blue fluttered and swayed as if swept by a fitful tempest it was yale against the field and old eli was acquitting herself nobly one of the private boxes was occupied by the hon andrew flemming and his family his wife and his two daughters were there in a corner of the box sat two lads who were talking earnestly in guarded tones they were tom thornton and andy emery thornton and emery had been entertaining fred flemmings sisters but now for the moment they had drawn aside and were earnestly discussing some point that seemed to interest them greatly it must be that the matter is settled and yates has been substituted for the one who is missing said thornton but it seems rather astonishing that flem should be so sure merriwell would not appear but he did seem sure nodded emery he told me over and over that merriwell would not be here to run and you must know enough of frank merriwell to be sure he would be here if he could get here even if he had to crawl on his knees thats right then what has happened to merriwell you tell i cant i know flemming would go to any extreme to carry out his desires in fact he is altogether too reckless and headstrong i knew he did not mean it when he told merriwell he was ready to bury the hatchet and i have felt that he was not talking to hear his own voice when he told us merriwell would not be on hand to race tonight at this moment fred flemming entered the box his face was flushed and there was a look of triumph in his eyes he spoke to his mother and then addressed himself to the two boys saying its all right some event below attracted the full attention of all in the box save the trio in one corner yates will run asked emery eagerly you bet your filthy nodded fred i told you he would but where is merriwell flemming smiled mysteriously it is evident he said that mr merriwell decided not to attend the tournament look here fred said thornton nervously you havent done anything that will get you into trouble have you flemming snapped his fingers what is it to me if merriwell sees fit to stay away he asked he may tell some sort of a wild story but it seems that he was afraid to appear and run all i ask of you fellows is that you keep your mouths closed on one point what is that i dont care to have you breathe to a living soul that i knew in advance that merriwell would not be on hand well not say a word about it yates had no idea that he might be called on i found it necessary to keep with him all the time and see that he did not get geared up then i had him where he could be found by the committee in case he was needed and and he was found he has gone to prepare for the race sure that settles it merriwell has failed to show up a wild yale cheer turned their attention to the arena at this moment big hickok was preparing to put the shot and he had been greeted in this manner by his admirers as he stepped out hickok was a giant and yale had the utmost confidence in him thus far the best record made by any other man was fortyone feet and five inches hickok must do his very best to beat that the cheers died away as the yale goliath poised himself for the effort he crouched and then the heavy iron sailed through the air and fell with a thud to the ground the tape was quickly drawn and then the score went up fortytwo feet and three inches once more yale let herself loose and it seemed that the roof must crack hickok quietly declined to take the two remaining trials open to him he was the last man on the list and yale had won the hammerthrowing was to follow and he was entered for the contest in the hammerthrowing contest yale had another opportunity to yell for hickok was again the winner over all others making a record of one hundred and twentythree feet and nine inches the contests followed each other in swift succession and yale more than held her own there was no reason why the wearers of the blue should not be jubilant at last the races came on up in the flemming box were three lads who were anxiously awaiting the announcement of the onemile run despite the triumph which he felt fred flemming betrayed a sort of hilarious nervousness as he chatted with his sisters and his friends watching fred closely tom thornton saw that he was under a strain and again thornton wondered what had become of frank merriwell princeton won one of the shorter races and harvard won another in each of these a yale man was second if mr merriwell had contented himself with being less ambitious he might be here tonight said flemming in an aside to his college comrades emery and thornton exchanged glances there was a significance about such language that could not be misunderstood thornton shivered a bit and unconsciously drew back from flemming the excitement of the evening was at its highest pitch thus far the contestants for yet another race were getting into position and in another moment they were off like a pack of greyhounds this time a yale man carried his colors to victory and the sons of old eli yelled their approval and delight yale was doing nobly this night she was making a record for herself that would be remembered but now came the greatest race of all the mile run preparations were made for it and feverish anticipation swayed the great multitude fred flemming was literally quivering as he leaned over the rail of the box lets give yatsie a great sendoff he exclaimed they are coming out in a minute he was watching the point where the runners must first appear his hand shook on the rail the runners appeared the first was beatty the harvard man and the harvard crowd hoorahed hoarsely then came mansford of princeton and the tigers let themselves loose jetting of dartmouth followed and the new hampshire lads greeted him in a manner that brought the blood to his cheeks then little judd the u p man trotted out and he was received with howls of delight from the quakers now now comes yates cried fred flemming the yale man appeared and flemming stood up to cheer he dropped into his seat as if he had been shot his face turning ashen gray and the cheer dying on his lips good heavens gasped tom thornton it is frank merriwell but his exclamation was drowned by the mighty cheer which greeted the appearance of the yale standardbearer chapter xxxvii to victory conclusion merriwell merriwell rah rah rah it was a mighty roar of voices then came the wellknown yale yell which was repeated again and again the entire yale crowd was standing wildly waving hands hats flags handkerchiefs anything and everything that could be found to wave it was an ovation that might have gladdened the heart of an emperor it was not strange that the sound nerved the yale man to vow within himself to die in the effort to win for dear old eli if he could not win otherwise but up in one of the boxes not far from the starting point were three young men who were utterly overcome with amazement and consternation one of them had a face that was drawn and pale as if he had received a mortal wound whats it mean flem asked andy emery in freds ear merriwell is here have you been horsing us then for all that his parents and his sisters were present fred flemming ground out a bitter cry his voice shook and he choked as he answered you know as well as i what it means oh what luck he was utterly unmanned and his mother observing his pallor asked him if he had been suddenly taken ill he answered her with a snarl like a mad dog the five runners came down to the line just as they did so duncan yates burst into the flemming box what sort of a jolly business is this flemming he demanded his face pale with anger and then seeing there were ladies present he removed his cap and mumbled an apology fred did not introduce yates he was too much broken up to think of such a thing thats what id like to know he said helplessly you know we were told merriwell was not on hand to run but he showed up in time to dress and i was coolly informed that i wasnt in it i object to such treatment and i want to know if it was a job on me if it was a job ill give you my word i know nothing about it said fred in a weak and humble manner at this moment as they looked down frank merriwell was seen to gaze straight toward them and something like a scornful triumphant smile flitted across his face id like to strangle him grated flemming the runners were preparing for the start pistol in hand the starter stood ready to give the signal his voice was heard bidding them make ready a moment later the pistol cracked and the runners leaped away oh if hell come in the tailender panted fred flemming the band was playing its liveliest air and the runners sped around the track like fawns graceful fellows they were with the possible exception of little judd judd started off bravely however seeming to scoot into the lead like a squirrel his short legs fairly twinkling the u p crowd let out a great cheer to encourage the little fellow beatty of harvard was likewise a quick starter and he was right at judds heels while mansford and merriwell got away side by side jetting the dartmouth representative was slow about starting but still he was a runner it had been expected that other colleges would take part in this race but for certain reasons there were but five starters around the track ran the lithelimbed youngsters with judd holding the lead for two laps then he was passed by beatty who spurted to get to the front and this gave harvard an opportunity to hoorah from the very outset it seemed that merriwell and mansford were in for a neckandneck match they clung together in a singular manner for a time the five runners were well bunched but there came a stringing out at last little judd began to lag and jetting who had pushed past merriwell and mansford went by the u p man and began to crowd beatty the new hampshire boys cheered him on and the sound of the yell he loved to hear got into his head and worked his undoing otherwise jetting must have been a dangerous man for the leaders at the finish as it was he pumped himself out some seconds too soon at the first quarter harvard led and she was still leading with dartmouth second when the first half was passed then came a fierce struggle for the lead which ended with the weakening of both beatty and jetting beatty weakened first however and fell back but jetting was seen to stagger a bit recover and go on merriwell and mansford passed beatty and narrowed the gap between them and jetting mansford set his teeth and gained an advantage of ten feet by a quick break this advantage he was resolved to hold jetting fought like a tiger to hold the lead but mansford crowded him harder and harder finally going to the front then came a desperate struggle between merriwell and jetting but yales colors were carried into second place at the beginning of the last quarter and now now there was excitement the finish was drawing near and princeton had the lead although the distance was short as frank passed the yale crowd he was given a rousing cheer which seemed to put fresh life and strength into his body he crept up on mansford who was running like the wind the difference grew less and less eight feet six feet four feet could he close the gap then for a moment a black cloud seemed to pass before franks eyes his heart was in his mouth where it lay hot and dry like a stone that has baked in the sun it seemed that he must fall win or die win or die those words rang through his head as if some one had shouted them into his ear i will he knew the end was close at hand and still the black and yellow was before him then it was that frank nerved himself for one last great effort and dashed forward with a fresh burst of speed that seemed little short of marvelous that burst carried him to mansfords side carried him into the lead carried him over the line at the finish a winner there was a grand supper in new york that night at which frank merriwell was the guest of honor he was toasted again and again by his admiring friends and it seemed that everybody was his friend at last there were speeches and songs and a general merry time old yale had carved her way to glory once more and among her standardbearers merriwell was the leader tell us tell us old man cried paul pierson how was it that you happened to be so late in appearing at the garden really we had given up hope that you would come and were for getting yates into running rig you barely got along in time what kept you away i was unavoidably detained answered frank smiling yes but that is an unsatisfactory explanation rattleton and the fellows who were with you reported your mysterious disappearance and we were for putting detectives on the case tomorrow cant you clear up the mystery well you see it is like this i fell in with some gentlemen who seemed to take a strong interest in me note the word strong there in fact they were too strong for me they seemed to like me exceedingly well and they pressed me to stay all night with them i was sort of roped into it as it were i found it difficult to get away without wounding their feelings this was said in a queer manner and the lads about the table looked at each other inquiringly but you managed to get away said pierson yes i offered them inducements in the shape of coin of the realm they seemed to be out for stuff and some person who must love me dearly had induced them to take charge of me and care for me tenderly however i worked on their greed by offering more than my friend had offered and as i promised not to make too much of a fuss about it i was let off but barely in time to reach here i am not going to say anything more about this matter just now but i expect to look around some and find out who my friend is who engaged the gentlemen to care for me so tenderly when i find him well i wont do a thing to him well heres luck to you cried pierson lifting his glass gentlemen heres luck to frank merriwell the best allaround man who ever called dear old yale alma mater drink drink hearty a few words more and we will bring this story to a close frank was truly the hero of the college and it was many a day before his wonderful dash was forgotten by even the most indifferent of the students
