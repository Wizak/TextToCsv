the phantom city a doc savage adventure by kenneth robeson back cover doc savages greatest ordeal arabian thieves led by the diabolically clever mohallet set one fiendish trap after another for doc savage and his mighty five only doc with his superhuman mental and physical powers could have withstood this incredible ordeal of endurance which led from the cavern of the crying rock through the pitiless desert of rub al khali and its phantom city to a fight to the death against the last of a savage prehistoric race of whitehaired beasts chapter the submarine quest new york is a city of many races all nationalities are seen on her streets hence four brownskinned men walking down fifth avenue attracted no unusual notice they wore business suits neat and new but not gaudy this helped them to escape attention they kept in a tight cluster their eyes prowled alertly they were nervous but strangers from far places overawed by first sight of manhattans cloudpuncturing skyscrapers and canyon streets often act thus their subdued excitement failed to draw more than casually amused glances from pedestrians slight smiles aimed at the quartet would have faded to glassy loosejawed stares had their real character become known the four were as vicious a bevy of throatslitters as ever sauntered along one of new yorks cracks of brick and glass gothams machinegunning gangsters were babes compared to these four nervous brown men they were on a mission a mission which had slightest hint of it reached the police would have drawn a howling swarm of squad cars the slightly stiffbacked manner in which each man walked was due to a long flat sword in a sheath strapped tightly against his spine thin spikesnouted automatics were concealed expertly in their clothing within the past hour the tip of each blade and the lead nose of each bullet had been pressed ceremoniously into a piece of raw meat the chunk of red meat was one into which a highly venomous serpent had been goaded to sink its fangs repeatedly loading it with poison on other occasions these men had proved that a scratch from weapons treated thus was sufficient to cause nearly instant death it was night clouds scraped spongy gray flanks against the sharp tops of the tall buildings fflashing signs on broadway splashed pale colored luminance against the wadded vapor a thin gum of moisture covered streets and sidewalks it had rained at sundown an hour before the four men turned into a side street reached a darkened doorway and stopped before it the entry was shabby its frame was scratched and grooved where heavy merchandise had been taken in and out a large packing box obviously empty stood in the gloom out of the big box came a voice qawam bilaja it growled make haste conceal yourselves in this place our quarry may soon appear the quartet started for the box evidently with the idea of wedging themselves into it not here sons of dumb camels gritted the man in the box the doorway will be shelter enough it is best that i remain hidden here throughout not appearing at any time do not by your glances or actions betray my presence anta sami do you hear in guttural arabic the four muttered that they understood they arranged themselves in the murk reaching under their coat tails they produced their long swords the sheaths were tight enough to hold the weapons in place and they could be drawn downward in handy fashion fools their chief hissed from the box replace those there is to be no killing until we have the information we desire back into the spine scabbards went the blades each man being careful not to prick himself with the deadly tip of his weapon he is coming soon one man asked in arabic at any minute replied the man remaining unseen in the box watch the street to the left my sons how will we know him he is a big man wallah he is the biggest man you ever saw and his body is of a color and seeming hardness of a metal bronze a giant man of bronze the four peered down the street then drew back it is a dark street and full of bad smells a man muttered you are sure he will come this way directly across the street is a great steel door see you it naarn aiwah yes beyond that door is a garage where this bronze man keeps many cars in this street one is permitted to drive in only a single direction therefore he will come from the left the four men peered at the giant steel doors across the thoroughfare for the first time they noted the towering size of the building above it the structure was of shiny metal and expertly fitted gray masonry it shot upward nearly a hundred stories the bronze man lives there on the eightysixth floor said the voice in the box walah this fellow must have great wealth to live in a place like that he is a strange man this bronze one he is a being of mystery one about whom many fantastic tales are told his name is familiar to every one in the city the newspapers carry feature stories about him yet he is almost a legend for he does not show himself to the public and does not seek publicity but he has that which we want he has we have but to find where it is kept that is your job squatting like four brown owls the quartet kept unwinking eyes fixed to the left down the somber street have you found aught of the escaped whitehaired girl asked the man in the packing case no trace master but our comrades search everywhere taiyib malihi very well she must be caught and brought back to my yacht it is well none in this city can understand the language she speaks a man said thoughtfully only you enlightened one can converse with her and it took you even with your learning many days to master a few words of her tongue watch the street snapped the hidden man draw your guns but use them only to produce fright one fellow muttered the girl should be slain fool we may need her to guide us to this phantom city we keep her alive and unharmed understand that if something happens to a hair of her white head allah help the man responsible the four squatting men drifted uneasy glances at the box as if it held a dangerous monster they feared this master of theirs the bronze man whose arrival we await is he the only one we have crossed the ocean to see one fellow mumbled he is the one said the voice in the box he is doc savage two blocks distant a limousine cruised to a street intersection and turned left the car was long expensive somber in color there was nothing flashy about it the windows were up the traffic cop on the corner glanced at the license tags he snapped erect in new york low license numerals designate the cars of the influential this one was a single figure the officer squinted to see who was in the machine he smiled widely and executed a brisk salute several pedestrians who chanced to gaze at the car fell to staring jaws slack each of them recognized instantly the limousine occupant at the next corner a fat man stepped back to the curb to let the big machine pass he got a good look at the man behind the wheel he nearly dropped a bundle he was carrying for the love of mud he breathed an enterprising newsboy witnessing the incident rushed up and offered the portly man a newspaper wanta read about that guy mister he asked eagerly buy an evening comet its got a feature story about him tells how he just cleaned up a gang that was terrorizing a manufacturing town who is he the newscarrier looked disgusted mister i thought everybody knowed that man why he went into this manufacturing town of prosper city with his five helpers and mopped up an outfit that had murdered no tellin how many people he does them kind of things regular helpin people who need it and punishin wrongdoers is his profession the stout man blinked was that doc savage you said it the limousine rolled on two blocks and turned into the gloomy side street which led past the giant spire of gleaming metal and gray stone which housed doc savages quarters it neared the recess where the brown men lurked taal grunted one of the swarthy quartet come along the four leaped into the street spread fan fashion and rushed they flourished their longbarreled automatics wallah hissed one truly this man is of amazing appearance a faint glow from the dash was sufficient to disclose the man at the limousine wheel the only occupant of the car the features of this individual were striking so remarkable that it was very apparent why a few seconds ago the fat man had been awed by his single glimpse the figure behind the wheel was that of a giant sculptured from solid bronze in the metallic mans neck in the great hands on the wheel huge sinews stood out in repose like bundled cables the bronze of the hair was a shade darker than the bronze of the skin the hair lay straight and smooth like a metallic skullcap the unusually high forehead the lean corded cheeks the muscular mouth advertised a rare power of character most striking were the eyes like pools of flake gold glistening in the vague light their gaze seemed to have a hypnotic quality an intensity almost weird get your hands up gritted one of the arabs in fair english doc savage studied the four his bronze features did not change expression the quartet might have been putting on some kind of a show for all the excitement he showed his hands remained on the wheel the body of the limousine was armorplate steel although the fact was not evident to the casual glance the windows were an inch thick of the latest bulletproof glass it would take a steel slug from a tank rifle to get through them he spoke in a low voice not moving his lips his words were distinct four men he said they look like arabs they popped out of a doorway with pistols the dark gunman quartet saw no lip movement indicating speech they heard no words the limousine was soundproofed against normal noises anta sami rapped the spokesman do you hear get your hands up doc continued still without moving his lips these fellows are strangers think ill play along and see whats on their minds you men can cover us if you crave a little action once more the arabs failed to realize words had been spoken had they heard they would have been puzzled at the brief descriptive speech it was unlikely that they would have understood its purpose reaching over slowly doc unlocked the door he started to get out la grunted one of the men no stay where you are the fellow eased into the front seat gun alert the other three clambered in the back they did not notice the bulletproof glass or the armor plate and did not guess the bronze mans surrender was deliberate they were jubilant talk freely and you will not be harmed one advised shu biddak doc asked in excellent arabic what do you want the four looked somewhat surprised so you speak our tongue one muttered slightly doc admitted he used the dialect peculiar to the part of arabia from which these men hailed the southern coast he neglected to add that he had a fluent command of dialects from almost all other sectors of their native land this business about the language was the first contact the four had with the bronze mans remarkable knowledge this giant metallic man was something of a mental marvel the fact that he could converse fluently in the tongue of nearly any race on the globe was only one of his fantastic accomplishments you have a submarine said one of the arabs a submarine with which you once went under the ice of the north pole that is right doc admitted in arabic the brown man reached under his coat tail squirmed and drew his flat sword he indicated the poison on the tip we want that submarine he declared he put the sword point against docs chest the steel slit a few threads of the bronze mans coat fabric you will take us to it chapter ii the whitehaired girl doc studied the sword the edge was thin hollow ground like a razor back of the cutting edge were grooves resembling the corrugations in a file these held the poison what do you want with the submarine he asked that bronze man is our affair doc had expected some such answer if i refuse to take you to it what then the man tapped the sword this you will die suddenly that does not leave me much choice doc said dryly shall i drive you to the boathouse it is not far we will walk sajyid we do not know the city and you might drive us to a station of the police they got out of the limousine one man slapped hands over docs clothing fingering pocket contents through the cloth when he found nothing large enough to be a weapon he seemed satisfied imshi he grunted go on they strode westward toward the hudson river water front setting a leisurely pace which would not attract attention in the gloomy street where the holdup had occurred there was at no time a sign of the man who had given the arabs their orders the chap hidden in the box he had kept under cover they walked through a section of garment shops the streets almost deserted the way sloped downward the asphalt had been rutted by wheels of heavy trucks and rain residue lay like pools of molten lead in the chugholes body smells of the four arabs reeked faintly they were in need of a bath here where the way was darker the shabby streets empty of life they kept their longbarreled pistols in hand wallah hissed one of the four is it much farther not much doc pointed there a row of covered piers was before them the buildings might have been gigantic match boxes with slightly arched tops here and there was a wharf which was not covered down the wide waterfront street a sign on the front of a pier warehouse read hidalgo trading co perhaps two hundred feet nearer was an uncovered pier crowded with crates moving cranes and tool sheds doc made directly for this pier they entered the litter of boxes and machinery worked outward through an alley between high stacks of oil drums the floor planks were very greasy oilsoaked it was very dark the men found it impossible to see each other two guns were kept pressed to docs back quickening his pace slightly doc drew away from the muzzles lmshi ala mah gritted a man go more slowly an instant later the guns again shoved against cloth go on grunted an arab when there was no movement no answer the man cursed dug a match out and whipped it alight on his trousers wallah he wailed instead of docs back their guns were gouging a burlap covered bale of rope the four brown men cackled arabic profanity in chorus son of a dumb camel snarled one who had brought up the rear you let him trick you he slipped away in the darkness there is no submarine hereeeooww his words turned into the squawl of a cat with its tall under a chair rocker there had been no perceptible sound but bronze hands had suddenly trapped the speakers elbows from behind the arabs yell rose to a piping bleat of agony he felt as if he had lost his arms at the elbows pain caused his hands to splay open his gun bounced across the oilsaturated wharf planks he felt a terrific wrench at his back cloth tore leather straps snapped the poisoned sword came away from his spine sheath and all the man was lifted hurled forward he was not flung head first but sidewise he struck two of his companions all three piled against the baled rope the swarthy fellow with the match jumped aside the movement extinguished his match he flourished his pistol but did not shoot he was not too excited to realize the shot sound would draw the police wildly he clutched for his sword great steel jaws seemed to clamp his ankles he was lifted as lightly as if he had been a rabbit he swung head downward his whole body was carried up and down with a tamping motion causing his head to bang the solid planks he became limp as a punctured inner tube the trio piled against the rope bale untangled themselves and sought to arise then the blackness above them seemed to ram huge bronze fists metallic fingers touched various parts of their persons seeking nerve centers leaving numb paralysis and excruciating hurt mercy of allah a man croaked he is not human the three found themselves without pistols with rippings and snappings the swords were torn from place the weapons sailed away to drop into the nearby river one sought to flee plunging blindly through the stacked boxes and machinery he covered a score of yards and began to entertain visions of safety then he was snatched up a great arm banded his chest tightened air went out of the arabs lungs with a sound as of water pouring from an upset bucket his ribs ground together allah i am dying he gurgled he was mistaken his ribs did not break although one or two cracked doc savage possessing a profound knowledge of human anatomy knew about how much pressure they would stand doc carried his victim back to the other three the one who had been dropped on his head was flippering his hands nervelessly with returning consciousness the remaining two were too dazed for flight roughly doc slammed them against the mound of rope bales then he waited for them to recover at first the quartet showed more fight doc drove out bronze hands open and cuffed them back the men shrank against the rope shivering they squirmed on the greasy boards they peered at the metallic giant as if he were some incredible titan from another existence they numbered four and they were fighting men yet their best efforts had seemed puny childlike he was something new in their experience this big man of bronze doc produced a tiny flashlight he gave the lens a twist causing the beam to widen to a fat funnel and placed it on the wharf boards the glow sprayed over the four prisoners and backsplashed on doc himself the arabs continued to stare at doc one by one their gaze rested upon his strange golden eyes stayed there wallah one repeated his earlier declaration he is not human doc did not change expression his lips did not move he was waiting knowing that the more the men thought of the recent fight the more frightened they would become abruptly the surrounding night seemed to give birth to an eerie sound the note was trilling mellow low like the song of some strange jungle bird or the noise of wind filtering through a naked cold jungle forest it was melodious but rose and fell without tune it was not a whistle and neither did it seem a product of vocal cords the swarthy men squirmed and rolled their glances over the adjacent darkness it seemed to come from everywhere that sound they looked at doc at his motionless lips at the sinews that were like alloy steel bars on his neck probably not one of the four realized doc was making the weird note they had no way of knowing that the sound was part of this mighty bronze man a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of utter concentration it came when doc was thinking or when danger threatened sometimes it precoursed a plan of sudden action just now it meant merely that the bronze man was pondering what possible motive the arabs could have for wanting the underthepolarice submarine noting the fright which his tiny unconscious trilling sound had caused doc decided to make his questioning as ghostly and fantastic as possible these men superstitious by nature would be unusually susceptible to that sort of thing a hollow unearthly voice apparently coming from the darkness overhead demanded why do you seek the submarine the four brown fellows gave tremendous starts they shrank back their eyes popped it was evident they had never before encountered ventriloquism at least never the voicethrowing art handled with the uncanny facility which doc possessed they did not answer the question what use do you intend to make of the underseas boat the voice repeated the swarthy quartet still made no reply but their fear grew watching them closely doc became quite certain he could scare them into talking freely given a little time like most barbaric people they were easily terrified by something they did not understand the questioning however came to a sudden end there was a singular eeeek of a noise a vicious brief combination of squeak and whistle the ripping sound of it was almost against docs left ear a round hole it might have been made by a bullet opened in the rope bale before his eyes the bronze man whipped backward out of the flash glow the best of gun silencers permitted some noise he knew there had been no such sound behind him yet the missile which had embedded in the rope had come with the velocity of a rifle slug his strange golden eyes roved alertly he was puzzled the mysterious weapon which had hurled that missile was something new in his experience eeeek the short ugly bleat was well to the right this time it was the sound of some sort of slug passing through the air the thing glanced off a lifling crane with a loud clang and moaned away in the night not unlike a ricocheting bullet wallah gulped an arab they scrambled to their feet elation was on their faces doc savage threw his voice at a hulking crate some yards away ordering ihda be quiet the darkskinned quartet sank back to crouching positions simultaneously another of the bizarre projectiles squeaked past and sank deep into the big crate it had been directed at docs voice gliding backward doc encountered more neatly stacked oil drums he climbed silently atop them there was a feline stealth and quiet about his movements he even put his weight only on the rims of the barrels lest the metal heads boom drum fashion under his great weight he worked almost to the other side of the wharf then veered shoreward over ropes biglinked chain shipping crates machinery he made almost no sound a bystander a few feet away would have been ignorant of his passage not having heard the bronze giant depart the four arabs crouched immobile afraid to flee near the shore end of the wharf doc paused briefly to listen his hearing was in keeping with his other remarkable facultieshis aural organs had been developed from childhood by a system of intensive exercise part of a twohour routine which he took daily keen as his hearing was he had detected no sound to show from whence the mystery missiles had come but they must have emanated from this vicinity he caught movement the scrape of cloth against rusty iron he whipped silently for the sound gliding over the greasy wood out at the river end of the wharf there were grunts curses and the rattle of running feet the four arabs had gotten up nerve enough to take flight at that noise the skulker in front of doc stirred about then headed shoreward the grease squished softly under feet doc lunged his metallic hands sensitive for all of their indurate strength encountered cloth they gathered in great fistfuls of the fabric and the yielding flesh beneath there was a gasp a low bleat a fist pecked twice at docs face the tensile cushions of his cheek muscles absorbed the blows releasing his grip and clutching again with incredible speed he captured his victims hands they were weaponless there was a telltale slenderness about the hands doc moved to the right where the beam of a distant street light glanced through the piled merchandise remaining in the shadows himself he shoved his captive out into the dingy glow he had rather expected what he saw but the amazing beauty and exotic appearance of the girl all but caused him to loosen his grip the slenderness of her hands had betrayed her sex she had white hair the whitest hair doc had ever seen upon a human being it was unshorn slightly wavy a dazzling wealth of it like loose snow she came almost to docs shoulder which made her very tall for a woman her features were regular magnificent in their cameo perfection there was color in her exquisite lips in her entrancing eyes but other than that her face was pale it was a paleness of terror her garb was unique as astounding as her strange white hair and gorgeous beauty she wore full anklelength pantaloons after the moslem fashion her blouse was of silk strange little slippers silkbrocaded shod her small feet doc glanced at her wrists they were ringed with narrow purple marks she had he decided been tied recently with ropes she rocked her head back and screamed her voice held a tearing fear her words three of them repeated over and over were of a tongue doc had never before heard he failed to understand them yet they had a vague familiarity he tried arabic on her tal taal la takun khauf come come dont be frightened she answered him with another yowl the same three strange words he mulled the words over trying to place them in his memory that he might address her in her own dialect suddenly be flung her away there had come a rush of feet in the murk to one side he sought to whirl got half around then the equivalent of two lions seemed to hit him for one of the few times in his life doc was knocked down the men who sprang upon him had the strength of monsters his assailants were not the arabs all four of those could hardly have matched one of the pair who now held him they swung fists which landed with the awful force of iron mauls the whitehaired girl ran away in the night faintly over the sounds of his own fight doc could hear the four arabs they too were fleeing the vicinity of the pier doc found the neck of one of his foes reasoned there must be a jaw immediately above it and let fly a fist the report as it landed was slightly less loud than a shot the wharf planks whined as an enormous form fell down upon them the second attacker stumbled over his toppled companion apparently he stooped and felt of the prone senseless hulk holy cow the fellows voice had the booming quality of a big animal roaring in a cave did this guy kayo you monk no answer from the fallen one pinch him and see if hes playing possum doc suggested dryly chapter iii the arab prince for fifteen or twenty seconds there was pindrop silence sounds of the flight of the whitehaired girl and the four arabs had died away entirely holy cow gulped docs assailant did we pull a boner whod you think i was doc queried how was we to know we heard the girl belier and could tell somebody was holdin her but couldnt see who it was we figured wed find out you spoke arabic that fooled us you had seen the girl before sure we saw her as soon as we hit the street after hearin you say four birds had stopped you say howd you manage to talk into the radio transmitter in the car without them guys gettin wise the windows of the limousine were closed docs four late captors would have been astounded at this information they were not aware of docs brief description of their first appearance since he had spoken without moving his lips nor did they dream there was a shortwave transmitter in the big machine sending on a meter length to which a receiver in docs skyscraper office was attuned you trailed the girl here doc asked yeah she was followin somebody one man we didnt get a good look at him it was too dark but i guess he was taggin you and your four playmates we seem to have had quite a convention light a match and lets see if we can wake monk up the man with the roaring voice thumbed a match alight the fitful glow revealed a remarkable personage the fellow was a giant yet he had fists so huge in proportion that the rest of him seemed undersized in comparison each was comprised of but slightly less than a gallon of rustcolored casehardened knuckles his face was long puritanical his mouth thin and grim his habitual expression was that of a man who found very little in the world to approve of this was renny colonel john renwick the engineering profession knew him a man among the three or four living greatest in that profession he had made a goodly fortune at his trade his sole diversion was a disquieting habit of knocking panels out of doors with his huge fists renny was one of a group of five men who had associated themselves with doc savage in the strange work for which he had been trained from the cradle that work was to go to the ends of the world punishing wrongdoers helping those in need of help a desire for excitement and adventure and a profound admiration for the astounding bronze man who was their chief held the little group together some men crave money others works of art and some go in for societythese five specialized in trouble there was plenty of that around doc his path was always that of peril of danger and thrilling adventure a second member of the group reposed on the pier boards snoring softly in unconsciousness hair gristle arms longer than his legs a face that was incredibly homely that was monk he weighed all of two hundred and sixty pounds and barely missed being as wide as he was tall if appearance was a guide there was room for possibly a spoonful of brains back of a pair of eyebrows which were like two shaggy mice actually lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair he was announced thus at scientific gatherings if at no other time was known in informed circles as a chemist whose accomplishments were almost magic sleeping beauty renny snorted isnt he a picture they revived monk by the simple process of grasping his heels dangling him over the wharf edge and dunking him in the chilly river he came up groaning holding his jaw with both furry hands wryly he squinted at doc you dont need to tell me he groaned it was you we jumped we made a mistake his voice was mild childlike got flashlights doc demanded sure renny produced one it was small powerful current was not supplied by a battery but by a tiny generator actuated by a spring motor which was wound by twisting the rear cap of the flash dizzily monk dug out an identical light when my next time comes to jump somebody in the dark im gonna have a look at im first he muttered pinching gingerly at is jaw well spread out doc directed search this pier renny rumbled but they all ran off the girl and the four arabs did doc told him there was another fellow around here maybe more than one lets have a look they began at the shoreward end of the wharf and worked outward if you hear a shrill squeak duck doc warned say we heard noises like that out at the end of the pier a little before we jumped you monk grunted what was it some kind of missiles which were fired at me but we didnt hear shots renny boomed no coughing of a silenced rifle either i know then what fired the darn things it couldnt have been an air rifle because they make a noise a silenced air rifle monk suggested in his small voice you hairy dope renny rumbled you cant silence an air rifle until not a blame sound can be heard doc put in when you birds finish your argument well look around renny popped his enormous fists together the resulting sound was like two concrete blocks colliding o k lets go they looked behind every bale under the covers over each piece of machinery and tried the tops of all boxes to see that they were nailed solidly well we found what the little boy shot at monk grinning said when the search was over whered he go dyou reckon whoever it was must have skipped out at the same time as the whitehaired girl and the four arabs doc concluded there wasnt a sign of an empty rifle cartridge lying around monk added his small voice somewhat ludicrous for such a giant i think well find those things were not propelled by explosive powder doc advised renny rattled his hard knuckles together say i been thinkin i told you the girl was followin somebody here when we trailed her we only got a couple of glimpses of the fellow ahead of her and neither of them were clear but i think he was carryin somethin about like a big fiddle case im pretty certain he was monk echoed then it is a safe bet that he launched those projectiles doc decided searching doc speedily located the rope bale against which he had crowded the four arabs preparatory to questioning them he plucked at the burlap covering his powerful fingers tearing it off easily the rope was twoinch stuff very stiff he worked the coils apart without great difficulty near the opposite side of the bale he unearthed the missile which had made the squeaky whistle monk and renny peered at it holy cow exploded renny first bullet i ever saw like that the slug resembled nothing so much as an elongated aerial bomb half an inch thick by four inches long it even had the metal guiding vanes on the tapering tail it was solid steel monk picked up the strange projectile sniffed of it and shook his head no powder smell on it doc nodded he had already made certain of that fact got any idea how it was launched monk queried nothing definite enough to mention doc told him monk and renny swapped glances in the flashlight glow to an outsider docs reply might have conveyed the impression that he was utterly puzzled to monk and renny who knew this amazing bronze man and his remarkable ways as well as any did the answer meant that doc had a very good idea how the missile had been launched had he been baffled he would have said so they did not press for information knowing it would be useless doc always kept theories to himself until they were proven facts renny changed the subject any idea why they wanted the submarine none whatever doc assured him but its pretty evident they want it badly pretty monk grinned say that kinda describes that whitehaired girl too what i mean she knocked a mans eyes out a looker huh she was dressed like shed just jumped out of some turks harem renny said sourly yah you would suggest that shes married monk snorted renny eyed doc solemnly did you get enough of a look at her garments to tell whether or not they were theatrical stuff they were genuine doc assured him some of the cloth had a weave peculiar to the southern coastal tribes of arabia she was no actress thats dang queer monk uttered even arabians dont dress like that when they come to this country a brief flurry of rain washed in from the river the men dashed along the wharf reached the street and found a prowling taxi the hack carried them to the murky street beside the tower of a skyscraper which held docs office glistening in the rain docs limousine stood where it had been deserted at the curb entering doc wheeled it toward the big metal doors a special lift lowered the machine to the basement garage which held other cars belonging to the bronze man these were roadsters coupes phaetons and an assortment of trucks all were powerful vehicles an elevator carried them to the eightysixth floor we left ham in the office monk grunted halfway down the corridor a door bore a name in small unobtrusive letters clark savage jr they opened it and walked in a man sat in a chair across the richly fitted office he was not facing them and only the top of his natty slouch hat was visible ham must be asleep on the job the shyster monk chuckled the man in the chair stood erect huh monk gulped staring youre not ham the fellow was a sleek expensively clad arab he had plenty of height a good breadth of shoulder and ropy muscles rolled under a skin that was smooth as brown silk the mans right eye moved as he appraised doc and his two companions but his left eye remained strangely fixed he showed most of his teeth in a great smile the teeth were artificial of platinum or white gold in the center of each was set a clear diamond of fair size the combination of rigid left eye and bejeweled teeth was bizarre the man resembled a carnival freak i am mohallet he said in excellent english monk blinked small eyes which were like sparks in little pits of gristle wheres ham the arab seemed puzzled if you mean the gentleman who introduced himself as brigadier general theodore marley brooks he stepped into the next room a moment ago thats him monk swung across the office to a door it let him into a vast room in which almost every foot of floor space was occupied by bookcases this was doc savages library it held one of the most complete collections of scientific volumes in existence beyond lay another room even larger stands cases and work tables laden with scientific apparatus stood everywhere the mechanism was of the most modern type indeed much of it was so advanced as to be beyond the comprehension of the worlds leading scientists this library and laboratory were unique men of science had come from abroad to inspect them to study there usually they went away proclaiming them the most perfect of their kind to be found there was in existence a greater library and laboratory however none knew of it or its whereabouts this establishment was also the property of doc savage it was located at a remote spot in the polar regions at the place doc called his fortress of solitude to his fortress of solitude the strange bronze man vanished at intervals at such times none knew whence he had gone or how to find him not even his five aids he spent these periods weeks and sometimes months in intensive uninterrupted study preparing for greater tasks ahead these sojourns were responsible for the almost superhuman mental development of the bronze man they had given him a knowledge which seemed to a layman nearly unlimited a slender waspish man was bending over a workbench in the laboratory he was dressed in the height of fashion his garb was sartorial perfection he was carefully stropping the long thornlike blade of a sword cane across a hone whos your friend out here ham monk demanded before replying ham gave his blade a few additional whets then sheathed it the thing became an innocent black walking stick he flourished it a time or two purposefully delaying to aggravate monk ham one of doc savages five aids was probably the most astute lawyer harvard had ever turned out he was never seen to go anywhere without his sword cane he and monk were rarely together without being in a goodnatured quarrel this state of affairs dated back to the great war to an incident which had given ham his nickname as a joke ham had taught monk several french words which were highly insulting telling him they were the proper things with which to flatter a frenchman monk had used them on a french general and had landed in the guardhouse a few days after monks release the dapper ham had been hailed up on a charge of stealing hams somebody had planted the evidence ham had never been able to prove monk had framed him the incident still irked him monk bloated indignantly as ham delayed his answer some day im gonna muss up that pretty face of yourn he promised his small voice angry ham scowled at monks hairy apish frame he waved his sword cane again and one of these days im gonna give you a shave right down to the bone monk grinned who is that arab with the jewelry in his mouth he said he was a mister mohallet ham advised he came up here a few minutes ago looking for doc the two swapped glares then went back to the richly equipped outer office mohallet was showing his diamondset teeth in a smile and addressing doc you are doc savage doc nodded his gaze fixed on mohallets rigid left eye the orb was artificial glass that was why it did not move some months ago newspapers all over the world carried a story about an expedition you made under the polar ice by submarine mohallet continued do you still have that submarine if i may ask it was the helldiver doc said we still have it mohallet flashed his jeweled teeth i am an agent sent from arabia by prince abdul rajab my mission is to charter the submarine chapter iv the snatch doc took the arabs words without change of expression that did not mean he was uninterested so schooled were the bronze mans nerves that he possessed the unusual ability to show emotion only when he wished monk and ham forgot to glare at each other rennys long face became even more sober who is prince abdul rajab doc asked quietly the ruler of a rich tribe in southern arabia mohallet explained he is quite wealthy and he has authorized me to pay any reasonable sum for the rental of the submarine why does he want the craft mohallet drooped his shoulders apologetically i greatly regret that i cannot tell you i do not myself know then youre wasting your time doc said shortly mohallet sprang erect showing his jeweled teeth in a profuse smile the prince abdul rajab is something of an explorer he declared hastily it is certain that he wants the submarine for some expedition probably under the ice at one of the poles since you wish to know the use he intends to make of the underseas boat before you will rent it i will cable him for the information i hope that will be satisfactory it might help mohallet waited for doc to say more was disappointed then queried you will charter the vessel doc ignored the question who is the whitehaired girl mohallet blinked his right eye his left orb the glass one had a disconcerting habit of remaining always unlidded staring he replied nothing who were the four arabs with poisoned swords who seized me in an effort to learn the whereabouts of the sub doc continued mohallets jaw sagged and who was the man who tried to kill me with a mysterious silent weapon which fired torpedoshaped projectiles of steel doc went on the diamonds in mohallets teeth winked as he ran his tongue over them i do not understand you know nothing of these things believe me i do not ahadha sahih is it true has some one from my country been seeking the submarine they have when you cable your prince abdul rajab you might ask him about that waasafah akhkh mohallet was lapsing into arabic in his perturbation alas i cannot understand this i hope these incidents have not persuaded you to refuse to charter the helldiver not if the craft is to be used for a good purpose i am sure you will approve of the use to which it is to be put i shall cable my master prince abdul rajab immediately mohallet hesitated he passed a finger tip over his fantastic teeth before we enter negotiations i should like for you to show me over the submarine i wish to make sure that it is in working condition then i shall cable my chief docs bronze features remained immobile ill show you the helldiver come on they went out into the corridor entered an elevator docs three aids after receiving a nod from their giant chief followed down in the ornate mirrored lobby doc turned back abruptly i left my keys upstairs he explained ill go back for them a bulky safe stood in eve corner of the eightysixth floor office doc opened it and extracted a case containing scores of flat keys he did not leave immediately instead he glided into the laboratory traveling with great speed he came back almost at once carrying a large glass vial filled with a biliouslooking chemical he sprinkled the stuff on the rich office rug his own footprints monks rennys and those of mohallet immediately turned a yellowish color the footprints of ham who had not left the office recently did not become visible on the rug nap doc whipped to a telephone he called the number of new yorks most famous hotel connect me with the banquet room where the american society of scientists is holding its meeting he requested then when he had his circuit major thomas j roberts and william harper littlejohn please i am sorry replied an uninterested voice i cannot call those two gentlemen they are the most important speakers of the evening this is doc savage huh gulped the voice no longer casual just a moment ill call them possibly a minute later a new voice said briskly this is long tom roberts johnnys right here by me we seem to be in trouble again doc told long tom great me and johnny will ditch this banquet pronto we werent doing anything up here but shooting off our mouths there was little about long toms speech to show that he was probably americas greatest electrical wizard the man with him johnny was an archaeologist and geologist whose works on these subjects were already becoming classics they were the remaining members of docs little group of five aids come right down here then doc suggested orders will be in the usual place k the conversation terminated long tom and johnny going back to explain briefly to the august gathering of scientists that important business necessitated their immediate departure any call from doc meant excitement and adventure and that was the stuff for which they lived doc extinguished the office lights then he stepped to the window from a pocket he brought a tiny object a crayon of peculiar substance with the crayon he wrote rapidly on the windowpane he finished stepped back and turned the light on briefly there was nothing visible upon the glass to show he had written nor would examination with a microscope of moderate power have revealed anything long tom and johnny upon their arrival would turn a small lantern projecting ultraviolet light upon the window for orders were commonly left there by doc under the ultraviolet rays the writing would fluoresce or glow in the fashion of vaseline and other materials when treated thus the letters would spring out with a dazzling electric blue it was docs custom to communicate directions to his aids in this secret fashion his life work of punishing wrongdoers and aiding the oppressed had made all criminals his enemies interception of his slightest command might on occasion be a matter of life and death mohallet and docs three friends were waiting downstairs when doc joined them ham was adjusting his immaculate clothing in one of the many mirrors while monk looked on disgust on his simian face hams natty attire was famous tailors often followed him down the street to see fashionable clothing being worn as it should be mohallet and the other three loaded into a taxicab doc rode outside on the running board this was a thing he habitually did when danger threatened little escaped his amazingly sharp eyes mohallet peered often through the cab windows at doc as they rolled toward the hudson he seemed fascinated by the bronze giant it was still raining doc wore no hat his bronze hair shed the drizzle duckback fashion and the moisture seemed not to cling to his finetextured metallic skin doc glanced backward often as the cab progressed his presence on the running board had a pronounced effect on such traffic policemen as they passed the officers fell over themselves to open a lane through streams of cars there were few policemen in the city who did not know this mighty bronze man by sight the lowliest rookie knew there was a mandatory order out that doc savage should receive every cooperation from the police department each of docs five aids held high honorary commissions on the force the taxi passed the pier where doc had taken the four arabs went on and halted before the vast warehouse on the front of which a sign read hidalgo trading co the hidalgo trading co had any one cared to investigate was doc savage himself it did no business and owned only this warehouse they dismissed the cab doc inserted a key and admitted them to the huge structure his touch upon a switch brought lights ana mutajjib gasped mohallet i am astonished he had reason to be at the outer end the concrete floor sloped downward into the river cradled upon the floor were numerous planes they ranged from a gigantic trimotored speed ship to small gyros which could ascend and descend vertically all ships were amphibians capable of landing on earth or water doc led the way to the right opened another door which gave into a partitioned part of the gigantic building there it is he announced this section of the structure was a long boathouse literally a big indoor drydock in fact for in the huge concrete trough where the helldiver lay there was no water the craft was slender cigarshaped possibly a hundred yards in length the hull was without a superstructure although there was a collapsible shield which could be raised to form a navigating bridge the bows terminated in a springsteel ram of a bowsprit larger than a telephone pole the rudders and propellers were inclosed in steel baskets to protect them from ice cakes as were the diving fins from bow to stern ran massive steel runners intended to enable the strange craft to skate along under the polar ice floes come aboard doc suggested you can soon tell shes in good shape they crossed a swaying gangplank and began their inspection months ago doc savage had visited the vicinity of the north pole in the helldiver as far as the rest of the world knew the expedition had been a scientific one in which hardship had brought death to all aboard the craft excepting doc and his five men actually the jaunt had been a mad bloody perilous race for a derelict liner with a fiftymilliondollar treasure aboard since that frightful venture the helldiver had lain here no one had shown a desire for such a craft mohallet did not carry his scrutiny far i can see she is in excellent condition he declared let us return and conduct our negotiations they left the strange submarine crossed the big room which held the plane and stepped out into the leaking night keep close together doc directed well find a taxi crossing the wide street which paralleled the water front they sought the shelter of high buildings along a narrow thoroughfare feet clattered behind them men appeared closing in from the rear a full dozen of them doc splashed the beam of a flashlight it revealed swarthy evil faces the visages of the four who had attacked the bronze man earlier in the night were among them all held weapons wallah mohallet gulped what does this mean eeeek the vicious whistling squeak of a noise was close overhead a bombshaped steel projectile dug a shower of fragments off a brick wall it means wed better hunt cover doc suggested dryly up the street the devils hissed mohallet if i had a gun up the street doc repeated and gave him a shove that propelled him many feet docs three men followed the arab for a moment they lost track of their bronze chief in the darkness then wood splintered ahead doc had preceded them with the tremendous speed of which he was capable and had forced a door cmon monk puffed an instant later docs low voice guided them to the doorway through which he had broken tom remains of the panel crunched underfoot as they piled through theres a stairway doc rapped up it and hold em back at the top wheres mohallet a loud wail from the street answered that question blows followed curses grunts he mustve been a poor runner renny boomed theyve got him mohallets voice screeched from the street they have seized me help it ended suddenly renny and the others started back outdoors nothing appealed to them more than a fight it made no difference that there were a dozen foes outside with poisoned swords and some very mysterious silent weapon which launched terrific bolts of steel doc blocked them upstairs men they went up obeying not because they feared doc or had to take his commands but because they knew his directions were usually the best doc was not with them they knew that before they were at the top of the creaking flight he had eased back into the drooling night silent as the sinking raindrops doc floated to the right he intended to circle cross the street and launch himself upon the dark horde from the rear a man trotted across the pavement to the left doc veered for him the fellow thumbed on a flashlight the glare waved like a gigantic plume then smacked into docs face the flash wielder gasped ua he squawled look out here he is doc whipped forward the light made such a glare that he could not distinguish the man behind it but as the fellow struck with a sword movement of the flash betrayed the direction of the swing the light traveled slightly with the sway of the tawny body judging with uncanny facility doc knew the blade was traveling in an overhead swipe he twisted aside the steel hissed past force of the blow carried it down until the metal chopped the pavement the blade snapped off halfway to the hilt doc grasped the hand holding the flash twisted the man shrieked his light falling jarred out lens and bulb on the pave doc jerked again once more the victim wailed in his agony he lost his fragment of a sword approaching feet were almost a roar wait croaked a hollow voice in arabic get back i will handle the bronze devil a grisly eeeek echoed the words more followed they came faster and faster until their noise was an almost continuous scream the man doc had disarmed gave a hideous squawk as one of the steel bolts drove through him more of the weird projectiles thudded into flesh there was no sound from the weapon firing them but only the eerie squeal of the missiles themselves then silence fell he is dead the hollow voice said with certainty i swept the entire street both at the level of a mans chest and close to the pavement a light you sons of camels a flash spiked a white rod it waved nudging the body of the man doc had tackled the unfortunate fellow had been pummeled by the steel bolts until he retained little of the shape of a human the fool rumbled the hollow voice callously we had to slay him to get the bronze man but he had it coming for permitting himself to be overpowered so easily the flash beam continued to dart about gradually the truth dawned doc savage or his body was not in sight he must have reached cover snarled the man with the light into this doorway after the others swarthy figures piled into the door they crowded shoulders up the stairs then amid a great screeching and cursing they came toppling back they have found heavy boxes of goods to hurl a man moaned there was a short profane palaver it ended in the gang gathering up their injured and taking to their heels in a big rush chapter v the whitehaired girls call the fleeing gang were not yet out of the narrow street when monk came banging down the stairs with ungainly leaps renny and ham were close at his heels doc monk called anxiously he used his flashlight the luminance danced along the front of a building just in time to disclose docs bronze form as he dropped from the deep sill to a rather high window his spring to that haven had taken him clear of the storm of steel from the silent mystery weapon monk played his light on the body of the slain man that ghost gun is a devilish thing whatever it is renny and ham flung in pursuit of their late attackers better let em go doc suggested the two stopped renny boomed but we might be able to tail em to their hideout long tom will do that huh i thought he was makin a spiel at a banquet of scientists tonight i phoned him doc explained then i left orders on the office window for him to tag after us hang around this vicinity and trail any suspicious brown gentlemen he was not to take part in any fighting unless necessary what about johnny he was to remain at the office and relay long toms messages to us a few blocks away car motors began roaring loudly the noise sank away in the distance they must have had cars waiting monk said in his small voice i hope long tom can tail em doc made a brief examination of the slain mans clothing he found a few half and quarter lira coins some nickel ten and twentyparas pieces but no american money there was a package of arabian cigarettes mutilated by one of the steel projectiles he found nothing which would identify the man did you get a look at the mystery weapon ham queried in a hopeful voice too dark doc told him come on well get to a telephone and wait for some word from long tom they walked rapidly eastward keeping close to building fronts to avoid as much of the rain as they could four blocks five and they found an allnight drug store telephone booths stood in the rear like a row of sentinels doc entered one and dialed the number of his headquarters johnny answered almost instantly no word yet doc johnny had a precise classroom manner about his speech this came no doubt from the interval he had spent as head of the natural science research department of one of the nations most famous universities doc held the wire renny leaning against the phonebooth door tapped his big fists together thoughtfully he was wondering how the swarthy men who had attacked them in the street had trailed them to the spot going to the boathouse doc had ridden the taxi running board renny knew it was almost impossible that any one could have followed them without being observed by the bronze man he put his bafflement into words howd those brown babies locate us doc followed us from the office huh rennys fists gave an extra loud bang you saw em right holy cow howd you know they wouldnt cut down on us when we came out of the boathouse they had a swell chance at us there we kept in a compact group youll recall they couldnt have fired upon us without danger of hitting mohallet you think they didnt want to harm mohallet its certain they didnt he is one of them possibly their chef monk and ham trading scowls like two unfriendly tomcats shouldered up to the booth to hear the conversation wonder rode rennys puritanical face mohallet was in with the arab gang he gulped howd you figure that remember anything about the planking of that pier where we had our first scuffle with the outfit doc countered the homely monk answered that sure it was greasy exactly doc told them on the rug in the office i sprinkled some chemical which turns yellow when it comes in contact with grease even in minute quantities mohallets footprints became the same shade of yellow as our own in other words he had been walking around on a greasy surface just as we had then he was on the pier renny grunted i wonder if he was the bird who fired on you with that noiseless weapon its possible ham twirled his sword cane slowly i see now that you were just playing with those fellows doc what was the idea im very curious to know what theyre up to and we might learn some interesting facts if we could get a line on that whitehaired girl yeah agreed the homely monk who always had an eye for a pretty girl shed sure be worth talkin to doc spoke into the telephone to make sure he was still connected with johnny the skyscraper office had a second phone long toms call would come in over that to be instantly relayed by johnny these birds may try to swipe the sub now that they know where it is renny boomed softly they wont get far there are burglar alarms all over the boathouse wired to the office doc kept the phone receiver to his ear and even if they got to the helldiver they couldnt take her to sea essential parts of the mechanism are missing mohallet was not submarine expert enough to notice that i wonder if mohallets story about being the agent of a prince abdul rajab was a lie ham pondered no telling johnnys precise scholastic voice came abruptly from the phone long tom just called he said rapidly he saw enough to prove that bird mohallet is the leader of the gang where are they doc demanded watching your office here what long tom is calling from a corner cigar stand two blocks away he says the whole crew is sauntering up and down out in front apparently theyre waiting for crying out loud the last was a loud gasp of surprise silence followed johnny doc called sharply some seconds later johnny gulped youd better blow right up here doc i cant make heads or tails of what shes saying what whos saying a whitehaired girl who just walked in by george shes a peach for looks echoing johnnys words came ugly sounds men cackled in shrill arabic guns crashed a feminine voice cried out loudly it sounded more angry than afraid a loud snap and the uproar came to a sudden end the phone had gone out of commission doc pitched out of the phone booth rapping the office he gained the street no taxis were in sight this was a poor district the dwellers were users of the subway more than cabs he headed for his office his men trailed him they were in good condition probably able to hold their own with the average sprinter but by the time they had crossed the street doc had negotiated a goodly portion of the next block he was faster than his men they pushed on the bronze mans vastly superior speed increasing his lead in amazing fashion doc sighted a taxi at a stand but ignored it by the time he could enter the machine and get the driver awake to the urgency of matters he would save no time the hour was not late near the center of manhattan pedestrians with raincoats and umbrellas still were plentiful entering that district doc took to the center of thoroughfares his remarkable appearance the amazing speed with which he traveled attracted popeyed stares twice gaping drivers let their cars bang into other machines there were no swarthy men visible before the skyscraper a single roving glance of docs golden eyes told him that he was not surprised the sounds he had heard over the phone had been the brown fellows attacking the office doc used the side entrance through his private garage from there a highspeed elevator of special construction carried him upward the lift was one which operated at a far swifter pace than even the fast express cages the mechanism was of docs designing he popped out in the eightysixthfloor corridor the office door gaped open it was badly torn about the lock burned powder smell soaked the air a brassy litter of empty automatic cartridges freckled the floor there was no sound doc sloped through the door saw bullet pocks in walls and furniture and leaped for the library no one was there nor was anybody in the laboratory with its fabulous assortment of scientific apparatus he glided back noting the door between office and library was dotted with bullet marks the panel was of heavy armorplate steel the lead had done nothing but batter off paint going out into the corridor doc pressed an urgent thumb on one of the elevator call buttons he waited thirty seconds a minute there was no response with an ear pressed to the sliding metal doors he could hear from the chimneylike elevator shafts extending hundreds of feet downward excited yells doc ran to his private lift it sank so swiftly that his feet completely left the floor for fully sixty floors he literally fell through space then came the slow wrenchihg shock of the halt this private lift of docs operated from an individual batterygenerator system in a room adjoining the basement garage because of this it was independent of the power leads which fed the other elevators doc investigated the electric main which supplied the great bank of skyscraper cages he found the big switch open he closed it he was in the lobby when cages stalled above began arriving johnny and long tom got out of the first johnny was a sixfoot bag of bones his coat hung on his bony shoulders as on a crosspiece of wood he wore spectacles the left lens of which was of remarkable thickness actually this lens was a powerful magnifier johnny had virtually lost the use of his left eye in the great war and needing a magnifier in his profession as archaeologist and geologist carried it there for convenience long tom seemed at first glance the weakling of this strange group of trouble hunters his complexion was somewhat pale unhealthy his hair and eyes were colorless he was slender and looked fragile long toms unusually bulbous forehead hinted at his mental caliber his command of electricity was little short of wizardry johnny held his glasses on as he bounced out of the elevator they got the girl he barked when we tried to follow they jerked the power switch and stalled the elevators long tom made angry gestures with his pale hands i trailed em up and got out at the floor about the office tried to jump the gang from the rear there was too many of em johnny removed his glasses entirely he had no real necessity for them since his right eye was perfectly normal the brown whelps made the attack for the sole purpose of grabbing that whitehaired girl he declared did she have time to talk to you doc questioned a little johnny shrugged his lathy shoulders but bless me doc i couldnt understand a word she said small thoughtful lights flickered in docs golden eyes johnny had been unable to understand the whitehaired girl that was unusual only two or three living men possessed a greater command of languages ancient and modern than johnny he could for instance read ancient egyptian hieroglyphics as readily as the average individual peruses a popular novel johnny studied doc its a bad break that you didnt get to talk to her johnny was no egoist he knew very well that doc savages command of languages was greater than his own vast knowledge in fact not a little of his own learning had come from his association with this amazing man of bronze this same state of affairs applied to long tom and the others long toms command of electricity great as it was could not equal docs fund of electrical lore renny and his engineering monk and his chemistry ham and his law the bronze man excelled each in his line came a commotion at the lobby entrance renny and monk giants both charged inside ham sword came tucked under an arm trailed them monk eyed doc and groaned so were too late huh that doc told him remains to be seen they took the highspeed elevator to the eightysixth floor previously the terrific speed of the cage had no pronounced effect on doc due to his almost incredible strength but his five aids were slammed to their knees by the force of the start a wide grin wrinkled monks homely face in the lift riding this superspeed car was one of his diversions he never failed to get a kick out of it when doc first had the thing installed monk had nearly worn it out joyriding ham fiddling with his sword cane scowled blackly at monk he did that on principle ham disliked anything which entertained monk johnny polished the magnifying lens in his spectacles as they entered the office that girl the language she spoke he grumbled it puzzles me from her manner as she ran into the office i think she had come to tell us something but i couldnt make heads nor tails of it say was she really goodlookin monk asked hopefully the only squint i got at her was in the dark she was exquisite johnny declared fervently a blissful smile wreathed monks pleasantly ugly face he squinted at the dapper ham its too bad you got a wife and thirteen children you overdressed shyster ham purpled indignantly monk had recently acquired a terrible habit terrible from hams viewpoint of telling every personable young lady they met that ham had a wife and thirteen halfwitted children the truth was that ham had neither wife nor offspring youd better hope the whitehaired girl is from zamboanga ham told monk nastily yeah monk was puzzled why the monkeys have no tails in zamboanga ham jeered she wont be too surprised when she sees you doc ignored this mild squabble it was always going on anyway he hurried to the great laboratory was gone only a moment and came back with a device which resembled a hand garden sprayer his five aids eyed the object they knew what it meant having seen it used before they stepped out into the corridor their gaze sought the tiled floor on the floor was a film of colorless fluid not unlike pale sticky molasses it was hardly noticeable this was a peculiar chemical mixture of docs own concoction ordinarily it was without odor doc kept it there at all times the sprayer held another chemical this when mingled with even a tiny quantity of the first mixture produced a powerful and striking odor the pale stuff before the door stuck to the shoe soles of any one walking through it tracks unnoticeable to the naked eye would be left for some time when a mist from the sprayer touched these the distinctive odor was produced descending to the lobby doc proceeded to trail the whitehaired girls captors he did not use the sprayer steadily but at intervals of a rod or so like a hound on a fast scent the tracks led eastward wayfarers amazed at the sight a giant metallic figure of a man engaged in the apparently senseless procedure of spraying the sidewalk stared in wonder some even started to tag along curiously they were seen left behind for doc moved swiftly the trail entered a side street it crossed park avenue went on toward the east river and threaded a sector of gloomy squalid tenements funny they didnt take to their cars boomed the bigvoiced renny probably afraid we had the license numbers suggested the bespectacled johnny long tom the pale electrical wizard advanced another theory maybe they put the girl in a car and sent her off since they were trailing entirely by odor there was nothing to tell them whether the girl was still with the group they were following but doc putting a query to the clerk in a tobacco shop which they passed clarified that particular point the clerk had seen the group of swarthy men and the whitehaired girl was still with them he had not realized she was a captive but had been stricken by her exquisite beauty the way became darker more deserted odors from a distant fish market mingled with the peculiar scent they were following the rain drooled from low clouds out on the river there was steamlike fog boats squawked whistles at each other the trail ended abruptly holy cow renny rumbled were sunk the spot where the strange odor they were following became no longer evident was near the doorless windowless side of a storage warehouse doc whose olfactory organs were developed far beyond those of his companions kept the sprayer going for some moments at the same time he bent close to the nonetooclean walk they entered one or more cars here he announced he examined the street the asphalt washed clean by the intermittent rain retained no definite tire prints that could be followed they stood at the curb a grimly silent cluster as renny had said it looked as if they were sunk a car drove past it was an old touring car very large the curtains were up the driver was the only occupant he glanced at doc and his group and fell to staring suddenly the man halted his machine then backed it up he leaned out he was pudgy with big ears small chin and eyes so watery that they seemingly had been held out in the slow rain his collar was soiled and so wrinkled that it might have been a rolled handkerchief tied around his neck good evening he said nervously were you looking for somebody several darkskinned men and a whitehaired girl doc told him thats the party who forced me to haul them away gulped the weaklooking man chapter vi the ghostly death renny cracked his big fists together and rumbled what a break for us they hired you doc demanded of the man the driver nodded uneasily they gave me five dollars i got to wondering why they didnt take a taxi and so after i dropped em i drove back here to see if there was anything funny about them if there was i was gonna tell a policeman where i took em doc swung near the touring car can you take us to the place the man hesitated his lower lip jerked rabbit fashion he seemed scared he mumbled i dont know about this ask a policeman if youre in doubt doc suggested the man wiped his wet eyes i guess itll be all right mister doc stood on the running board as was his fashion his five friends loaded inside the car rolled ahead their course was southward and eastward into an even shabbier section of the city here the poorer element lived it was a district where two and three families in a room were not uncommon the fine rain frosted the windows in the touringcar curtains there was no windshield wiper and the driver reached out from time to time to swipe a puffy palm over the glass the car top old and porous was soaked doc savage seemingly as impervious to moisture as a statue of the metal he resembled kept an alert watch he saw nothing alarming the meek fat man stopped the touring car by putting on both foot and emergency brakes he pointed theres where they went the house was an old brownstone with unwashed windows it was narrow two stories in height there was no light in it doc dropped off the running board and glided close the windows were lidded on the inside by drawn curtains they were very dirty except for a square patch in the middle of one pane he went back to the car and asked the driver did you see a cardboard forrent sign stuck on the window when you brought them here the man was slow with his reply no i dont think i did did they walk right in like they had a key they sure did doc went back bending close he used his flashlight on the door lock the plate which held the keyhole was scratched bright metal showed in the scratches even a novice would have recognized the signs the lock had been picked recently with a sharp instrument doc glanced up the cracks between the stone blocks offered easy climbing to any one at all skilled in the trade of the socalled human fly few individuals plying the trade of human fly ever possessed quite the agility and strength of this mighty man of bronze doc drew himself up the wail as readily as another would surmount a ladder those in the touring car saw him attain the roof after that he was lost in the darkness and rain aboard a ship moored on the nearby water front a bell began striking ships time before it ended more bells took up the clanging chorus fog whistles hooted softly mournfully in the houses radios jangled a baby cried somewhere on the elevated a train slammed south rivulets of rain water sobbed in the gutters minute after minute dragged past renny boomed softly i dont like this he got out of the touring car the others followed except for the driver who humped close to his wheel a bit whitefaced doc did not appear the clanging of ships bells had ceased the radio jangle ended suddenly as it was switched off monk looked at an expensive wrist watch almost lost in the coarse red fur matting his skin five minutes he grunted ill wait a minute more then im goin in southward in the harbor the horn of a liner set up an awful prolonged moanlng a dread dirge like the pain cries of a stricken thing doc appeared on the house roof he descended as rapidly as surely as he had gone up and came to the car i could hear no one at the rear he said softly well pick the lock and go in the front way the car driver said nothing he might not have heard producing a small curved bit of steel from within his clothing doc seemed only to insert it in the lock and the tumblers clicked the panel swung open it creaked once a mousy sound all right doc said his voice reaching only his five friends well ail go in at once they entered feeling their way down a passage which was very dark and full of plaster and rat smells eeeek the hideous squeak came without warning it was followed by others a procession so swift that their combined note was one fearsome scream with only the faintest of stutters to mark the interval between them slender tapering steel projectiles wiped plaster off the walls a few screeched into the street out of the black screaming hallway came startled cries grunts moans and finally silence the hideous wailing from the mysterious weapon continued a time it was evidently oscillating back and forth for again the missiles launched out into the street one projectile glanced from a building in such a fashion that it whirled back and landed in the headlight glare of the touring car leaning forward the driver stared at the snout of the slender bit of metal it held a foul smear poison the driver laughed the sound was a nervous gobble in his throat he let in the clutch and drove away at the corner he looked back the awesome whistling of the missiles had ceased in the old brownstone house a dead silence had fallen it worked the driver gurgled a slick scheme it got em he turned the dilapidated car around a corner and onward he kept only a mild pressure on the accelerator he had had dealings with the police this fellow and he knew that a speeding car might easily excite suspicion going westward to broadway he turned north he followed the angling course of the street until he was in the brilliant glare of the theatrical district around times square he veered into a dingy little street just above times square and pulled in to the curb before a small hotel he started to get out a darkskinned man had been waiting in the hotel door he stepped out swiftly into the rain it was mohallet seeing him the driver sank back behind the wheel the swarthy man got in how did it go he asked taking pains with his english great leered the driver they never suspected a thing walked right into it it is well said mohallet i pulled it neat bragged the driver mohallet nodded it was indeed a wise move when i got hold of you and held you ready for just such an emergency my own men could never have managed the deception now i get paid huh suggested the other you do but first draw up the street a few yards and park it is best that no one should see me giving you money at this spot obediently the touring car pulled ahead half the length of the block and nosed in to the curb mohallet reached into a pocket the one next the driver he fumbled the driver gave a violent start you stuck me with somethin he gulped a thousand pardons mohallet murmured and sidled away slightly it must he a pin in my clothin the driver sat perfectly still for a moment then wildly he sought to move his limbs they seemed paralyzed his face was turning a weird mottled scarlet hue his lips opened writhed in distorted fashion no words came out the man continued his grisly struggles for possibly thirty seconds then he slumped over motionless mohallet felt of the fellows wrist good he jeered you have collected your pay from me my friend the man was dead mohallet removed a long sharp needle from his pocket which had been next the driver the tip was poisonsmeared he inserted it in a screwcap metal pipe case intended to hold it he glanced cautiously out of the car to see if he had been noticed what he saw caused him to start violently to emit a horrified squawk in the old brownstone house in the slum district doc savage and his five men examined an interesting piece of apparatus the thing was not unlike a machine gun with a greatly distorted barrel mounted on an efficient stand it was equipped with a geared device which caused it to sweep from side to side there was a trigger to the trigger was attached a cord which ran through eyelets and was stretched across the hall upon entering they had hit this a trap doc explained i entered through a rear window and found it i simply set the thing so it would fire over our heads that was to fool the driver he was one of em monk asked in his mild voice surprised at least hired by them its a safe bet that hell get in touch with them to report that we are done for but howll we know where he goes monk wailed i called the police and asked them to send a car to shadow the fellow doc explained i allowed time for the car to reach this vicinity thats why i was gone so long monk remembering the anxious wait in the street grinned widely long tom had been examining the unusual weapon on the floor he showed the natural interest of an electrical expert in touch with something new in his profession dang me he exploded you know what this thing is doc nodded but you tell the rest of em its a magnetic gun long tom explained ive experimented with models of small power but never with one as strong as this theres a powerful set of batteries not unlike flashlight cells wired to an electromagnet the steel slugs are fed from a magazine and by a system of contacts magnetism is employed to set them in violent motion in the barrel the current shuts off at the proper instant and lets them fly out thats the general idea doc agreed the thing is the only type of gun which can be considered truly silent in operation long tom fingered the magnetic gun eagerly watch it doc warned those slugs are poisoned long tom shouldered the strange weapon im going to add this to my museum of late the electrical wizard had taken to collecting unusual objects which they encountered in their adventures he had equipped a private museum at his bachelor quarters in a highclass club his assortment already contained some interesting articles doc started for the door lets get in touch with the police arent you gonna search this place monk demanded i did that on the first visit doc explained theres nothing here they just broke into an empty house and set their trap three blocks away they found an openallnight drug store doc got a phone circuit to police headquarters and held the wire several minutes later a police voice rattled in the receiver doc hung up swiftly we got a bad break he told his friends he whipped for the door the others close on his heels there was a taxi stand at the corner they raced for that what dyou mean bad break rumbled bigvoiced renny the police car followed the driver all right doc threw over his shoulder mohallet joined the fellow and killed him the cops saw that they rushed mohallet and he got away renny howled not exactly but he got to his hotel the police have him besieged there now theres a young war going on around the hotel they piled into a cab doc took the running board horn blaring steadily accelerator on the floor boards the machine rooted up broadway a fire engine could not have made better progress through the desultory traffic policemen far ahead reared on tiptoe saw the giant bronze form of doc savage clinging to the outside of the taxi and tweeted their whistles madly opening a lane around the little hotel in the times square district there was pandemonium police had roped off the street facing the hostelry radio patrol cars big detective phaetons motor cycles with bulletproof shields on the fronts swarmed about shots banged men ran around yelling guns in hand ambulances stood engines panting monk piled out of the car homely face all agrin this was the sort of thing he loved excitement the others trod his heels they breasted the police lines here you cant get through a burly sergeant began then catching sight of doc he gulped and turned red if you need any weapons sir we have em he offered anxious to atone for his mistake no thanks doc said we have enough this despite the fact that doc had no firearm he rarely carried a gun aithough his ability as a marksman was in keeping with his other accomplishments doc depended on his wits on his unusual scientific devices too doc never took human life if it could be avoided his enemies however had a distressing habit of coming to an untimely but deserved end in traps they had themselves set for the bronze man his five aids carried an unusual type of firearm they drew them now the guns resembled oversized automatics fitted with curled magazines these were machine guns of docs own invention they fired even more rapidly than the latest type aircraft weapons the shots coming so swiftly that the average human ear could not distinguish the interval between them they used these guns more for the fear their terrific rate of fire instilled than for lethal effect for like their bronze chief the five used every precaution to avoid taking life in his clothing each man carried ammo drums for the rapidfirers charged with what biggame hunters term mercy bullets these striking a man would not penetrate deeply enough to produce death they caused an unconsciousness which lasted for less than an hour chapter vii flown birds mohallets brown men were holding out from the windows of the hotel the hostelry was a narrow slice of brick wedged between office buildings it had a highly ornamental front after the fashion to twenty years ago monk counted the stories ten the buildings on each side are fourteen floors that means they couldnt have slipped away on the roof tops he hailed a policeman you got the rear covered theres forty cops around there grunted the officer eeeek a thin steel projectile smashed through a ear behind which they were crouched glancing from street to curb it whined up into the air then came clanging back thats whats kinda got us bumfuzzled muttered the cop we cant imagine what kind of a gun theyre using theres no flash and no noise we cant locate the snipers its a magnetic gun long tom explained we just collected one like it doc with a quick dash secured the missile from the magnetic rifle he examined it centering his attention on the snout he had feared there would be poison on it there was none doc summoned the police captain in charge of the siege tell your men to keep under cover he directed the missiles from his noiseless gun are not poisoned it seems but the brown fellows in there carry knives and bullets which are doped had any one been badly hit nobody got a scratch as yet the officer admitted so far its been mostly noise you got any ideas darken the street doc directed and that means really darken it douse the street lamps get those big electric signs over on broadway turned out the police captain looked puzzled but did not press for explanations he knew the power of this bronze man the esteem in which he was held by the police commissioner it was well known that docs magical skill at surgery had once saved the life of the police commissioner doc eyed long tom k grinned the electrical wizard i know what youre planning ill go get the stuff long tom departed swiftly in the direction of docs skyscraper laboratory the command to darken the vicinity had told him the method of docs intended assault upon the hotel policemen scampered away in a few moments lights began going out the great flashing signs along broadway the monstrosities of illumination which had earned the section its appellation of the great white way blackened one by one an abysmal wet darkness settled police searchlights were turned on the hotel entrance the besieged brown men sought to shoot these out they got three or four but more were hurriedly rushed to the scene alarmed the fellows in the hotel now sought to combat the darkness by turning on lights in hotel rooms and running up the shades police riflemen judiciously positioned shot out the bulbs many newspaper cameramen swarmed about reckless of danger snapping flashlight pictures the batting white flashes of their lights flushed the streets for many blocks the reflections resembled lightning on the low clouds doc savage towering head and shoulders above the burly policemen was the center of pictorial attention it was a rare occasion when the news hawks caught doc in action man of mystery the newspapers called doc since they were able to learn so little about him although they heard many rumors the tabloids were making a gala occasion of the siege at the hotel long tom returned elbowing his way through the throng he earned two large hand bags doc savage opened the bags from one he extracted a device which resembled a magic lantern he actuated switches on the sides of this apparently nothing happened actually the lantern began to project rays of light of a wave length too short to be visible to the naked eye long tom from the other bag dug out goggles with lenses fully as large as condensedmilk cans these were fluoroscopic eyeglasses doc had perfected them wearing these queer goggles it was possible to see by use of the infrarays the lantern projected to the watching newspapermen the procedure smacked of black magic they were not of a sufficient scientific turn to realize that doc had merely adapted a common method of photography by use of infrarays to his own needs before morning every paper in the city would probably come out with word of this marvelous new invention the bronze man had perfected the truth was that any electrical engineer could duplicate on a cruder scale what he was doing all lights were now out news photographers were warned to take no more flashlights on pain of seeing the inside of the precinct jail doc and his men donned the fluoroscopic goggles to the bystanders it seemed that they advanced on the hotel in complete darkness to their eyes however the hotel front was plainly visible although looking somewhat weird in the infraray light long tom carried the projector lantern a brown man leaned from the hotel window it was dark he thought no one could see him taking deliberate aim monk shot the fellow in the shoulder with a mercy bullet the man seemed to go to sleep on the window sill he would awake later not greatly harmed a second swarthy fellow fell a victim in almost an identical manner thats two for me monk snorted gleefully a cinnamoncolored sentry was crouching inside the hotel door he seemed to stare directly at doc as the giant bronze man approached yet in the absolute murk he could see nothing doc handed him a leisurely clip on the jaw the watcher melted down as if he were lard on a hot griddle there seemed to be no one else downstairs when the fracas started the guests in the hotel had apparently locked themselves in their rooms the screaming of the women the frightened shouting of the men could be heard doc and his gang mounted i hope they havent harmed the whitehaired girl monk muttered in the secondfloor corridor they found no one standing at a thirdfloor window rear was another swarthy gunman he held a spikenosed automatic in his right hand a flashlight in his left from time to time he was darting the flash beam down the corridor he splashed his light just in time to illuminate doc and his party he yelled then and lifted his automatic toward doc renny was standing alongside doc at the instant he did not realize until splits of seconds later what had happened he felt only a wrench at his fist later he knew doc had seized the gun docs shot banged in the corridor no mercy bullet this but solid jacketed lead the slug directed with uncanny precision centered in the flash lens there was a spray of glass and the flash was driven backward from the brown mans claw the fellow squawled flipped stinging fingers to him the surroundings were now in darkness he whirled wrenched at the window and got it up a fire escape was outside he was clever he beat the sill to imitate sounds of a man going out then he crept back along the hall what followed was somewhat ludicrous the swarthy man was like one stricken suddenly blind but he thought his foes were also unable to see so he came on boldly on the balls of his feet he drew a flat sword from its spine sheath and held it poisoned tip ready for a sudden stab had the battle actually been in the darkness he would have been a dangerous foe as it was monk simply took deliberate aim and shot him in the leg with a mercy bullet the man swayed tried to charge then swatted down flat on the floor asleep docs group mounted on upward from the rooms came frightened whimpers from some a grim silence other guests shouted questions these doc warned to keep under cover theyre in the room next to mine yelled a man i heard em poundin in there doc ran to the room adjoining the voice he tried the door it was locked on the inside he called but no answer ill fix it renny thumped he threw one of his enormous fists a straightoutfrom thechest punch with a splintery explosion the panel jumped out of its grooves it was a stunning exhibition of what human bone and gristle could stand renny blew splinters off his knuckles reached in and turned the key they entered a hole perhaps two feet across gaped in the opposite wall plaster and brick debris from the aperture paved the floor two fire axes stood against the wall a third the metal head shattered lay on the floor where it had been dropped after being broken in making the opening the opening looked small for docs size but with a rubbery ease he writhed through renny and monk their big frames less flexible than docs failed to make it ham punching monk forcibly with the end of his sword cane snapped get out of the way and let somebody shaped like a man get through ham squirmed after doc long tom and johnny followed they found themselves in a shabby office the door beyond was open frostedglass panel broken out in the hall they found a janitor knocked senseless on the roof a skylight gaped open from this higher building it was possible to travel from roof to roof the remaining length of the block on the last building they discovered another skylight ajar they got away with the girl long tom gritted the four devils we got were left behind to give the others a chance to get clear mohallet had made good his escape further investigation proved it a newsboy vending his papers on broadway had seen the swarthy men and the beautiful whitehaired girl depart but had thought nothing of it doc sought out the police captain commanding the besieging officers he spoke a few words the four unconscious brown men were carried to a room in the hotel before newspaper reporters were admitted and once the news hawks were on the scene no mention was made of the darkskinned quartet every one had escaped they were permitted to believe some reporters found this hard to credit but it was dark and they had not glimpsed the men monk had shot with mercy bullets you can forget the four prisoners doc told the police captain they have not harmed anybody erummm mumbled the officer doubtfully i had better see if that is all right he called his superior came back with his ears red and said effusively the prisoners are yours officially they do not exist the officer wondered about those prisoners for the rest of the night he would have liked to haul them to the precinct station hand them a good shellacking and learn what this was all about the policeman would have been astounded had he known the disposal doc savage would eventually make of the four captives they would be sent to a unique institution which doc maintained in upstate new york very few individuals knew of this place at the remote establishment the villainous brown men would undergo a delicate brain operation which would wipe out all knowledge of their past lives they would not know their own identity after awakening later they would receive training in the ways of a lawabiding citizen complete even to a trade by which an excellent living could be made once discharged they would not return to criminal ways at least no crook had ever done so after having undergone docs somewhat astounding treatment doc kept his institution a secret had news of it gotten out there would be a nationwide hullabaloo no doubt and much publicity first however doc intended to question the prisoners preliminary to that he made a search of the room which had the hole in the wall cigarette stubs of arabian tobacco showed mohallets men had used this room for something other than digging the hole monk and renny were dispatched with the sprayer device to see if it was possible to trail mohallets gang by some of the chemical which might still remain on their shoe soles when they had gone doc pushed his search he scrutinized the walls peeled up the carpet dissected the furniture eventually he turned his attention to the bathroom two or three minutes later doc came back and got one of the fire axes he reentered the bath there was a loud crash johnny ham and long tom ran to the door they were just in time to see doc wrapping a bulky object carefully in a towel they looked at the tub it was one of the castiron enameled type which stood above the floor a great piece had been knocked out of one side obviously it was this piece of the bathtub which doc was bundling so painstakingly in the towel renny and monk two mountains of disappointment came hack to report that mohallet and his fellows had apparently entered a taxicab shortly after reaching the street at least the scent trail had ended at the curb two or three other people saw the girl monk muttered by golly she must be a looker to attract attention like that did she still wear the trick turk trousers ham queried sure that explains it the harem rig would start a panic anywhere numerous curious glances were slanted at the towelwrapped bundle which doc was now carrying carefully why the bronze man should knock a slab out of the hotel bathtub and keep it in his possession as if it were something precious was a puzzle to the others since his questioning might take some time doc had the four swarthy prisoners bound and gagged and inserted in large laundry baskets this latter act was to delude the many newspaper reporters doc savage was one of those rare individuals a man who really disliked publicity too newspaper yarns about himself were dangerous for they gave his enemies a line on his movements and his foes were legion the laundry baskets senseless men inside were loaded into innocent laundry trucks which transported them to docs more or less secret garage in the skyscraper basement doc and his men rode in the vehicle doc carried the segment of a bathtub the laundry truck was dismissed the captives were carried up to the eightysixth floor in the speed elevator renny looked the four over with an experienced eye these are tough babies getting the truth out of em is gonna be a job doc examined them it will be some time before they revive lets try a little hocuspocus on them speaking rapidly doc outlined his plan listening the others began to chuckle then with deft speed they set to work making preparations chapter viii the voice from hell balid was one of the four prisoners in the language of his race balids name meant stupid it was not an apt descriptive balid had acquired the nickname in his youth when he had been wont to pretend to being a very dumb lad entirely lacking in the brains to commit the clever thieving of which he often stood accused since he was the man who had been knocked off by docs hard fist balid was first to revive the others had been overcome by the mercy bullets the effects of which were more lasting in awakening balids arms and legs sought to perform the usual nerveless twitchings strangely enough they would not move balid realized he was in a place which was very warm he opened his eyes he emitted an involuntary cry of horrified surprise a hideous apparition towered near by nothing less than a fiery skeleton the thing was all of eight feet in height its blazing fire was an uncanny greenish hue all the rest of the room was in blackness the solid sepia of an abyss there was no sound the eerie skeleton of fire suddenly extended its arms on either side the arms stretched slowly to balid it seemed that each arm became at least twenty feet in length the thing of fiery bones opened its skull mouth a spurt of flame came out brief blinding this was accompanied by a squirming ball of white smoke balid watched the smoke instead of spreading it writhed and drew into a compact bundle then it suddenly assumed a definite shape balids eyes protruded he tried to cry out but was so shocked that the screams rattled in his throat the smoke puff had suddenly become the head and shoulders of bauds master mohallet mohallets throat was cut neatly from ear to ear crimson rivulets trickled from the gash the hideous apparition then vanished abruptly a glowing arm of the odious greenflame skeleton now stretched down and touched balid there was a hissing and crackling an intolerable agony shot through bauds frame he tried to move to get up and flee but he could not move his limbs seemed paralyzed he was hot oh so hot you are here said the skeleton in a hollow sepulchral voice that was no news to balid he knew he was present and how a more frightsome place his superstitious brain had never imagined you are at the great halfway point a place between the worldly sphere and the great beyond continued the fearful tomblike voice it is at this spot that your material life is reviewed and your future determined balid did his best to shudder although his body would not move he was dead he was sure of it there was no other explanation out of the darkness before balids eyes a hook now appeared upon it were fiery characters in arabic across the top was a heading the deeds of balid the volume closed before balid could read more this is a record of your life said the awful voice it is all there it is a very bad record it almost consigns you to the place where the evil go there is one thing which may save you tell the closing events of your worldly life speak the truth and it may mean your salvation lie and i shall certainly know it balid made several croaking sounds then got his explanation under way i was one of the men mohallet brought to the united states with the whitehaired girl begin further back than that commanded the sepulchral one balid was almost sobbing in his terror shall i start with the first appearance of the whitehaired girl mighty one further back than that start with something of mohallet mohallet is the chief of a robber tribe which operates on the southern arabic coast baud whimpered he has many followers what of the prince abdul ra ah there is no such person that is only a name which mohallet uses at times tell the truth worm thundered the ghostly skeleton of flame its fiery teeth chopping the words out lie and i will know and condemn you to everlasting damnation now tell me of the whitehaired girl mohallet found her walking along the coast balid wailed she wore strange garments and upon her wrist was a bracelet of a white metal this mohallet kept she spoke not the language of any people we knew she was held a prisoner and in the weeks which followed mohallet learned her language balid paused but when the fiery arm of bones reached out and touched him with a resulting surge of tingling pain he continued wildly i know not what mohallet learned when the whitehaired girl could speak with him whatever it was it greatly excited mohallet he took six men and the girl in a motor launch with him one night i know not where he went but he came back in a great rage and the six men were not with him but only the whitehaired girl we later found the bodies of the six men dead on the beach we said nothing of it because they had died from poisoned bullets of a size which fitted only mohallets pistols mohallet killed them so they could not tell where he had gone rumbled the voice from the bony jaws i know not but i think so continue with an armed party mohallet sought to penetrate the great desert of rub al khali where no man from the outer world has gone there are savage tribesmen along the coast they drove us back with great loss of fighting men mohallet sought to enter the great desert and could not yes then he came to the united states on his yacht his yacht balid squirmed or tried to perhaps flaming one it is not mohallets boat he stole it from an englishman some months ago mohallet came after the submarine owned by doc savage he did and why did he want it i know not i can only guess it must have been that he wished it to reach something of which the whitehaired girl told him something located in the great desert of rub al khali the truth worm what is this thing mohallet seeks it is the truth i tell what it is i know not where is mohallets yacht anchored in new york in the river the americans call the hudson near the street numbered one hundred you have talked well said the ghoulish voice monks tone pealed out in ribald laughter ill say he has he chortled as a reward well have to return him to life to the click of electric switches brilliant lights came on balid stared about eyes rolling he was in doc savages laboratory he looked down he was incased in a box which reached to his neck a box filled with nothing more mysterious than ordinary sand the sand was heated to an almost unpleasant warmth by common electric irons embedded in it the skeleton was nothing more than a tall framework of wood painted with phosphorus the joints were rubber bands which had permitted the amazing stretch of the arms from the right arm of this contraption dangled an insulated wire touching balid this had introduced an electric shock the book which had portended to contain balids life history was a common scrap book decorated with phosphorescent writing in balids pockets had been a coin purse with his name upon it which had enabled doc to head the book with the fellows cognomen also in the book was a short story of what had happened at the hotel in the times square district although balid had had no time to read it flashlight powder had made the flame from the skeletons mouth a wadded sheet had imitated the smoke cloud and the head of mohallet the throat cut was merely a picture doc had hurriedly executed from memory doc possessed no little ability as an artist balid moaned and shut his eyes tightly he began to wish he were actually dead he had told all he knew of mohallet and the whitehaired girl if mohallet found out he would inflict a form of death far from pleasant doc speaking in his normal tone said well go take a look at that yacht of mohallets with a hypo needle doc administered a drug to each of the four prisoners this would keep them unconscious until the application of another compound a counteragent revived them doc had no further use for the four within a few hours a mysterious white ambulance would come to the city and take the quartet away to the upstate institution where they would undergo docs unique treatment docs speed elevator took the little group to the basement garage they loaded into one of the big cars the same limousine which the brown men had stopped earlier in the night fifteen minutes later they parked near the end of one hundredth street using night glasses they peered out over the hudson they investigated the shore line finally monk ignited a chemical flare of his own invention this gave a light of intense brilliance the secret of its construction had earned the homely chemist a medal when he turned it over to the war department the light disclosed no yacht balid must have lied to us renny rumbled i dont think so doc said thoughtfully superstitious cuss that he was he really thought he was halfway to purgatory then mohallet has pulled his freight its likely doc agreed the affair at the hotel probably gave him quite a fright he was safe in figuring the town had become too hot for him hes set sail all right come on they ran back to the limousine a regulation police siren wailed under the hood as they hurtled southward they made directly for the vast pier warehouse the hidalgo trading co each man ran to a plane the wheels of the cradles on which the ships rested were well greased each craft rolled down the sloping concrete ramp to the river water under the impetus of its own propellers taking the air and using monks powerful flares at frequent intervals doc and his aids made a search for any suspiciouslooking yacht the skipper of a ferryboat gave them a description of the craft which had been anchored at the foot of one hundredth street when doc landed near the ferry shed upriver she was a tub of fair side he explained a classy looker you cant fail to recognize her she was all black with gold striping and gold funnel bands the planes were equipped with compact shortwave radio transmitters and receivers doc wirelessed the yachts description to his friends flying up and down the harbor circling manhattan island they kept an intent lookout for a black yacht docs five aids were all excellent pilots at the harbor mouth a customs officer reported a black yacht had steamed out to sea at full speed theyre trying to make their getaway doc informed his five men by radio well see if we can overhaul them flying out into the atlantic they found black clouds matted almost against the sea they were leaking steady rain below them fog was like wadded dirty cotton it hid all ships back and forth the planes swung time after time doc landed and engines shut off dropped the pickup microphone of a submarine listening device over the side this device one used extensively in the great war would register the sound of a ships screws for a distance of many miles doc heard numerous craft the mouth of new york harbor was a busy spot it was impossible to pick out the screw sounds of the yacht they sought monks flares brilliant as they were could not combat the soupy fog for some four hours the planes combed the sea in a fruitless search no use doc spoke into the radio transmitter at length the fog has us whipped the radio transmitters and receivers were synchronized perfectly on the same wave length the effect was not unlike that of a party telephone line any man could enter the conversation at will want us to turn back queried the clipped voice of dapper ham the shyster is anxious to see his wife and thirteen nitwit offspring monk chuckled the winged ape speaking ham jeered dont you mugs ever get tired of that the roaring tones of renny questioned mournfully were up against a stone wall on this proposition and you eggs wisecrack say doc johnnys scholastic voice put in you carried piece of bathtub away from that hotel didnt you right doc admitted whyd you do it mohallet apparently flung the whitehaired girl in the bathtub for a time when he was holding her at the hotel doc explained so what so she wrote a message on the tub whatd she use for ink a cake of toilet soap whatd the message say search me doc replied the characters are unlike any language that i have come in contact with do we go back and try to read em demanded long tom for the first time taking part in the aerial conversation we do doc decided chapter ix the mysterious city it was the dawn hour a few early delivery trucks rattled in the streets sounding like loosejointed monsters galloping through the fogcrammed cracks between the beetling buildings in docs eightysixthfloor quarters five men waited patiently and watched the sixth their chief work renny and long tom were dozing johnny the archaeologist was poring through massive books scratching his head using a pencil and paper the homely monk and the immaculate ham sat apart facing each other from time to time they swapped goodnatured insults just now monk was making a great show of reading a magazine of mens fashions which he had secured from an allnight news stand occasionally he read passages aloud one eye on hams sartorially correct attire hams garb was letterperfect but from time to time monk misread a sentence to make it seem the dressy lawyer had violated some rule of correct fashion ham took it patiently disgusted monk discarded the periodical got a pair of shears and began cutting small paper pigs out of a newspaper color crawled up in hams neck any reference to parkers which monk made invariably got his goat doc savage was working over the segment of hotelroom bathtub he had sprinkled ordinary black fingerprint powder over the enameled surface applied a slight amount of heat then blown off the surplus powder the soap lettering softened by the heat had retained enough of the fingerprint powder to make it readily seen the hieroglyphics themselves were strange to johnny with his profound knowledge of ancient languages the characters were a mystery just now johnny was brushing up on his fund of information about the great and mysterious desert of rub al khali which covers most of southern arabia as an expert on geology and archaeology this was his natural forte doc had covered numerous scraps of paper with marks as he probed the message left by the whitehaired girl he was jotting down characters from ancient tongues of the biblical days and various vocabularies of modern syrian and comparing them with the stuff on the tub there was no resemblance chicken tracks monk had called the marks with no idea of making a wisecrack they did resemble the prints of a fivetoed bird sometimes there was only one print never did more than five appear doc sat back abruptly thats what i get for trying to make something hard out of em the others stared at him you mean youve got em translated renny boomed awakening any one of you fellows can read them easily doc said dryly holy cow renny got up and lumbered over to peer at the hieroglyphics i still dont see how any one of you can read em doc repeated see if you can guess how in the meantime lets hear johnny give a lecture on this desert of rub al khali johnny adjusted his spectacles with the magnifying left lens the encyclopedia contains one of the most remarkable facts about this desert he began in a classroom voice most individuals think the north and south polar regions contain the largest areas on the globe as yet unexplored this is not the fact the largest totally unknown region is this desert of rub al khali the southern half is entirely unexplored it is reported to contain ruins of an ancient civilization as well as great salt marshes what about inhabitants monk demanded a few savage tribesmen it is believed johnny announced there is no fresh water only salty brine from the marshes it is said there is a species of camel which can subsist on the salt water and that the natives in turn live on the milk of these camels what else is known monk persisted very little an englishman made perhaps the most ambitious attempt at exploration a few years ago when he took an expedition across a portion of the desert others have gone in and vanished monk wrinkled his pleasantly ugly face how come it aint been explored with airplanes simply because a flight over this desert is more dangerous than one over the pole there is no water over a tremendous area a forced landing is almost certain to mean death by thirst in addition there are savage tribesmen along the coast doc savage put in a further explanation can be attributed to human psychology you fellows are highly educated but how many of you knew this desert of rub al khali was the largest unexplored region in the world no one admitted previous knowledge of that fact there you are doc told them explorers public belief to the contrary do their exploring for fame and monetary return from books and lectures a flight over the poles is good for newspaper headlines everywhere a hop over the desert of rub al khali might rate a scant paragraph providing there was no big gangster killing that day that is probably the real reason why the district is so unknown ham declared voicing a knowledge of human traits garnered in many a courtroom battle if this desert was as famous as the north pole you can bet it would be full of explorers renny had been eying the fragment of bathtub during the dissertation i cant read that stuff he boomed ill swear i cant you know the deafanddumb sign language dont you doc countered renny nodded not only did he himself know the sign language but doc and the others could converse in it fluently they often used it to exchange information when it was imperative that no sounds be made look doc directed he formed a letter of the sign language with his fingers and held it beside one of the hieroglyphic characters holy cow renny grunted thats the letter m exactly doc agreed the message is in english although hardly understandable when translated wait ill write it out doc printed the words on a fresh sheet of paper when he was done he held it up for the others to study huh monk gulped what a mess the missive read bd man scare g hom bot tke girl prsner bd man hom cryin rok south edg watr help pese girl tke yo phantom cit the weird message ended there probably she was interrupted doc explained blast it monk snorted i still cant read it here doc said and added omitted letters until he had the communication in a more coherent form bad man scared going home on boat taking girl prisoner bad man home crying rock south edge water help please girl take you to phantom city the bad man is mohallet doc surmised and by girl the whitehaired young lady means herself i see it monk grinned she tried to tell us that mohallets hangout is at a place called crying rock on the southern arabian coast but whats that stuff about a phantom city that doc said thoughtfully probably explains what is behind this mess ham tapped the paper with the end of his sword cane this was in english if you could call it that yet the girl certainly did not speak english doc considered suppose you came in contact with a deafanddumb person of some race arabian for example who could not read or write and you wanted to teach him to talk on his hands couldnt you do it giving him the signs in english and pointing to the corresponding actions and objects as you did so undoubtedly ham admitted then after the passage of many years or in case that person taught the sign language to some one else many of the letters might be omitted isnt that possible too that must explain it ham agreed the whitehaired girl can talk english of a kind on her fingers but cant speak it something like that the tongue she spoke was some dialect from the interior of arabia i am certain i only heard the three words which she cried when i seized her but they closely resembled arabian this thing is strange johnny muttered well probably find it has a very simple explanation doc assured him that is providing you birds want to follow it up monk grinned with all his agreeably unlovely countenance you couldnt keep me off it doc a pretty girl in distress would make monk tackle anything renny rumbled mention of a phantom city is what intrigues me murmured the more scholastic johnny that desert of rub al khali is rumored to hold some very interesting things in the way of ancient ruins with a heavy hammer doc savage smashed the fragment of bathtub he burned the papers on which he had scribbled it was just as well that no one else get the whitehaired girls message its contents were indelible in his retentive memory there may be a financial angle to this too he told his companions to all appearances this fellow mohallet is the chief of a gang who make their living by robbery he did not come all the way to new york and risk his neck trying to steal our submarine unless there was plenty of money at stake monk grunted explosively say we aint found out yet why he wanted the sub doc made no reply if he had any theories he was keeping them to himself he eyed his five aids saw they were all anxious to get on mohallets trail he had expected that this venture smacked of the thing they lived for exotic adventure in a foreign land well head for arabia by submarine he announced since mohallet came after the underseas boat he must need it badly we might find use for it monk groaned k but i sure dont fancy crossing the atlantic in that thing grease and oil and pitch and roll even the grub tastes of grease or it did when we went to the pole the dapper ham smiled widely he had just remembered that the contortions of the submarine kept monk continually on the verge of sea sickness im gonna enjoy the trip he decided aloud the ambulance from docs strange institution in upstate new york now arrived doc had summoned it earlier in the night unnoticed by pedestrians about at this early hour the four brown prisoners still sleeping were removed by way of the private lift and basement garage within a few hours all knowledge of their past lives would be wiped out in less than a year four honest citizens and skilled workmen would be released from the establishment wed better start getting the submarine ready doc decided monk ham and renny were dispatched to initiate work on the helldiver chapter x a guide to trouble the sky was like the whitehot concave paunch of a furnace overhead a round hole in the brazen heavens a peephole to the glitter and heat of a hell flame was the sun the helldiver crawled through the arabian sea as through hot oil she pulled a milky funnel of wake along behind spray jumping up from the bows dried almost instantly when it hit the sunheated deck plates and runnerlike guard rails monk his furry hulk clad only in trousers sat on deck with a highpower rifle watching for sharks on which to test his marksmanship he waved a slow arm whatm i offered for my share of arabia and the whole blasted ocean brothers he asked gloomily do i hear any offers thirty cents will buy it ham immaculate in white ducks and sun helmet smiled blissfully monk had spent a miserable time crossing there had been much rough sea they had been many days negotiating the atlantic the mediterranean the suez canal and the red sea monotony and much hard work was all the trip had offered the helldiver was equipped with an excellent set of master controls operated from the central control room enabling the tiny crew of five men to handle the craft there had been no sign of mohallet or his black yacht with the gold trim the helldiver is fast for a submarine doc declared clambering out of the main hatch chances are that mohallets yacht is much swifter however considering the few days we lost rigging the submarine for sea mohallet probably beat us here by a day or two maybe he didnt even come to this neck of the ocean monk suggested gloomily his yacht had not passed through the suez canal youll recall one of the prisoners told us it was a stolen boat doc pointed out mohallet not daring to take it through the canal must have sailed around the lower end of africa ive been figuring his probable maximum speed and our own rate and the chances are that he did not beat us by more than a couple of days johnny and long tom were on duty at the controls below docs golden eyes ranged across the bows arabia he announced monk squinted it looks like a sand pile to me ive seen some bleak country but it was a luxuriant jungle compared to that seven or eight miles distant lay the shore line it was low almost entirely of sand and rock beyond wrapped in jittering heat waves were bald mountain fangs the heildiver crawled ahead the big diesel engines mumbling tiny specks on the shore grew in size boxed themselves out in the shape of houses crowded along narrow streets it was a town small heatbaked the town of bustan doc offered in arabic the word means garden monk snorted noisily its the last outpost along this desolate coast doc continued well go ashore here and see if we can get a line on a place known as the crying rock even the best charts show no such landmark from the shore many dark eyes watched the approaching he diver bustan was a dead hole there was no harbor and vessels of necessity anchored off a beach which was rockspiked and dangerous in a blow hence ships seldom visited the place the authorities ruled bustan with an iron hand they had to otherwise robbers from the surrounding desert would have taken the town over there was considering the frontier outpost nature of the settlement very little lawlessness the local hakim had the reputation of being a bad governor to fool with he frequently caused criminals to be tried and executed the same day they were caught if ever there was a town where justice had teeth bustan was that place gentry of evil ways haunted the town however but they masqueraded as honest traders or tribal nomads one of these was among the many who watched the strangelooking helldiver he was a fat fellow his face resembled a ball of rancid yellow lard stuck full of very black whiskers this man maintained his scrutiny only long enough to make certain the helldiver was going to drop anchor offshore then he wheeled and scuttled up a cramped street populated by robed and whiskered men an occasional woman with covered face donkeys onehumped arabian camels commonly known as dromedaries and an infinite number of dogs he entered a large and not unattractive dwelling over the roof of this a radio aerial stretched broadcast receivers were not unknown in bustan ostensibly there was one hooked to the end of this aerial leadin the real purpose of the aerial however was to radiate the energy from an efficient shortwave transmitter and receiver this was concealed under a slab in the floor of one room and the slab was in turn masked by a rich rug mohallet was a robber chief with modern ideas occasionally the government of some nation sent a gunboat along the coast looking for him he maintained several radio stations to tip him off when such craft approached this was one of them the man with the lardy face was soon in communication with the yacht of his chief the set operated on voice and the harsh tones of mohallet himself soon crackled in the receivers what is it he demanded in arabic a strangelooking submarine has appeared offshore describe it it is long and narrow and has no conning tower said the fat man who was a merchant as far as the authorities of bustan were concerned it has large steel runners extending from bow to stern the name on the bows is helldiver a storm of profanity poured from the receivers mohallet in his youth had been a camel driver ii had assembled a choice collection of epithets wallah he ended it was an evil day when i went to new york no doubt that devil of a bronze man is aboard the submarine in some fashion he has learned why i wanted the underseas boat how he secured that information i do not know he must be a magician all magic is trickery said the fat man meaningly perhaps master it might be wise to try some sorcery of our own you have an idea queried mohallet smirking the plump man spoke rapidly and in a low voice his black whiskers against the microphone he was one of mohallets most clever followers this fake merchant through him quantities of the loot mohallet took from inland tribesmen and coastwise vessels was disposed of in a secret room under the house much of mohallets loot was now stored awaiting fencing mohallet laughed fiercely when he had heard the scheme to the end it is good he chortled carry it through at once after concealing the radio outfit the portly man hurried up to the roof of his house from there he could see a boat was being put off from the helldiver the boat was a collapsible one of metal it fitted be neath a hatch in the helldivers steel plates doc savage and johnny seated themselves in the little shell they were attired in worn garments the dress of common sailors the information they desired the whereabouts of the mysterious crying rock could best be obtained by mingling with local citizens they did not wish to attract attention to themselves a small powerful outboard motor kicked the boat beachward several officers met them but ham who took care of the legal angles of their jaunts had been foresighted enough to secure papers which made their landing entirely legal doc and johnny separated both spoke fluent arabic both knew the customs of the country be careful that no one thinks we are seeking mohallet doc suggested but pick up anything you can regarding him and the location of this crying rock k agreed johnny the gaunt archaeologist ambled along idling before bazaars and little drink shops a turjuman clubbed a camel up before a grog shop alighted and went in each step jarring dust from his robes the fellow had the appearance of one having just come from the desert johnny followed him in picked his chance and told the dragoman i am thinking of journeying to the spot known as the crying rock would you be interested in guiding me there wallah said the turjuman i have never heard of such a place disappointed johnny went on he decided to try a part of the town where fishermen lived if the crying rock was situated on the coast they might know its whereabouts striding along he entered an area where the miserable streets were narrow smelly rips between the walls of houses a figure in feminine robes came toward johnny carrying a large basket of dried fruits and nuts the features were completely masked by the inevitable face cloth johnny paid no attention just another arab woman the next instant there was a collision the basket spilled its contents over johnnys person their forms tangled momentarily you ran into me johnny said sharply in arabic but motivated by politeness he bent over to help the woman retrieve her dried fruits three wiry brown men hurtled out of a doorway upon the gaunt archaeologist they had discarded their usual flowing burnooses and were naked except for loin cloths robes flew off the womanish individual it was no woman but another lithe brown man johnnys bony frame ordinarily had the appearance of being about as graceful as a brush pile but now he danced backward with an astounding agility he jerked off his needless spectacles with the magnifying left lens he speared out a long arm his fist took one of the attackers on the jaw the fellow went over backward as abruptly as if turning a back flip of his own accord the other three darted back and forth they had drawn longbladed swords the tips of these weapons were muddy with poison compound johnny drove a hand to the armpit holster where he carried his small machinegun pistol it was gone the pretended woman had lifted it of course in the collision johnny seeking to retreat farther brought up against a wall poisoned blades menaced him in front on both sides the thin archaeologist dodged frantically he had no other weapon except an extra drum of cartridges for the missing rapidfirer he whipped out the drum and hurled it at a knifeman the fellow dodged with an expertness that spoke of years of practice at avoiding the bites of eviltempered camels the ammo dram bounded down the street a yapping dog ran out and pursued it other dogs appeared and surrounded the fighting men their frantic barks making a great bedlam the knifemen cursed the dogs and johnny they weaved in venomous blades alert johnny was in a spot the wall behind was too high to leap and he was sure that one touch of the poisoned steel would mean his death then the rescuer arrived he came charging around a corner a stocky man neatly clad imshi he yelled at johnnys assailants beat it he skidded to a stop whipped out a revolver and leveled it the gun gulped a throaty roar a brown man squawled dropped his sword and wrapped both arms over his middle he turned and ran weaving down the street the other assailants promptly followed johnny seized upon the fallen sword and set out after the runners but the plump newcomer got in his way better not he said in good english let em go the police will be here in a minute theyll jail us theyve got a habit of throwing everybody concerned in the can when a fight comes off maybe youre right johnny agreed he inspected his rescuer as they trotted through crooked streets leaving the vicinity he was impressed by the mans neat garb his smoothly shaven features men who shaved regularly were scarce in this part of the world my name is karl zad said the portly man william harper littlejohn johnny to my friends ejaculated johnny shaking hands and by helping me out of that hole you certainly qualify as a pal karl zad dropped behind ostensibly to look for pursuers but really to permit himself an evil grin it had worked thought karl zad this fool bag of bones did not suspect that the attack had been deliberately staged so that he karl zad might be the rescuer overhauling johnny he received a friendly grin from the gaunt archaeologist johnny of course had no way of knowing karl zad was the same lardfaced bewhiskered pretended merchant who had been in radio communication with the archvillain mohallet i am a merchant a trader along this coast volunteered karl zad thev are devils these natives they have robbed my caravans until they have about nut me out of business you are not a native of this district johnny hazarded i am from mecca i wish i had never left there too i never saw as many thieves as there are on this coast they are organized under a leader known as mohallet johnny all but fell down at this information here it seemed was a ready source of information have you asked johnny eagerly ever heard of a place known as crying rock karl zad did not reply immediately i have heard of such a place a great cliff which is said to make horrible sobbing sounds at times can you give me the exact location karl zad did some squirming and forehead wiping to simulate embarrassment maybe it is a dirty trick to take advantage of your gratitude he mumbled but id like mightily for you to give me a job guiding you there frankly im about broke johnny smiled widely great id appreciate that the details were quickly settled karl zad was to receive a reasonable fee for escorting them to crying rock johnny knew doc would approve of the idea especially when he learned karl zad had saved his life i shall pay up a few minor debts get my dunnage and meet you at the water front suggested karl zad need any money johnny offered no and many thanks they parted johnny found doc savage at the little collapsible metal boat fitted with an outboard motor a ring of gaping arabs surrounded the bronze giant they had never before seen a man obviously possessed of such mighty muscles no one seems to have heard of crying rock doc said thoughtfully whatd you learn plenty johnny exploded he told of the fight arid the find he had made in his rescuer he effused at length on karl zads excellent appearance and intelligence go over the part about the fight again doc requested johnny did so you say karl zad shot one of your attackers doc persisted in the stomach yes the bullet doubled him over and he ran johnny spoke for a few moments more on the merits of karl zad then shading his hands peered out at the submarine he could see the huge forms of renny and monk on deck when johnny turned doc was gone the big bronze man had departed silently johnny showed no surprise doc often went away in this fashion when he had something important on his mind during the next few minutes there was a great deal of commotion in the ancient streets of bustan the excitement was like that of chickens after the shadow of a hawk had passed in this case though the turmoil was caused by the flashing figure of a mighty bronze man who whipped along the streets at a bewildering speed doc made directly for the spot where the attack on johnny had occurred he found a crowd he mingled with them his golden eyes switched intently over the cobbles he was looking for blood from the man who had been shot in the stomach he found none he did however pick up a small round wad of blackened cardboard for the briefest instant after doc had found the object those near by were startled by a weird indefinable trilling note which seemed to come from nowhere yet everywhere persist for an instant then die away they glanced about curiously it was unlike anything they had ever heard that sound some looked at the giant of a man who resembled metal wondering if he could have anything to do with it doc faded away from the vicinity the round cardboard he had picked up was the wad from a blank revolver cartridge doc rejoined johnny he did not volunteer word of where he had been johnny did not ask he knew docs habit of telling what he thought should be told and no more karl zad appeared he carried two large hand bags of excellent leather both were new they seemed rather heavy we will be very glad to get your help doc said politely after johnny had performed the introductions johnny was enthusiastic he was not gullible karl zad was simply a smooth worker as clever a rogue at deception as could be found on the whole arabian coast they went out to the submarine karl zad expressed amazement at the compact efficiency of the submarine at the remarkable controls which enabled such a small crew to handle her he was shown to a stateroom where he deposited his baggage leave your luggage here and johnny will show you over the sub doc suggested karl zad did not seem greatly pleased at this but he left his bags and permitted himself to be led off forward where johnny began lecturing on the automatic depthmeasuring device a contraption which utilized sham sounds sent to the ocean bottom and echoed back an electrical ear measured the interval needed for the sound to go down and come back and the speed of sound waves through salt water being known the depth was readily ascertained doc was below decks for some time then he came up and had ham ferry him ashore in the little folding boat he carried a big box go back to the sub doc directed some of them may want to come ashore before we sail doc then walked away rapidly his large box under one arm ham returned to the helldiver sure enough it was not long before karl zad came hurriedly to the deck i forgot my watch karl zad gasped i left it in a shop to be repaired may i go ashore and get it sure said ham and offered his services as boatman chapter xi docs fast one once ashore karl zad did some fast moving he went directly to the zabit in charge of the local police i am karl zad a lawabiding merchant of this town he declared aboard the submarine helldiver is some of the loot from a desert caravan which was robbed near here some six weeks ago there are at least two new suitcases filled with it there may be more how do you know this he was asked they tried to sell the stuff to me i went out to the submarine to look at it not knowing they were thieves when i learned the truth i told them i would have to come ashore to get money and i hurried straight to you the zabit swallowed this volley of lies he grabbed his turban a rifle and summoned a squad of thinfaced efficient officers the raiding party departed on a run in the direction of the submarine karl zad walked in the opposite direction a satisfied smirk on his face he set a direct course for his house not looking behind him or showing interest in those he passed once inside he uncovered the shortwave radio set concealed under the floor he got mohallet after calling a few moments it is working perfectly master he reported i got the stuff aboardloot which i was keeping here in my house i hope you did not pick out the valuable articles growled the greedy mohallet only material which can be identified as loot from ransacked caravans jewelry with outstanding characteristics together with worthless papers from the wallets of robbed merchants good said mohallet now when doc savage and his men are in jail we will steal the submarine i will attend to that too master you did not tell them anything they may find of value no they asked me about a place known as crying rock i told them i knew where it was you lied of course but i had to tell them i knew i never heard of such a place before that is good gritted mohallet and there was a quality in his voice which said it might be a bad thing for karl zad if he did know where crying rock was what is behind all this trouble master asked karl zad that is not business of yours karl zad made an angry face but his voice remained meek servile very well at this point curtains over a door on the opposite side of the room parted noiselessly a huge nemesis in bronze flashed across the floor a metallic hand lifted chopped down karl zad never knew of the presence of doc savage he went to sleep instantly such was the force of the blow that he would slumber at least an hour doc savage leaned close to the radio microphone wait o master on the air and i will look and see if the police are as yet bringing the bronze man and his five helpers to shore the voice was a perfect imitation of that of karl zad an eavesdropper m the next room could hardly have told the difference among docs other accomplishments which he had perfected by intensive study and practice was a remarkable command of voice mimicry he could imitate almost any tone moreover he could simulate what defied most male mimics the voice of a woman doc did not go outside instead he ran into the next room got the box he had brought ashore and came back he opened it out came a sensitive directional radio receiver he switched off karl zads transmitter then tuning until he found the carrier wavemarked by a strong hissing on a certain part of the dial of mohallets sender he rotated the loop aerial until the signal was strongest this gave him the direction from which the waves were coming he made a mental note of the compass bearing later on the submarine he would draw a line on a chart using that bearing somewhere along that line mohallet was now located doc switched on karl zads transmitter there is no news he said imitating karl zads voice in uncanny fashion call me when there is commanded mohallet this ends our conversation naharak said mohallets carrier wave now died in businesslike fashion doc now smashed karl zads wireless set when he had finished it would never send another message doc left the house when he reached the beach the arabian zabit and his squad of policemen were approaching from the submarine doc waited for them they were very angry we were tipped off to search your submarine they told him it must have been some yankee idea of a joke we found nothing just to make sure they searched the box which held docs radio receiver i can prove that we came here directly from new york doc announced the policemen evidently believed him i cannot understand this their chief muttered in disgust i suggest you search thoroughly the house of the man who made this false charge against me karl zad the merchant doc suggested wallah hissed the zabit we will do that doc now hired one of a swarm of boatmen and vent out to the submarine he found his men puzzled angry johnny especially was in a boiling rage that was all a trick johnny roared windmilling his sticklike arms when i get hold of that karl zad ill skin im alive i will i imagine the police will take care of that doc said dryly theyre going to search his house and i overheard enough to guess there is much loot concealed there doc explained how the wad from the blank cartridge had put him on karl zads trail his five aids fell to grinning widely so all mohallets phenagling done was to give us a line on his whereabouts renny boomed johnny fumbled with his glasses which had the magnifier on the left side karl zad must have carried loot aboard in his bags to plant it he ruminated but what happened to the stuff doc it was a rare thing when doc smiled he smiled now i took it out and threw it overboard he said chapter xii decoy the sun was not quite up it was near enough to the horizon to spread a great scarlet fever over the sky chasing stars moon the fever grew increasing light bloodied the lazy surface of the arabian sea renny in the helldiver chart room lowered an enormous right hand over a coastal map on the map was a straight red line starting at the town of bustan and angling entirely across the sheet this was the radio bearing which doc had taken upon mohallets transmitter carefully lifting a redheaded glass pin renny consulted some figures penciled on a paper then stuck the pin back in the chart perhaps a quarter of an inch from the red line about thirty miles he said his vast voice vibrating in the steel cell of course we dont know where mohallet was located along that red line he might have been ashore even renny accomplished engineer that he was had few equals as a navigator he was setting the course of the submarine i wonder if mohallet is near this crying rock whatever that is pondered johnny polishing the magnifier half of his eyeglasses we should know before long doc told them the big bronze man now went out on deck the sea was calm but the speed of the helldiver caused a steady shower of spray to fall along the decks clad only in gym trunks doc proceeded to take a twohour routine of exercises which had been his daily ritual from childhood they were greatly different from the usual those exercises and they were solely responsible for the bronze mans amazing physical powers he made his muscles work one against the other straining until filming perspiration mingled with the sea spray he juggled a number of many figures in his head multiplying dividing extracting square and cube roots keening his faculties of concentration he employed a mechanism creating sound waves of frequencies so high and low the ordinary human ear could not detect them through a lifetime of practice doc had perfected his ears to a point where he could hear these sounds beyond ordinary ken he named scores of different odors after a quick olfactory test of small vials racked in a special case he read pages of braille printing writing for the blind which is a system of upraised dots on paper fingers moving so rapidly that they seemed merely to stroke the sheets this was to sharpen his sense of touch he had many other details in the routine they occupied the entire two hours with no time out for rest there was no magic about docs remarkable abilities probably no man had taken such exercises for such a long daily period from the cradle on were there individuals who had done so their strength agility and acuteness of senses might have equaled those of doc savage long tom came out on deck when doc finished the electrical wizard looked tired he had been at the radio instruments for many hours continuously since they had sailed from bustan not a peep out of mohallets radio transmitter he reported but i picked up some other stuff which is not so hot yes doc prompted the arabian authorities at bustan have radio communication with their capital city long tom explained mopping spray off his rather unhealthylooking face i listened to messages they sent during the night the stuff wasnt coded they found some of mohallets loot at karl zads house and they scared karl zad into telling everything he knew about mohallet which was not a great deal im betting doc offered right it wasnt but they wirelessed the complete story to their capital even to the details about karl zad being knocked out at his home they do not know who made that attack did they mention karl zads smashed wireless apparatus ill say not so good doc said dryly mohallet if be overheard this stuff is clever enough to guess the smashing of the radio transmitter was my work no doubt he knows all about radio directionfinding too mohallet probably has men listening to the government wireless stations to pick up news of any expeditions being sent out against him long tom nodded another thing karl zad is dead docs bronze features remained expressionless how come he tried to escape from the bustan police he killed one officer then he was himself killed a break for mohallet doc said slowly yeah if they ever catch mohallet they cant use karl zad for a witness against him an earsplitting howl came from below decks there were loud smacks the frantic clatter of feet an instant later monk shot up out of the deck hatch like something furry erupted by a noisy volcano under one arm monk carried a pig the shoat was fully as homely a specimen of the porker species as monk was of the human race it was a razorback with legs as long as those of a dog and ears so big they resembled wings ham came close on monks heels belaboring with his sheathed sword cane he was in a dancing rage you hairy missing link he howled ill skin you alive ill hollow you out until that pig can use you for a garage ill whats the trouble doc questioned an innocent look on his homely face monk scratched the enormous ears of his pig the shyster dont seem to like habeas corpus here ham shrieked you dressed the pig up with my best necktie habeas corpus likes corn monk smirked the necktie was corny yellow and habeas was a bit seasick so the tie made him work up an appetite ill work you up ham gritted renny emitted a thundering laugh whered you get that missin link of the pig race monk in bustan grinned monk hes got the makins of a great hog habeas corpus has i found im chasin a dog big enough to fight a lion and you probably stole him ham sneered nix i paid his arab owner one qirsh for im thats about four cents american money this arab said habeas corpus had taken to goin out in the desert and catchin hyenas monk gave ham a meaning look he kept so many dead hyenas dragged up to the arabs house that it was a nuisance and so the arab had to get rid are there hyenas in the arabian desert renny queried i forgot to ask the arab monk grinned doc went below and got a pair of powerful binoculars it was always something like this ham touchy on the subject of pigs since the wartime incident which had given him his name was in for a tough session monk would probably make a trained pet of his ridiculouslooking porker just to torment ham back on deck doc turned his glasses across the bows the sun was up now he shaded the lenses get your glasses brothers he suggested heres something worth looking at monk and ham forgot their quarrel there was a general rush for binoculars they trained them in the direction which doc indicated mohallets yacht renny thundered the shore line was a range of low mountains which shot up sheer from the water there was no vegetation the terrain seemed solid rock moreover there appeared to be no spots level enough for anything to grow directly ahead was a slight indentation in the frowning heights it was rimmed with the light line of a sandy beach as far as the eye could reach along the shore there was no other beach a black yacht with gold trim swung at anchor in this open cove the craft was something over a hundred feet in length it had trim lines of speed it showed no flag pennant or other bunting there was no sign of life aboard the bony johnny scrambled down to the wheel and bent the submarine toward the somber yacht take it easy doc warned they may be using that old war gag a disappearing gun one highexplosive shell in the innards of this boat and wed really have something to worry about the bronze man kept his lenses trained on he yacht there was he saw no name upon the black hull ill swear theres nobody aboard muttered renny whose eyes were second in sharpness to docs the sea was glassy barely moving the helldiver crept ahead it might have been a steel fish after some dark floating insect but the insect was dead nothing happened they came alongside johnnys expert touch nosed the helldivers bow to within a few feet of the yacht anchor chain with a springing leap that gave by its ease of execution a hint of docs remarkable muscular development the bronze man clutched the anchor linkage dangling by his hands he raced up like a spider on a web the deck planks once might have been cleanscrubbed now they were soiled crusted with brine littered here and there with bottles tin cans and bread crusts mohallets crew had been an untidy lot listening doc detected no sound but the idling of the sub engines behind him he went forward probing into cabins saloon crew quarters engine room the galley he found no one of signs of recent occupancy there were plenty liquor rings on tables were still wet where they had been implanted by glasses the galley stove would scorch the fingers bedding was still damp where men had slept upon it and perspired during the night there was in a converted guest cabin a laboratory which showed mohallet was beyond the average as a scientist there was much apparatus tool racks several of the silent magnetic rifles were there and others were in various stages of manufacture too there was a layout for making the poison for sword tips in an adjoining cabin doc found a hideous assortment of venomous snakes reptiles from many climes evidently these were the source of the raw poison in mohallets private stateroom denoted by its lavish hangings stood a large safe doc settled to his knees before this a professional cracksman would have been interested in the results the combination operated and the door swung open in a surprisingly few seconds the shelves inside held a sum of money both in the gold lira coins of arabia and english and american bank notes the amount was considerable searching doc found a few jewels all rather small and obviously pried from settings occupying a bed of honor in a folded square of velvet lay what vaguely resembled a bracelet of shiny slightly hardened lead wire the metal however was not lead the thin circlet when doc tested it bent easily the workmanship was a bit crude he could distinguish indentations left by the hammer which had shaped it the bit of jewelry bore evidences of much wear ornamentation if any had long since been wiped off by use doc recalled what mohallets man balid had told him in new york of a bracelet of white metal which the whitehaired girl had worn when found this must be it the thing would about fit her wrist doc replaced everything locked the safe and went on deck he surveyed the beach with his glasses his first sweep showed him a surprising vision the whitehaired girl stood sheltered by a great boulder waving frantically in the direction of the black yacht the girl continued to gesture her hair long and strangely white fluttered like the strands of a partially loosened turban doc ran to the bows swung over and descended by the anchor chain an acrobatic flip carried him to the submarine deck between two of the sturdy sledlike runners renny and long tom had already wrenched up the deck hatch and were hauling out the collapsible metal boat doc lent a hand he and renny scooted the little shell over the side johnny and long tom will stay aboard doc directed the rest of us will go ashore the pair designated to remain aboard showed disappointment but voiced no protests the others sprang into the folding boat renny twisted the outboard motor flywheel with one big hand much as he would spin a top the twin cylinders stuttered the little boat raised its bows and dragged a fan of wake shoreward monk had his pig habeas corpus between his knees with his furry hands he fished out one of the compact rapidfirer pistols ham also produced one of the remarkable guns ease up about a hundred yards offshore doc directed renny obediently cut the motor and pulled their craft broadside to the beach docs golden eyes raked probed he used the highmagnification glasses that deserted yacht nobody but the girl on shore the whole thing is strange monk muttered whats become of mohallet doc lifted one hand slowly carefully he formed letters of the deafanddumb language the girl had left the message in the vernacular written on the bathtub she should be able to understand it what is the trouble he signaled they had drifted in closer the girl must have had sharp eyes she deciphered his transmission her hand came up her fingers writhed help she appealed are you alone doc fingered her transmission was barely readable for most of the words were minus letters of more or less importance ys sent the whitehaired girl bd men g scare she says that shes alone and that the arabs fled in fright doc elaborated doing some guesswork monk habeas corpus under one arm stood erect if she can spell english out on her fingers she should be able to speak it he muttered im gonna give her a hail are you sure youre alone miss he called loudly ask her if her husbands around ham jeered the whitehaired girl however gave no indication of being able to understand the english which she could transmit upon her fingers she made more characters on her slender brown fingers she says she doesnt understand english doc reported also she says to stop talking and come ashore and get her lets do that renny renny fed the little outboard gas the boat skittered for the beach it rasped its metal bottom on surfrounded pebbles the sand of this beach was of very coarse sand and mixed with gravel monk clutching habeas corpus was first out of the boat he lumbered toward the girl grinning pleasantly a surprising thing then happened the girl peered closely at monks apish figure the furry bulk of the man seemed to frighten her she suddenly fled backward monk came to a stop daggone it is she scared of me or of habeas corpus doc advanced and the girl hesitated in her retreat doc spoke on his fingers the young woman replied in the same fashion this was the first glimpse they had gotten of her in good light her beauty was even more entrancing than they had thought she wants us to put a chain on monk before she comes close doc reported either that or knock him over the head monk looked pained the dapper ham began to titter why monk grunted doc talked with his fingers received a reply shes disgusted with us doc translated she asks if we do not know that monk is one of the white beasts only blackfurred ham emitted a squawl of laugher between salvos of mirth he choked she sure got monks number yahhh monk growled at ham then to doc what in thunders she talkin about white beasts the girl was staring at ham as if wondering whether his paroxysms of laughter did dot mean he was a bit demented she was an exotic figure she still wore much the same garb that she had in new york since she gave no signs of wanting to get close to the furry monk the men approached her they were now some yards from their boat once more doc addressed the girl in the digit vernacular her reply was lengthy the english words were so chopped so incomplete that only doc could follow them she thinks monk is one of a race of strange whitefurred savages which she fears greatly doc reported the thing is very mysterious its about the strangest thing i ever ran up against the whitehaired girl suddenly shot both arms out in front of her she screamed piercingly she can talk monk gulped she aint dumb ham spun ill say she aint dumb he yelled look the group whirled burnoosed brown men were springing up along the beach they seemed to materialize magically from the sand they had been concealed in pits cleverly covered over a machine gun clamored from a hiding place among the rocks the storm of lead was not aimed at docs gang but at their boat lead slugs hosed against the little craft literally tearing the thin metal hull to ribbons the boat folded strangely like a thing with its back broken it was all but cut in halves rendered entirely useless chapter xiii brown devils into the rocks doc snapped monks little machine gun spewed a stream of reports its roar was like the note of a gigantic bull fiddle ham and renny also turned loose burnoosed brown men folded down two four five of them doc began no killing if you can help mercy bullets grunted monk they only put em to sleep they raced for the nearest shelterboulders and monster slabs of stone which had slid down from the heights above during past ages the whitehaired girl seemed stunned by the abruptness of developments then she wheeled and raced ahead of them to cover blast her ham gritted she led us into a trap nix snapped monk she was as surprised at sight of these birds as we were the machine gun snarled in their direction but a bit too late the lead torrent hammered harmlessly among the boulders a brown man resembling a darkfaced white ghost in his robes sprang up forty yards to the right he lifted a rifle hams gun stuttered the rifleman spilled off the rock on which he stood now came monks chance to change the whitehaired girls opinion of him two burnoosed men darted out ahead of them near by mohallets voice shouted at the pair seize the girl get her clear so that we can kill this bronze devil and his men one of the swarthy pair grasped the girl the other struck at her head club fashion with a pistol twisting she evaded the blow monk emitted a bellow which was astounding in view of his usually mild voice he charged picking up a rock as he did so such long arms did he have that he seemed hardly to stoop in grasping the rock the fellow trying to club the girl sought to reverse his pistol monk flung the rock it caught the dark man in the face there was a mushy plop as it hit and the whole character of the mans features changed throwing the rock was monks way of avenging the attempted clubbing of the girl he could have shot the fellow with a mercy bullet much easier but that would have inflicted little pain releasing the girl the other man sought to flee two jumps he made then monk overhauled him and gathered him in a great bear hug one of the mans arms broke monks strength was tremendous dropping his victim monk cuffed him as he fell the flathanded blow against the skull knocked the man senseless the whitehaired girl gave monk a faint smile and the homely chemist grinned from ear to ear under cover doc called sharply at monk let im stay out there makin eyes at her and get shot ham suggested monk beckoning the young lady dived into shelter for possibly three minutes that followed there was a sort of tense silence broken frequently by shots docs men had latched their rapidfire pistols into singleshot operation almost every swarthy head that eased into view received a chemicalcharged bullet which induced instant unconsciousness it was uncanny shooting marksmanship the like of which the brown men of mohallet had never before gone up against heads ceased to appear in a low voice doc addressed the whitehaired girl he tried arabian of various districts the dialects of such desert tribes as possessed a vernacular apart the girl brightened she spoke rapidly doc listened then shook his head she speaks a tongue which was once arabian but its so distorted that itll take several hours of practice before i can converse intelligently with her he resorted to his fingers he was forced to go slowly leaving plenty of space between his words it was like an expert telegraph operator transmitting to a beginner the reply was lengthy they pulled a fast one on her doc told the others they brought her ashore during the night she didnt see those fellows hide themselves a small party of them were holding her at sight of the submarine they put on a great show of fright she made a try at escape during the excitement and succeeded of course they arranged for her escape she didnt realize that i knew she wasnt tryin to trap us monk grunted you fellows stick together doc directed the next instant he was gone from the spot doc made directly for the point from which mohallets voice had come if possible he wanted to get his hands on the master villain the fellow was a murderer the type who would be a menace to mankind as long as he was at liberty mohallet moreover knew what this was all about no doubt he held the explanation of the presence of this strange whitehaired girl who spelled english on her fingers yet who could not speak the tongue and who feared mysterious savages whom she called white beasts once doc got his hands on mohallet he had no apprehensions that the sinister fellow with the false eye and the jeweled teeth would tell what he knew doc possessed many ways of making men talk mohallet had retreated however doc came upon a skulking burnooseclad rifleman the man had time for one terrified yell before the crash of a metallic fist jarred him into unconsciousness another of mohallets followers saw the bronze giant from a distance he threw up his rifle and fired but when the bullet arrived there was no visible target other than a waste of rock and a sky already beginning to blaze with a terrific heat mohallets men were drawing away from the vicinity appalled by the uncanny marksmanship of the men they had attacked and fearful of the giant bronze one who was chief of the five a flurry of shots from the submarine drew docs attention he glided to the right and sought a high eminence of rock johnny and long tom had run the submarine close inshore apparently with the idea of joining the fight at long range their intentions were good but the way things were developing they had made a very bad move some distance down the beach mohallets men had carried light boats fitted with outboard motors to the water loading into the craft they were skimming toward the sub they used guns lead began to streak the bay surface about the helldiver no mercy bullets these deadly metaljacketed the slugs squeaked and clanged off the thick steel hull of the underseas boat johnny and long tom greatly outnumbered were driven from deck they were in too close to submerge there was no time to drive the heavy craft into deep water before it as much as began to move mohallets men were swarming over the deck mohallet himself was in one of the light boats he bent close to the sub hatch surrender he yelled in english or we will drop a depth bomb alongside nothing happened for some moments whether mohallets words could have been heard within the submarine or not was a question surrender mohallet repeated or we shall also kill the men who are ashore john and long tom must have had the deck hatch loosened a crack so as to catch the words there was a short conversation so lowvoiced that doc could not catch the words then the deck hatch opened mohallet and his followers swarmed down into the helldivers innards keeping under cover doc returned to his five friends and the whitehaired girl were in a kinda tough spot boomed bigfisted renny yeah grunted monk we sure ran into a streak of tough luck doc nodded slowly although his bronze features showed none of his thoughts he was disgusted it was a rare occasion when he fell into a trap as simple as this one he should he believed have observed that men were hidden along the beach cleverly though they had concealed themselves his attention had been riveted on the whitehaired girl and the sign talk with her that accounted for his entering the trap getting careless he said aloud riding to a fall like this we had it coming monk had been trying to talk to the girl on his fingers he was finding her abbreviated words too much for him daggone it he complained i cant keep up with this shorthand she uses let me try doc suggested im anxious to hear her story there was to be no conversation now however doc had not formed a dozen characters when a loud hail came from the direction of the helldiver ahoy doc savage it was mohallets voice doc made no answer going on the principle that a silence would shake mohallets confidence to some degree i want to make a deal mohallet called again what kind doc demanded his mobile voice was pitched in a tone that carried strongly without being loud a deal which will save your lives mohallet retorted would you be kind enough to point out what danger now threatens our lives doc inquired certainly this pack of dogs you call your followers offers no menace mohallet cursed expressively wallah he yelled you would never be able to make your way from this spot to civilization doc laughed the sound was remarkably hearty and expressed an entire confidence in his ability to reach bustan the nearest settlement we will kill your two men whom we have aboard threatened mohallet trying a new tact what is your deal doc queried come aboard bringing the essential part of the submarine machinery which is needed to permit it to submerge and which is missing mohallet requested in return we will permit you to remain alive and will take you along with us unharmed huh monk exploded machinery missing who we werent born yesterday doc yelled what has the date of your birth got to do with it asked mohallet who was apparently not up on american slang i mean simply that we are not children enough to believe youd keep your word mohallet swore some more what is your price get off the submarine with your men clear out entirely la mohallet howled no doc debated take us fully into your confidence telling us what this is about and permitting us to remain in control of the submarine to sail it wherever you wish to go wallah that is agreeable mohallet was entirely too prompt in taking up the offer renny rattled his huge fists together the louse he dont intend to keep the bargain neither do we doc said dryly there wasnt a word said about us not climbing mohallet if we get the chance chapter xiv the pig kiss doc his three men and the whitehaired girl were not fired upon as they walked down to the beach they retained their weapons hey monk whispered you aint carryin no part from the submarine doc whered you put it i didnt remove any monk blinked his little eyes then johnny and long tom put over some kind of a fast one doc finished they must have removed the part themselves and given the impression we had it boats came from the submarine only one man was in each makin a big show in hopes well think hes goin to play square renny rumbled brown men appeared amid the rocks behind them they fingered their guns eagerly but offered no violence neither did they come close they had acquired a mighty respect for their foes doc and his companions entered the boats reluctantly the girl followed them her attractive face was twisted with distress she feels pretty tough about gettin us into this mess monk decided doc addressed the pretty young lady on his fingers dont worry about us he told her she smiled wryly shes got nerve ham admitted fiddling absently with his sword cane i wish we had time to get her story thatll have to wait until we get out of this scrape doc told him if we kill time this bird mohallet might use the interval to think up a scheme slick enough to sink us there were no weapons in sight upon mohallets person or on those of his men when doc reached the helldiver you see we are keeping our word mohallet murmured now if you will kindly replace the missing part he peered at docs person obviously wondering where the missing mechanism was concealed where are my other two men doc demanded johnny and long tom were led into view they were unharmed although their arms were bound cut them free doc commanded angrily this was done now we will go below and replace the part doc announced all in a group please mohallet commanded monk had retained his pig habeas corpus throughout the trouble monk would not readily turn loose of such a potent instrument for annoying the welldressed ham he carried the strangelooking porker big ears flapping as he clambered below they went forward moving in a tight group the girl and mohallet brought up the rear docs whisper reached only to long toms ear what did you fellows take off the machinery nothin chuckled long tom i simply shortcircuited some of the wires which lead to the electrical mechanism controlling the diving rudders mohallet a hit in the rear did not hear this statement he crowded up a false smile exposing his grotesque bejeweled teeth he was going to permit no plots to he hatched against him i must he a party in any conversation of course he smirked doc savage showed no emotion but he spoke rapidly lowvoiced the words were a weird combination of gutturals and clackings mohallets one good eye stared his other eye remained fixed like the orb of a dead man he had not understood a syllable of the tongue in fact only monk and mohallet had heard the words mohallet did not know it but there were few who could comprehend that language it was the pure speech of the ancient mayans those people of central america who once had a civilization that rivaled the egyptians doc and his men had acquired facility in the use of this tongue on a visit to the strange spot which was the source of the fabulous wealth which doc possessed in the lost valley in a remote central american republic lay a gold mine of almost fantastic richness a handful of survivors of the ancient mayan race lived there unknown to the rest of the world and worked the mine they had a powerful radio receiver at high noon on certain designated days doc had but to broadcast several words of mayan over a powerful radio transmitter within a few days the mayans would send out a treasure pack train of burros the value of these cargoes invariably ranged into millions this wealth it was understood was to he used by doc only to further his strange object in life the righting of wrongs and the punishing of evildoers all over the globe mohallet knowing nothing of all this was baffled by the weird words you will speak a language i understand he snapped teeth jewels bared in a snarl doc ignored him monk a grin on his homely face scratched habeas corpus behind the ears im gonna put my pet in my stateroom he said mildly you will stay with us commanded mohallet his evil and grotesque face ugly monk paid no attention he walked away mohallet glared did nothlng doc and the others worked on forward several brown villains joined mohallet some of them went ahead of the party they were patently suspicious of a trick doc killed time in the little compartment which housed the divingrudder mechanism monk rejoined the party he did not have the pig k doc said loudly well repair the mechanism long tom whispered mohallet is sure to pull something the instant we do let him doc replied in a low voice lets trail along with this thing and see what happens theres something big behind the whole business and im getting anxious to learn what it is make the repairs mohallet commanded impatiently it was part of the bargain that you tell us what use you intend to make of the helldiver doc pointed out i will tell you when the repairs are made hissed the barbariclooking mohallet long tom now replaced the control wires which he had shorted the task took only a moment he wheeled on mohallet you could have done that yourself if you had known anything about submarines he jeered son of a camel mohallet gritted sparks seeming to fly from his diamondstudded teeth he sprang suddenly backward a sweep of his arm sent the whitehaired girl reeling through the low door in a steel bulkhead with surprising speed he followed her scooped her up and ran aft she fought but was helpless against his strength he crossed a compartment which contained no machinery but was walled with bunks the sleeping quarters doc pursued them ignoring the group of brown men behind the swarthy fellows not closely acquainted with docs ability to move swiftly did not note that the bronze man was a bit sluggish in his actions doc and his five friends crowded into the sleeping compartment in a group they lumbered along between the bunks instantly doors slammed fore and aft metal dogs rattled renny crashed his great frame against one panel he handed it a resounding wallop with one of his huge fists nothing happened at the opposite end of the chamber monk was fighting the other door the slabs of plate steel were proof against anything less than a cutting torch or high explosive were trapped monk howled and theyve got the girl highly perturbed the five men stared at doc he showed no concern selecting a comfortable bunk he stretched out in it ham sheathed his sword cane which he had bared he peered at doc then he grinned straightening his immaculate coat you expected something like this he accused doc not something like this this very thing doc told him but blast it were in a worse keep your shirt on doc soothed well play the same game as those birds incidentally theyre not quite as slick as they think they are you mean the sub still wont run itll run all right if they have men aboard who understand the machinery they havent the fact that they didnt find the disconnected wires on the diving mechanism proves that not necessarily that mechanism is not the usual type a man who has spent years on naval submarines would have to puzzle it out before he saw how it worked docs prediction speedily proved to be correct the helldiver got under way showing there were men in mohallets crowd who knew enough of underseas craft to operate this one they heard a deck hatch clang forward an indication that the men in the bow compartment had clambered out and joined mohallet and the others in the control and engine compartments for fully two hours the helldiver did nothing but cruise at varying speeds several times a swaying of the steel floor showed the craft was turning whats the idea of this cruisin around monk pondered theyre familiarizing themselves with the controls and the handling of the boat doc hazarded the aimless cruising persisted for some time longer then the helldiver made three short dives the first was ragged the sub standing almost on its nose when it was down the second was better the third fair theyre improving ham admitted monk made a fierce face wish theyd get along with their mudpie making he got his wish the sub straightened out and began to cruise at fair speed then it turned and slowly submerged theyve gone along the coast some distance doc announced theyre now heading straight for shore the others showed surprise it was high tribute to docs concentration and keen senses that he had been able to keep track of their erratic progress the others had no idea where they had gone doc now pressed an ear to the hull plates for a long time there was no sound but the labor of the engines there came a sharp shock a blow delivered from the bottom the helldiver had touched the sea floor the engines now stopped apparently while mohallets men made sure no damage had been done they did not know that the sub would stand a much greater shock listen doc suggested his friends crammed their ears to the sweating steel plates they caught the sound immediately a combination of eerie gurgling mumbling and hissing faint fantastic the noise went on and on monk groped for a descriptive finally he grunted like some monster crying crying rock doc reminded a moment later the engines started again the helldiver inched forward the stout runners they were attached to the keel and the sides as well as to the deck gritting over a rocky bottom from time to time but what made that infernal crying noise renny boomed no one answered doc was quiet showing no concern as always the rest were on edge nervous they darted from one point to another in the little sleeping compartment jamming ears to the hull but they could hear now only the engine moan the diesels used on the surface had been shut off and electric motors were propelling their note was a dull whine mingling with the harsher gear noise the rushing of water and the occasional gobble of machinery as diving or steering rudders were operated blast it johnny snapped wrenching off his glasses to shake sweat from the lenses i wish i knew where were goin five minutes ten fifteen the suspense grew the motors were barely turning the helldiver must he making no more than three miles an hour a shock it resembled a blow from the top this time it was not especially hard what the blazes rapped johnny he pocketed his glasses in a case which had a special recess for the thick magnifying left lens the deck runners hit something that time were evidently going places doc told him dryly a sharp uptilt a loud sobbing as the ballast tanks blew showed the helldiver was coming to the surface the diesels did not start the electric motors continued propulsion but not for long the submarine veered to one side they could tell this because there was an abrupt tendency for their bodies to sway to the left the hull runners grated on rock they could hear men banging feet on deck chains rattled hawsers made faint scraping noises as they were dragged from special drums in the hull the motors died the helldiver sagged backward briefly then stopped with a faint jar she had been moored doc listened at the plates he heard a low gurgling on the outside of the hull runners we seem to be in a moving current of water he stated voices from mohallets men were now audible the stout steel walls made the words indistinguishable but the tones were shrill excited ham straining his ears tapped the hull in puzzled fashion with his sword cane they sounded like theyre scared stiff he volunteered now what can be wrong monks homely face cracked a big grin habeas corpus must be doin his stuff ham bristled dont mention that pig to me when we get out of this the first thing im gonna do is make breakfast bacon out of him monk acquired a foxy look ive got a great big kiss for the little thing thats gonna get us out of this ham should have been more wary but he was mad and he thought suddenly that doc and monk had conspired with the attractive whitehaired girl that she should release them me too he snapped ill kiss the one who rescues us from this mess mean that monk demanded owlishly cross my heart its a promise ham scowled at monks homely face and im sure it wont make her sick either you guys heard im promise monk told the others solemnly he said hed kiss habeas corpus what ham squawled the pig monk explained sweetly i put a chemical mixture on his bristles it works kinda like the itchin powder the kids have fun with only lots worse one of mohallets gang has touched habeus corpus and started burnin and when the others grabbed im to see what was wrong they began burnin tool monk leered happily at ham it looks like you kiss the pig mohallets men will let us out to stop the itchin ham said a gloomy nothing the rescue had suddenly lost its charm chapter xv the world of blackness mohallets voice penetrated the door in the stern bulkhead he sounded frightened he was very angry wallah he snarled when you spoke in the tongue i did not understand you planned a trick that khanzir that pig what has it done to my men waasalah akhkh alas and to me too doc came close to the bulkhead have all of your men been affected the fools grated mohallet they have like dogs when they began to itch they scratched each other and that spread the curse that is very bad doc said it will be bad for you bronze man we are going to put a bomb in the submarine and go off and leave it if you do not tell us how to get rid of this devilish affliction try washing it off curse you that only spreads the agony what is it that you have given us bronze man it would be terrible would it not if after hours of the pain you are undergoing now the flesh should begin to turn white then drop off in great chunks doc suggested mohallet swore shrilly you are trying to frighten us in the rear of the sleeping compartment monk whispered to the gloomy ham docs got im goin this stuff makes a little white blister theyll be scared green when they see those doc continued badgering mohallet it would not be pleasant said doc if as you watched lumps of your own body drop away there was great agony but not quite enough agony to kill you until perhaps you could see a few of your own bones nice thought eh mohallet launched a stream of his best maledictions that stuff wont have such an effect whispered bony johnny is doc saying it will long tom snorted hes just askin the guy how hed like them things to happen mohallet was screaming we shall go away and leave a bomb go ahead doc rapped go off and die mohallet apparently did leave for a few moments evidently running a little bluff of his own but he was hack before long driven by the smarting of the pernicious chemical we will let you out bronze man if you will agree we agree to nothing doc told him shortly mohallet outdid all his previous outbursts of vituperative his sulphurous word flow ran some three minutes seemingly without time out for a breath intake what are your terms he asked send the whitehaired girl to turn us loose doc ordered you and each of your men will advance one at a time and hand over all his arms then you will gather on deck and after that you get an antidote for what ails you beyond that we make no promises mohallet departed again there was a long wait punctuated by much agitated yelling and galloping about too several times there was sound of boxes being moved in the storeroom theyre cookin up somethin monk decided uneasily moving water continued to gurgle along the hull of the helldiver wonder where were at pondered bigfisted renny there are no rivers along this coast mohallet came to the bulkhead and cried angrily we accept your terms complying with instructions the whitehaired girl loosened the mechanical dogs which secured the door her eyes were radiant she said something happy and excitedly hut unintelligible in her native tongue shed your weapons doc yelled at the evil faces framed in the compartment to the stern a pistol skittered across the gridded floor more followed then rifles dont forget those poisoned knives and swords shimmering in the electric luminance blades cascaded to the floor the heap of arms grew spread holy cow chuckled renny they carried enough weapons for an army finally mohallet snarled that is all now the cure doc stood for a moment watching the brown men they were in great discomfort to say the least their fingers were going almost steadily scraping their smarting hides their efforts only spread the chemical and caused it to work deeper out on deck doc directed the swarthy men backed away they could he heard climbing the companion which led to the main hatch above the control room go mix the antidote monk doc directed monk hurried to his little stateroom he carried a remarkably compact assortment of chemical ingredients almost a complete laboratory in itself with him wherever he went the stuff had been rifled hut none of the bottles broken he worked swiftly at mixing a potion which would stop the smarting instantly to a man with his vast knowledge of chemistry the task was an easy one the pig habeas corpus appeared the unlovely specimen of a shoat seemed not greatly bothered by the itching chemical thats what comes of having a hide toughened by arabian fleas and lice monk chuckled he lathered habeas corpus liberally with the antidote grinning gotta get you prettied up ham is gonna kiss you monk rejoined doc the group clambered for the deck they did so warily expecting trickery alert for it holy cow renny bawled when he had his head outside they were in an abysmal darkness sunlight had been glaring nearly blinding when they had gone below it had been morning night could not have come so quickly and there never was a night with blackness such as this pitch darkness water gurgled it seemed to sob and course all around them the air throbbed with the sound of it the sucking swishing and splashing of a vast muffled waterfall this noise was not loud they had not noticed it while below had been aware only of a stream pouring past the moored helldiver that the submarine was moored became speedily evident mohallets voice came out of the abyss to the right wallah the remedy quick a chorus of agonized yells echoed the demand pleas by mohallets men that their distress he relieved doc savage knew now as he had earlier suspected that the insistence of mohallets followers ignorant and easily frightened was responsible for the speedy capitulation doc spiked a flashlight beam at the voices he saw a huge shelf of stone worn smooth and grooved deeply by the waters of ages an underground river renny boomed were in a great underground stream the engineers vast voice rumbled away in echoes thumping muttering bouncing back and forth following closely the echoes as if set off by them came a cataclysmic roar it was as if the two halves of the world had jumped apart and come together like a clap of gigantic hands the titanic sound of the blast mounted until it seemed to crush skulls and it was followed by lesser noises as if buckshot were rattling in a tin lid only of infinitely greater loudness the waters of the underground river lifted writhed expanded as if the stream were a colossal snake of liquid sucking in a great breath the helldiver came up on that awful surface chiplight the anchorage hawsers snapped like threads on a package the sub rolled as if she were a steel hog trying to wet her back doc gripped the big runners with one metal clamp of a hand his other hand collared somebody it was the whitehaired girl he held her from falling he called to his men to hold tight that was hardly necessary his great voice was lost in the whooping thunder which filled the huge cavern back and forth gamboled the echoes earsplitting in themselves the noise subsided slowly it seemed because of these echoes the submarine ceased to pitch so greatly rennys great voice boomed from toward the stern everybody all right youd better shut up came a somewhat shrill crack from long tom lookit what you started with that other yell doc came to his feet he bore the whitehaired girl toward the deck hatch she had made no outcry other than a gasp and she was silent now evidently knowing her words could not be understood she did not speak fortunately only the single hatch had been open there was water below but not enough to destroy the helldivers buoyancy doc switched on pumps to clear the water before it worked into the battery rooms doc threw the control which should have automatically started the engines nothing happened he tried the electric motors again no response he dived for the engine room first glance showed him the trouble mohallet had been tricky enough to do what he had been deceived into thinking docs men had done earlier he had taken essential parts of the mechanism light stuff which could be carried easily doc veered back for the deck passing the whitehaired girl who was trying to smile her gratitude he had wanted the engines going so he could cruise about in search of his men had any been washed overboard on deck he found all five safe but wet and puzzled what happened johnny pondered doc did not answer immediately he dropped back below got an empty bottle poured a little phosphorus in it and corked it back outside he flung the bottle into the water the glowing phosphorus made a surprising light in the infinite darkness the shiny spark surged about eddied this way and that but did not move greatly doc turned his flashlight on the cavern walls the submarine did not seem to be drifting an explosion that blocked the river mouth he declared mohallet must have planted the dynamite or nitro we had a quantity aboard plainly marked he had a man stationed to set the blast at a signal the fellow heard renny yell could not distinguish the words in the cavern and thought it was mohallet he set the blast and the river is blocked were not moving they must have set the blast to keep us from turning back they watched a bit longer to make sure there was no motion doing that they noted a fact of undeniable interest the river is rising johnny pointed out rocks that were sticking out of the water a few minutes ago you cant see now yells came from the shore mohallets men the peculiar acoustics of the cavern made them sound like an excited coyote pack theyve put themselves in a pickle monk chuckled and us in one too doc pointed out they have the engine parts they closed the river mouth to keep us from going back of course going to one of the deck hatches doc opened it and broke out a folding boat there were several aboard he placed this in the water long tom from his electrical equipment produced a powerful portable spotlight this was mounted with a clamp upon the how of the collapsible boat doc went alone to bargain with mohallet he found the outlaw and his followers a chastened itching group upon the ledge between scratching themselves and watching with popping eyes the rising water they were exceedingly busy they did not curse the sight of doc this time a swimming sinner in the great flood never looked at noah and his ark with more longing gaze mohallet tried to make terms you must agree to make us your equal partners when we reach the phantom city the phantom city doc demanded what is that i will tell you when you take us aboard you must also return our arms and permit us the run of the submarine thats a laugh doc jeered we have parts of the machinery which you must possess before you can escape the rising waters which will soon flood this cavern do you know how long the helldiver can remain under water what has that it can stay down several days in a pinch but you cannot leave we can stay down until you drown doc said shortly we have diving suits aboard the selfcontained kind which need no air hoses there is a diving lock which will permit divers to leave the helldiver and return while it is submerged we can simply come and get the machinery from beside your drowned bodies you might not find it mohallet said desperately in a pinch we would have enough time to make replacements right in the submarine doc now switched into arabic for the benefit of such of mohallets men as might not speak english and repeated his dire predictions this had the effort he hoped for the swarthy fellows began to insist on complete submission it ended with the missing parts being tossed to doc in the boat the bronze man immediately guided his little craft away he was pursued by wild cries some of mohallets men wanted to go back with him doc left the replacing of the parts to his five aids he still had not had time to question the whitehaired girl and even now it was necessary to postpone that a bit he wanted to inspect the scene of the explosion with the bow searchlight of his boat ramming an expanding rod of white he drove downstream he considered testing the air with his nostrils it was foul like that in a cave if there was ventilation through crevices in the rock above it was very meager he tipped the searchlight up the roof was perhaps three hundred feet above the opposite wall was fully twice that distance away the place was vast but as underground caverns went not without precedent the huge carlsbad caverns in new mexico had a room both higher and wider than this that did not detract from the uncanny air of the place however the darkness was especially effective the searchlight beam was like a white inlay in ebony if this was a river the water should be fresh doc decided he dipped a finger touched it to his tongue the water was very salty the scene of the explosion appeared it was at a sort of sinkhole where the salt river dipped down to come out beneath the sea the sinkhole had caused a whirlpool effect during high water and this had worn ledges on which mohallet had placed his explosive the river as near as doc could ascertain was blocked completely he investigated the surface of the piled rock he stripped and dived at the front edge ascertaining how much it sloped out and thus getting an idea of the possible thickness he spent some thirty minutes in this intensive investigation returning doc found the helldiver in running condition the parts replaced they cruised slowly toward the spot where mohallet and his men stood between the itching and the water the latter was now around their ankles the brown men were almost mad with fear several sprang into the river so frantic were they to reach the submarine this excited the rest they followed those who could not swim and they were plenty piled in after the others fearful lest they he left arms flailing screaming wildly for help they churned for the sub here and there men began sinking these when ever their heads were above the surface emitted grisly screeches it was a bedlam doc renny and monk promptly dived overboard to help the tearcrazed brown fellows it was no mean task the instant they came near a swarthy man he sought to climb atop them it was necessary to clip them senseless with fists docs other three men rapidfiring little pistols in hand stood on deck and in the control room and herded the swarthy gang below mohallet was one of the first to come aboard he scrambled down the metal ladder jeweled teeth hidden by angrily puckered lips the other members of the villainous swarm were rescued and hazed into the sub immediately a yelling went up for the potion which would alleviate the smarting affliction monk went to his tiny cubicle and concocted a fresh supply of the stuff the first lot had been lost overboard in the turmoil of the explosion which had closed the underground river mouth the prisoners had been wedged into the compartment which had previously held doc and his aids the sleeping quarters this chamber intended to accommodate a large crew was the most ample room in the helldiver it would accommodate mohallet and the others more than a score and a half of men all told mohallet had evidently left the rest of his followers on the goldtrimmed black yacht johnny and long tom protected monk with machinegun pistols as he opened the compartment door to pass in the lotion monk handed in the large bottle then he thrust in his head he intended to tell them that a thin application of the stuff would prove to be sufficient hey he howled he sought to leap into the chamber a volley of fists an avalanche of hissing brown bodies opposed him monk struck back grunting and howling monks fights were always noisy but the foes were too many for him he was forced backward the metal door shut and the dogs rapped into place what was it johnny barked that whitehaired girl monk groaned during the excitement as they came aboard they must have seized her theyre holding her in there jamming his homely face close to the steel panel monk ordered the young ladys release he promised fiercely to pull the ears the arms and the legs off each swarthy man if she was not freed they laughed at him monk hit the steel door a few times knowing he would never get in that way he spun away there was a cutting torch aboard with that they should be able to force the door doc intercepted monk let it ride he suggested the water is rising fast wed better sail upstream and see if we can find an exit if we cant were the same as entombed but that girl well drill a few holes in the bulkhead so we can watch and be sure they dont harm her k monk ran for the control room chapter xvi voyage of terror inset in the hull plates of the submarine were floodlights of mammoth candlepower thick lenses protected these near each light was an inspection port a small window of glass which would withstand tons of water pressure from without the original purpose of these had been to permit those within the submarine to peer out at the under surface of the polar ice pack the floodlights were switched on glare sprayed walls of the cavern seemed to jump out of the black abyss at them the rock was worn channeled and ribbed by high waters there were no stalactites the usual icicles of stone found hanging from cave roofs water seepage was necessary to form those and there was little rain on the arid waste above to make seepage the river although not flowing was full of eddies and flecked with foam it was a tortured monster bloating filling the fantastic hole which was its lair i never did like caves monk grumbled flinging out a furry hand to harvest habeas corpus who was on the point of leaping overboard for a swim long tom in the control room crouched over the sonic device for measuring the depth of the water the electrical wizard had made this particular apparatus with his own hands it was a good deal more sensitive than the fathometer mechanism utilizing the same principle in use on most modern ocean liners in addition long toms device would measure accurately the distance between the helldiver hull and a mass of ice or stone above or near the sides this latter feature would be invaluable should the sub have to dive in the underground river since long toms mechanism would register a distance of a few feet very soon they had to make such a dive the cavern closed down into the river ahead dropping below they dogged the hatches doc eased away buoyancy and set the diving rudders the floodlights were still brightly lighted ham took a bow inspection port renny and monk to port and starboard they kept a close anxious lookout doc handling the controls eased the helldiver ahead microphones and loud speakers were banked along the controlroom wall they relayed each word of the watchers at the inspection ports doc sank the submarine until the runnerprotected keel was no more than eight or ten feet from the bottom soon there came a slight jar kind of a ledge in front ham reported about thirty feet high a waterfall effect ease the bows up and we can get over the floor it was covered with a rubber composition grid would not become slippery with grease tilted a bit they crossed the ledge with a grumbling of steel runners on this business is worse than goin under the polar ice monk grumbled up there we always knew that in a pinch we could release a chemical from tanks in the hull and melt the ice overhead dry up snapped ham who was wearing a headset hooked in the loudspeaker circuit your jabber gives me an ache for the love of mud hams eyes popped his jaw fell he dropped his sword cane something he rarely did spinning slowly with the sluggish current a hideous hairy apparition had come within range of the floodlights it was a body the cadaver of some hideous dead thing in stature the specter attained nearly six feet the arms stiffly outstretched in rigor mortis had a span somewhat greater than the height of the figure the face was an unlovely mingling of the beast and the human enormous was the mouth the bared teeth porcine the nose was flat with the nostril holes seeming to open outward instead of downward the creature was furred almost as plentifully as a bear the hair was white as if the monstrosity had been wrapped in cotton it seemed dapper ham startled as he was did not pass the chance for a verbal snapper at monks expense look the lawyer howled monks ghost the thing did have monks simian build his furry hide only that the hair was white instead of a rusty red the slight underwater bow wave from the helldiver caused the apparition to be flung outward still spinning first to the side then head over heels as the vagaries of current dictated it was lost to sight doc leaping to an inspection port in the control room had secured a glimpse of the creature hey monk yelled was that thing human this caused ham to give a loud unkind laugh through the electrical communication circuit doc called do you fellers recall the crack the girl made about a white beast when she first saw monk you mean this mustve been a specimen of the things monk questioned whats your bet that it was one of em monk decided furthermore it was not a whitefurred ape or a gorilla but a human being of low mentality then as ham laughed again say shyster you aint kissed habeas corpus yet as you agreed to do ham sobered no more was heard out of him for many minutes the creature was human all right doc agreed but how come its hair was white renny boomed doc said dryly the girls hair is white too monk grumbled in defense her and that thing dont belong to the same clan this guy was a savage you could tell that thats not what i meant doc told him both of them having white hair indicates that both might have come from the same environment monk snorted i dont think im gonna like that environment if we get there doc now gave all his attention to navigating the helldiver it was a task akin to handling eggshells this was no ice floe under which they were traveling if they got stuck in the rock there would be no melting their way free with chemical from reservoirs in the submarines skin the river waters aided no doubt by the grinding effect of great boulders rolled along the bottom by the current had grooved out sizable trenches there was always a chance the submarine would wedge into one of these the ceiling was still under water current had strengthened they were moving out of the backwater doc touched the levers which controlled the motor speed whine of the machinery increased breasting the river the sub worked on it was like a metallic fish exploring the hole made by some waterdwelling animal blind except for the few yards the floodlights penetrated it nosed along if there was peril ahead they would be almost upon it before its presence could be detected there came a jarring a shriek of runners on stone the strange underseas boat came to a dead halt holy cow renny thumped the current rollin over a ledge ahead jammed us down in a floor groove no semblance of hurry entered docs movements he touched buttons compressed air shrieked water squished and bubbled as ballast tanks blew the helldiver was fitted with two caged propellers one port one starboard incidentally there was a third propeller in the center completely inclosed in a box of steel plates which were hinged and in an emergency could be dropped to permit use of the screw this prop had never yet been used except in tests nor did they need it now with a rasping grunt of stone and steel the sub came free letting water pour back into the tanks doc trimmed the craft before it banged the ceiling they felt their way onward ten minutes later they came to the surface the cavern roof arched above sometimes a few feet distant sometimes many yards black enough to be solid the darkness stretched ahead interminably now that navigation was not so ticklish a proposition doc turned the controls over to gaunt johnny out on deck doc sampled the air heres some encouragement he called what dyou mean renny rumbled the air is fresher every one not needed to navigate the helldiver now clambered out on deck the purity of the air and it was noticeably more breathable although still saturated with water and cavern odors indicated there was an opening they used powerful flashlights they were strong enough to give nearly the illumination of a searchlight these whitened the cave walls to either side and the roof above great crusts of dried salt resembling a deposit of frost was the principal scenic feature the briny water flowing past seemed as sepia as a rushing flood of drawing ink renny yelled to test the acoustics his vast voice gobbled and thumped crashing back and forth in echoes that seemed as loud as the original shout the weird hullabaloo set up by his cry persisted many seconds before it died the helldivers diesel surface engines were turned on their clamor hardly to be considered loud on the open sea became a monstrous growling in the confines of the huge underground river doc and his men discussed the situation doc had noted the reading of a sensitive barometric altimeter and its slow crawl as they progressed this gave the height to which the river had lifted it was not great its a sluggish stream as rivers go at best doc declared we have lifted enough however to know that there is no doubt but that the lower reaches of the stream which we just quitted are flooded queer this thing has never been discovered monk muttered the mouth must be under the sea but slightly exposed at low tide doc suggested the rush of water leaving together with the charge of warm air from outdoors to replace the cool air inside probably combine to make the sounds which gave the cavern mouth its name of crying rock johnny whose geology knowledge included an understanding of such phenomena seconded docs reasoning but the river is salt monk pointed out the desert of rub al khali lies overhead doc told him you remember the discussion we had about the place many rumors are heard about what lies in the region great salt marshes the ruins of cities erected by prehistoric peoples and so on the salt marshes might explain this river it may be their overflow the sea before many hours had passed mohallet and his men imprisoned as well as barricaded within the hull set up a great clamor they were starving they explained doc offered them food for the release of the whitehaired girl they refused you can consider yourselves on a diet then doc informed them no girl no grub and if any harm comes to that young lady youre out of luck mohallet tried to argue then he sought to obtain information about their progress how many qasabalis have you covered he wanted to know why doc countered bronze man you do not know whence we are headed make me and my men your partners and we will share alike too you will have our help you will need it you mean there is danger ahead great danger a danger greater than you can imagine and what else is there that i will tell you if you will release me nothing doing you got this information from the girl wallah i got it no matter how how did the girl get out of this place to which we are going mohallets reply was a derisive grunt doc persisted you wanted the submarine to go up this underground river thats why you came to new york to get it but why didnt you try planes waasafah akhkh alas i did this was news there had been no previous hint that mohallet had sought the use of airplanes before making his unfortunate attempt to get docs submarine didnt the planes succeed the desert is no place for planes bronze man mohallet said disgustedly the land is of such a great roughness that there is nowhere a landing place and there are great sandstorms which cause sand to work into the motors too the whitehaired girl did not know whither direction this underground river went wallah we searched long from the air but we did not find the phantom city nor did we find any sign of the white beasts so you did get your information from the girl doc mused lets hear some more about this phantom city and white beasts mohallet proceeded to imitate a clam chapter xvii the white beasts light magic was in the cry sunlight ahead renny perched on a protective runner near the bows was first to make the discovery they had been wending along the river for a long time the chronometer in the control room said it had been days they had barely kept ahead of the rising water each twentyfour hours doc had taken his regular two hour exercise routine he had just finished he increased the helldivers speed slightly it was like the dawn the blooming of that sunlight ahead it whitened until it hurt their eyes fifteen minutes later the submarine nosed into the solarirridated outer world for a short distance they sailed through a sheerwalled canyon the rock sides although not fabulously high were waterpolished so smooth as to be unclimbable a rocky island appeared it was like a tongue upright in the gullet of the canyon it was as bare and rounded as an egg it stood in the canyon center the walls spread a second island came into view also in the channel middle this one was less worn spotted with boulders and considerably larger than the first the stony walls fell away suddenly ahead lay a vast mirror a mirror of salt water one of the great salt marshes in the interior of arabia doc decided this river must be an outlet for all the marshes huh monk seemed somewhat disappointed he waved an arm there aint nothin here but sand rock salt water and plenty of hot sun what were you expecting the phantom city ham who had not yet complied with his promise to kiss habeas corpus sniffed audibly it looks like the phantom city is a phantom down below mohallet and his men set up a howling they had been doing that often of late they were really hungry by this time doc and his men had bored several holes in the steel bulkheads and had thus kept tab on the whitehaired girls welfare mohallet had treated her surprisingly well especially after doc had demonstrated how a machinegun pistol muzzle would fit through the loopholes through these the girl had received liquid food surplus cloth from several burnooses had contributed to a recess in one comer of the prison cell where the young woman could have privacy going down now doc conversed briefly with mohallet the outlaw chief refused to do anything unless given his liberty doc left him knowing hunger would eventually do its work the helldiver was bent a few degrees to port when doc returned to deck thought i seen something moving explained monk who was at the helm he pointed at a low knob just off the bows the water ended against a range of bare sunscorched hills these supported only the scrawniest of desert vegetation even close in the water was fairly deep they managed to maneuver the submarine with jumping distance of the shore even if we did go aground wed be lifted off later said johnny who had clipped colored sun lenses to his glasses the lake is bound to rise because of the closed river renny will remain aboard doc decided the others went ashore they had donned tropical sun helmets pocketed extra ammo clips for their guns they took no food they expected to be away no more than an hour or so long enough to see if monk had really seen anything and to climb a hill and look at the country the spot where monk thought he had perceived movement was not far from the larger of the two islands at the river entrance it might have been an animal he explained i couldnt tell probably the heat ham sneered or maybe a pig monk retorted they worked around a low headland over a small ridge doc in the lead halted what monk saw seems to have been plenty he said dryly bodies lay side by side about the same distance between each they numbered eight seven were large grotesque the eighth was smaller more symmetrical all of them were stiff and dead seven of the white beasts and the body of a whitehaired man muttered johnny suddenly wrenching off his glasses and their sun shield doc surveyed the vicinity then advanced at a run he examined the forms of the seven whitefurred apish men for men they were each wore a breech cloth of stiff camel hide the eighth man was of excellent physical development with a fairly intelligent face his skin was sunbrowned his white hair and a flowing white beard giving him a striking appearance his garb was interesting look at his duds gulped ham who was naturally intrigued by such things the attire consisted of a short tunic and shorts with a closefitting head covering the garments were made of flat plates none larger than a silver dollar loosely riveted together so as to be flexible the workmanship was excellent the color of the weird mail was that of silver only richer stooping swiftly doc eyed the stuff he touched it bent one of the plates between his powerful thumb and forefinger whatre they made of demanded ham wed better analyze it and make sure doc told him a rare thing had happened to the big bronze mans voice it sounded puzzled whipping erect doc began to circle rapidly his course spread over a wider area sand lay among the rocks he found prints the feet of the hairy apish man he followed them a short distance they suddenly told him a story he raced back to his fellows we interrupted some kind of a ceremony he gestured at the eight bodies all of these fellows if youll notice were killed with sharp instruments probably spears theyve been dead some time but there were many more of the whitefurred creatures here not many minutes ago sand particles are still tumbling into the tracks they left and they circled around us headed for the helldiver huh monk gulped wheeling he sprinted back in the direction of the submarine the others followed heads down silent they ran sweat began writhing in pale rivulets down their frames it was oppressively hot long before they came in sight of the submarine they heard rennys thunderous voice boom out heard howls the bullfiddle moan of rennys rapidfirer the white beasts had attacked the helldiver there was a horde of them at least a hundred they swarmed over the submarine hull like pale flies forward of the conning tower rennys giant form centered a fighting cluster use the mercy bullets doc directed he led his four aids in they came close before they began firing they had latched their guns into singleshot to conserve ammunition at the first rapping shots the big whitefurred men spun upon this new menace bellowing in a strange guttural dialect they charged they were less inhuman when seen alive these apish fellows they were in fact dot a great deal nearer missing links in appearance than monk the hair of some was not a true white but ranged to yellowish and even a pale brown they carried spears armed with primeval tips of stone and crude bludgeons they dropped like flies before the mercy bullets which were little more than softmetal shells filled with sleepinducing drug renny still fighting was toppled off the submarine he hit the salty water with a great splash sank came up and struck out at hirsute foes who had followed him in his huge fists were as effective as blacksmith hammers in front of doc and the other four the bestial men wavered and began to give way the little guns seemed to carry terror suddenly a new courage swept them they bawled in their coarse lingo from behind doc came a great roll of yells the sound of hundreds of brutish voices all screeching at once the beat of feet became a mumble like the noise of stampeding cattle doc and his four aids veered around blazes monk gulped theres so many of em they look like a snowstorm the hills were emptying a swarm of the hairy men they had been congregated back there these fellows are not entirely ignorant doc said grimly they set a trap and we tumbled right into it theyve got us cut off try to make it to the sub that it speedily developed was a herculean task it defied accomplishment their foes at the helldiver made a concentrated rush hurling spears throwing clubs they came faster than they could be put to sleep with the mercy bullets johnny went down bony limbs thrashing monk his snorting and bellowing surpassing the uncouth cries of his foes waded in and got the gaunt geologist to his feet then they both vanished under an avalanche of snowy forms doc plunged to their aid he was met by a determined cluster of the hairy men they seemed to sense this bronze giant was the chief of those they had attacked they concentrated on him and got a surprise of no mean proportions spears thrust at the bronze man impaled only sunheated desert air smashing clubs encountered space the speed with which doc weaved and dodged was uncanny the brutish men emitted cries shrill bleats like the whimpering of puppies thwarted in some desire the swarm charging down from the hills arrived a white tidal wave of fighting men they overwhelmed what resistance doc and his men could offer dodging twisting dropping an occasional hulking fellow with rapier blows which impacted before they were seen doc sought to keep in the clear diving a hairy man got him around the knees there was tremendous strength in the anthropoid arms another hirsute figure launched upon his shoulders arms with a wrenching animallike power inclosed his neck so mightily was the bronze man muscled that it was seldom he encountered human beings capable of meeting him on even terms he had met them now they crashed down in the sand thrashing striking doubling doc got corded hands upon the creature who held his knees his fingers probed for nerves found them with a hideous bleat the fellow flopped to the earth temporarily incapable of more motion reaching up and back doc seized the head of the one who gripped his neck he pulled doubling simultaneously the hairy man gyrated through the air and splashed into deep water half a dozen figures charged doc it was almost magic the way he slid through their clutches leaving only parts of his garments behind one snowy man got docs rapidfirer however he knew the little black implement was a weapon he fumbled foolishly with it lacking the intellect to operate the thing docs eyes roved what he saw was far from pleasant all his men had succumbed battered bruised skinned they were in the grips of hairy captors none seemed seriously damaged doc knew that it was only a matter of moments until he would himself be captured the odds were hopeless escape landward was out of the question the hairy men were so many there that they resembled a drove of sheep whirling doc leaped into the water he filled his lungs in the air stroked deep and sought to get under the keel of the helldiver he found it necessary to swim downward steadily in order to remain beneath the surface he felt light as a cork that meant the water was heavy with salt in solution literally a brine he collided with the helldiver hull pulled himself downward and under the keel by gripping the steel runners on the other side he bobbed to the surface the hairy men were not watching here unnoticed doc clambered up they saw him just as he dropped down the controlroom hatch yelling they rushed for the sub doc ran to the compartment where mohallet and his followers were imprisoned they were shouting beating on the steel door anxious to know what was going on outside doc loosened the metal dogs which held the panel then whirled and sprinted back he was sheltered in another cubicle before mohallet and his men got the door open the swarthy men fought each other to be first outside not one remained in the prison they had occupied for days the whitehaired girl did not appear doc ran into the prison compartment at sight of him the girl cried out in her strange tongue her voice was glad she crouched in a corner despite her long imprisonment she had managed to keep her exotic garb remarkably neat she spoke rapidly then realizing doc could not understand her words she reverted to abbreviated deafanddumb finger signs she wanted to know what had happened the white beasts doc informed her with signs she shivered the gladness seemed to ooze out of her chapter xviii joy ride fighting was rampant on deck mohallet and his followers without exercise for days were getting it aplenty now from the sounds they were not doing so badly theyre welcome to whatever headway they make doc thought grimly he knew he had not sent mohallet and the rest to any fate which they would have escaped had he not released them left imprisoned they would certainty have been captured a swarthy man streaming crimson from a head cut fell down the controlroom companion and ran along a steelwalled corridor half a dozen breechclothed whitehaired savages pursued him more followed doc swept the girl forward they exchanged no more sign talk there was not time for it a try at submerging the helldiver would be useless it was moored to a rock hump ashore with a hawser which the best efforts of the engines would not snap wrenching open a small cabinet doc took out two diving lungs these consisted of little more than nose clips and mouthpieces from which a hose led to an oxygen and airpurifying tank which could be strapped on the hack in another cabinet lay other diving equipment pressure suits for deepwater work heavy leaded ankle weights were there doc seized some they would be necessary in this buoyant salt water the diving lock a chamber which permitted ingress and egress under water was situated near the bows he made for it closing the watertight pressure door behind them five minutes sufficed to don the lungs and the heavy anklets of lead doc instructed the girl in the simple operation of the apparatus repeating his directions several times then he thrust the lever which opened the diving compartment to the water brine rushed in filling the little chamber the buoyancy of it lifted them the weights tugged at their ankles doc dropped out he sank perhaps ten feet it was possible to keep his eyes open in the water the stuff was remarkably clear for all of its salt content the girl glided down to his side her hair it was not inclosed by the diving lung which was hoodless seemed even whiter beneath the surface doc grasped her hand they walked away leaning fat over to move against the weight of the water having retained his sense of direction doc set a course parallel to the shore veering in a bit where the depth was not so great possibly twenty feet above their heads the pressure there was not uncomfortable brilliant sunlight penetrating the brine seemed to dispel its body it was as if they were walking in a strangely solid air such bubbles as arose and there were a few resembled jewels past experience had told doc about how far they would go in a given time distance covered was deceptive under water since it required a great deal more effort and their steps were short at the best fifteen minutes later he angled over found a low place which meant a gulch and quitted the water the whitehaired girl tramped at his side they were in a wash with gently sloping sunheated sides doc motioned the girl to remain where she was stripping off diving lungs and weights he clambered up the slope affairs at the submarine had taken a turn different than he had expected mohallet was palavering with the whitish apish men the swarthy fellow was waving his arms and talking with great vehemence his followers were gathered behind him they seemed to have suffered few casualties doc discovered his own five friends they had been bound tightly flung down on the sand and were under heavy guard turning doc beckoned the girl obediently she scrambled up to his side he spoke slowly and carefully in a dialect peculiar to certain inland nomads of arabia it was evident that she comprehended many of his words but not quite enough to get his meaning this proved what he had surmised her tongue was merely an inland dialect of arabia he reverted to the fingered words does mohallet speak the language of the white beasts my own tongue and that of the white beasts is almost the same he read from the girls fingers mohallet learned to speak with me so he can converse with the others doc decided to settle a point which had puzzled him from the first how does it happen that you can transmit english on your fingers yet do not speak or understand the tongue she smiled slightly a grand tribute to her courage some forty years ago a man of your own race came to my people out of the desert he had been unlucky enough to be captured by the white beasts and we rescued him in a raid upon their village doc nodded the wanderer who had come to her people must have been some unlucky explorer the white beasts had tortured this man they had cut out his tongue before we arrived and thrust sharp thorns into his ears rendering them useless continued the girl her slender fingers flashing letters rapidly doc nodded once more the explorer had been the same as deaf and dumb he saw the light he watched the girls fingers go on unable to hear our language this man looked in a book which was in his supplies and from it taught us a way of talking on our fingers that he might converse with us the abbreviated finger talk continued he lived with us the rest of his life i knew him in my youth he taught me the language and grateful for my kindness to him in his old age he made me many small presents her youth could not have been long ago doc reflected she was not more than twenty if he was any guesser he squinted at the submarine nothing radical had developed mohallet was still haranguing he turned his attention back to the girl anxious to get her story how did you get out of this place he questioned the white beasts captured me she replied then looked as if that explained everything i do not understand doc persisted the white beasts throw their prisoners dead and living into the mouth of the underground river as sacrifices she transmitted it chanced that the stream was very low when i was thrown in the seasonal rains had not come and the sun had sucked up the waters until they were low i got through doc perceived how that was possible the salty brine would make it simple since a human form floated easily in the stuff from this it was evident that the mouth of the underground stream at crying rock was occasionally exposed what did you do for food he queried i did without i was very weak and could not run away when a raiding party from mohallets main band found me doc was catching her abbreviated words more easily now he found that repeating them under his breath as they were formed helped of course a person could go downstream much faster than the submarine had come up but her long voyage underground must have been a ghastly ordeal why is mohallet so anxious to get to the phantom city he asked i do not know is there any platinum in the city i do not know what platinum is doc considered then decided to go deeper into the platinum subject it is a grayish shiny metal there is much of that there was a man lying dead on the shore doc explained he was evidently one of your people he wore garments made of plates of a shiny metal is that the same metal of which you have so much she showed distress the white beasts kill many of my people and have done so for years until there are hut few left yes that is the metal doc scratched his head thoughtfully it was not often that he made any kind of gesture when thinking were you wearing garments of this metal when mohallet found you he asked no they were too heavy i threw them off but you told mohallet of the stuff he asked yes i told him how much there was that was before i knew him to be an evil man my words seemed to excite him greatly i dont doubt it doc said aloud but he sounded puzzled he reverted to fingered words were you not wearing bracelets or rings of white metal yes one bracelet it was very dear to me because wait doc rapped in english then held up a hand to make himself understood mohallets confab with the white beasts had come to an end an end favorable to mohallet some sort of an agreement had been reached the white beasts it was evident from what now ensued had accepted mohallet and his swarthy villains as allies temporarily at least docs five friends were lifted and carried to the submarine they were not taken below but dumped on deck as many of the furry white savages now clambered aboard the helldiver as could cling many of them went below from the way they fingered around stroking the guard rails opening and shutting the hatches and laughing wildly it was apparent they were intrigued by this great steel toy the mooring cable was cast off and hauled in the vibration of the surface diesels came to docs sensitive ears the helldiver began to move wonder what they think became of us doc pondered on his fingers giving the girl a smile to insure her confidence the smile had a somewhat different effect than doc had hoped for the entrancingly pretty whitehalred girl returned it with a look doc had seen before on the features of members of the fair sex he made his bronze countenance sober it was invariably something like this when he was thrown with a young lady whatever race the girl belonged to the same thing happened and it always made doc genuinely uncomfortable the whitehaired girl was stricken with the bronze mans undeniable good looks she would be affected more as time passed it was always that way as had many another she was headed for disappointment doc had long ago made up his mind that the fair sex had no place in an existence such as he led a life in which hardly a day was without its deadly peril not only to doc but to those associated with him he made a very intent job of watching the submarine mohallets followers were evidently taking their savage allies for a little joy ride the helldiver swept some distance offshore then cruised along at a fair pace the whitefurred savages did much squawling in their low dialect and jumping around they took turns diving below to inspect the marvels there since some had to come up before others went down it was evident the interior of the underseas boat was jammed something happened the sub veered suddenly for shore it put on great speed spray flew from the bows terror seemed to sweep the decks mohallets men piled wildly out on deck and crowded for the bows as if greatly desiring to get that much nearer land then the truth became evident the submarine was sinking going down by the bows the presence of mohallets men on deck showed the submersion was not deliberate some accident had occurred below one of them opened the door of the diving compartment not knowing what it was and they cant get it closed doc informed the girl in the sign language water is coming in flooding the sub the scene which followed would have thrown a movie director into ecstasies of delight it was mob terror in its most spectacular form long before the helldiver reached shore men began leaping overboard it was not necessary for them to swim the salty water floated them like corks theres machinery which will close the divingcompartment door doc yelled making an effort to save the craft he had put himself in plain view his great voice romped across the briny surface with surprising volume but there was too much yelling confusion aboard the sub for him to be heard the helldiver sank perhaps a hundred yards offshore chapter xix the red city doc remained where he had appeared in his unsuccessful effort to shout word of how to close the diving compartment hatch to those aboard the unlucky submarine although mohallet and the others had not heard him they had seen him there was no necessity for going back in hiding he saw his five friends still bound bobbing about on the salty surface it was fortunate they had been on deck when disaster came they were seized like so many floating logs and hauled ashore great though the confusion had been doc concluded every one had escaped from the mel diver he discerned mohallet paddling shoreward in the wake of a hairy savage who seemed to be chief of the white beasts for several minutes monster bubbles came up from the sunken underseas boat they made hollow coughing noises as they broke an oil slick appeared on the surface there was not a great deal of the oil only that which came from saturated waste drip pans and possibly an open oil can or two it was impossible to tell from this distance how deep the submarine sank before encountering bottom the first savages to reach shore jumped up and down and screamed shrilly they walked in small circles making gestures of tearing something to pieces and contorting their already unlovely faces into hideous grimaces this performance seemed intended to convey the same idea which an american puts across by shaking his fist at an enemy they were making their threats in the direction of mohallet but the wily bandit chief put on a wrath act of his own the instant he reached shore he poked his arms frantically in the direction of doc and the girl howling the furry men raced for doc it was to be suspected from their actions that mohallet had made his superstitious allies believe that doc was responsible for the sinking of the submarine doc whirled the whitehaired girl was putting her diving lung back on no doc told her on his fingers we might have trouble leaving the water and once in it we could not keep track of my five friends his shirt torn in the fight was merely a few soaked rags he discarded it and his undershirt which was also torn the sun hot as it was would not blister his bronze skin the bronze hue was itself due to exposure to tropical suns doc tied the two diving lungs at his belt the heavy lead anklets he discarded if necessity arose large rocks would serve the same purpose do you know this country he asked the girl she gave a perfectly american nod of affirmation what direction is best for our flight she pointed to the north they set out clambering up the opposite side of the small canyon beyond it lay other gulches some sheer of wall almost unscalable others were gentle valleys there were a few scrawny desert shrubs thornarmored nowhere was there grass the rocks themselves had the appearance of having once been baked in a furnace they were heatcracked grooved where sand and wind had worn away veins of softer substance baying like animals the whitehaired savages surged in pursuit their longarmed apish forms seemed adapted to the rough going the way was almost half steady climbing up and down they came on with appalling speed with the passage of less than two hundred yards the whitehaired girl began to show distress except for the liquids taken through the bored holes she had been without food during the long period of confinement with mohallet inside the submarine and was correspondingly weak she realized her condition you had better go on alone doc shook his head no or i had better enter the water while you go he picked her up handling her weight lightly and draped her across a shoulder one hand kept her there firmly in position she would not be uncomfortable if the girl thought they had been traveling fast she received a surprise now the bronze man went ahead with a speed which exceeded by many times that of their pursuers instead of scrambling down rocky cliffs he negotiated them with long drops which seemed certain to shatter his powerful legs yet never did several times he spanned rocky cracks with leaps which caused the girl to make choking sounds of horror then her confidence in the mighty bronze man increased and she made these sounds no more the pursuing white beasts and their swarthy allies fell behind rapidly doc stopped what is your name he asked the girl using one hand ja she told him he lowered her you will remain here ja i will be back shortly im going to persuade our pursuers to use caution he left her hidden in a rocky recess and turned back his speed now was even greater he slowed a bit when he could hear the labored breathing of those who followed peering around a boulder he saw them four of the apish men had distanced all the others they were the strongest and most agile of the white beasts they had lost their crude weapons in the submarine accident it seemed for they carried no arms and none were concealed in their scanty hide garments doc let them come close then rushed suddenly his fists lashed two terrific swings and dropped a savage the others howled in rage but they had courage they did not flee before charging the bronze giant they groped about for small rocks to use as weapons that was their undoing one fell his jaw battered out of kilter even as his furry paws closed over a stone the surviving pair danced about clumsily seeking to adopt docs style of fighting with his fists that was even more unfortunate than their pause to get rocks gliding up to them doc weaved away from their ungainly blows simultaneously landing punches of his own there was a frightful power in the bronze mans fists they hit with precision searching out vulnerable spots and they left squarish patches of crushed broken skin which oozed scarlet doc left all four big savages spread senseless on the sand he returned to the girl despite his exertion there was hardly a perceptible increase in his breath pace the girl had a suggestion on her finger tips why not go to my people and secure their help doc considered this briefly is it far they dwell in the phantom city it is nearly half a days journey from here she seemed to consider her late experience with docs pace of travel but you might make it in two hours doc nodded we will go there ja he told her he did not add that his purpose in going was to get her to a place of safety leaving himself free to go into action unhampered they set out to the northward it was a city carved from solid rock a mountain of stone hewn and hollowed into walls streets and dwellings the rock was a pale red in color doc savage from a distance of possibly a mile studied the strange sight he had noted specimens of the red stone in the course of their twohour journey the stuff was porous easily worked yet a fabulous amount of labor had gone into the carving of the phantom city the fantastic metropolis was situated at a considerable height above the level of the salt marshes beyond it mountains towered even higher down these precipitous slopes crawled a stream of fair size no doubt it was fed by springs so that it ran the year around vegetation rimmed the creek on level ground below the city of rock were small patches of growing crops obviously irrigated doc stared at these tiny plots of grain they were most interesting the crops were not green but strangely white a color akin to the hair of the people who lived here is the water in that stream drinkable doc asked yes explained the girl it is the only drinkable water for a distance of countless qosabols the white beasts also get their water for drinking and bathing from it doc was silent a bit the luster of the sun seemed to kindle small flames in his golden eyes an indication that he was pondering the puzzle of the white hair the white grain fields then he got it it is something in the water that makes your hair white isnt it ja he asked it must be she replied the stranger who taught us the talk of the hands had black hair when he came but it became as our own hair when he had dwelt a while idly doc reflected that an american beauty specialist could clean up if he had this stream available the bleaching compound was no doubt dissolved from a formation somewhere near the streams source whether drinking the water or bathing in it was responsible for the whitening process it was difficult to say but the shade of white was beautiful ja was rested now she ran by docs side as he swung toward the phantom city the going was somewhat smoother here in the past two hours doc had managed to pick up a great deal of the girls language his very complete knowledge of arabic root words made that simpler he had simply to ask her for the word which corresponded with one transmitted on his fingers in english it was necessary for her to give him the words only once that was enough to fix them in his retentive memory the red rock walls of the strange metropolis shoved up ahead of them the fact that they were one great mass of stone without joints anywhere gave the place a modernistic aspect there was no sign of life hut this did not alarm the girl they do not know whether we are friends or enemies she said speaking slowly trying to use words doc had learned they will remain hidden until they are sure the walls were perforated with a massive gate coming close doc observed these gates with interest they were of metal it was covered with a corrosion but at points the corrosion film had been scraped off the metal below had the color of silver only a bit deeper as they came nearer ja pointed a slender hand at these gates and said that is the metal of which i told you the metal which you called platinum doc was shocked into one of his rare exhibits of surprise those gates were solid massive they must weigh tons he glided close studied the metal he picked up a rock and scraped it through the graygreen corrosion he spun on the girl listen ja was the jewelry you wore when mohallet found you his query was never finished with a lusty groaning the monster metal gates swung ajar there had been no sound from within no one had appeared there was no sound now nor did men show themselves the gates simply opened actuated by some crude but efficient mechanism contained in chambers hollowed out within the walls the effect was ghostly one befitting the eerie name of phantom city come the girl started within the walls wait doc said sharply in her tongue i do not like this the girl hesitated then retreated a few paces from the gates it is strange that they have not hailed us she murmured doc not understanding some of her words nevertheless got enough of them to secure her meaning lift your voice and call to them he suggested the girl complied loudness seemed to detract nothing from the quality of her musical voice for some seconds after her cry no answer came a man appeared abruptly within the gate and a little distance back from it he was a tall man handsome and powerful of build he had the same remarkable snowwhite hair as ja this individual spoke so rapidly in the strange tongue that doc could not catch the words slight as was his familiarity with the language he says that there has been a great fight with the white beasts the girl translated slowly many are wounded and he is the only one at the gates he asks us to hurry in that he may shut the gates should the white beasts again come very careless doc reflected to have only one lookout at the gates or perhaps other fighting men tired from combat were sleeping near at hand where they could be called in case of an attack by the white beasts he entered the gates at jas side a street stretched ahead a ditch cut in the solid rock the sides perforated with doors all of which seemed of exactly the same size bodies lay in the streets men killed in recent combat some were those of whitehaired folk powerfully formed by far the greater number were the apish white beasts they approached the single living figure the man who had summoned them in he stared at them there was something rigid queer about his stance suddenly the man screamed words in the dialect the whitehaired girl whirled a trap she shrieked he was promised his life if he would decoy us in out of doorways around them simian white beasts bounded they flooded the vicinity of the gate blocking egress there chapter xx phantom sudden appearance of the hairy white savages told a story in itself they had taken the phantom city capturing or slaying the inhabitants this explained why no one had appeared upon the walls the white beasts had waited and with an animal cunning had thought of the decoy trick the decoy had repented too late his warning accomplished nothing but his own death for with a hideous bellow a hairy man smashed a club against the fellows head he tumbled down instantly dead a stoneheaded spear came hurtling at ja only docs quick wrench which pulled her to her knees saved her the spear rotating rapidly as it flew hissed on and smacked its head into a thousand fragments on a red stone wall it was imperative that they get out of the street to the right the house roofs doc rapped fighting silently he strove to open the way some one threw a heavy club doc saw it coming but did not get out of its way instead when it was half an arms length from his head he caught it stepping backward in the fashion of a baseball catcher absorbing the jar of a fast ball an instant later the club thrower was down several ribs broken by his own weapon which had come back at him too swiftly for his eyes to follow there were too many of the white beasts they closed upon the girl grasped her and hauled her to the street which was also of hard red rock doc a windmill of dangerous fists churned in to help her it was hopeless even his fighting qualities had a limit the hideous foes were so thick they clambered atop each other to get into the fight despite his best efforts doc was forced away from the girl he did however manage to maneuver under a wall he crouched then sailed upward in a great leap his fingers gripped the edge of a roof he swung up a flung club smashed against one arm as he went over it bounced back as if it had collided with steel springs doc ran across the roof it was flat like the top of a stone block there was another street beyond rather narrow he cleared it easily with a leap that would have seemed prodigious to another man he examined his arm where the club had hit there was a great ache in it the skin was broken slightly but the giant muscles and the hone beneath were not damaged seriously a weird sort of houndandhare game now ensued the apish savages lacking the agility to leap the streets were greatly handicapped but what they lacked in grace they made up in persistence back and forth the chase led from the roof tops doc discovered be could see over the city walls for a considerable distance to the eastward lay the marshes they stretched so far they were lost in distant haze like a sea there should doc reflected be water grass growing in the brine or around its edges none was evident a moment later he understood the reason this salt marsh must be one of many which covered a considerable area of these the outer world knew the other marshes no doubt situated on higher ground fed into this one the closing of the underground river had caused the brine to rise that was why no water grass was visible it had been covered to a depth of many feet doc dropped down and entered a hollowed stone house he discovered passages leading downward and it speedily became evident that there were corridors and crosscorridors undermining the whole city doc entered these his anthropoid pursuers were as unfamiliar with this underground labyrinth as was doc their pursuit lagged before long they had no idea where in the many acres the phantom city covered doc was lurking they had made no more progress by nightfall dry clarity of the desert air made the night heavens a thing of brilliant splendor the moon seemed to come thousands of miles nearer the earth the stars were distinct as distant electric lights doc savage left a subterranean chamber of rock where he had concealed himself and made for the city walls they were not so high but that he could drop over them safely with his agility he could have quitted the city of stone at any time during the afternoon and escaped but he had remained behind for a reason he had wanted to eavesdrop on the white beasts and get a line on any plans they might have he had succeeded conversation of two warriors spoken lazily because they were tired and the afternoon hot had been slow enough for docs comprehension the prisoners from the submarine would no doubt be brought here there was no word of that for the savages in the phantom city as yet knew nothing of the submarine episode but here was to be the future headquarters of the hairy men in this city of solid stone the whitehaired girl ja still lived she had been placed with perhaps twoscore other persons the stoic survivors of the phantom city inhabitants these captives doc had gathered were to be sacrificed a few at a time by being tossed in the underground river poised near the city walls doc waited his eyes probed the brilliant moonlight both in search of the party who held his five friends prisoners and to consider various avenues of flight toward the marsh seemed to be the best route down the river during the afternoon doc had noticed numerous small irregularly shaped objects scattered along the bank some distance downstream he had figured out what they were inflated camel hides used for boats rafts rather such craft were used by arabian nomads along the river jordan a small incision was made in a slain camel and flesh and bones removed the camel was taken out of his skin instead of the skin from the camel once this was done holes were sewn tightly and the skin blown up with air these camel rafts would support much weight but doc did not have a high opinion of their sailing qualities camels seemed fairly plentiful in the surrounding desert in the course of the afternoon doc had glimpsed a number of them they were drinking not from the river but from the salty brine of the marsh this verified scientific reports that this great desert held such a species of camel as for the water from the stream doc had quenched his thirst from a jar of that which he found in a dwelling the stuff had a pronounced but not unpleasant taste of chemicals in solution doc was now quite sure bathing in the stuff was what turned ўthe hair white the chemical content simply bleached the hair his thoughts snapped suddenly to the present coming through the moonlight was a file of savages and burnoosed brown men the serpentine caravan crawled closer coarse shouts pealed from the red stone walls of the phantom city other yells came back from the newcomers doc discerned the form of mohallet with a burly bleached savage evidently the chief of the white beasts he led the caravan docs five friends marched about halfway back their wrists were bound at their backs the massive gates of whitish metal swung open to admit the arrivals a great excitement seized mohallet the instant he saw those gates he ran to them scratched them with a dagger which he had managed to salvage somewhere and his ecstasy increased at the shine of the metal beneath platinum he screamed in arabic wallah it is platinum these gates are alone worth millions of dollars it was impossible for mohallet to be sure the gates were of platinum since they were in the moon shadow beneath the walls doc reflected mohallet must have been certain he would find much of the metal which composed the bracelet the whitehaired girl had been wearing when his men found her wandering on the arabian coast there was a great rejoicing around the gates all of mohallets swarthy men joined in they considered their fortunes made for the time being how they would get out of the country was forgotten docs five friends stood by grimly silent the white beasts also stood around unable to understand why shiny metal should drive their allies to a species of insanity the march was eventually resumed a bronze ghost of a figure haunted the journey through darkened streets of stone doc could move with uncanny stealth he had perfected this ability by studying the methods of masters of stealth the hunting carnivora of the jungles none saw him a burnoosed brown man spying a dead man in a side street and noting the form was clad in a mailed suit of the shiny metal could not resist the impulse to slip away from the column and secure the armor he was wrapping the metallic garment in a bundle when some kind of a monster seemed to swallow the world at least that was the swarthy fellows impression there was a great blackness before his eyes a roaring unconsciousness doc savage lowered the senseless bundle of bones his fist landing on a vulnerable nerve center had produced unconsciousness about as quickly as was possible he wanted the mans burnoose to use as a disguise securing the flowing garment required only a moment he did not fancy the smelt of the thing but it was no time for squeamishness he donned it several of mohallets followers stared suspiciously as the burnoosed figure of a man glided up and joined them they had noticed the fellow depart perhaps now in their subconscious minds was the thought that the one who had returned was a bit larger than he who had departed doc used a simple method in allaying their suspicions from his burnoose he tugged an end of the metal armor the others seeing it grinned widely their suspicions never quite real vanished they could understand a side trip for pilfering the column tramped on no one aware that doc savage had affixed himself to it it was dark in the streets and doc kept has hood pulled well over his features the cavalcade came finally to a structure hewn in what had been the peak of the red rock mound which had been sculptured to create the phantom city they entered a large amphitheater open to the sky this was undoubtedly an audience chamber where rulers in the heyday of this weird city had received the populace doc now secured one of the important pieces of information he was after the prisoners were confined in a large room opening off the amphitheater doc was among the group who conducted renny monk and the others to the prison room the interior was lighted with torches of thornwood doc saw ja she was not hurt seriously however most of the other captives were marked with wounds of more or less degree all however were capable of keeping their feet a metal door was shut on the prisoners in the center of the amphitheater a conference got under way mohallet was losing no time confronting the chief of the white beasts he spoke in a loud voice slow and distinct enough that all could hear his own men naturally could not comprehend the tongue of the white beasts in which mohallet spoke doc due to the effort mohallet made to speak slowly and distinctly understood most of it the bronze man and the five who accompanied him are demons mohallet announced they have closed the outlet of the marsh you have noticed the water is rising it will continue to rise until this city and all the rest of the world is flooded mohallet was exaggerating greatly doc reflected but the whitefurred savages ignorant as they were believed him a loud angry rumble went around largely composed of threats against doc and the others you must kill the bronze man then maybe the river will flow under the mountains again bellowed mohallet will it flow if we slay him demanded the chief of the white beasts it may but i cannot be sure said the canny mohallet will it flow if we slay not only the bronze one but his five men and our other captives as well you will try and see directed mohallet coldbloodedly but i have told you i can guarantee nothing shall we make the sacrifices immediately pondered the bewildered chief the lake has risen much and my people are greatly worried they think the rising of the waters is a curse upon us for taking this city nonsense shouted mohallet the curse is this white metal which you have come in contact with you must get rid of it send it where you will not touch it and be contaminated he allowed time for this statement to be absorbed then went on you will gather all the metal together and have your men convey it far into the desert to the southward to a spot to which i shall direct you watching intently doc decided the ignorant white beasts would comply with this ridiculous suggestion it was merely a slick scheme mohallet had hatched for getting the metal transported much of the distance down to the sea coast first mohallet continued you must capture the bronze man and slay him unnoticed doc savage walked slowly to the single guard at the door of the chamber which held the prisoners with a single terrific fist blow be felled the sentry chapter xxii camel boats a surge of one mighty shoulder sent the metal door open monk renny cmon you men doc rapped he added the same command couched in the dialect of the phantom city dwellers men surged from the door bigfisted renny firstthe others crowding his heels after them came the other prisoners of these women and children outnumbered the men the door by which the amphitheater had been entered was only a few yards distant docs sudden course of action was not as reckless as it seemed if every one could get through that door they stood a chance of escaping the phantom city moreover doc was convinced that mohallet would persuade the white beasts to start slaying their captives immediately shrieking in dismay mohallets men and their unlovely allies raced to intercept the flight some of mohallets followers waved guns the tiny rapidfirers which were docs own invention had the swarthy killers known how to handle the weapons the fight would have ended disastrously in split seconds but the little guns had a pronounced recoil it took some practice to be able to hold them on any kind of a target and get good results the pistollike machine guns jumped about uncontrollably when they were put in action they fought the brown men like angry moaning animals leaping wildly the bullet streams felled numbers of their ugly allies doc and his five men charging fiercely added to the confusion they had spent their lives on the trail of violence these six odds did not faze them monk often boasted that he would rather fight fifty men than two because they got in each others way dont let em cut you off doc warned keep to the outskirts himself doing directly the opposite of what he had cautioned against the bronze man waded into the middle of his foes a brown man with a machine gun saw he was the object of the rush and sought to flee he dropped before taking a dozen steps clubbed down by two fists that felt like steel doc seized the rapidfirer one bullet he fired at the stone amphitheater floor the way it splashed showed him it was one of the mercy slugs after that he hosed those about him liberally with the sleepinducing missiles even in the most heated combat doc never took life directly if it could be helped his kindness however did not keep him from permitting his foes to occasionally fall a victim of some death trap of their own the last of the phantom city dwellers were through the door all right out we go doc savage called he waited until his five friends had preceded him outside then slammed the door there was a bar of the same heavy soft metal which composed the panel he shot the bar home the metal felt cool under his hands in reaching the eastern wall of the phantom city they had only two encounters with their foes both were minor quickly ended by docs accurate use of the rapidfirer pistol doc still wore his purloined burnoose it was of excellent fabric torn in strips it became a rope stout enough to lower them all to within safe dropping distance of the ground working on a plan of action which he had formulated doc led the group of fugitives eastward down the stream behind them the phantom city emptied itself in pursuit renny dropped back to docs side we overheard enough talk to show us why mohallet was so anxious to get here he boomed the phantom city is lousy with platinum there must be a great mine near here mohallet wants the stuff i know doc told him mohallet found a platinum bracelet on jas wrist whos ja the girl thats her name oh oh rennys chuckle thundered so youre calling each other by first names if she has a second name she forgot to tell me doc took great pains to explain the party came to the inflated camel hides upon the stream banks the weird contraptions which served as boats there were paddles crude things of heavy wood under docs direction the skin craft were put afloat some were opened and allowed to fill partially with water these were loaded upon others which were intact thus was a supply of drinking water carried whatre we gonna do for food monk demanded there are wild camels in the desert doc explained water is the main thing camel steaks phooey monk shuddered i ate one once the only difference between it and a slab of wood was that i didnt get any splinters in my tongue if you still had habeas corpus you could eat him ham jeered what became of the pig doc queried three of our hairy friends were chasin im through the rocks the last i saw of im monk muttered then added cheerfully i dont think they caught im they embarked monk with a masterly piece of maneuvering outwitted ham who was seeking to get the pretty ja as a passenger on his inflated camel hide ja rode with monk the homely chemist however at once experienced great difficulty in navigating the unwieldy craft he did nothing but go in circles until ja took a paddle and demonstrated the method used in keeping the tricky raft on a straight and narrow course thanks to the fantastically rough nature of the ground along the stream they kept ahead of their pursuers reaching the lake doc set a course toward the mouth of the underground river we cant get out that way monk called pessimistically the cavern is probably entirely full of water by now dont it stand to reason that is the point nearest the coast doc savage countered they had covered two or three miles when other airfilled camelhide rafts appeared on the briny surface behind them the white beasts it seemed themselves possessed a supply of these ungainly vessels the pursuers did not gain neither did they fall behind time dragged paddling the clumsy rafts was a nerveshattering task there was nothing mechanical about it each stroke of the paddles had to be different or the hides would spin like drunken tops doc dropping back alongside monks raft carried on a conversation with ja how did your people get to this region in the first place he asked no one knows that for sure she replied there is only a legend handed down from my ancestors what is the legend it is that countless sinin ago the river did not flow underground but through the mountains to the sea my ancestors came up this river and built the phantom city carving it from solid rock since that was almost as easy as quarrying stone they dwelt here mining the white metal until a day when the river suddenly began to flow underground after that none could reach the sea because of the savages who inhabited the mountains and desert this sounded reasonable enough more than once colonies established in ancient days had been lost completely to the parent nation through the encroachment of surrounding savage races for monks benefit doc was translating jas conversation they were here to mine the platinum monk muttered say doc how are we gonna get our share of that platinum youd better concentrate on how were going to get out of here alive doc advised him anyway it belongs to these people he waved an arm at the phantom city dwellers on the rafts ahead of them if you wish it they will be glad to give it all to you as a reward for saving them from the white beasts ja offered as doc translated monk grinned widely at this doc showed no expression a fact which plainly disappointed the ravishingly pretty whitehaired girl the night dragged on interminably the strangetasting water was rationed carefully from the camelskin sacks men took turns at using the clumsy paddles why do we not cross the marshes and take to the mountains ja wanted to know our friends behind would be certain to overhaul us doc savage pointed out to her doc gazed frequently at the shore the moonlight and the fact that he was viewing the terrain from the great expanse of brine made it look different but during the day he had fixed certain landmarks in his mind dawn was not far off when he directed their little flotilla inshore johnny bony arms wielding a paddle with seemingly tirelessness perceived their position the submarine sank right ahead of us he ejaculated with an uncanny precision that came of combined keen memory and excellent observation powers doc stopped over the sunken helldiver without a word he slipped off the camelskin raft and stroked into the brine the sub lay at a depth of slightly more than thirty feet the main hatch leading to the control room was open a shadowstuffed maw doc pulled himself within a metal cabinet held highpowered rifles they had not been disturbed he clamped three of them between his knees and churned up to the surface with them using his hands these will outrange the little rapidfirer pistols he explained to his five friends use them to keep our pursuers at a distance try to puncture their inflated camel hides renny took one of the rifles he set the telescopic sight carefully then fired a single shot not at their foes but at a distant rock this was to test the range of the bullets he then sighted deliberately at an airfilled camelskin raft next to doc renny was the most accomplished sharpshooter in the group the rifle whacked violently a volley of yells drifted from the distant enemy several were soon bobbing about on the salty marsh surface renny had punctured their ungainly conveyance four or five more shots caused the whole flotilla to come to a baffled halt machinepistol bullets came skipping across the surface but the range was too great to permit effective shooting doc savage was diving again and again to the helldiver each trip he carried a load of muchneeded supplies arms and ammunition came first then canned concentrated food which had not been harmed by the water whatre the chances of raising the sub renny asked not worth trying doc told him but there should be compressed air in the tanks we might use it the compressed air was all wasted by mohallets men in their wild efforts to keep the sub from sinking doc explained how are the batteries some have been ruined by the salt water doc told him but the greater number of the cells inclosed in waterproof containers the air vents of which close automatically to keep out water are still serviceable then if we could get her on top shed still run right but it would take powerful lifting cranes and big buoyancy tanks to get her up equipment we do not have doc made one more dive he brought up a large waterproof box renny and the others peered at the container puzzled doc had brought considerable apparatus aboard the helldiver at the start of the voyage stuff the use of which they were unfamiliar with this was one of those items doc vouchsafed no explanation he placed his box carefully on his own raft lets go he directed it was time they were getting under way mohallets men and the white beasts had fanned out in a semicircle and were seeking to surround them just out of rifle shot some had gone ashore with the idea of sharpshooting from behind sheltering rocks doc set a course for the larger and more rugged of the two islands in the canyon through which the river ran before diving into its underground channel just before reaching the chasm monk abruptly turned his raft shoreward he landed dashed into the rocks and came back with habeas corpus he paddled up with the homely pig perched on the bloated camel hide he was hangin around waitin for hams kiss monk grinned indicating the bigeared spindlelegged porker ham expressed a personal and very explicit opinion of monk his idea of humor and pigs in general ham rarely swore but he could use dictionary words and get the same effect what is he saying ja asked monk on her fingers hes telling me what a pal i am monk explained in the same fashion they reached the island without incident the sun a gory ball of heat was lifting as they landed chapter xxii the torrent under docs direction his five men stationed themselves at regular intervals around the rocky island the twoscore individuals rescued from the city carved in rock unfamiliar with firearms were virtually useless in any but handtohand combat from that moment the morning air was rent by an occasional rifle shot or the moan of a machine pistol the latter weapons in the hands of mohallets men did little damage the range was too great the canyon sides could be reached by the rifles docs men held but effective return fire could not span the distance moreover their pursuers did not dare paddle past the isle and attempt to surround them the canyon walls too steep for climbing at this point prevented their foes landing and carrying their clumsy pneumatic rafts downstream were snug as bugs in a rug monk grinned interrupting his diversion of teaching habeas corpus to shake hands until our grub and water run out long tom reminded say ill scout around and see if i cant find something to feed that pig if we can fatten him up hell do for eating nix monk growled youll eat me before you touch habeas thats a very good idea ham said nastily ham for once in his life was without his sword cane his captors had taken it its absence did not help his humor monk leering cheerfully proceeded to address the pretty ja on his fingers ham looked on carelessly at first then with sudden rage you homely missing link he screeched youre telling her that lie about me having a wife and thirteen nitwit children the pair began making fierce faces an onlooker would have thought sudden death impended for somebody attractive ja evidently thought so she settled things by promptly leaving them both she went in search of doc the bronze man carrying his mysterious box had gone off by himself ja found doc on a sector of the isle where the rock was solid he had opened the box an array of intricate apparatus was disclosed tubes batteries and coils were assembled compactly a large piece of mechanism was affixed tightly to the rock doc wore a headset the whitehaired girl gave doc a ravishing smile the response to this as far as she could see was none she covered her disappointment by looking with pretended interest at their surroundings the sun was hotter down the chasm in the direction of the undergroundriver entrance the other island reared much of it had been covered by water it was a rock hump bare of shelter or life beyond that the maw of the cavern no longer yawned it had been covered completely by the rising marsh waters ja after gazing some seconds again tried her wiles on doc once more the results were negligible doc was not unaware of the young ladys entrancing beauty or her sly purpose he was simply giving her no encouragement he downed an impulse to tell her to go talk to monk who was always appreciative of the company of a pretty girl quite disgusted ja whirled to flounce away will you make a round and tell every one to maintain absolute quiet for a short period at an interval of every ten minutes doc called after her no moving around every one is to remain absolutely quiet and no shooting the girl nodded stiffly then went on the mission she did not understand the purpose of the unusual request nor was she alone in her puzzlement the others did not understand it either the entire day passed without a happening of importance mohallet and his allies seemed to have settled for a siege they had sought to dive to the submarine to replenish their stock of weapons it was evident though that they had not been able to enter the helldiver i locked all the hatches but one from the inside doc explained then put a padlock on that one they will have difficulty breaking in working under water boulders offered some shelter from the midday heat the water was rationed as sparingly as possible night came the heavens again brilliant with stars and moon if you ask me we oughta try to do ourselves some good monk grumbled sittin around this way were playin into this guy mohallets hands if you ask me use your head renny boomed why suggest the impossible ham sneered he hasnt any whatre you drivin at monk asked renny ignoring hams jab i mean that doc must have some plan explained the bigfisted engineer but we aint got a chance of gettin out of here monk persisted im betting doc does monk grumbled i dont see how you will somebody knock the gorilla in the head so i can get some sleep ham requested monk bristled indignantly by golly you aint kissed habeas corpus yet youre gonna do it now the homely chemist seizing his pig prepared to leap upon ham and force fulfillment of their bargain quiet doc called from the distance silence instantly fell no one moved or spoke they had been observing these intervals of stillness all day none knowing the reason therefore so far nothing had come of them but this was the exception all right doc yelled loudly onto the rafts everybody make a great deal of noise we want our enemies to come close enough that we can talk with them their foes evidently saw the first inflated camelbide craft as it put off from the isle mohallet himself paddled within shouting distance he yelled in arabic if you will surrender you will be allowed to live were not surrendering docs mighty voice volleyed back were moving away from here and if you follow us it will mean your death thats a warning wallah roared mohallet lies try to flee and we will follow and kill you you follow us and itll be your finish doc repeated earnestly youre wasting your time trying to talk him out of it said johnny fiddling with his glasses im afraid so doc admitted but he was warned by now all the inflated skins were afloat doc clambred on the last one and shoved off he did not have ja for a passenger this time the young lady had dismissed as a hopeless task her efforts to snare doc she was riding with the homely but happy monk where do we go called long tom to the other island the bare one doc replied holy cow renny boomed there aint a sign of shelter there theyll pick us off put some action into those paddles doc commanded you fellows may not think youre in a hurry but you are the bare hump of rock for which they were headed was nearly half a mile distant they worked furiously to reach it as doc had directed behind a swarm of puffy skin rafts bobbed in pursuit shouting doc warned them to go back a chorus of fierce shouts was his answer mohallet and his allies thought they saw the finish of their quarry when nothing had happened by the time the bleak rock knob was reached docs men exchanged uneasy glances wondering if they had not made their position hopeless the rafts of their foes crowded in haunting the shadows banked against the sheer canyon walls they were enabled to come within range the chasm was narrower here bullets began snapping spitefully against the rocky spire leaving gray smears docs men returned the fire shooting as accurately as they could from the rocking skin boats renny rumbled this is bad if something doesnt its happening now doc rapped take a look at the water renny stood up to peer at the surface his eyes popped he smacked his huge fists together his yell romped like thunder in the confines of the chasm its moving the waters moving the river had started flowing slowly at first the water crept along then its speed increased current ripples appeared they mounted a roar starting as a dull whisper loudened to a great babble of sound the barrier at the outer end of the underground stream has just broken down ham barked not just doc corrected it gave way some time ago the movement of the water has just reached here howd you know that ham demanded the apparatus ive been using all day doc told him it is simply a powerful amplifier to pick up earth sounds it works on the principle of a seismograph utilizing sensitive microphones and audio amplifiers it picked up the rumbling as the barrier gave way and the jarring of the flood through the underground cavern ham pondered he realized now that doc had been certain the barricade would collapse their flight from the phantom city had been guided by the supposition that it would howd you figure it would give way he demanded youll recall i spent some time going over it doc reminded him the barrier obviously wasnt strong enough to hold against great pressure there were rifts through which water could pass this was eventually certain to loosen the whole mass it was a question of time we could have held out for days on the other island waiting for it talk ceased they fell to watching mohallet and their other enemies the river had become a torrent of doom mohallet and nearly all the rest were afloat on the inflated camelhide rafts the craft were too clumsy to cope with a moderate current this was no current of moderation foam covered the whole surface by now waves fought each other small riffles came into being grew into convulsing monsters that tossed a dozen feet upward swirling and roaring the flood converged on a great whirlpool which marked the maw of the cavern helpless in the abrupt rush of waters mohallet was among the first to be carried into the vortex such was the power of the sucking current that his raft was crushed drawn from view together with its rider he wont have a chance in there monk said monk did not sound gloomy he was hardened to violence and sudden death and no one had ever earned his end more thoroughly than mohallet other rafts were pulled into the spinning gullet wailing those who rode them fought the current they might as well have tried to battle niagara with a toothpick for a paddle they were swallowed in rapid succession many even before they reached the full force of the whirlpool some managed to land on the bald rocky spire which harbored doc and his companions these were glad to surrender their weapons in exchange for safety half an hour saw the chasm clean of camelskin rafts of the horde who had besieged them only a few score on shore and others who had made the isle remained alive they had met a fate these men which had a way of seizing upon those who opposed doc savage they had gone to join others who had come to an end in like fashion caught in a sudden reversal of some trap they had been closing upon the giant bronze man and those who helped him throughout most of the night the torrent moaned and rushed for a time there was no appreciable lowering of the marsh level there was a great deal of water to be drained water fed by other briny swales on higher levels by dawn the water was falling leaving a crust of brine which dried white in the hot sun by noon the river had become sluggish it would not fall much more and they could work upstream with their clumsy inflated rafts doc allowed five hours more for safetys sake then they put off paddling upstream such of their enemies as had reached the isle they left behind these could swim ashore to mingle with the other survivors the chief of the white beasts and the more fierce of the warriors had gone to their death in the cavern the power of the savages was broken they came within sight of the spot where the helldiver lay holy cow exploded renny have we got luck the brine had lowered enough so that the long steel spine of the sub was fully exposed all weve got to do is open the hatches and bail her out renny declared shell float then even if she dont itll be a simple matter to rig winches and cables and slide her into the water think we can get out through the cavern the way we came in monk asked doc not a doubt of it doc assured him from the way the water went out its almost certain the channel is cleared of obstructions monk grinned at pretty ja great well float the sub and ferry these whitehaired people out maybe theyd rather stay here doc reminded a conference followed to monks infinite disgust it developed that ja and her people elected to remain in their strange city carved from stone from what ja had seen of the outer world and the men who dwelt there mohallet for instance she did not think highly of it this is their home renny said thoughtfully they probably wouldnt be satisfied away from it arms and ammunition aplenty would be left in the phantom city it was decided and the inhabitants instructed in their use this would guarantee against any future threat by the white beasts doc was taking no part in the consultation he had dropped off one of the airfilled camel skins and was examining the helldiver the hull was intact she could be floated in a few hours made ready to take them back to civilization civilization doc smiled faintly wryly the word was not a synonym for safety or security to himself and his five men it meant simply that they would be on deck for more trouble for some call which might take them to the far corners of the earth monks voice reached doc now lets see if we cant trade these people something for a little of that good platinum youd better forget the platinum doc told him huh doc addressed the whitehaired girl using the deafanddumb dialect on his fingers that his friends might comprehend what was being said between the two of them you were wearing a bracelet when mohallet found you he signaled where did you get it from the stranger who came here years ago the man who taught us the talk of the hands the girl replied it was the case of a watch which he melted and beat into an armlet say monk ejaculated a watch a watch case well for mohallet saw the bracelet doc explained it was platinum he asked ja if there was much similar metal here and she told him there was a great deal of the shiny stuff mohallet made the natural mistake of presuming it was all platinum monk gulped and swallowed several times you mean to tell me did you look closely at the metal of those gates doc asked only close enough to see that it was shiny and soft like platinum monk admitted was it it is lead doc told him dryly the kind you make bullets out of the end
