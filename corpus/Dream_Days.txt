dream days contents the twentyfirst of october dies irae mutabile semper the magic ring its walls were as of jasper a saga of the seas the reluctant dragon a departure the twentyfirst of october in the matter of general culture and attainments we youngsters stood on pretty level ground true it was always happening that one of us would be singled out at any moment freakishly and without regard to his own preferences to wrestle with the inflections of some idiotic language long rightly dead while another from some fancied artistic tendency which always failed to justify itself might be told off without warning to hammer out scales and exercises and to bedew the senseless keys with tears of weariness or of revolt but in subjects common to either sex and held to be necessary even for him whose ambition soared no higher than to crack a whip in a circusring in geography for instance arithmetic or the weary doings of kings and queens each would have scorned to excel and indeed whatever our individual gifts a general dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept us all at much the same dead level a level of ignorance tempered by insubordination fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects of healthier tone than those already enumerated in which we were free to choose for ourselves and which we would have scorned to consider education and in these we freely followed each his own particular line often attaining an amount of special knowledge which struck our ignorant elders as simply uncanny for edward the uniforms accoutrements colours and mottoes of the regiments composing the british army had a special glamour in the matter of facings he was simply faultless among chevrons badges medals and stars he moved familiarly he even knew the names of most of the colonels in command and he would squander sunny hours prone on the lawn heedless of challenge from bird or beast poring over a tattered army list my own accomplishment was of another character took as it seemed to me a wider and a more untrammelled range dragoons might have swaggered in lincoln green riflemen might have donned sporrans over tartan trews without exciting notice or comment from me but did you seek precise information as to the fauna of the american continent then you had come to the right shop where and why the bison wallowed how beaver were to be trapped and wild turkeys stalked the grizzly and how to handle him and the pretty pressing ways of the constrictor in fine the haunts and the habits of all that burrowed strutted roared or wriggled between the atlantic and the pacific all this knowledge i took for my province by the others my equipment was fully recognized supposing a book with a bearhunt in it made its way into the house and the atmosphere was electric with excitement still it was necessary that i should first decide whether the slot had been properly described and properly followed up ere the work could be stamped with full approval a writer might have won fame throughout the civilized globe for his trappers and his realistic backwoods and all went for nothing if his pemmican were not properly compounded i damned his achievement and it was heard no more of harold was hardly old enough to possess a special subject of his own he had his instincts indeed and at birdsnesting they almost amounted to prophecy where we others only suspected eggs surmised possible eggs hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood harold went straight for the right bush bough or hole as if he carried a diviningrod but this faculty belonged to the class of mere gifts and was not to be ranked with edwards lore regarding facings and mine as to the habits of prairiedogs both gained by painful study and extensive travel in those realms of gold the army list and ballantyne selinas subject quite unaccountably happened to be naval history there is no laying down rules as to subjects you just possess them or rather they possess you and their genesis or protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down selina had never so much as seen the sea but for that matter neither had i ever set foot on the american continent the byways of which i knew so intimately and just as i if set down without warning in the middle of the rocky mountains would have been perfectly at home so selina if a genie had dropped her suddenly on portsmouth hard could have given points to most of its frequenters from the days of blake down to the death of nelson she never condescended further selina had taken spiritual part in every notable engagement of the british navy and even in the dark days when she had to pick up skirts and flee chased by an ungallant de ruyter or van tromp she was yet cheerful in the consciousness that ere long she would be gleefully hammering the fleets of the world in the glorious times to follow when that golden period arrived selina was busy indeed and while loving best to stand where the splinters were flying the thickest she was also a careful and critical student of seamanship and of maneuvre she knew the order in which the great lineofbattle ships moved into action the vessels they respectively engaged the moment when each let go its anchor and which of them had a spring on its cable while not understanding the phrase she carefully noted the fact and she habitually went into an engagement on the quarterdeck of the gallant ship that reserved its fire the longest at the time of selinas weird seizure i was unfortunately away from home on a loathsome visit to an aunt and my account is therefore feebly compounded from hearsay it was an absence i never ceased to regret scoring it up with a sense of injury against the aunt there was a splendid uselessness about the whole performance that specially appealed to my artistic sense that it should have been selina too who should break out this way selina who had just become a regular subscriber to the young ladies journal and who allowed herself to be taken out to strange teas with an air of resignation palpably assumed this was a special joy and served to remind me that much of this dreaded convention that was creeping over us might be after all only veneer edward also was absent getting licked into shape at school but to him the loss was nothing with his stern practical bent he wouldnt have seen any sense in it to recall one of his favourite expressions to harold however for whom the gods had always cherished a special tenderness it was granted not only to witness but also priestlike to feed the sacred fire itself and if at the time he paid the penalty exacted by the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the roast he must ever after one feels sure have carried inside him some of the white gladness of the acolyte who greatly privileged has been permitted to swing a censer at the sacring of the very mass october was mellowing fast and with it the year itself full of tender hints in woodland and hedgerow of a course wellnigh completed from all sides that still afternoon you caught the quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal preoccupied and possessed selina had strayed down the garden and out into the pasture beyond where on a bit of rising ground that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old coachroad on the other she had cast herself down to chew the cud of fancy there she was presently joined by harold breathless and very full of his latest grievance i asked him not to he burst out i said if hed only please wait a bit and edward would be back soon and it couldnt matter to him and the pig wouldnt mind and edwardd be pleased and everybodyd be happy but he just said he was very sorry but bacon didnt wait for nobody so i told him he was a regular beast and then i came away and and i blieve theyre doing it now yes hes a beast agreed selina absently she had forgotten all about the pigkilling harold kicked away a freshly thrownup molehill and prodded down the hole with a stick from the direction of farmer larkins demesne came a longdrawn note of sorrow a thin cry and appeals telling that the stout soul of a black berkshire pig was already faring down the stony track to hades d you know what day it is said selina presently in a low voice looking far away before her harold did not appear to know nor yet to care he had laid open his molerun for a yard or so and was still grubbing at it absorbedly its trafalgar day went on selina trancedly trafalgar day and nobody cares something in her tone told harold that he was not behaving quite becomingly he didnt exactly know in what manner still he abandoned his molehunt for a more courteous attitude of attention over there resumed selina she was gazing out in the direction of the old highroad over there the coaches used to go by uncle thomas was telling me about it the other day and the people used to watch for em coming to tell the time by and praps to get their parcels and one morning they wouldnt be expecting anything different one morning first there would be a cloud of dust as usual and then the coach would come racing by and then they would know for the coach would be dressed in laurel all laurel from stem to stern and the coachman would be wearing laurel and the guard would be wearing laurel and then they would know then they would know harold listened in respectful silence he would much rather have been hunting the mole who must have been a mile away by this time if he had his wits about him but he had all the natural instincts of a gentleman of whom it is one of the principal marks if not the complete definition never to show signs of being bored selina rose to her feet and paced the turf restlessly with a short quarterdeck walk why cant we do something she burst out presently he he did everything why cant we do anything for him who did everything inquired harold meekly it was useless wasting further longings on that mole like the dead he travelled fast why nelson of course said selina shortly still looking restlessly around for help or suggestion but hes hes dead isnt he asked harold slightly puzzled whats that got to do with it retorted his sister resuming her cagedlion promenade harold was somewhat taken aback in the case of the pig for instance whose last outcry had now passed into stillness he had considered the chapter as finally closed whatever innocent mirth the holidays might hold in store for edward that particular pig at least would not be a contributor and now he was given to understand that the situation had not materially changed he would have to revise his ideas it seemed sitting up on end he looked towards the garden for assistance in the task thence even as he gazed a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still air the gardener had been sweeping that afternoon and now an unconscious priest was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves to the calmeyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon harold was up and off in a moment forgetting nelson forgetting the pig the mole the larkin betrayal and selinas strange fever of conscience here was fire real fire to play with and that was even better than messing with water or remodelling the plastic surface of the earth of all the toys the world provides for rightminded persons the original elements rank easily the first but selina sat on where she was her chin on her fists and her fancies whirled and drifted here and there in curls and eddies along with the smoke she was watching as the quickfooted dusk of the short october day stepped lightly over the garden little red tongues of fire might be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke harold anon staggering under armfuls of leaves anon stoking vigorously was discernible only at fitful intervals it was another sort of smoke that the inner eye of selina was looking upon a smoke that hung in sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the splinterrip the shout of the boardingparty the choking sob of the gunner stretched by his gun a smoke from out of which at last she saw as through a riven pall the radiant spirit of the victor crowned with the coronal of a perfect death leap in full assurance up into the ether that immortals breathe the dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire something of the priestess in her stride something of the devotee in the set purpose of her eye the leaves were well alight by this time and harold had just added an old furze bush which flamed and crackled stirringly go n get some more sticks ordered selina and shavings n chunks of wood n anything you can find look here in the kitchengarden there s a pile of old peasticks fetch as many as you can carry and then go back and bring some more but i say began harold amazedly scarce knowing his sister and with a vision of a frenzied gardener peastickless and threatening retribution go and fetch em quick shouted selina stamping with impatience harold ran off at once true to the stern system of discipline in which he had been nurtured but his eyes were like round os and as he ran he talked fast to himself in evident disorder of mind the peasticks made a rare blaze and the fire no longer smouldering sullenly leapt up and began to assume the appearance of a genuine bonfire harold awed into silence at first began to jump round it with shouts of triumph selina looked on grimly with knitted brow she was not yet fully satisfied cant you get any more sticks she said presently go and hunt about get some old hampers and matting and things out of the toolhouse smash up that old cucumber frame edward shoved you into the day we were playing scouts and mohicans stop a bit hooray i know you come along with me hard by there was a hothouse aunt elizas special pride and joy and even grimly approved of by the gardener at one end in an outhouse adjoining the necessary firing was stored and to this sacred fuel of which we were strictly forbidden to touch a stick selina went straight harold followed obediently prepared for any crime after that of the peasticks but pinching himself to see if he were really awake you bring some coals said selina briefly without any palaver or proandcon discussion heres a basket ill manage the faggots in a very few minutes there was little doubt about its being a genuine bonfire and no paltry makeshift selina a maenad now hatless and tossing disordered locks all the dross of the young lady purged out of her stalked around the pyre of her own purloining or prodded it with a peastick and as she prodded she murmured at intervals i knew there was something we could do it isnt much but still it s something the gardener had gone home to his tea aunt eliza had driven out for hers a long way off and was not expected back till quite late and this far end of the garden was not overlooked by any windows so the tribute blazed on merrily unchecked villagers far away catching sight of the flare muttered something about them young devils at their tricks again and trudged on beerwards never a thought of what day it was never a thought for nelson who preserved their honest pintpots to be paid for in honest pence and saved them from litres and decimal coinage nearer at hand frightened rabbits popped up and vanished with a flick of white tails scared birds fluttered among the branches or sped across the glade to quieter sleepingquarters but never a bird nor a beast gave a thought to the hero to whom they owed it that each year their little homes of horsehair wool or moss were safe stablished neath the flap of the british flag and that game laws quietly permanent made la chasse a terror only to their betters no one seemed to know nor to care nor to sympathise in all the ecstasy of her burntoffering and sacrifice selina stood alone and yet not quite alone for as the fire was roaring at its best certain stars stepped delicately forth on the surface of the immensity above and peered down doubtfully with wonder at first then with interest then with recognition with a start of glad surprise they at least knew all about it they understood among them the name was a daily familiar word his story was a part of the music to which they swung himself was their fellow and their mate and comrade so they peeped and winked and peeped again and called to their laggard brothers to come quick and see the best of life is but intoxication and selina who during her brief inebriation had lived in an ecstasy as golden as our drab existence affords had to experience the inevitable bitterness of awakening sobriety when the dying down of the flames into sullen embers coincided with the frenzied entrance of aunt eliza on the scene it was not so much that she was at once and forever disrated broke sent before the mast and branded as one on whom no reliance could be placed even with edward safe at school and myself under the distant vigilance of an aunt that her pocket money was stopped indefinitely and her new church service the pride of her last birthday removed from her own custody and placed under the control of a trust she sorrowed rather because she had dragged poor harold against his better judgment into a most horrible scrape and moreover because when the reaction had fairly set in when the exaltation had fizzled away and the younglady portion of her had crept timorously back to its wonted lodging she could only see herself as a plain fool unjustified undeniable without a shadow of an excuse or explanation as for harold youth and a short memory made his case less pitiful than it seemed to his more sensitive sister true he started upstairs to his lonely cot bellowing dismally before him a dreary future of pains and penalties sufficient to last to the crack of doom outside his door however he tumbled over augustus the cat and made capture of him and at once his mourning was changed into a song of triumph as he conveyed his prize into port for augustus who detested above all things going to bed with little boys was ever more knave than fool and the trapper who was wily enough to ensnare him had achieved something notable augustus when he realized that his fate was sealed and his nights lodging settled wisely made the best of things and listened with a languorous air of complete comprehension to the incoherent babble concerning pigs and heroes moles and bonfires which served harold for a selfsung lullaby yet it may be doubted whether augustus was one of those rare fellows who thoroughly understood but selina knew no more of this source of consolation than of the sympathy with which the stars were winking above her and it was only after some sad interval of time and on a very moist pillow that she drifted into that quaint inconsequent country where you may meet your own pet hero strolling down the road and commit what hairbrained oddities you like and everybody understands and appreciates dies irae those memorable days that move in procession their heads just out of the mist of years long dead the most of them are fulleyed as the dandelion that from dawn to shade has steeped itself in sunlight here and there in their ranks however moves a forlorn one who is blind blind in the sense of the dulled windowpane on which the pelting raindrops have mingled and run down obscuring sunshine and the circling birds happy fields and storied garden blind with the spatter of a misery uncomprehended unanalysed only felt as something corporeal in its buffeting effects martha began it and yet martha was not really to blame indeed that was half the trouble of it no solid person stood full in view to be blamed and to make atonement there was only a wretched impalpable condition to deal with breakfast was just over the sun was summoning us imperious as a herald with clamour of trumpet i ran upstairs to her with a broken bootlace in my hand and there she was crying in a corner her head in her apron nothing could be got from her but the same dismal succession of sobs that would not have done that struck and hurt like a physical beating and meanwhile the sun was getting impatient and i wanted my bootlace inquiry below stairs revealed the cause marthas brother was dead it seemed her sailor brother billy drowned in one of those strange faroff seas it was our dream to navigate one day we had known billy well and appreciated him when an approaching visit of billy to his sister had been announced we had counted the days to it when his cheery voice was at last heard in the kitchen and we had descended with shouts first of all he had to exhibit his tattooed arms always a subject for fresh delight and envy and awe then he was called upon for tricks jugglings and strange fearful gymnastics and lastly came yarns and more yarns and yarns till bedtime there had never been any one like billy in his own particular sphere and now he was drowned they said and martha was miserable and and i couldnt get a new bootlace they told me that billy would never come back any more and i stared out of the window at the sun which came back right enough every day and their news conveyed nothing whatever to me marthas sorrow hit home a little but only because the actual sight and sound of it gave me a dull bad sort of pain low down inside a pain not to be actually located moreover i was still wanting my bootlace this was a poor sort of a beginning to a day that so far as outside conditions went had promised so well i rigged up a sort of jurymast of a bootlace with a bit of old string and wandered off to look up the girls conscious of a jar and a discordance in the scheme of things the moment i entered the schoolroom something in the air seemed to tell me that here too matters were strained and awry selina was staring listlessly out of the window one foot curled round her leg when i spoke to her she jerked a shoulder testily but did not condescend to the civility of a reply charlotte absolutely unoccupied sprawled in a chair and there were signs of sniffles about her even at that early hour it was but a trifling matter that had caused all this electricity in the atmosphere and the girls manner of taking it seemed to me most unreasonable within the last few days the time had come round for the despatch of a hamper to edward at school only one hamper a term was permitted him so its preparation was a sort of blend of revelry and religious ceremony after the main corpus of the thing had been carefully selected and safely bestowed the pots of jam the cake the sausages and the apples that filled up corners so nicely after the last package had been wedged in the girls had deposited their own private and personal offerings on the top i forget their precise nature anyhow they were nothing of any particular practical use to a boy but they had involved some contrivance and labour some skimping of pocket money and much delightful cloudbuilding as to the effect on their enraptured recipient well yesterday there had come a terse acknowledgment from edward heartily commending the cakes and the jam stamping the sausages with the seal of smith majors approval and finally hinting that fortified as he now was nothing more was necessary but a remittance of five shillings in postage stamps to enable him to face the world armed against every buffet of fate that was all never a word or a hint of the personal tributes or of his appreciation of them to us to harold and me that is the letter seemed natural and sensible enough after all provender was the main thing and five shillings stood for a complete equipment against the most unexpected turns of luck the presents were very well in their way very nice and so on but life was a serious matter and the contest called for cakes and halfcrowns to carry it on not gewgaws and knitted mittens and the like the girls however in their obstinate way persisted in taking their own view of the slight hence it was that i received my second rebuff of the morning somewhat disheartened i made my way downstairs and out into the sunlight where i found harold playing conspirators by himself on the gravel he had dug a small hole in the walk and had laid an imaginary train of powder thereto and as he sought refuge in the laurels from the inevitable explosion i heard him murmur my god said the czar my plans are frustrated it seemed an excellent occasion for being a black puma harold liked black pumas on the whole as well as any animal we were familiar with so i launched myself on him with the appropriate howl rolling him over on the gravel life may be said to be composed of things that come off and things that dont come off this thing unfortunately was one of the things that didnt come off from beneath me i heard a shrill cry of oh its my sore knee and harold wriggled himself free from the pumas clutches bellowing dismally now i honestly didnt know he had a sore knee and whats more he knew i didnt know he had a sore knee according to boyethics therefore his attitude was wrong sore knee or not and no apology was due from me i made halfway advances however suggesting we should lie in ambush by the edge of the pond and cut off the ducks as they waddled down in simple unsuspecting single file then hunt them as bisons flying scattered over the vast prairie a fascinating pursuit this and strictly illicit but harold would none of my overtures and retreated to the house wailing with full lungs things were getting simply infernal i struck out blindly for the open country and even as i made for the gate a shrill voice from a window bade me keep off the flowerbeds when the gate had swung to behind me with a vicious click i felt better and after ten minutes along the road it began to grow on me that some radical change was needed that i was in a blind alley and that this intolerable state of things must somehow cease all that i could do i had already done as wellmeaning a fellow as ever stepped was pounding along the road that day with an exceeding sore heart one who only wished to live and let live in touch with his fellows and appreciating what joys life had to offer what was wanted now was a complete change of environment somewhere in the world i felt sure justice and sympathy still resided there were places called pampas for instance that sounded well league upon league of grass with just an occasional wild horse and not a relation within the horizon to a bruised spirit this seemed a sane and a healing sort of existence there were other pleasant corners again where you dived for pearls and stabbed sharks in the stomach with your big knife no relations would be likely to come interfering with you when thus blissfully occupied and yet i did not wish just yet to have done with relations entirely they should be made to feel their position first to see themselves as they really were and to wish when it was too late that they had behaved more properly of all professions the army seemed to lend itself the most thoroughly to the scheme you enlisted you followed the drum you marched fought and ported arms under strange skies through unrecorded years at last at long last your opportunity would come when the horrors of war were flickering through the quiet countryside where you were cradled and bred but where the memory of you had long been dim folk would run together clamorous palsied with fear and among the terror stricken groups would figure certain aunts what hope is left us they would ask themselves save in the clemency of the general the mysterious invincible general of whom men tell such romantic tales and the army would march in and the guns would rattle and leap along the village street and last of all you you the general the fabled hero you would enter on your coalblack charger your pale set face seamed by an interesting sabrecut and then but every boy has rehearsed this familiar piece a score of times you are magnanimous in fine that goes without saying you have a coalblack horse and a sabrecut and you can afford to be very magnanimous but all the same you give them a good talkingto this pleasant conceit simply ravished my soul for some twenty minutes and then the old sense of injury began to well up afresh and to call for new plasters and soothing syrups this time i took refuge in happy thoughts of the sea the sea was my real sphere after all on the sea in especial you could combine distinction with lawlessness whereas the army seemed to be always weighted by a certain plodding submission to discipline to be sure by all accounts the life was at first a rough one but just then i wanted to suffer keenly i wanted to be a poor devil of a cabin boy kicked beaten and sworn at for a time perhaps some hint some inkling of my sufferings might reach their ears in due course the sloop or felucca would turn up it always did the rakishlooking craft black of hull low in the water and bristling with guns the jolly roger flapping overhead and myself for sole commander by and by as usually happened an east indiaman would come sailing along full of relations not a necessary relation would be missing and the crew should walk the plank and the captain should dance from his own yardarm and then i would take the passengers in hand that miserable group of wellknown figures cowering on the quarterdeck and then and then the same old performance the air thick with magnanimity in all the repertory of heroes none is more truly magnanimous than your pirate chief when at last i brought myself back from the future to the actual present i found that these delectable visions had helped me over a longer stretch of road than i had imagined and i looked around and took my bearings to the right of me was a long low building of grey stone new and yet not smugly so new and yet possessing distinction marked with a character that did not depend on lichen or on crumbling semieffacement of moulding and mullion strangers might have been puzzled to classify it to me an explorer from earliest years the place was familiar enough most folk called it the settlement others with quite sufficient conciseness for our neighbourhood spoke of them there fellows up by hallidays others again with a hint of derision named them the monks this last title i supposed to be intended for satire and knew to be fatuously wrong i was thoroughly acquainted with monks in books and well knew the cut of their long frocks their shaven polls and their fascinating big dogs with brandybottles round their necks incessantly hauling happy travellers out of the snow the only dog at the settlement was an irish terrier and the good fellows who owned him and were owned by him in common wore clothes of the most nondescript order and mostly cultivated sidewhiskers i had wandered up there one day searching as usual for something i never found and had been taken in by them and treated as friend and comrade they had made me free of their ideal little rooms full of books and pictures and clean of the antimacassar taint they had shown me their chapel high hushed and faintly scented beautiful with a strange new beauty born both of what it had and what it had not that too familiar dowdiness of common places of worship they had also fed me in their dininghall where a long table stood on trestles plain to view and all the woodwork was natural unpainted healthily scrubbed and redolent of the forest it came from i brought away from that visit and kept by me for many days a sense of cleanness of the freshness that pricks the senses the freshness of cool spring water and the large swept spaces of the rooms the red tiles and the oaken settles suggested a comfort that had no connection with padded upholstery on this particular morning i was in much too unsociable a mind for paying friendly calls still something in the aspect of the place harmonized with my humour and i worked my way round to the back where the ground after affording level enough for a kitchengarden broke steeply away both the word gothic and the thing itself were still unknown to me yet doubtless the architecture of the place consistent throughout accounted for its sense of comradeship in my hour of disheartenment as i mused there with the low grey purposefullooking building before me and thought of my pleasant friends within and what good times they always seemed to be having and how they larked with the irish terrier whose footing was one of a perfect equality i thought of a certain look in their faces as if they had a common purpose and a business and were acting under orders thoroughly recognized and understood i remembered too something that martha had told me about these same fellows doing a power o good and other hints i had collected vaguely of renouncements rules selfdenials and the like thereupon out of the depths of my morbid soul swam up a new and fascinating idea and at once the career of arms seemed overacted and stale and piracy as a profession flat and unprofitable this then or something like it should be my vocation and my revenge a severer line of business perhaps such as i had read of something that included black bread and a hairshirt there should be vows too irrevocable bloodcurdling vows and an iron grating this iron grating was the most necessary feature of all for i intended that on the other side of it my relations should range themselves i mentally ran over the catalogue and saw that the whole gang was present all in their proper places a sadeyed row combined in tristful appeal we see our error now they would say we were always dull dogs slow to catch especially in those akin to us the finer qualities of soul we misunderstood you misappreciated you and we own up to it and now alas my dear friends i would strike in here waving towards them an ascetic hand one of the emaciated sort that lets the light shine through at the fingertips alas you come too late this conduct is fitting and meritorious on your part and indeed i always expected it of you sooner or later but the die is cast and you may go home again and bewail at your leisure this too tardy repentance of yours for me i am vowed and dedicated and my relations henceforth are austerity and holy works once a month should you wish it it shall be your privilege to come and gaze at me through this very solid grating but whack a wellaimed clod of garden soil whizzing just past my ear starred on a treetrunk behind spattering me with dirt the present came back to me in a flash and i nimbly took cover behind the trees realizing that the enemy was up and abroad with ambuscades alarms and thrilling sallies it was the gardeners boy i knew well enough a red proletariat who hated me just because i was a gentleman hastily picking up a nice sticky clod in one hand with the other i delicately projected my hat beyond the shelter of the treetrunk i had not fought with redskins all these years for nothing as i had expected another clod of the first class for size and stickiness took my poor hat full in the centre then ajaxlike shouting terribly i issued from shelter and discharged my ammunition woe then for the gardeners boy who unprepared skipping in premature triumph took the clod full in his stomach he the foolish one witless on whose side the gods were fighting that day discharged yet other missiles wavering and wide of the mark for his wind had been taken with the first clod and he shot wildly as one already desperate and in flight i got another clod in at short range we clinched on the brow of the hill and rolled down to the bottom together when he had shaken himself free and regained his legs he trotted smartly off in the direction of his mothers cottage but over his shoulder he discharged at me both imprecation and deprecation menace mixed up with an undercurrent of tears but as for me i made off smartly for the road my frame tingling my head high with never a backward look at the settlement of suggestive aspect or at my wellplanned future which lay in fragments around it life had its jollities then life was action contest victory the present was rosy once more surprises lurked on every side and i was beginning to feel villainously hungry just as i gained the road a cart came rattling by and i rushed for it caught the chain that hung below and swung thrillingly between the dizzy wheels choked and blinded with delicious smelling dust the world slipping by me like a streaky ribbon below till the driver licked at me with his whip and i had to descend to earth again abandoning the beaten track i then struck homewards through the fields not that the way was very much shorter but rather because on that route one avoided the bridge and had to splash through the stream and get refreshingly wet bridges were made for narrow folk for people with aims and vocations which compelled abandonment of many of lifes highest pleasures truly wise men called on each element alike to minister to their joy and while the touch of sunbathed air the fragrance of garden soil the ductible qualities of mud and the sparkwhirling rapture of playing with fire had each their special charm they did not overlook the bliss of getting their feet wet as i came forth on the common harold broke out of an adjoining copse and ran to meet me the morning rainclouds all blown away from his face he had made a new squirrelstick it seemed made it all himself melted the lead and everything i examined the instrument critically and pronounced it absolutely magnificent as we passed in at our gate the girls were distantly visible gardening with a zeal in cheerful contrast to their heartsick lassitude of the morning theres bin another letter come today harold explained and the hamper got joggled about on the journey and the presents worked down into the straw and all over the place one of em turned up inside the cold duck and thats why they werent found at first and edward said thanks awfully i did not see martha again until we were all reassembled at teatime when she seemed redeyed and strangely silent neither scolding nor finding fault with anything instead she was very kind and thoughtful with jams and things feverishly pressing unwonted delicacies on us who wanted little pressing enough then suddenly when i was busiest she disappeared and charlotte whispered me presently that she had heard her go to her room and lock herself in this struck me as a funny sort of proceeding mutabile semper she stood on the other side of the garden fence and regarded me gravely as i came down the road then she said hi o and i responded hullo and pulled up somewhat nervously to tell the truth the encounter was not entirely unexpected on my part the previous sunday i had seen her in church and after service it had transpired who she was this newcomer and what aunt she was staying with that morning a volunteer had been called for to take a note to the parsonage and rather to my own surprise i had found myself stepping forward with alacrity while the others had become suddenly absorbed in various pursuits or had sneaked unobtrusively out of view certainly i had not yet formed any deliberate plan of action yet i suppose i recollected that the road to the parsonage led past her aunts garden she began the conversation while i hopped backwards and forwards over the ditch feigning a careless ease saw you in church on sunday she said only you looked different then all dressed up and your hair quite smooth and brushed up at the sides and oh so shiny what do they put on it to make it shine like that dont you hate having your hair brushed she ran on without waiting for an answer how your boots squeaked when you came down the aisle when mine squeak i walk in all the puddles till they stop think ill get over the fence this she proceeded to do in a businesslike way while with my hands deep in my pockets i regarded her movements with silent interest as those of some strange new animal ive been gardening she explained when she had joined me but i didnt like it theres so many worms about today i hate worms wish theyd keep out of the way when im digging oh i like worms when im digging i replied heartily seem to make things more lively dont they she reflected shouldnt mind em so much if they were warm and dry she said but here she shivered and somehow i liked her for it though if it had been my own flesh and blood hoots of derision would have instantly assailed her from worms we passed naturally enough to frogs and thence to pigs aunts gardeners rockinghorses and other fellowcitizens of our common kingdom in five minutes we had each others confidences and i seemed to have known her for a lifetime somehow on the subject of ones self it was easier to be frank and communicative with her than with ones female kin it must be i supposed because she was less familiar with ones faulty tattered past i was watching you as you came along the road she said presently and you had your head down and your hands in your pockets and you werent throwing stones at anything or whistling or jumping over things and i thought perhaps youd bin scolded or got a stomachache no i answered shyly it wasnt that fact is i was i often but its a secret there i made an error in tactics that enkindling word set her dancing round me half beseeching half imperious oh do tell it me she cried you must iii never tell anyone else at all i vow and declare i wont her small frame wriggled with emotion and with imploring eyes she jigged impatiently just in front of me her hair was tumbled bewitchingly on her shoulders and even the loss of a front tooth a loss incidental to her age seemed but to add a piquancy to her face you wont care to hear about it i said wavering besides i cant explain exactly i think i wont tell you but all the time i knew i should have to but i do care she wailed plaintively i didnt think youd be so unkind this would never do that little downward tug at either corner of the mouth i knew the symptom only too well it s like this i began stammeringly this bit of road here up as far as that corner you know it s a horrid dull bit of road im always having to go up and down it and i know it so well and im so sick of it so whenever i get to that corner i just well i go right off to another place what sort of a place she asked looking round her gravely of course its just a place i imagine i went on hurriedly and rather shamefacedly but its an awfully nice place the nicest place you ever saw and i always go off there in church or during joggraphy lessons im sure its not nicer than my home she cried patriotically oh you ought to see my home it s lovely weve got yes it is ever so much nicer i interrupted i mean i went on apologetically of course i know your homes beautiful and all that but this must be nicer cos if you want anything at all youve only got to want it and you can have it that sounds jolly she murmured tell me more about it please tell me how you get there first i dont quite know exactly replied i just go but generally it begins by well youre going up a broad clear river in a sort of a boat youre not rowing or anything youre just moving along and theres beautiful grass meadows on both sides and the rivers very full quite up to the level of the grass and you glide along by the edge and the people are haymaking there and playing games and walking about and they shout to you and you shout back to them and they bring you things to eat out of their baskets and let you drink out of their bottles and some of em are the nice people you read about in books and so at last you come to the palace steps great broad marble steps reaching right down to the water and there at the steps you find every sort of boat you can imagine schooners and punts and rowboats and little menofwar and you have any sort of boating you want to rowing or sailing or shoving about in a punt id go sailing she said decidedly and i d steer no youd have to steer and id sit about on the deck no i wouldnt though id row at least id make you row and id steer and then wed oh no ill tell you what we do wed just sit in a punt and dabble of course well do just what you like i said hospitably but already i was beginning to feel my liberty of action somewhat curtailed by this exigent visitor i had so rashly admitted into my sanctum i dont think wed boat at all she finally decided its always so wobbly where do you come to next you go up the steps i continued and in at the door and the very first place you come to is the chocolateroom she brightened up at this and i heard her murmur with gusto chocolateroom its got every sort of chocolate you can think of i went on soft chocolate with sticky stuff inside white and pink what girls like and hard shiny chocolate that cracks when you bite it and takes such a nice long time to suck i like the soft stuff best she said cos you can eat such a lot more of it this was to me a new aspect of the chocolate question and i regarded her with interest and some respect with us chocolate was none too common a thing and whenever we happened to come by any we resorted to the quaintest devices in order to make it last out still legends had reached us of children who actually had from time to time as much chocolate as they could possibly eat and here apparently was one of them you can have all the creams i said magnanimously and ill eat the hard sticks cos i like em best oh but you mustnt she cried impetuously you must eat the same as i do it isnt nice to want to eat different ill tell you what you must give me all the chocolate and then ill give you ill give you what you ought to have oh all right i said in a subdued sort of way it seemed a little hard to be put under a sentimental restriction like this in one s own chocolateroom in the next room you come to i proceeded theres fizzy drinks theres a marbleslab business all round the room and little silver taps and you just turn the right tap and have any kind of fizzy drink you want what fizzy drinks are there she inquired oh all sorts i answered hastily hurrying on she might restrict my eatables but id be hanged if i was going to have her meddle with my drinks then you go down the corridor and at the back of the palace theres a great big park the finest park you ever saw and theres ponies to ride on and carriages and carts and a little railway all complete engine and guards van and all and you work it yourself and you can go first class or in the van or on the engine just whichever you choose id go on the engine she murmured dreamily no i wouldnt id then there s all the soldiers i struck in really the line had to be drawn somewhere and i could not have my railway system disorganized and turned upside down by a mere girl theres any quantity of em fine big soldiers and they all belong to me and a row of brass cannons all along the terrace and every now and then i give the order and they fire off all the guns no they dont she interrupted hastily i wont have em fire off any guns you must tell em not to i hate guns and as soon as they begin firing i shall run right away but but that s what theyre there for i protested aghast i dont care she insisted they mustnt do it they can walk about behind me if they like and talk to me and carry things but they mustnt fire off any guns i was sadly conscious by this time that in this brave palace of mine wherein i was wont to swagger daily irresponsible and unquestioned i was rapidly becoming so to speak a mere lodger the idea of my fine big soldiers being told off to carry things i was not inclined to tell her any more though there still remained plenty more to tell any other boys there she asked presently in a casual sort of way oh yes i unguardedly replied nice chaps too well have great then i recollected myself well play with them of course i went on but you are going to be my friend arent you and youll come in my boat and well travel in the guards van together and ill stop the soldiers firing off their guns but she looked mischievously away and do what i would i could not get her to promise just then the striking of the village clock awoke within me another clamorous timepiece reminding me of midday mutton a good halfmile away and of penalties and curtailments attaching to a late appearance we took a hurried farewell of each other and before we parted i got from her an admission that she might be gardening again that afternoon if only the worms would be less aggressive and give her a chance remember i said as i turned to go you mustnt tell anybody about what ive been telling you she appeared to hesitate swinging one leg to and fro while she regarded me sideways with halfshut eyes its a dead secret i said artfully a secret between us two and nobody knows it except ourselves then she promised nodding violently bigeyed her mouth pursed up small the delight of revelation and the bliss of possessing a secret run each other very close but the latter generally wins for a time i had passed the mutton stage and was weltering in warm rice pudding before i found leisure to pause and take in things generally and then a glance in the direction of the window told me to my dismay that it was raining hard this was annoying in every way for even if it cleared up later the worms i knew well from experience would be offensively numerous and frisky sulkily i said grace and accompanied the others upstairs to the schoolroom where i got out my paintbox and resolved to devote myself seriously to art which of late i had much neglected harold got hold of a sheet of paper and a pencil retired to a table in the corner squared his elbows and protruded his tongue literature had always been his form of artistic expression selina had a fit of the fidgets bred of the unpromising weather and instead of settling down to something on her own account must needs walk round and annoy us artists intent on embodying our conceptions of the ideal she had been looking over my shoulder some minutes before i knew of it or i would have had a word or two to say upon the subject i suppose you call that thing a ship she remarked contemptuously who ever heard of a pink ship hoohoo i stifled my wrath knowing that in order to score properly it was necessary to keep a cool head there is a pink ship i observed with forced calmness lying in the toyshop window now you can go and look at it if you like d you suppose you know more about ships than the fellows who make em selina baffled for the moment returned to the charge presently those are funny things too she observed spose they re meant to be trees but theyre blue they are trees i replied with severity and they are blue theyve got to be blue cos you stole my gamboge last week so i cant mix up any green didnt steal your gamboge declared selina haughtily edging away however in the direction of harold and i wouldnt tell lies either if i was you about a dirty little bit of gainboge i preserved a discreet silence after all i knew she knew she stole my gainboge the moment harold became conscious of selinas stealthy approach he dropped his pencil and flung himself flat upon the table protecting thus his literary efforts from chilling criticism by the interposed thickness of his person from some where in his interior proceeded a heartrending compound of squeal and whistle as of escaping steam longdrawn ear piercing unvarying in note i only just wanted to see protested selina struggling to uproot his small body from the scrawl it guarded but harold clung limpetlike to the table edge and his shrill protest continued to deafen humanity and to threaten even the serenities of olympus the time seemed come for a demonstration in force personally i cared little what souloutpourings of harold were priated by selina she was pretty sure to get hold of them sooner or later and indeed i rather welcomed the diversion as favourable to the undisturbed pursuit of art but the clannishness of sex has its unwritten laws boys as such are sufficiently put upon maltreated trodden under as it is should they fail to hang together in perilous times what disasters what ignominies may not be looked for possibly even an extinction of the tribe i dropped my paint brush and sailed shouting into the fray the result for a short space hung dubious there is a period of life when the difference of a year or two in age far outweighs the minor advantage of sex then the gathers of selinas frock came away with a sound like the rattle of distant musketry and this calamity it was rather than mere brute compulsion that quelled her indomitable spirit the female tongue is mightier than the sword as i soon had good reason to know when selina her riven garment held out at length avenged her discomfiture with the greekfire of personalities and abuse every black incident in my short but not stainless career every error every folly every penalty ignobly suffered were paraded before me as in a magiclantern show the information however was not particularly new to me and the effect was staled by previous rehearsals besides a victory remains a victory whatever the moral character of the triumphant general harold chuckled and crowed as he dropped from the table revealing the document over which so many gathers had sighed their short lives out you can read it if you like he said to me gratefully its only a deathletter it had never been possible to say what harolds particular amusement of the hour might turn out to be one thing only was certain that it would be something improbable unguessable not to be foretold who for instance in search of relaxation would ever dream of choosing the drawingup of a testamentary disposition of property yet this was the form taken by harolds latest craze and in justice this much had to be said for him that in the christening of his amusement he had gone right to the heart of the matter the words will and testament have various meanings and uses but about the signification of death letter there can be no manner of doubt i smoothed out the crumpled paper and read in actual form it deviated considerably from that usually adopted by family solicitors of standing the only resemblance indeed lying in the absence of punctuation my dear edward it ran when i die i leave all my muny to you my walkin sticks wips my crop my sord and gun bricks forts and all things i have goodbye my dear charlotte when die i leave you my wach and cumpus and pencel case my salors and camperdown my picteres and evthing goodbye your loving brother armen my dear martha i love you very much i leave you my garden my mice and rabets my plants in pots when i die please take care of them my dear catera desunt why you re not leaving me anything exclaimed selina indignantly youre a regular mean little boy and ill take back the last birthday present i gave you i dont care said harold repossessing himself of the document i was going to leave you something but i shant now cos you tried to read my deathletter before i was dead then iii write a deathletter myself retorted selina scenting an artistic vengeance and i shant leave you a single thing and she went off in search of a pencil the tempest withindoors had kept my attention off the condition of things without but now a glance through the window told me that the rain had entirely ceased and that everything was bathed instead in a radiant glow of sunlight more golden than any gamboge of mine could possibly depict leaving selina and harold to settle their feud by a mutual disinheritance i slipped from the room and escaped into the open air eager to pick up the loose end of my new friendship just where i had dropped it that morning in the glorious reaction of the sunshine after the downpour with its moist warm smells bespanglement of greenery and inspiriting touch of rainwashed air the parks and palaces of the imagination glowed with a livelier iris and their blurred beauties shone out again with fresh blush and palpitation as i sped along to the tryst again i accompanied my new comrade along the corridors of my pet palace into which i had so hastily introduced her and on reflection i began to see that it wouldnt work properly i had made a mistake and those were not the surroundings in which she was most fitted to shine however it really did not matter much i had other palaces to place at her disposal plenty of em and on a further acquaintance with and knowledge of her tastes no doubt i could find something to suit her there was a real arabian one for instance which i visited but rarely only just when i was in the fine oriental mood for it a wonder of silk hangings fountains of rosewater pavilions and minarets hundreds of silent welltrained slaves thronged the stairs and alleys of this establishment ready to fetch and carry for her all day if she wished it and my brave soldiers would be spared the indignity also there were processions through the bazaar at odd moments processions with camels elephants and palanquins yes she was more suited for the east this imperious young person and i determined that thither she should be personally conducted as soon as ever might be i reached the fence and climbed up two bars of it and leaning over i looked this way and that for my twinsouled partner of the morning it was not long before i caught sight of her only a short distance away her back was towards me and well one can never foresee exactly how one will find things she was talking to a boy of course there are boys and boys and lord knows i was never narrow but this was the parsons son from an adjoining village a redheaded boy and as common a little beast as ever stepped he cultivated ferrets his only good point and it was evidently through the medium of this art that he was basely supplanting me for her head was bent absorbedly over something he carried in his hands with some trepidation i called outhi but answer there was none then again i called hi but this time with a sickening sense of failure and of doom she replied only by a complex gesture decisive in import if not easily described a petulant toss of the head a jerk of the left shoulder and a backward kick of the left foot all delivered at once that was all and that was enough the redheaded boy never even condescended to glance my way why indeed should he i dropped from the fence without another effort and took my way homewards along the weary road little inclination was left to me at first for any solitary visit to my accustomed palace the pleasures of which i had so recently tasted in company and yet after a minute or two i found myself from habit sneaking off there much as usual presently i became aware of a certain solace and consolation in my newly recovered independence of action quit of all female whims and fanciful restrictions i rowed sailed or punted just as i pleased in the chocolateroom i cracked and nibbled the hard sticks with a certain contempt for those who preferred the soft veneered article and i mixed and quaffed countless fizzy drinks without dread of any prohibitionist finally i swaggered into the park paraded all my soldiers on the terrace and bidding them take the time from me gave the order to fire off all the guns the magic ring grownup people really ought to be more careful among themselves it may seem but a small thing to give their word and take back their word for them there are so many compensations life lies at their feet a partycoloured indiarubber ball they may kick it this way or kick it that it turns up blue yellow or green but always coloured and glistenning thus one sees it happen almost every day and with a jest and a laugh the thing is over and the disappointed one turns to fresh pleasure lying ready to his hand but with those who are below them whose little globe is swayed by them who rush to build starpointing alhambras on their most casual word they really ought to be more careful in this case of the circus for instance it was not as if we had led up to the subject it was they who began it entirely prompted thereto by the local newspaper what a circus said they in their irritating casual way that would be nice to take the children to wednesday would be a good day suppose we go on wednesday oh and pleats are being worn again with rows of deep braid etc what the others thought i know not what they said if they said anything i did not comprehend for me the house was bursting walls seemed to cramp and to stifle the roof was jumping and lifting escape was the imperative thing to escape into the open air to shake off bricks and mortar and to wander in the unfrequented places of the earth the more properly to take in the passion and the promise of the giddy situation nature seemed prim and staid that day and the globe gave no hint that it was flying round a circus ring of its own could they really be true i wondered all those bewildering things i had heard tell of circuses did longtailed ponies really walk on their hindlegs and fire off pistols was it humanly possible for clowns to perform onehalf of the bewitching drolleries recorded in history and how oh how dare i venture to believe that from off the backs of creamy arab steeds ladies of more than earthly beauty discharged themselves through paper hoops no it was not altogether possible there must have been some exaggeration still i would be content with very little i would take a low percentage a very small proportion of the circus myth would more than satisfy me but again even supposing that history were once in a way no liar could it be that i myself was really fated to look upon this thing in the flesh and to live through it to survive the rapture no it was altogether too much something was bound to happen one of us would develop measles the world would blow up with a loud explosion i must not dare i must not presume to entertain the smallest hope i must endeavour sternly to think of something else needless to say i thought i dreamed of nothing else day or night waking i walked arminarm with a clown and cracked a portentous whip to the brave music of a band sleeping i pursued perched astride of a coalblack horse a princess all gauze and spangles who always managed to keep just one unattainable length ahead in the early morning harold and i once fully awake crossexammed each other as to the possibilities of this or that circus tradition and exhausted the lore long ere the first housemaid was stirring in this state of exaltation we slipped onward to what promised to be a day of all white days which brings me right back to my text that grownup people really ought to be more careful i had known it could never really be i had said so to myself a dozen times the vision was too sweetly ethereal for embodiment yet the pang of the disillusionment was none the less keen and sickening and the pain was as that of a corporeal wound it seemed strange and foreboding when we entered the breakfastroom not to find everybody cracking whips jumping over chairs and whooping in ecstatic rehearsal of the wild reality to come the situation became grim and pallid indeed when i caught the expressions gardenparty and my mauve tulle and realized that they both referred to that very afternoon and every minute as i sat silent and listened my heart sank lower and lower descending relentlessly like a clockweight into my boot soles throughout my agony i never dreamed of resorting to a direct question much less a reproach even during the period of joyful anticipation some fear of breaking the spell had kept me from any bald circus talk in the presence of them but harold who was built in quite another way so soon as he discerned the drift of their conversation and heard the knell of all his hopes filled the room with wail and clamour of bereavement the grinning welkin rang with circus circus shook the windowpanes the mocking walls reechoed circus circus he would have and the whole circus and nothing but the circus no compromise for him no evasions no fallacious unsecured promises to pay he had drawn his cheque on the bank of expectation and it had got to be cashed then and there else he would yell and yell himself into a fit and come out of it and yell again yelling should be his profession his art his mission his career he was qualified he was resolute and he was in no hurry to retire from the business the noisy ones of the world if they do not always shout themselves into the imperial purple are sure at least of receiving attention if they cannot sell everything at their own price one thing silence must at any cost be purchased of them harold accordingly had to be consoled by the employment of every specious fallacy and baseborn trick known to those whose doom it is to handle children for me their hollow cajolery had no interest i could pluck no consolation out of their bankrupt though prodigal pledges i only waited till that hateful well known some other time dear told me that hope was finally dead then i left the room without any remark it made it worse if anything could to hear that stale wornout old phrase still supposed by those dullards to have some efficacy to nature as usual i drifted by instinct and there out of the track of humanity under a friendly hedgerow had my black hour unseen the world was a globe no longer space was no more filled with whirling circuses of spheres that day the old beliefs rose up and asserted themselves and the earth was flat again ditchriddled stagnant and deadly flat the undeviating roads crawled straight and white elms dressed themselves stiffly along inflexible hedges all nature centrifugal no longer sprawled flatly in lines out to its farthest edge and i felt just like walking out to that terminus and dropping quietly off then as i sat there morosely chewing bits of stick the recollection came back to me of certain fascinating advertisements i had spelled out in the papers advertisements of great and happy men owning big ships of tonnage running into four figures who yet craved to the extent of public supplication for the sympathetic cooperation of youths as apprentices i did not rightly know what apprentices might be nor whether i was yet big enough to be styled a youth but one thing seemed clear that by some such means as this whatever the intervening hardships i could eventually visit all the circuses of the world the circuses of merry france and gaudy spain of holland and bohemia of china and peru here was a plan worth thinking out in all its bearings for something had presently to be done to end this intolerable state of things midday and even feedingtime passed by gloomily enough till a small disturbance occurred which had the effect of releasing some of the electricity with which the air was charged harold it should be explained was of a very different mental mould and never brooded moped nor ate his heart out over any disappointment one wild outburst one dissolution of a minute into his original elements of air and water of tears and outcry so much insulted nature claimed then he would pull himself together iron out his countenance with a smile and adjust himself to the new condition of things if the gods are ever grateful to man for anything it is when he is so good as to display a short memory the olympians were never slow to recognize this quality of harolds in which indeed their salvation lay and on this occasion their gratitude had taken the practical form of a fine fat orange toughrinded as oranges of those days were wont to be this he had eviscerated in the good oldfashioned manner by biting out a hole in the shoulder inserting a lump of sugar therein and then working it cannily till the whole soul and body of the orange passed glorified through the sugar into his being thereupon filled full of orangejuice and iniquity he conceived a deadly snare having deftly patted and squeezed the orangeskin till it resumed its original shape he filled it up with water inserted a fresh lump of sugar in the orifice and issuing forth blandly proffered it to me as i sat moodily in the doorway dreaming of strange wild circuses under tropic skies such a stale old dodge as this would hardly have taken me in at ordinary moments but harold had reckoned rightly upon the disturbing effect of illhumour and had guessed perhaps that i thirsted for comfort and consolation and would not criticize too closely the source from which they came unthinkingly i grasped the golden fraud which collapsed at my touch and squirted its contents into my eyes and over my collar till the nethermost parts of me were damp with the water that had run down my neck in an instant i had harold down and with all the energy of which i was capable devoted myself to grinding his head into the gravel while he realizing that the closure was applied and that the time for discussion or argument was past sternly concentrated his powers on kicking me in the stomach some people can never allow events to work themselves out quietly at this juncture one of them swooped down on the scene pouring shrill misplaced abuse on both of us on me for illtreating my younger brother whereas it was distinctly i who was the injured and the deceived on him for the high offense of assault and battery on a clean collar a collar which i had myself deflowered and defaced shortly before in sheer desperate illtemper disgusted and defiant we fled in different directions rejoining each other later in the kitchengarden and as we strolled along together our short feud forgotten harold observed gloomily i should like to be a caveman like uncle george was tellin us about with a flint hatchet and no clothes and live in a cave and not know anybody and if anyone came to see us we didnt like i joined in catching on to the points of the idea wed hit him on the head with the hatchet till he dropped down dead and then said harold warming up wed drag him into the cave and skin him for a space we gloated silently over the fair scene our imaginations had conjured up it was blood we felt the need of just then we wanted no luxuries nothing dearbought nor farfetched just plain blood and nothing else and plenty of it blood however was not to be had the time was out of joint and we had been born too late so we went off to the greenhouse crawled into the heating arrangement underneath and played at the dark and dirty and unrestricted life of cavemen till we were heartily sick of it then we emerged once more into historic times and went off to the road to look for something living and sentient to throw stones at nature so often a cheerful ally sometimes sulks and refuses to play when in this mood she passes the word to her underlings and all the little people of fur and feather take the hint and slip home quietly by back streets in vain we scouted lurked crept and ambuscaded everything that usually scurried hopped or fluttered the small society of the undergrowth seemed to have engagements elsewhere the horrid thought that perhaps they had all gone off to the circus occurred to us simultaneously and we humped ourselves up on the fence and felt bad even the sound of approaching wheels failed to stir any interest in us when you are bent on throwing stones at something humanity seems obtrusive and better away then suddenly we both jumped off the fence together our faces clearing for our educated ear had told us that the approaching rattle could only proceed from a dogcart and we felt sure it must be the funny man we called him the funny man because he was sad and serious and said little but gazed right into our souls and made us tell him just what was on our minds at the time and then came out with some magnificently luminous suggestion that cleared every cloud away what was more he would then go off with us at once and pay the thing right out to its finish earnestly and devotedly putting all other things aside so we called him the funny man meaning only that he was different from those others who thought it incumbent on them to play the painful mummer the ideal as opposed to the real man was what we meant only we were not acquainted with the phrase those others with their laboured jests and clumsy contortions doubtless flattered themselves that they were funny men we who had to sit through and applaud the painful performance knew better he pulled up to a walk as soon as he caught sight of us and the dogcart crawled slowly along till it stopped just opposite then he leant his chin on his hand and regarded us long and soulfully yet said he never a word while we jigged up and down in the dust grinning bashfully but with expectation for you never knew exactly what this man might say or do you look bored he remarked presently thoroughly bored or else let me see youre not married are you he asked this in such sad earnestness that we hastened to assure him we were not married though we felt he ought to have known that much we had been intimate for some time then its only boredom he said just satiety and world weariness well if you assure me you arent married you can climb into this cart and ill take you for a drive im bored too i want to do something dark and dreadful and exciting we clambered in of course yapping with delight and treading all over his toes and as we set off harold demanded of him imperiously whither he was going my wife he replied has ordered me to go and look up the curate and bring him home to tea does that sound sufficiently exciting for you our faces fell the curate of the hour was not a success from our point of view he was not a funny man in any sense of the word but im not going to he added cheerfully then i was to stop at some cottage and ask what was it there was nettlerash mixed up in it im sure but never mind ive forgotten and it doesnt matter look here were three desperate young fellows who stick at nothing suppose we go off to the circus of certain supreme moments it is not easy to write the varying shades and currents of emotion may indeed be put into words by those specially skilled that way they often are at considerable length but the sheer crude article itself the strong live thing that leaps up inside you and swells and strangles you the dizziness of revulsion that takes the breath like cold water who shall depict this and live all i knew was that i would have died then and there cheerfully for the funny man that i longed for red indians to spring out from the hedge on the dogcart just to show what i would do and that with all this i could not find the least little word to say to him harold was less taciturn with shrill voice uplifted in solemn chant he sang the great spheral circussong and the undying glory of the ring of its timeless beginning he sang of its fashioning by cosmic forces and of its harmony with the stellar plan of horses he sang of their strength their swiftness and their docility as to tricks of clowns again of the glory of knavery and of the eternal type that shall endure lastly he sang of her the woman of the ring flawless complete untrammelled in each subtly curving limb earths highest output times noblest expression at least he doubtless sang all these things and more he certainly seemed to though all that was distinguishable was weregointothecircus and then once more weregointothecircus the sweet rhythmic phrase repeated again and again but indeed i cannot be quite sure for i heard confusedly as in a dream wings of fire sprang from the old mares shoulders we whirled on our way through purple clouds and earth and the rattle of wheels were far away below the dream and the dizziness were still in my head when i found myself scarce conscious of intermediate steps seated actually in the circus at last and took in the first sniff of that intoxicating circus smell that will stay by me while this clay endures the place was beset by a hum and a glitter and a mist suspense brooded large oer the blank mysterious arena strung up to the highest pitch of expectation we knew not from what quarter in what divine shape the first surprise would come a thud of unseen hoofs first set us aquiver then a crash of cymbals a jangle of bells a hoarse applauding roar and coralie was in the midst of us whirling past twixt earth and sky now erect flushed radiant now crouched to the flowing mane swung and tossed and moulded by the maddening dancemusic of the band the mighty whip of the count in the frockcoat marked time with pistolshots his warcry whooping clear above the music fired the blood with a passion for splendid deeds as coralie laughing exultant crashed through the paper hoops we gripped the red cloth in front of us and our souls sped round and round with coralie leaping with her prone with her swung by mane or tail with her it was not only the ravishment of her delirious feats nor her creamcoloured horse of fairy breed longtailed roefooted an enchanted prince surely if ever there was one it was her more than mortal beauty displayed too under conditions never vouchsafed to us before that held us spellbound what princess had arms so dazzlingly white or went delicately clothed in such pink and spangles hitherto we had known the outward woman as but a drab thing hourglass shaped nearly legless bunched here constricted there slow of movement and given to deprecating lusty action of limb here was a revelation from henceforth our imaginations would have to be revised and corrected up to date in one of those swift rushes the mind makes in highstrung moments i saw myself and coralie close enfolded pacing the world together oer hill and plain through storied cities past rows of applauding relations i in my sunday knickerbockers she in her pink and spangles summers sicken flowers fail and die all beauty but rides round the ring and out at the portal even so coralie passed in her turn poised sideways panting on her steed lightly swayed as a tulipbloom bowing on this side and on that as she disappeared and with her went my heart and my soul and all the light and the glory and the entrancement of the scene harold woke up with a gasp wasnt she beautiful he said in quite a subdued way for him i felt a momentary pang we had been friendly rivals before in many an exploit but here was altogether a more serious affair was this then to be the beginning of strife and coldness of civil war on the hearthstone and the sundering of old ties then i recollected the true position of things and felt very sorry for harold for it was inexorably written that he would have to give way to me since i was the elder rules were not made for nothing in a sensibly constructed universe there was little more to wait for now coralie had gone yet i lingered still on the chance of her appearing again next moment the clown tripped up and fell flat with magnificent artifice and at once fresh emotions began to stir love had endured its little hour and stern ambition now asserted itself oh to be a splendid fellow like this selfcontained ready of speech agile beyond conception braving the forces of society his hand against everyone yet always getting the best of it what freshness of humour what courtesy to dames what triumphant ability to discomfit rivals frockcoated and moustached though they might be and what a grand selfconfident straddle of the legs who could desire a finer career than to go through life thus gorgeously equipped success was his keynote adroitness his panoply and the mellow music of laughter his instant reward even coralies image wavered and receded i would come back to her in the evening of course but i would be a clown all the working hours of the day the short interval was ended the band with longdrawn chords sounded a prelude touched with significance and the programme in letters overtopping their fellows proclaimed zephyrine the bride of the desert in her unequalled bareback equestrian interlude so sated was i already with beauty and with wit that i hardly dared hope for a fresh emotion yet her title was tinged with romance and coralies display had aroused in me an interest in her sex which even herself had failed to satisfy entirely brayed in by trumpets zephyrine swung passionately into the arena with a bound she stood erect one foot upon each of her supple plunging arabs and at once i knew that my fate was sealed my chapter closed and the bride of the desert was the one bride for me black was her raiment great silver stars shone through it caught in the dusky twilight of her gauze black as her own hair were the two mighty steeds she bestrode in a tempest they thundered by in a whirlwind a scirocco of tan her cheeks bore the kiss of an eastern sun and the sandstorms of her native desert were her satellites what was coralie with her pink silk her golden hair and slender limbs beside this magnificent fullfigured cleopatra in a twinkling we were scouring the desert she and i and the two coalblack horses side by side keeping pace in our swinging gallop we distanced the ostrich we outstrode the zebra and as we went it seemed the wilderness blossomed like the rose i know not rightly how we got home that evening on the road there were everywhere strange presences and the thud of phantom hoofs encircled us in my nose was the pungent circussmell the crack of the whip and the frank laugh of the clown were in my ears the funny man thoughtfully abstained from conversation and left our illusion quite alone sparing us all jarring criticism and analysis and he gave me no chance when he deposited us at our gate to get rid of the clumsy expressions of gratitude i had been laboriously framing for the rest of the evening distraught and silent i only heard the marchmusic of the band playing on in some corner of my brain when at last my head touched the pillow in a trice i was with zephyrine riding the boundless sahara cheek to cheek the world well lost while at times through the sandclouds that encircled us glimmered the eyes of coralie touched one fancied with something of a tender reproach its walls were as of jasper in the long winter evenings when we had the picturebooks out on the floor and sprawled together over them with elbows deep in the hearthrug the first business to be gone through was the process of allotment all the characters in the pictures had to be assigned and dealt out among us according to seniority as far as they would go when once that had been satisfactorily completed the story was allowed to proceed and thereafter in addition to the excitement of the plot one always possessed a personal interest in some particular member of the cast whose successes or rebuffs one took as so much private gain or loss for edward this was satisfactory enough claiming his right of the eldest he would annex the hero in the very frontispiece and for the rest of the story his career if chequered at intervals was sure of heroic episodes and a glorious close but his juniors who had to put up with characters of a clay more mixed nay sometimes with undiluted villany were hard put to it on occasion to defend their other selves as it was strict etiquette to do from ignominy perhaps only too justly merited edward was indeed a hopeless grabber in the buffalobook for instance so named from the subject of its principal picture though indeed it dealt with varied slaughter in every zone edward was the stalwart bearded figure with yellow leggings and a powderhorn who undauntedly discharged the fatal bullet into the shoulder of the great bull bison charging home to within a yard of his muzzle to me was allotted the subsidiary character of the friend who had succeeded in bringing down a cow while harold had to be content to hold edwards spare rifle in the background with evident signs of uneasiness farther on again where the magnificent chamois sprang rigid into midair edward crouched dizzily against the precipiceface was the sportsman from whose weapon a puff of white smoke was floating away a barekneed guide was all that fell to my share while poor harold had to take the boy with the haversack or abandon for this occasion at least all alpine ambitions of course the girls fared badly in this book and it was not surprising that they preferred the pilgrims progress for instance where women had a fair show and there was generally enough of em to go round or a good fairy story wherein princesses met with a healthy appreciation but indeed we were all best pleased with a picture wherein the characters just fitted us in number sex and qualifications and this to us stood for artistic merit all the christmas numbers in their gilt frames on the nurserywall had been gone through and allotted long ago and in these sooner or later each one of us got a chance to figure in some satisfactory and brightly coloured situation few of the other pictures about the house afforded equal facilities they were generally wanting in figures and even when these were present they lacked dramatic interest in this picture that i have to speak about although the characters had a stupid way of not doing anything and apparently not wanting to do anything there was at least a sufficiency of them so in due course they were allotted too in itself the picture which in its ebony and tortoiseshell frame hung in a corner of the diningroom had hitherto possessed no special interest for us and would probably never have been dealt with at all but for a revolt of the girls against a succession of books on sport in which the illustrator seemed to have forgotten that there were such things as women in the world selina accordingly made for it one rainy morning and announced that she was the lady seated in the centre whose gown of rich flowered brocade fell in such straight severe lines to her feet whose cloak of dark blue was held by a jewelled clasp and whose long fair hair was crowned with a diadem of gold and pearl well we had no objection to that it seemed fair enough especially to edward who promptly proceeded to grab the armourman who stood leaning on his shield at the ladys right hand a dainty and delicate armourman this and i confess though i knew it was all right and fair and orderly i felt a slight pang when he passed out of my reach into edwards possession his armour was just the sort i wanted myself scalloped and fluted and shimmering and spotless and though he was but a boy by his beardless face and golden hair the shattered spearshaft in his grasp proclaimed him a genuine fighter and fresh from some such agreeable work yes i grudged edward the armourman and when he said i could have the fellow on the other side i hung back and said id think about it this fellow had no armour nor weapons but wore a plain jerkin with a leather pouch a mere civilian and with one hand he pointed to a wound in his thigh i didnt care about him and when harold eagerly put in his claim i gave way and let him have the man the cause of harolds anxiety only came out later it was the wound he coveted it seemed he wanted to have a big sore wound of his very own and go about and show it to people and excite their envy or win their respect charlotte was only too pleased to take the childangel seated at the ladys feet grappling with a musical instrument much too big for her charlotte wanted wings badly and next to those a guitar or a banjo the angel besides wore an amber necklace which took her fancy immensely this left the picture allotted with the exception of two or three more angels who peeped or perched behind the main figures with a certain subdued drollery in their faces as if the thing had gone on long enough and it was now time to upset something or kick up a row of some sort we knew these good folk to be saints and angels because we had been told they were otherwise we should never have guessed it angels as we knew them in our sunday books were vapid colourless uninteresting characters with straight upanddown sort of figures white nightgowns white wings and the same straight yellow hair parted in the middle they were serious even melancholy and we had no desire to have any traffic with them these bright bejewelled little persons however piquant of face and radiant of feather were evidently hatched from quite a different egg and we felt we might have interests in common with them shortnosed shock headed with mouths that went up at the corners and with an evident disregard for all their fine clothes they would be the best of good company we felt sure if only we could manage to get at them one doubt alone disturbed my mind in games requiring agility those wings of theirs would give them a tremendous pull could they be trusted to play fair i asked selina who replied scornfully that angels always played fair but i went back and had another look at the brownfaced one peeping over the back of the ladys chair and still i had my doubts when edward went off to school a great deal of adjustment and reallotment took place and all the heroes of illustrated literature were at my call did i choose to possess them in this particular case however i made no haste to seize upon the armourman perhaps it was because i wanted a fresh saint of my own not a stale saint that edward had been for so long a time perhaps it was rather that ever since i had elected to be saintless i had got into the habit of strolling off into the background and amusing myself with what i found there a very fascinating background it was and held a great deal though so tiny blue and red like gems then a white road ran with wilful uncalledfor loops up a steep conical hill crowned with towers bastioned walls and belfries and down the road the little knights came riding two and two the hill on one side descended to water tranquil farreaching and blue and a very curly ship lay at anchor with one mast having an odd sort of crowsnest at the top of it there was plenty to do in this pleasant land the annoying thing about it was one could never penetrate beyond a certain point i might wander up that road as often as i liked i was bound to be brought up at the gateway the funny galleried topheavy gateway of the little walled town inside doubtless there were high jinks going on but the password was denied to me i could get on board a boat and row up as far as the curly ship but around the headland i might not go on the other side of a surety the shipping lay thick the merchants walked on the quay and the sailors sang as they swung out the corded bales but as for me i must stay down in the meadow and imagine it all as best i could once i broached the subject to charlotte and found to my surprise that she had had the same joys and encountered the same disappointments in this delectable country she too had walked up that road and flattened her nose against that portcullis and she pointed out something that i had overlooked to wit that if you rowed off in a boat to the curly ship and got hold of a rope and clambered aboard of her and swarmed up the mast and got into the crowsnest you could just see over the headland and take in at your ease the life and bustle of the port she proceeded to describe all the fun that was going on there at such length and with so much particularity that i looked at her suspiciously why you talk as if youd been in that crowsnest yourself i said charlotte answered nothing but pursed her mouth up and nodded violently for some minutes and i could get nothing more out of her i felt rather hurt evidently she had managed somehow or other to get up into that crowsnest charlotte had got ahead of me on this occasion it was necessary no doubt that grownup people should dress themselves up and go forth to pay calls i dont mean that we saw any sense in the practice it would have been so much more reasonable to stay at home in your old clothes and play but we recognized that these folk had to do many unaccountable things and after all it was their life and not ours and we were not in a position to criticize besides they had many habits more objectionable than this one which to us generally meant a free and untrammelled afternoon wherein to play the devil in our own way the case was different however when the pressgang was abroad when prayers and excuses were alike disregarded and we were forced into the service like native levies impelled toward the foe less by the inherent righteousness of the cause than by the indisputable rifles of their white allies this was unpardonable and altogether detestable still the thing happened now and again and when it did there was no arguing about it the order was for the front and we just had to shut up and march selina to be sure had a sneaking fondness for dressing up and paying calls though she pretended to dislike it just to keep on the soft side of public opinion so i thought it extremely mean in her to have the earache on that particular afternoon when aunt eliza ordered the ponycarriage and went on the warpath i was ordered also in the same breath as the ponycarriage and as we eventually trundled off it seemed to me that the utter waste of that afternoon for which i had planned so much could never be made up nor atoned for in all the tremendous stretch of years that still lay before me the house that we were bound for on this occasion was a big house a generic title applied by us to the class of residence that had a long carriagedrive through rhododendrons and a portico propped by fluted pillars and a grave butler who bolted back swingdoors and came down steps and pretended to have entirely forgotten his familiar intercourse with you at less serious moments and a big hall where no boots or shoes or upper garments were allowed to lie about frankly and easily as with us and where finally people were apt to sit about dressed up as if they were going on to a party the lady who received us was effusive to aunt eliza and hollowly gracious to me in ten seconds they had their heads together and were hard at it talking clothes i was left high and dry on a straightbacked chair longing to kick the legs of it yet not daring for a time i was content to stare there was lots to stare at high and low and around then the inevitable fidgets came on and scratching ones legs mitigated slightly but did not entirely disperse them my two warders were still deep in clothes i slipped off my chair and edged cautiously around the room exploring examining recording many strange fine things lay along my route pictures and gimcracks on the walls trinkets and globular old watches and snuffboxes on the tables and i took good care to finger everything within reach thoroughly and conscientiously some articles in addition i smelt at last in my orbit i happened on an open door half concealed by the folds of a curtain i glanced carefully around they were still deep in clothes both talking together and i slipped through this was altogether a more sensible sort of room that i had got into for the walls were honestly upholstered with books though these for the most part glimmered provokingly through the glass doors of their tall cases i read their titles longingly breathing on every accessible pane of glass for i dared not attempt to open the doors with the enemy encamped so near in the window though on a high sort of desk there lay all by itself a most promisinglooking book gorgeously bound i raised the leaves by one corner and like scent from a potpourri jar there floated out a brief vision of blues and reds telling of pictures and pictures all highly coloured here was the right sort of thing at last and my afternoon would not be entirely wasted i inclined an ear to the door by which i had entered like the brimming tide of a fullfed river the grand eternal inexhaustible clothesproblem bubbled and eddied and surged along it seemed safe enough i slid the book off its desk with some difficulty for it was very fine and large and staggered with it to the hearthrug the only fit and proper place for books of quality such as this they were excellent hearthrugs in that house soft and wide with the thickest of pile and ones knees sank into them most comfortably when i got the book open there was a difficulty at first in making the great stiff pages lie down most fortunately the coalscuttle was actually at my elbow and it was easy to find a flat bit of coal to lay on the refractory page really it was just as if everything had been arranged for me this was not such a bad sort of house after all the beginnings of the thing were gay borders scrolls and strapwork and diapered backgrounds a maze of colour with small misshapen figures clambering cheerily up and down everywhere but first i eagerly scanned what text there was in the middle in order to get a hint of what it was all about of course i was not going to waste any time in reading a clue a signboard a fingerpost was all i required to my dismay and disgust it was all in a stupid foreign language really the perversity of some people made one at times almost despair of the whole race however the pictures remained pictures never lied never shuffled nor evaded and as for the story i could invent it myself over the page i went shifting the bit of coal to a new position and as the scheme of the picture disengaged itself from out the medley of colour that met my delighted eyes first there was a warm sense of familiarity then a dawning recognition and then o then along with blissful certainty came the imperious need to clasp my stomach with both hands in order to repress the shout of rapture that struggled to escape it was my own little city i knew it well enough i recognized it at once though i had never been quite so near it before here was the familiar gateway to the left that strange slender tower with its grim square head shot far above the walls to the right outside the town the hill as of old broke steeply down to the sea but today everything was bigger and fresher and clearer the walls seemed newly hewn gay carpets were hung out over them fair ladies and longhaired children peeped and crowded on the battlements better still the portcullis was up i could even catch a glimpse of the sunlit square within and a dainty company was trooping through the gate on horseback two and two their horses in trappings that swept the ground were gay as themselves and they were the gayest crew for dress and bearing i had ever yet beheld it could mean nothing else but a wedding i thought this holiday attire this festal and solemn entry and wedding or whatever it was i meant to be there this time i would not be balked by any grim portcullis this time i would slip in with the rest of the crowd find out just what my little town was like within those exasperating walls that had so long confronted me and moreover have my share of the fun that was evidently going on inside confident yet breathless with expectation i turned the page joy at last i was in it at last i was on the right side of those provoking walls and needless to say i looked about me with much curiosity a public place clearly though not such as i was used to the houses at the back stood on a sort of colonnade beneath which the people jostled and crowded the upper stories were all painted with wonderful pictures above the straight line of the roofs the deep blue of a cloudless sky stretched from side to side lords and ladies thronged the foreground while on a dais in the centre a gallant gentleman just alighted off his horse stooped to the fingers of a girl as bravely dressed out as selinas lady between the saints and round about stood venerable personages robed in the most variegated clothing there were boys too in plenty with tiny red caps on their thick hair and their shirts had bunched up and worked out at the waist just as my own did so often after chasing anybody and each boy of them wore an odd pair of stockings one blue and the other red this system of attire went straight to my heart i had tried the same thing so often and had met with so much discouragement and here at last was my justification painted deliberately in a grownup book i looked about for my saintfriends the armourman and the other fellow but they were not to be seen evidently they were unable to get off duty even for a wedding and still stood on guard in that green meadow down below i was disappointed too that not an angel was visible one or two of them surely could easily have been spared for an hour to run up and see the show and they would have been thoroughly at home here in the midst of all the colour and the movement and the fun but it was time to get on for clearly the interest was only just beginning over went the next page and there we were the whole crowd of us assembled in a noble church it was not easy to make out exactly what was going on but in the throng i was delighted to recognize my angels at last happy and very much at home they had managed to get leave off evidently and must have run up the hill and scampered breathlessly through the gate and perhaps they cried a little when they found the square empty and thought the fun must be all over two of them had got hold of a great wax candle apiece as much as they could stagger under and were tittering sideways at each other as the grease ran bountifully over their clothes a third had strolled in among the company and was chatting to a young gentleman with whom she appeared to be on the best of terms decidedly this was the right breed of angel for us none of your sickbed or night nursery business for them well no doubt they were now being married he and she just as always happened and then of course they were going to live happily ever after and that was the part i wanted to get to storybooks were so stupid always stopping at the point where they became really nice but this picturestory was only in its first chapters and at last i was to have a chance of knowing how people lived happily ever after we would all go home together he and she and the angels and i and the armourman would be invited to come and stay and then the story would really begin at the point where those other ones always left off i turned the page and found myself free of the dim and splendid church and once more in the open country this was all right this was just as it should be the sky was a fleckless blue the flags danced in the breeze and our merry bridal party with jest and laughter jogged down to the waterside i was through the town by this time and out on the other side of the hill where i had always wanted to be and sure enough there was the harbour all thick with curly ships most of them were piled high with weddingpresents bales of silk and gold and silver plate and comfortablelooking bags suggesting bullion and the gayest ship of all lay close up to the carpeted landingstage already the bride was stepping daintily down the gangway her ladies following primly one by one a few minutes more and we should all be aboard the hawsers would splash in the water the sails would fill and strain from the deck i should see the little walled town recede and sink and grow dim while every plunge of our bows brought us nearer to the happy island it was an island we were bound for i knew well already i could see the islandpeople waving hands on the crowded quay whence the little houses ran up the hill to the castle crowning all with its towers and battlements once more we should ride together a merry procession clattering up the steep street and through the grim gateway and then we should have arrived then we should all dine together then we should have reached home and then ow ow ow bitter it is to stumble out of an opalescent dream into the cold daylight cruel to lose in a second a seavoyage an island and a castle that was to be practically your own but cruellest and bitterest of all to know in addition to your loss that the fingers of an angry aunt have you tight by the scruff of your neck my beautiful book was gone too ravished from my grasp by the dressy lady who joined in the outburst of denunciation as heartily as if she had been a relative and naught was left me but to blubber dismally awakened of a sudden to the harshness of real things and the unnumbered hostilities of the actual world i cared little for their reproaches their abuse but i sorrowed heartily for my lost ship my vanished island my uneaten dinner and for the knowledge that if i wanted any angels to play with i must henceforth put up with the anaemic nightgowned nonentities that hovered over the bed of the sundayschool child in the pages of the sabbath improver i was led ignominiously out of the house in a pulpy watery state while the butler handled his swing doors with a stony impassive countenance intended for the deception of the very elect though it did not deceive me i knew well enough that next time he was off duty and strolled around our way we should meet in our kitchen as man to man and i would punch him and ask him riddles and he would teach me tricks with corks and bits of string so his unsympathetic manner did not add to my depression i maintained a diplomatic blubber long after we had been packed into our ponycarriage and the lodgegate had clicked behind us because it served as a sort of armourplating against heckling and argument and abuse and i was thinking hard and wanted to be let alone and the thoughts that i was thinking were two first i thought ive got ahead of charlotte this time and next i thought when ive grown up big and have money of my own and a fullsized walkingstick i will set out early one morning and never stop till i get to that little walled town there ought to be no real difficulty in the task it only meant asking here and asking there and people were very obliging and i could describe every stick and stone of it as for the island which i had never even seen that was not so easy yet i felt confident that somehow at some time sooner or later i was destined to arrive a saga of the seas it happened one day that some ladies came to call who were not at all the sort i was used to they suffered from a grievance so far as i could gather and the burden of their plaint was man men in general and man in particular though the words were but spoken i could clearly discern the capital m in their acid utterance of course i was not present officially so to speak down below in my subworld of chairlegs and hearthrugs and the undersides of sofas i was working out my own floorproblems while they babbled on far above my head considering me as but a chairleg or even something lower in the scale yet i was listening hard all the time with that respectful consideration one gives to all grownup peoples remarks so long as one knows no better it seemed a serious indictment enough as they rolled it out in tact considerateness and right appreciation as well as in taste and aesthetic sensibilities we failed at every point we breeched and bearded prenticejobs of nature and i began to feel like collapsing on the carpet from sheer spiritual anaemia but when one of them with a swing of her skirt prostrated a whole regiment of my brave tin soldiers and never apologized nor even offered her aid toward revivifying the battleline i could not help feeling that in tactfulness and consideration for others she was still a little to seek and i said as much with some directness of language that was the end of me from a society point of view rudeness to visitors was the unpardonable sin and in two seconds i had my marching orders and was sullenly wending my way to the st helena of the nursery as i climbed the stair my thoughts reverted somehow to a game we had been playing that very morning it was the good old game of rafts a game that will be played till all the oceans are dry and all the trees in the world are felled and after and we were all crowded together on the precarious little platform and selina occupied every bit as much room as i did and charlottes legs didnt dangle over any more than harolds the pitiless sun overhead beat on us all with tropic impartiality and the hungry sharks whose fins scored the limitless pacific stretching out on every side were impelled by an appetite that made no exceptions as to sex when we shared the ultimate biscuit and circulated the last waterkeg the girls got an absolute fourth apiece and neither more nor less and the only partiality shown was entirely in favour of charlotte who was allowed to perceive and to hail the savioursail on the horizon and this was only because it was her turn to do so not because she happened to be this or that surely the rules of the raft were the rules of life and in what then did these visitorladies grievance consist puzzled and a little sulky i pushed open the door of the deserted nursery where the raft that had rocked beneath so many hopes and fears still occupied the oceanfloor to the dull eye that merely tarries upon the outsides of things it might have appeared unromantic and even unraftlike consisting only as it did of a round spongebath on a bald deal towelhorse placed flat on the floor even to myself much of the recent raftglamour seemed to have departed as i halfmechanically stepped inside and curled myself up in it for a solitary voyage once i was in however the old magic and mystery returned in full flood when i discovered that the inequalities of the towelhorse caused the bath to rock slightly indeed but easily and incessantly a few minutes of this delightful motion and one was fairly launched so those women below didnt want us well there were other women and other places that did and this was going to be no scrambling raftaffair but a fullblooded voyage of the man equipped and purposeful in search of what was his rightful own whither should i shape my course and what sort of vessel should i charter for the voyage the shipping of all england was mine to pick from and the far corners of the globe were my rightful inheritance a frigate of course seemed the natural vehicle for a boy of spirit to set out in and yet there was something rather uppish in commanding a frigate at the very first setoff and little spread was left for the ambition frigates too could always be acquired later by sheer adventure and your real hero generally saved up a squarerigged ship for the final achievement and the rapt return no it was a schooner that i was aboard of a schooner whose masts raked devilishly as the leaping seas hissed along her low black gunwale many hairbrained youths started out on a mere cutter but i was prudent and besides i had some inkling of the serious affairs that were ahead i have said i was already on board and indeed on this occasion i was too hungry for adventure to linger over what would have been a special delight at a period of more leisure the dangling about the harbour the choosing your craft selecting your shipmates stowing your cargo and fitting up your private cabin with everything you might want to put your hand on in any emergency whatever i could not wait for that out beyond soundings the big seas were racing westward and calling me albatrosses hovered motionless expectant of a comrade and a thousand islands held each of them a fresh adventure stored up hidden away awaiting production expressly saved for me we were humming closehauled down the channel spray in the eyes and the shrouds thrilling musically in much less time than the average man would have taken to transfer his gladstone bag and his rugs from the train to a sheltered place on the promenadedeck of the tame daily steamer so long as we were in pilotage i stuck manfully to the wheel the undertaking was mine and with it all its responsibilities and there was some tricky steering to be done as we sped by headland and bay ere we breasted the great seas outside and the land fell away behind us but as soon as the atlantic had opened out i began to feel that it would be rather nice to take tea by myself in my own cabin and it therefore became necessary to invent a comrade or two to take their turn at the wheel this was easy enough a friend or two of my own age from among the boys i knew a friend or two from characters in the books i knew and a friend or two from nomansland where every fellows a born sailor and the crew was complete i addressed them on the poop divided them into watches gave instructions i should be summoned on the first sign of pirates whales or frenchmen and retired below to a wellearned spell of relaxation that was the right sort of cabin that i stepped into shutting the door behind me with a click of course firearms were the first thing i looked for and there they were sure enough in their racks dozens of em doublebarrelled guns and repeating rifles and long pistols and shiny plated revolvers i rang up the steward and ordered tea with scones and jam in its native pots none of your finicking shallow glass dishes and when properly streaked with jam and blown out with tea i went through the armoury clicked the rifles and revolvers tested the edges of the cutlasses with my thumb and filled the cartridge belts chockfull everything was there and of the best quality just as if i had spent a whole fortnight knocking about plymouth and ordering things clearly if this cruise came to grief it would not be for want of equipment just as i was beginning on the lockers and the drawers the watch reported icebergs on both bows and what was more to the point coveys of polar bears on the icebergs i grasped a rifle or two and hastened on deck the spectacle was indeed magnificent it generally is with icebergs on both bows and these were exceptionally enormous icebergs but i hadnt come there to paint academy pictures so the captains gig was in the water and manned almost ere the boatswains whistle had ceased sounding and we were pulling hard for the polar bears myself and the rifles in the sternsheets i have rarely enjoyed better shooting than i got during that afternoons tramp over the icebergs perhaps i was in specially good form perhaps the bears rose well anyhow the bag was a portentous one in later days on reading of the growing scarcity of polar bears my conscience has pricked me but that afternoon i experienced no compunction nevertheless when the huge pile of skins had been hoisted on board and a stiff grog had been served out to the crew of the captains gig i ordered the schooners head to be set due south for icebergs were played out for the moment and it was getting to be time for something more tropical tropical was a mild expression of what was to come as was shortly proved it was about three bells in the next days forenoon watch when the lookout man first sighted the pirate brigantine i disliked the looks of her from the first and after piping all hands to quarters had the brass carronade on the foredeck crammed with grape to the muzzle this proved a wise precaution for the flagitious pirate craft having crept up to us under the colours of the swiss republic a state with which we were just then on the best possible terms suddenly shook out the skullandcrossbones at her masthead and let fly with roundshot at close quarters knocking into pieces several of my crew who could ill be spared the sight of their disconnected limbs aroused my ire to its utmost height and i let them have the contents of the brass carronade with ghastly effect next moment the hulls of the two ships were grinding together the cold steel flashed from its scabbard and the deathgrapple had begun in spite of the deadly work of my grapegorged carronade our foe still outnumbered us i reckoned by three to one honour forbade my fixing it at a lower figure this was the minimum rate at which one dared to do business with pirates they were stark veterans too every man seamed with ancient sabrecuts whereas my crew had many of them hardly attained the maturity which is the gift of ten long summers and the whole thing was so sudden that i had no time to invent a reinforcement of riper years it was not surprising therefore that my dauntless boardingparty axe in hand and cutlass between teeth fought their way to the pirates deck only to be repulsed again and yet again and that our planks were soon slippery with our own ungrudged and inexhaustible blood at this critical point in the conflict the bosun grasping me by the arm drew my attention to a magnificent british manofwar just hove to in the offing while the signalman his glass at his eye reported that she was inquiring whether we wanted any assistance or preferred to go through with the little job ourselves this veiled attempt to share our laurels with us courteously as it was worded put me on my mettle wiping the blood out of my eyes i ordered the signalman to reply instantly with the half dozen or so of flags that he had at his disposal that much as we appreciated the valour of the regular service and the delicacy of spirit that animated its commanders still this was an orthodox case of young gentlemanadventurer versus the unshaved pirate and her majestys marine had nothing to do but to form the usual admiring and applauding background then rallying round me the remnant of my faithful crew i selected a fresh cutlass i had worn out three already and plunged once more into the pleasing carnage the result was not long doubtful indeed i could not allow it to be as i was already getting somewhat bored with the pirate business and was wanting to get on to something more southern and sensuous all serious resistance came to an end as soon as i had reached the quarterdeck and cut down the pirate chief a fine blackbearded fellow in his way but hardly up to date in his parryandthrust business those whom our cutlasses had spared were marched out along their own plank in the approved old fashion and in tune the scuppers relieved the decks of the blood that made traffic temporarily impossible and all the time the britishmanofwar admired and applauded in the offing as soon as we had got through with the necessary throatcutting and swabbingup all hands set to work to discover treasure and soon the deck shone bravely with ingots and mexican dollars and church plate there were ropes of pearls too and big stacks of nougat and rubies and gold watches and turkish delight in tubs but i left these trifles to my crew and continued the search alone for by this time i had determined that there should be a princess on board carried off to be sold in captivity to the bold bad moors and now with beating heart awaiting her rescue by me the perseus of her dreams i came upon her at last in the big statecabin in the stern and she wore a holland pinafore over her princessclothes and she had brown wavy hair hanging down her back just like well never mind she had brown wavy hair when gentlefolk meet courtesies pass and i will not weary other people with relating all the compliments and countercompliments that we exchanged all in the most approved manner occasions like this when tongues wagged smoothly and speech flowed free were always especially pleasing to me who am naturally inclined to be tonguetied with women but at last ceremony was over and we sat on the table and swung our legs and agreed to be fast friends and i showed her my latest knife onebladed hornhandled terrific hung round my neck with string and she showed me the chiefest treasures the ship contained hidden away in a most private and particular locker a musical box with a glass top that let you see the works and a railway train with real lines and a real tunnel and a tin ironclad that followed a magnet and was ever so much handier in many respects than the real fullsized thing that still lay and applauded in the offing there was high feasting that night in my cabin we invited the captain of the manofwar one could hardly do less it seemed to me and the princess took one end of the table and i took the other and the captain was very kind and nice and told us fairy stories and asked us both to come and stay with him next christmas and promised we should have some hunting on real ponies when he left i gave him some ingots and things and saw him into his boat and then i went round the ship and addressed the crew in several set speeches which moved them deeply and with my own hands loaded up the carronade with grapeshot till it ran over at the mouth this done i retired into the cabin with the princess and locked the door and first we started the musical box taking turns to wind it up and then we made toffee in the cabinstove and then we ran the train round and round the room and through and through the tunnel and lastly we swam the tin ironclad in the bath with the soapdish for a pirate next morning the air was rich with spices porpoises rolled and gambolled round the bows and the south sea islands lay full in view they were the real south sea islands of course not the badly furnished journeymenislands that are to be perceived on the map as for the pirate brigantine and the manofwar i dont really know what became of them they had played their part very well for the time but i wasnt going to bother to account for them so i just let them evaporate quietly the islands provided plenty of fresh occupation for here were little bays of silvery sand dotted with landcrabs groves of palmtrees wherein monkeys frisked and pelted each other with cocoanuts and caves and sites for stockades and hidden treasures significantly indicated by skulls in riotous plenty while birds and beasts of every colour and all latitudes made pleasing noises which excited the sporting instinct the islands lay conveniently close together which necessitated careful steering as we threaded the devious and intricate channels that separated them of course no one else could be trusted at the wheel so it is not surprising that for some time i quite forgot that there was such a thing as a princess on board this is too much the masculine way whenever theres any real business doing however i remembered her as soon as the anchor was dropped and i went below and consoled her and we had breakfast together and she was allowed to pour out which quite made up for everything when breakfast was over we ordered out the captains gig and rowed all about the islands and paddled and explored and hunted bisons and beetles and butterflies and found everything we wanted and i gave her pink shells and tortoises and great milky pearls and little green lizards and she gave me guineapigs and coral to make into waistcoatbuttons and tame seaotters and a real pirates powderhorn it was a prolific day and a longlasting one and weary were we with all our hunting and our getting and our gathering when at last we clambered into the captains gig and rowed back to a late tea the following day my conscience rose up and accused me this was not what i had come out to do these triflings with pearls and parrakeets these al fresco luncheons off yams and bananas there was no making of history about them i resolved that without further dallying i would turn to and capture the french frigate according to the original programme so we upped anchor with the morning tide and set all sail for san salvador of course i had no idea where san salvador really was i havent now for that matter but it seemed a rightsounding sort of name for a place that was to have a bay that was to hold a french frigate that was to be cut out so as i said we sailed for san salvador and made the bay about eight bells that evening and saw the topmasts of the frigate over the headland that sheltered her and forthwith there was supimoned a council of war it is a very serious matter a council of war we had not held one hitherto pirates and truck of that sort not calling for such solemn treatment but in an affair that might almost be called international it seemed well to proceed gravely and by regular steps so we met in my cabin the princess and the bosun and a boy from the reallife lot and a man from among the bookmen and a fellow from nomansland and myself in the chair the bosun had taken part in so many cuttingsout during his past career that practically he did all the talking and was the council of war himself it was to be an affair of boats he explained a boatscrew would be told off to cut the cables and two boatscrews to climb stealthily on board and overpower the sleeping frenchmen and two more boatscrews to haul the doomed vessel out of the bay this made rather a demand on my limited resources as to crews but i was prepared to stretch a point in a case like this and i speedily brought my numbers up to the requisite efficiency the night was both moonless and starless i had arranged all that when the boats pushed off from the side of our vessel and made their way toward the ship that unfortunately for itself had been singled out by fate to carry me home in triumph i was in excellent spirits and indeed as i stepped over the side a lawless idea crossed my mind of discovering another princess on board the frigate a french one this time i had heard that that sort was rather nice but i abandoned the notion at once recollecting that the heroes of all history had always been noted for their unswerving constancy the french captain was snug in bed when i clambered in through his cabin window and held a naked cutlass to his throat naturally he was surprised and considerably alarmed till i discharged one of my set speeches at him pointing out that my men already had his crew under hatchways that his vessel was even then being towed out of harbour and that on his accepting the situation with a good grace his person and private property would be treated with all the respect due to the representative of a great nation for which i entertained feelings of the profoundest admiration and regard and all that sort of thing it was a beautiful speech the frenchman at once presented me with his parole in the usual way and in a reply of some power and pathos only begged that i would retire a moment while he put on his trousers this i gracefully consented to do and the incident ended two of my boats were sunk by the fire from the forts on the shore and several brave fellows were severely wounded in the handtohand struggle with the french crew for the possession of the frigate but the bosuns admirable strategy and my own reckless gallantry in securing the french captain at the outset had the fortunate result of keeping down the deathrate it was all for the sake of the princess that i had arranged so comparatively tame a victory for myself i rather liked a fair amount of bloodletting redhot shot and flying splinters but when you have girls about the place they have got to be considered to a certain extent there was another supperparty that night in my cabin as soon as we had got well out to sea and the french captain who was the guest of the evening was in the greatest possible form we became sworn friends and exchanged invitations to come and stay at each others homes and really it was quite difficult to induce him to take his leave but at last he and his crew were bundled into their boats and after i had pressed some pirate bullion upon them delicately of course but in a pleasant manner that admitted of no denial the gallant fellows quite broke down and we parted our bosoms heaving with a full sense of each others magnanimity and good fellowship the next day which was nearly all taken up with shifting our quarters into the new frigate so honourably and easily acquired was a very pleasant one as everyone who has gone up in the world and moved into a larger house will readily understand at last i had grim black guns all along each side instead of a rotten brass carronade at last i had a squarerigged ship with real yards and a proper quarterdeck in fact now that i had soared as high as could be hoped in a single voyage it seemed about time to go home and cut a dash and show off a bit the worst of this oceantheatre was it held no proper audience it was hard of course to relinquish all the adventures that still lay untouched in these southern seas whaling for instance had not yet been entered upon the joys of exploration and strange inland cities innocent of the white man still awaited me and the book of wrecks and rescues was not yet even opened but i had achieved a frigate and a princess and that was not so bad for a beginning and more than enough to show off with before those dull unadventurous folk who continued on their millhorse round at home the voyage home was a record one so far as mere speed was concerned and all adventures were scornfully left behind as we rattled along for other adventurers who had still their laurels to win hardly later than the noon of next day we dropped anchor in plymouth sound and heard the intoxicating clamour of bells the roar of artillery and the hoarse cheers of an excited populace surging down to the quays that told us we were being appreciated at something like our true merits the lord mayor was waiting there to receive us and with him several admirals of the fleet as we walked down the lane of pushing enthusiastic devonians the princess and i and our warworn weatherbeaten spoilladen crew everybody was very nice about the french frigate and the pirate booty and the scars still fresh on our young limbs yet i think what i liked best of all was that they all pronounced the princess to be a duck and a peerless brown haired darling and a true mate for a hero and of the right princessbreed the air was thick with invitations and with the smell of civic banquets in a forward stage but i sternly waved all festivities aside the coachesandfour i had ordered immediately on arriving were blocking the whole of the high street the champing of bits and the pawing of gravel summoned us to take our seats and be off to where the real performance awaited us compared with which all this was but an interlude i placed the princess in the most highly gilded coach of the lot and mounted to my place at her side and the rest of the crew scrambled on board of the others as best they might the whips cracked and the crowd scattered and cheered as we broke into a gallop for home the noisy bells burst into a farewell peal yes that was undoubtedly the usual bell for schoolroom tea and high time too i thought as i tumbled out of the bath which was beginning to feel very hard to the projecting portions of my framework as i trotted downstairs hungrier even than usual farewells floated up from the front door and i heard the departing voices of our angular elderly visitors as they made their way down the walk man was still catching it apparently man was getting it hot and much man cared the seas were his and their islands he had his frigates for the taking his pirates and their hoards for an unregarded cutlassstroke or two and there were princesses in plenty waiting for him somewhere princesses of the right sort the reluctant dragon footprints in the snow have been unfailing provokers of sentiment ever since snow was first a white wonder in this drabcoloured world of ours in a poetrybook presented to one of us by an aunt there was a poem by one wordsworth in which they stood out strongly with a picture all to themselves too but we didnt think very highly either of the poem or the sentiment footprints in the sand now were quite another matter and we grasped crusoes attitude of mind much more easily than wordsworths excitement and mystery curiosity and suspense these were the only sentiments that tracks whether in sand or in snow were able to arouse in us we had awakened early that winter morning puzzled at first by the added light that filled the room then when the truth at last fully dawned on us and we knew that snowballing was no longer a wistful dream but a solid certainty waiting for us outside it was a mere brute fight for the necessary clothes and the lacing of boots seemed a clumsy invention and the buttoning of coats an unduly tedious form of fastening with all that snow going to waste at our very door when dinnertime came we had to be dragged in by the scruff of our necks the short armistice over the combat was resumed but presently charlotte and i a little weary of contests and of missiles that ran shudderingly down inside ones clothes forsook the trampled battlefield of the lawn and went exploring the blank virgin spaces of the white world that lay beyond it stretched away unbroken on every side of us this mysterious soft garment under which our familiar world had so suddenly hidden itself faint imprints showed where a casual bird had alighted but of other traffic there was next to no sign which made these strange tracks all the more puzzling we came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery and pored over them long our hands on our knees experienced trappers that we knew ourselves to be it was annoying to be brought up suddenly by a beast we could not at once identify dont you know said charlotte rather scornfully thought you knew all the beasts that ever was this put me on my mettle and i hastily rattled off a string of animal names embracing both the arctic and the tropic zones but without much real confidence no said charlotte on consideration they wont any of em quite do seems like something lizardy did you say a iguanodon might be that praps but thats not british and we want a real british beast i think its a dragon t isnt half big enough i objected well all dragons must be small to begin with said charlotte like everything else praps this is a little dragon whos got lost a little dragon would be rather nice to have he might scratch and spit but he couldnt do anything really lets track him down so we set off into the wide snowclad world hand in hand our hearts big with expectation complacently confident that by a few smudgy traces in the snow we were in a fair way to capture a halfgrown specimen of a fabulous beast we ran the monster across the paddock and along the hedge of the next field and then he took to the road like any tame civilized taxpayer here his tracks became blended with and lost among more ordinary footprints but imagination and a fixed idea will do a great deal and we were sure we knew the direction a dragon would naturally take the traces too kept reappearing at intervals at least charlotte maintained they did and as it was her dragon i left the following of the slot to her and trotted along peacefully feeling that it was an expedition anyhow and something was sure to come out of it charlotte took me across another field or two and through a copse and into a fresh road and i began to feel sure it was only her confounded pride that made her go on pretending to see dragontracks instead of owning she was entirely at fault like a reasonable person at last she dragged me excitedly through a gap in a hedge of an obviously private character the waste open world of field and hedge row disappeared and we found ourselves in a garden wellkept secluded most undragonhaunted in appearance once inside i knew where we were this was the garden of my friend the circusman though i had never approached it before by a lawless gap from this unfamiliar side and here was the circusman himself placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the walks i stepped up to him and asked him politely if he had lately seen a beast may i inquire he said with all civility what particular sort of a beast you may happen to be looking for its a lizardy sort of beast i explained charlotte says it s a dragon but she doesnt really know much about beasts the circusman looked round about him slowly i dont think he said that ive seen a dragon in these parts recently but if i come across one ill know it belongs to you and ill have him taken round to you at once thank you very much said charlotte but dont trouble about it please cos praps it isnt a dragon after all only i thought i saw his little footprints in the snow and we followed em up and they seemed to lead right in here but maybe its all a mistake and thank you all the same oh no trouble at all said the circusman cheerfully i should be only too pleased but of course as you say it may be a mistake and its getting dark and he seems to have got away for the present whatever he is youd better come in and have some tea im quite alone and well make a roaring fire and ive got the biggest book of beasts you ever saw its got every beast in the world and all of em coloured and well try and find your beast in it we were always ready for tea at any time and especially when combined with beasts there was marmalade too and apricotjam brought in expressly for us and afterwards the beastbook was spread out and as the man had truly said it contained every sort of beast that had ever been in the world the striking of six oclock set the more prudent charlotte nudging me and we recalled ourselves with an effort from beastland and reluctantly stood up to go here i m coming along with you said the circusman i want another pipe and a walkll do me good you neednt talk to me unless you like our spirits rose to their wonted level again the way had seemed so long the outside world so dark and eerie after the bright warm room and the highlycoloured beastbook but a walk with a real man why that was a treat in itself we set off briskly the man in the middle i looked up at him and wondered whether i should ever live to smoke a big pipe with that careless sort of majesty but charlotte whose young mind was not set on tobacco as a possible goal made herself heard from the other side now then she said tell us a story please wont you the man sighed heavily and looked about him i knew it he groaned i knew i should have to tell a story oh why did i leave my pleasant fireside well i will tell you a story only let me think a minute so he thought a minute and then he told us this story long ago might have been hundreds of years ago in a cottage halfway between this village and yonder shoulder with his wife and their little son now the shepherd spent his days and at certain times of the year his nights too up on the wide ocean bosom of the downs with only the sun and the stars and the sheep for company and the friendly chattering world of men and women far out of sight and hearing but his little son when he wasnt helping his father and often when he was as well spent much of his time buried in big volumes that he borrowed from the affable gentry and interested parsons of the country round about and his parents were very fond of him and rather proud of him too though they didnt let on in his hearing so he was left to go his own way and read as much as he liked and instead of frequently getting a cuff on the side of the head as might very well have happened to him he was treated more or less as an equal by his parents who sensibly thought it a very fair division of labour that they should supply the practical knowledge and he the booklearning they knew that booklearning often came in useful at a pinch in spite of what their neighbours said what the boy chiefly dabbled in was natural history and fairytales and he just took them as they came in a sandwichy sort of way without making any distinctions and really his course of reading strikes one as rather sensible one evening the shepherd who for some nights past had been disturbed and preoccupied and off his usual mental balance came home all of a tremble and sitting down at the table where his wife and son were peacefully employed she with her seam he in following out the adventures of the giant with no heart in his body exclaimed with much agitation its all up with me maria never no more can i go up on them there downs was it ever so now dont you take on like that said his wife who was a very sensible woman but tell us all about it first whatever it is as has given you this shakeup and then me and you and the son here between us we ought to be able to get to the bottom of it it began some nights ago said the shepherd you know that cave up there i never liked it somehow and the sheep never liked it neither and when sheep dont like a thing theres generally some reason for it well for some time past theres been faint noises coming from that cave noises like heavy sighings with grunts mixed up in them and sometimes a snoring far away down real snoring yet somehow not honest snoring like you and me onights you know i know remarked the boy quietly of course i was terrible frightened the shepherd went on yet somehow i couldnt keep away so this very evening before i come down i took a cast round by the cave quietly and there o lord there i saw him at last as plain as i see you saw who said his wife beginning to share in her husbands nervous terror why him i m a telling you said the shepherd he was sticking halfway out of the cave and seemed to be enjoying of the cool of the evening in a poetical sort of way he was as big as four carthorses and all covered with shiny scales deepblue scales at the top of him shading off to a tender sort o green below as he breathed there was that sort of flicker over his nostrils that you see over our chalk roads on a baking windless day in summer he had his chin on his paws and i should say he was meditating about things oh yes a peaceable sort o beast enough and not ramping or carrying on or doing anything but what was quite right and proper i admit all that and yet what am i to do scales you know and claws and a tail for certain though i didnt see that end of him i aint used to em and i dont hold with em and that s a fact the boy who had apparently been absorbed in his book during his father s recital now closed the volume yawned clasped his hands behind his head and said sleepily its all right father dont you worry its only a dragon only a dragon cried his father what do you mean sitting there you and your dragons only a dragon indeed and what do you know about it cos it is and cos i do know replied the boy quietly look here father you know weve each of us got our line you know about sheep and weather and things i know about dragons i always said you know that that cave up there was a dragon cave i always said it must have belonged to a dragon some time and ought to belong to a dragon now if rules count for anything well now you tell me it has got a dragon and so thats all right im not half as much surprised as when you told me it hadnt got a dragon rules always come right if you wait quietly now please just leave this all to me and ill stroll up tomorrow morning no in the morning i cant ive got a whole heap of things to do well perhaps in the evening if im quite free ill go up and have a talk to him and youll find itll be all right only please dont you go worrying round there without me you dont understand em a bit and theyre very sensitive you know hes quite right father said the sensible mother as he says dragons is his line and not ours hes wonderful knowing about bookbeasts as every one allows and to tell the truth im not half happy in my own mind thinking of that poor animal lying alone up there without a bit o hot supper or anyone to change the news with and maybe well be able to do something for him and if he aint quite respectable our boyll find it out quick enough hes got a pleasant sort o way with him that makes everybody tell him everything next day after hed had his tea the boy strolled up the chalky track that led to the summit of the downs and there sure enough he found the dragon stretched lazily on the sward in front of his cave the view from that point was a magnificent one to the right and left the bare and billowy leagues of downs in front the vale with its clustered homesteads its threads of white roads running through orchards and welltilled acreage and far away a hint of grey old cities on the horizon a cool breeze played over the surface of the grass and the silver shoulder of a large moon was showing above distant junipers no wonder the dragon seemed in a peaceful and contented mood indeed as the boy approached he could hear the beast purring with a happy regularity well we live and learn he said to himself none of my books ever told me that dragons purred hullo dragon said the boy quietly when he had got up to him the dragon on hearing the approaching footsteps made the beginning of a courteous effort to rise but when he saw it was a boy he set his eyebrows severely now dont you hit me he said or bung stones or squirt water or anything i wont have it i tell you not goin to hit you said the boy wearily dropping on the grass beside the beast and dont for goodness sake keep on saying dont i hear so much of it and its monotonous and makes me tired ive simply looked in to ask you how you were and all that sort of thing but if im in the way i can easily clear out ive lots of friends and no one can say im in the habit of shoving myself in where im not wanted no no dont go off in a huff said the dragon hastily fact is i m as happy up here as the days long never without an occupation dear fellow never without an occupation and yet between ourselves it is a trifle dull at times the boy bit off a stalk of grass and chewed it going to make a long stay here he asked politely cant hardly say at present replied the dragon it seems a nice place enough but ive only been here a short time and one must look about and reflect and consider before settling down its rather a serious thing settling down besides now i m going to tell you something youd never guess it if you tried ever so fact is im such a confoundedly lazy beggar you surprise me said the boy civilly its the sad truth the dragon went on settling down between his paws and evidently delighted to have found a listener at last and i fancy thats really how i came to be here you see all the other fellows were so active and earnest and all that sort of thing always rampaging and skirmishing and scouring the desert sands and pacing the margin of the sea and chasing knights all over the place and devouring damsels and going on generally whereas i liked to get my meals regular and then to prop my back against a bit of rock and snooze a bit and wake up and think of things going on and how they kept going on just the same you know so when it happened i got fairly caught when what happened please asked the boy thats just what i dont precisely know said the dragon i suppose the earth sneezed or shook itself or the bottom dropped out of something anyhow there was a shake and a roar and a general stramash and i found myself miles away underground and wedged in as tight as tight well thank goodness my wants are few and at any rate i had peace and quietness and wasnt always being asked to come along and do something and ive got such an active mind always occupied i assure you but time went on and there was a certain sameness about the life and at last i began to think it would be fun to work my way upstairs and see what you other fellows were doing so i scratched and burrowed and worked this way and that way and at last i came out through this cave here and i like the country and the view and the people what ive seen of em and on the whole i feel inclined to settle down here whats your mind always occupied about asked the boy thats what i want to know the dragon coloured slightly and looked away presently he said bashfully did you ever just for fun try to make up poetry verses you know course i have said the boy heaps of it and some of its quite good i feel sure only theres no one here cares about it mothers very kind and all that when i read it to her and sos father for that matter but somehow they dont seem to exactly cried the dragon my own case exactly they dont seem to and you cant argue with em about it now youve got culture you have i could tell it on you at once and i should just like your candid opinion about some little things i threw off lightly when i was down there im awfully pleased to have met you and im hoping the other neighbours will be equally agreeable there was a very nice old gentleman up here only last night but he didnt seem to want to intrude that was my father said the boy and he is a nice old gentleman and ill introduce you some day if you like cant you two come up here and dine or something tomorrow asked the dragon eagerly only of course if you ye got nothing better to do he added politely thanks awfully said the boy but we dont go out anywhere without my mother and to tell you the truth i m afraid she mightnt quite approve of you you see theres no getting over the hard fact that youre a dragon is there and when you talk of settling down and the neighbours and so on i cant help feeling that you dont quite realize your position you re an enemy of the human race you see havent got an enemy in the world said the dragon cheerfully too lazy to make em to begin with and if i do read other fellows my poetry im always ready to listen to theirs oh dear cried the boy i wish youd try and grasp the situation properly when the other people find you out theyll come after you with spears and swords and all sorts of things youll have to be exterminated according to their way of looking at it you re a scourge and a pest and a baneful monster not a word of truth in it said the dragon wagging his head solemnly characterll bear the strictest investigation and now theres a little sonnetthing i was working on when you appeared on the scene oh if you wont be sensible cried the boy getting up im going off home no i cant stop for sonnets my mothers sitting up iii look you up tomorrow sometime or other and do for goodness sake try and realize that youre a pestilential scourge or youll find yourself in a most awful fix goodnight the boy found it an easy matter to set the mind of his parents at ease about his new friend they had always left that branch to him and they took his word without a murmur the shepherd was formally introduced and many compliments and kind inquiries were exchanged his wife however though expressing her willingness to do anything she could to mend things or set the cave to rights or cook a little something when the dragon had been poring over sonnets and forgotten his meals as male things will do could not be brought to recognize him formally the fact that he was a dragon and they didnt know who he was seemed to count for everything with her she made no objection however to her little son spending his evenings with the dragon quietly so long as he was home by nine oclock and many a pleasant night they had sitting on the swan while the dragon told stories of old old times when dragons were quite plentiful and the world was a livelier place than it is now and life was full of thrills and jumps and surprises what the boy had feared however soon came to pass the most modest and retiring dragon in the world if hes as big as four carthorses and covered with blue scales cannot keep altogether out of the public view and so in the village tavern of nights the fact that a real live dragon sat brooding in the cave on the downs was naturally a subject for talk though the villagers were extremely frightened they were rather proud as well it was a distinction to have a dragon of your own and it was felt to be a feather in the cap of the village still all were agreed that this sort of thing couldnt be allowed to go on the dreadful beast must be exterminated the countryside must be freed from this pest this terror this destroying scourge the fact that not even a henroost was the worse for the dragons arrival wasnt allowed to have anything to do with it he was a dragon and he couldnt deny it and if he didnt choose to behave as such that was his own lookout but in spite of much valiant talk no hero was found willing to take sword and spear and free the suffering village and win deathless fame and each nights heated discussion always ended in nothing meanwhile the dragon a happy bohemian lolled on the turf enjoyed the sunsets told antediluvian anecdotes to the boy and polished his old verses while meditating on fresh ones one day the boy on walking in to the village found everything wearing a festal appearance which was not to be accounted for in the calendar carpets and gaycoloured stuffs were hung out of the windows the churchbells clamoured noisily the little street was flowerstrewn and the whole population jostled each other along either side of it chattering shoving and ordering each other to stand back the boy saw a friend of his own age in the crowd and hailed whats up he cried is it the players or bears or a circus or what its all right his friend hailed back hes acoming whos acoming demanded the boy thrusting into the throng why st george of course replied his friend hes heard tell of our dragon and hes comm on purpose to slay the deadly beast and free us from his horrid yoke o my wont there be a jolly fight here was news indeed the boy felt that he ought to make quite sure for himself and he wriggled himself in between the legs of his goodnatured elders abusing them all the time for their unmannerly habit of shoving once in the front rank he breathlessly awaited the arrival presently from the faraway end of the line came the sound of cheering next the measured tramp of a great warhorse made his heart beat quicker and then he found himself cheering with the rest as amidst welcoming shouts shrill cries of women uplifting of babies and waving of handkerchiefs st george paced slowly up the street the boys heart stood still and he breathed with sobs the beauty and the grace of the hero were so far beyond anything he had yet seen his fluted armour was inlaid with gold his plumed helmet hung at his saddlebow and his thick fair hair framed a face gracious and gentle beyond expression till you caught the sternness in his eyes he drew rein in front of the little inn and the villagers crowded round with greetings and thanks and voluble statements of their wrongs and grievances and oppressions the boy heard the grave gentle voice of the saint assuring them that all would be well now and that he would stand by them and see them righted and free them from their foe then he dismounted and passed through the doorway and the crowd poured in after him but the boy made off up the hill as fast as he could lay his legs to the ground its all up dragon he shouted as soon as he was within sight of the beast hes coming hes here now youll have to pull yourself together and do something at last the dragon was licking his scales and rubbing them with a bit of houseflannel the boys mother had lent him till he shone like a great turquoise dont be violent boy he said without looking round sit down and get your breath and try and remember that the noun governs the verb and then perhaps youll be good enough to tell me whos coming thats right take it coolly said the boy hope youll be half as cool when ive got through with my news its only st george whos coming thats all he rode into the village halfanhour ago of course you can lick him a great big fellow like you but i thought id warn you cos hes sure to be round early and hes got the longest wickedestlooking spear you ever did see and the boy got up and began to jump round in sheer delight at the prospect of the battle o deary deary me moaned the dragon this is too awful i wont see him and thats flat i dont want to know the fellow at all im sure hes not nice you must tell him to go away at once please say he can write if he likes but i cant give him an interview im not seeing anybody at present now dragon dragon said the boy imploringly dont be perverse and wrongheaded youve got to fight him some time or other you know cos hes st george and youre the dragon better get it over and then we can go on with the sonnets and you ought to consider other people a little too if its been dull up here for you think how dull its been for me my dear little man said the dragon solemnly just understand once for all that i cant fight and i wont fight ive never fought in my life and im not going to begin now just to give you a roman holiday in old days i always let the other fellows the earnest fellows do all the fighting and no doubt thats why i have the pleasure of being here now but if you dont fight hell cut your head off gasped the boy miserable at the prospect of losing both his fight and his friend oh i think not said the dragon in his lazy way youll be able to arrange something ive every confidence in you youre such a manager just run down theres a dear chap and make it all right i leave it entirely to you the boy made his way back to the village in a state of great despondency first of all there wasnt going to be any fight next his dear and honoured friend the dragon hadnt shown up in quite such a heroic light as he would have liked and lastly whether the dragon was a hero at heart or not it made no difference for st george would most undoubtedly cut his head off arrange things indeed he said bitterly to himself the dragon treats the whole affair as if it was an invitation to tea and croquet the villagers were straggling homewards as he passed up the street all of them in the highest spirits and gleefully discussing the splendid fight that was in store the boy pursued his way to the inn and passed into the principal chamber where st george now sat alone musing over the chances of the fight and the sad stories of rapine and of wrong that had so lately been poured into his sympathetic ear may i come in st george said the boy politely as he paused at the door i want to talk to you about this little matter of the dragon if youre not tired of it by this time yes come in boy said the saint kindly another tale of misery and wrong i fear me is it a kind parent then of whom the tyrant has bereft you or some tender sister or brother well it shall soon be avenged nothing of the sort said the boy theres a misunderstanding somewhere and i want to put it right the fact is this is a good dragon exactly said st george smiling pleasantly i quite understand a good dragon believe me i do not in the least regret that he is an adversary worthy of my steel and no feeble specimen of his noxious tribe but hes not a noxious tribe cried the boy distressedly oh dear oh dear how stupid men are when they get an idea into their heads i tell you hes a good dragon and a friend of mine and tells me the most beautiful stories you ever heard all about old times and when he was little and hes been so kind to mother and motherd do anything for him and father likes him too though father doesnt hold with art and poetry much and always falls asleep when the dragon starts talking about style but the fact is nobody can help liking him when once they know him hes so engaging and so trustful and as simple as a child sit down and draw your chair up said st george i like a fellow who sticks up for his friends and im sure the dragon has his good points if hes got a friend like you but thats not the question all this evening ive been listening with grief and anguish unspeakable to tales of murder theft and wrong rather too highly coloured perhaps not always quite convincing but forming in the main a most serious roll of crime history teaches us that the greatest rascals often possess all the domestic virtues and i fear that your cultivated friend in spite of the qualities which have won and rightly your regard has got to be speedily exterminated oh youve been taking in all the yarns those fellows have been telling you said the boy impatiently why our villagers are the biggest storytellers in all the country round its a known fact youre a stranger in these parts or else youd have heard it already all they want is a fight theyre the most awful beggars for getting up fights it s meat and drink to them dogs bulls dragons anything so long as its a fight why theyve got a poor innocent badger in the stable behind here at this moment they were going to have some fun with him today but theyre saving him up now till your little affairs over and ive no doubt theyve been telling you what a hero you were and how you were bound to win in the cause of right and justice and so on but let me tell you i came down the street just now and they were betting six to four on the dragon freely six to four on the dragon murmured st george sadly resting his cheek on his hand this is an evil world and sometimes i begin to think that all the wickedness in it is not entirely bottled up inside the dragons and yet may not this wily beast have misled you as to his real character in order that your good report of him may serve as a cloak for his evil deeds nay may there not be at this very moment some hapless princess immured within yonder gloomy cavern the moment he had spoken st george was sorry for what he had said the boy looked so genuinely distressed i assure you st george he said earnestly theres nothing of the sort in the cave at all the dragons a real gentleman every inch of him and i may say that no one would be more shocked and grieved than he would at hearing you talk in that that loose way about matters on which he has very strong views well perhaps ive been overcredulous said st george perhaps ive misjudged the animal but what are we to do here are the dragon and i almost face to face each supposed to be thirsting for each others blood i dont see any way out of it exactly what do you suggest cant you arrange things somehow thats just what the dragon said replied the boy rather nettled really the way you two seem to leave everything to me i suppose you couldnt be persuaded to go away quietly could you impossible i fear said the saint quite against the rules you know that as well as i do well then look here said the boy its early yet would you mind strolling up with me and seeing the dragon and talking it over its not far and any friend of mine will be most welcome well its irregular said st george rising but really it seems about the most sensible thing to do youre taking a lot of trouble on your friends account he added goodnaturedly as they passed out through the door together but cheer up perhaps there wont have to be any fight after all oh but i hope there will though replied the little fellow wistfully ive brought a friend to see you dragon said the boy rather loud the dragon woke up with a start i was just er thinking about things he said in his simple way very pleased to make your acquaintance sir charming weather were having this is st george said the boy shortly st george let me introduce you to the dragon weve come up to talk things over quietly dragon and now for goodness sake do let us have a little straight commonsense and come to some practical businesslike arrangement for im sick of views and theories of life and personal tendencies and all that sort of thing i may perhaps add that my mothers sitting up so glad to meet you st george began the dragon rather nervously because youve been a great traveller i hear and ive always been rather a stayathome but i can show you many antiquities many interesting features of our countryside if youre stopping here any time i think said st george in his frank pleasant way that wed really better take the advice of our young friend here and try to come to some understanding on a business footing about this little affair of ours now dont you think that after all the simplest plan would be just to fight it out according to the rules and let the best man win theyre betting on you i may tell you down in the village but i dont mind that oh yes do dragon said the boy delightedly itll save such a lot of bother my young friend you shut up said the dragon severely believe me st george he went on theres nobody in the world id sooner oblige than you and this young gentleman here but the whole things nonsense and conventionality and popular thickheadedness theres absolutely nothing to fight about from beginning to end and anyhow im not going to so that settles it but supposing i make you said st george rather nettled you cant said the dragon triumphantly i should only go into my cave and retire for a time down the hole i came up youd soon get heartily sick of sitting outside and waiting for me to come out and fight you and as soon as youd really gone away why id come up again gaily for i tell you frankly i like this place and im going to stay here st george gazed for a while on the fair landscape around them but this would be a beautiful place for a fight he began again persuasively these great bare rolling downs for the arena and me in my golden armour showing up against your big blue scaly coils think what a picture it would make now youre trying to get at me through my artistic sensibilities said the dragon but it wont work not but what it would make a very pretty picture as you say he added wavering a little we seem to be getting rather nearer to business put in the boy you must see dragon that there s got to be a fight of some sort cos you cant want to have to go down that dirty old hole again and stop there till goodness knows when it might be arranged said st george thoughtfully i must spear you somewhere of course but im not bound to hurt you very much theres such a lot of you that there must be a few spare places somewhere here for instance just behind your foreleg it couldnt hurt you much just here now you re tickling george said the dragon coyly no that place wont do at all even if it didnt hurt and im sure it would awfully it would make me laugh and that would spoil everything lets try somewhere else then said st george patiently under your neck for instance all these folds of thick skin if i speared you here you d never even know i d done it yes but are you sure you can hit off the right place asked the dragon anxiously of course i am said st george with confidence you leave that to me its just because ive got to leave it to you that im asking replied the dragon rather testily no doubt you would deeply regret any error you might make in the hurry of the moment but you wouldnt regret it half as much as i should however i suppose weve got to trust somebody as we go through life and your plan seems on the whole as good a one as any look here dragon interrupted the boy a little jealous on behalf of his friend who seemed to be getting all the worst of the bargain i dont quite see where you come in theres to be a fight apparently and youre to be licked and what i want to know is what are you going to get out of it st george said the dragon just tell him please what will happen after im vanquished in the deadly combat well according to the rules i suppose i shall lead you in triumph down to the marketplace or whatever answers to it said st george precisely said the dragon and then and then therell be shoutings and speeches and things continued st george and i shall explain that youre converted and see the error of your ways and so on quite so said the dragon and then oh and then said st george why and then there will be the usual banquet i suppose exactly said the dragon and thats where i come in look here he continued addressing the boy im bored to death up here and no one really appreciates me im going into society i am through the kindly aid of our friend here whos taking such a lot of trouble on my account and youll find ive got all the qualities to endear me to people who entertain so now thats all settled and if you dont mind i m an oldfashioned fellow dont want to turn you out but remember youll have to do your proper share of the fighting dragon said st george as he took the hint and rose to go i mean ramping and breathing fire and so on i can ramp all right replied the dragon confidently as to breathing fire its surprising how easily one gets out of practice but ill do the best i can goodnight they had descended the hill and were almost back in the village again when st george stopped short knew i had forgotten something he said there ought to be a princess terror stricken and chained to a rock and all that sort of thing boy cant you arrange a princess the boy was in the middle of a tremendous yawn im tired to death he wailed and i cant arrange a princess or anything more at this time of night and my mothers sitting up and do stop asking me to arrange more things till tomorrow next morning the people began streaming up to the downs at quite an early hour in their sunday clothes and carrying baskets with bottlenecks sticking out of them every one intent on securing good places for the combat this was not exactly a simple matter for of course it was quite possible that the dragon might win and in that case even those who had put their money on him felt they could hardly expect him to deal with his backers on a different footing to the rest places were chosen therefore with circumspection and with a view to a speedy retreat in case of emergency and the front rank was mostly composed of boys who had escaped from parental control and now sprawled and rolled about on the grass regardless of the shrill threats and warnings discharged at them by their anxious mothers behind the boy had secured a good front place well up towards the cave and was feeling as anxious as a stagemanager on a first night could the dragon be depended upon he might change his mind and vote the whole performance rot or else seeing that the affair had been so hastily planned without even a rehearsal he might be too nervous to show up the boy looked narrowly at the cave but it showed no sign of life or occupation could the dragon have made a moonlight flitting the higher portions of the ground were now black with sightseers and presently a sound of cheering and a waving of handkerchiefs told that something was visible to them which the boy far up towards the dragonend of the line as he was could not yet see a minute more and st georges red plumes topped the hill as the saint rode slowly forth on the great level space which stretched up to the grim mouth of the cave very gallant and beautiful he looked on his tall warhorse his golden armour glancing in the sun his great spear held erect the little white pennon crimsoncrossed fluttering at its point he drew rein and remained motionless the lines of spectators began to give back a little nervously and even the boys in front stopped pulling hair and cuffing each other and leaned forward expectant now then dragon muttered the boy impatiently fidgeting where he sat he need not have distressed himself had he only known the dramatic possibilities of the thing had tickled the dragon immensely and he had been up from an early hour preparing for his first public appearance with as much heartiness as if the years had run backwards and he had been again a little dragonlet playing with his sisters on the floor of their mothers cave at the game of saintsanddragons in which the dragon was bound to win a low muttering mingled with snorts now made itself heard rising to a bellowing roar that seemed to fill the plain then a cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the cave and out of the midst of it the dragon himself shining seablue magnificent pranced splendidly forth and everybody said oooooo as if he had been a mighty rocket his scales were glittering his long spiky tail lashed his sides his claws tore up the turf and sent it flying high over his back and smoke and fire incessantly jetted from his angry nostrils oh well done dragon cried the boy excitedly didnt think he had it in him he added to himself st george lowered his spear bent his head dug his heels into his horses sides and came thundering over the turf the dragon charged with a roar and a squeal a great blue whirling combination of coils and snorts and clashing jaws and spikes and fire missed yelled the crowd there was a moments entanglement of golden armour and bluegreen coils and spiky tail and then the great horse tearing at his bit carried the saint his spear swung high in the air almost up to the mouth of the cave the dragon sat down and barked viciously while st george with difficulty pulled his horse round into position end of round one thought the boy how well they managed it but i hope the saint wont get excited i can trust the dragon all right what a regular playactor the fellow is st george had at last prevailed on his horse to stand steady and was looking round him as he wiped his brow catching sight of the boy he smiled and nodded and held up three fingers for an instant it seems to be all planned out said the boy to himself round three is to be the finishing one evidently wish it could have lasted a bit longer whatevers that old fool of a dragon up to now the dragon was employing the interval in giving a ramping performance for the benefit of the crowd ramping it should be explained consists in running round and round in a wide circle and sending waves and ripples of movement along the whole length of your spine from your pointed ears right down to the spike at the end of your long tail when you are covered with blue scales the effect is particularly pleasing and the boy recollected the dragons recently expressed wish to become a social success st george now gathered up his reins and began to move forward dropping the point of his spear and settling himself firmly in the saddle time yelled everybody excitedly and the dragon leaving off his ramping sat up on end and began to leap from one side to the other with huge ungainly bounds whooping like a red indian this naturally disconcerted the horse who swerved violently the saint only just saving himself by the mane and as they shot past the dragon delivered a vicious snap at the horses tail which sent the poor beast careering madly far over the downs so that the language of the saint who had lost a stirrup was fortunately inaudible to the general assemblage round two evoked audible evidence of friendly feeling towards the dragon the spectators were not slow to appreciate a combatant who could hold his own so well and clearly wanted to show good sport and many encouraging remarks reached the ears of our friend as he strutted to and fro his chest thrust out and his tail in the air hugely enjoying his new popularity st george had dismounted and was tightening his girths and telling his horse with quite an oriental flow of imagery exactly what he thought of him and his relations and his conduct on the present occasion so the boy made his way down to the saints end of the line and held his spear for him its been a jolly fight st george he said with a sigh cant you let it last a bit longer well i think id better not replied the saint the fact is your simpleminded old friends getting conceited now theyve begun cheering him and hell forget all about the arrangement and take to playing the fool and theres no telling where he would stop ill just finish him off this round he swung himself into the saddle and took his spear from the boy now dont you be afraid he added kindly ive marked my spot exactly and hes sure to give me all the assistance in his power because he knows its his only chance of being asked to the banquet st george now shortened his spear bringing the butt well up under his arm and instead of galloping as before trotted smartly towards the dragon who crouched at his approach flicking his tail till it cracked in the air like a great cartwhip the saint wheeled as he neared his opponent and circled warily round him keeping his eye on the spare place while the dragon adopting similar tactics paced with caution round the same circle occasionally feinting with his head so the two sparred for an opening while the spectators maintained a breathless silence though the round lasted for some minutes the end was so swift that all the boy saw was a lightning movement of the saints arm and then a whirl and a confusion of spines claws tail and flying bits of turf the dust cleared away the spectators whooped and ran in cheering and the boy made out that the dragon was down pinned to the earth by the spear while st george had dismounted and stood astride of him it all seemed so genuine that the boy ran in breathlessly hoping the dear old dragon wasnt really hurt as he approached the dragon lifted one large eyelid winked solemnly and collapsed again he was held fast to earth by the neck but the saint had hit him in the spare place agreed upon and it didnt even seem to tickle baint you goin to cut is ed orf master asked one of the applauding crowd he had backed the dragon and naturally felt a trifle sore well not today i think replied st george pleasantly you see that can be done at any time theres no hurry at all i think well all go down to the village first and have some refreshment and then ill give him a good talkingto and youll find hell be a very different dragon at that magic word refreshment the whole crowd formed up in procession and silently awaited the signal to start the time for talking and cheering and betting was past the hour for action had arrived st george hauling on his spear with both hands released the dragon who rose and shook himself and ran his eye over his spikes and scales and things to see that they were all in order then the saint mounted and led off the procession the dragon following meekly in the company of the boy while the thirsty spectators kept at a respectful interval behind there were great doings when they got down to the village again and had formed up in front of the inn after refreshment st george made a speech in which he informed his audience that he had removed their direful scourge at a great deal of trouble and inconvenience to himself and now they werent to go about grumbling and fancying theyd got grievances because they hadnt and they shouldnt be so fond of fights because next time they might have to do the fighting themselves which would not be the same thing at all and there was a certain badger in the inn stables which had got to be released at once and hed come and see it done himself then he told them that the dragon had been thinking over things and saw that there were two sides to every question and he wasnt going to do it any more and if they were good perhaps hed stay and settle down there so they must make friends and not be prejudiced and go about fancying they knew everything there was to be known because they didnt not by a long way and he warned them against the sin of romancing and making up stories and fancying other people would believe them just because they were plausible and highly coloured then he sat down amidst much repentant cheering and the dragon nudged the boy in the ribs and whispered that he couldnt have done it better himself then every one went off to get ready for the banquet banquets are always pleasant things consisting mostly as they do of eating and drinking but the specially nice thing about a banquet is that it comes when somethings over and theres nothing more to worry about and tomorrow seems a long way off st george was happy because there had been a fight and he hadnt had to kill anybody for he didnt really like killing though he generally had to do it the dragon was happy because there had been a fight and so far from being hurt in it he had won popularity and a sure footing in society the boy was happy because there had been a fight and in spite of it all his two friends were on the best of terms and all the others were happy because there had been a fight and well they didnt require any other reasons for their happiness the dragon exerted himself to say the right thing to everybody and proved the life and soul of the evening while the saint and the boy as they looked on felt that they were only assisting at a feast of which the honour and the glory were entirely the dragons but they didnt mind that being good fellows and the dragon was not in the least proud or forgetful on the contrary every ten minutes or so he leant over towards the boy and said impressively look here you will see me home afterwards wont you and the boy always nodded though he had promised his mother not to be out late at last the banquet was over the guests had dropped away with many goodnights and congratulations and invitations and the dragon who had seen the last of them off the premises emerged into the street followed by the boy wiped his brow sighed sat down in the road and gazed at the stars jolly night its been he murmured jolly stars jolly little place this think i shall just stop here dont feel like climbing up any beastly hill boys promised to see me home boy had better do it then no responsibility on my part responsibility all boys and his chin sank on his broad chest and he slumbered peacefully oh get up dragon cried the boy piteously you know my mothers sitting up and i m so tired and you made me promise to see you home and i never knew what it meant or i wouldnt have done it and the boy sat down in the road by the side of the sleeping dragon and cried the door behind them opened a stream of light illumined the road and st george who had come out for a stroll in the cool nightair caught sight of the two figures sitting there the great motionless dragon and the tearful little boy whats the matter boy he inquired kindly stepping to his side oh its this great lumbering pig of a dragon sobbed the boy first he makes me promise to see him home and then he says id better do it and goes to sleep might as well try to see a haystack home and im so tired and mothers here he broke down again now dont take on said st george ill stand by you and well both see him home wake up dragon he said sharply shaking the beast by the elbow the dragon looked up sleepily what a night george he murmured what a now look here dragon said the saint firmly heres this little fellow waiting to see you home and you know he ought to have been in bed these two hours and what his motherll say i dont know and anybody but a selfish pig would have made him go to bed long ago and he shall go to bed cried the dragon starting up poor little chap only fancy his being up at this hour its a shame thats what it is and i dont think st george youve been very considerate but come along at once and dont let us have any more arguing or shillyshallying you give me hold of your hand boy thank you george an arm up the hill is just what i wanted so they set off up the hill arminarm the saint the dragon and the boy the lights in the little village began to go out but there were stars and a late moon as they climbed to the downs together and as they turned the last corner and disappeared from view snatches of an old song were borne back on the nightbreeze i cant be certain which of them was singing but i think it was the dragon here we are at your gate said the man abruptly laying his hand on it goodnight cut along in sharp or youll catch it could it really be our own gate yes there it was sure enough with the familiar marks on its bottom bar made by our feet when we swung on it oh but wait a minute cried charlotte i want to know a heap of things did the dragon really settle down and did there isnt any more of that story said the man kindly but firmly at least not tonight now be off goodbye wonder if its all true said charlotte as we hurried up the path sounded dreadfully like nonsense in parts praps its true for all that i replied encouragingly charlotte bolted in like a rabbit out of the cold and the dark but i lingered a moment in the still frosty air for a backward glance at the silent white world without ere i changed it for the land of firelight and cushions and laughter it was the day for choirpractice and caroltime was at hand and a belated member was passing homewards down the road singing as he went then st george ee made revrence in the stable so dim oo vanquished the dragon so fearful and grim soo grim and soo fierce that now may we say all peaceful is our wakin on chriistmas day the singer receded the carol died away but i wondered with my hand on the doorlatch whether that was the song or something like it that the dragon sang as he toddled contentedly up the hill a departure it is a very fine thing to be a real prince there are points about a pirate chief and to succeed to the captaincy of a robber band is a truly magnificent thing but to be an heir has also about it something extremely captivating not only a longlost heir an heir of the melodrama strutting into your hitherto unsuspected kingdom at just the right moment loaded up with the consciousness of unguessed merit and of rights so long feloniously withheld but even to be a common humdrum domestic heir is a profession to which few would refuse to be apprenticed to step from leadingstrings and restrictions and one glass of port after dinner into property and liberty and due appreciation saved up polished and varnished dusted and laid in lavender all expressly for you why even the princedom and the robber captaincy when their anxieties and responsibilities are considered have hardly more to offer and so it will continue to be a problem to the youth in whom ambition struggles with a certain sensuous appreciation of lifes sidedishes whether the career he is called upon to select out of the glittering knickknacks that strew the counter had better be that of an heir or an enginedriver in the case of eldest sons this problem has a way of solving itself in childhood however the actual heirship is apt to work on the principle of the boroughenglish of our happier ancestors and in most cases of inheritance it is the youngest that succeeds where the res is angusta and the weekly books are simply a series of stiff hurdles at each of which in succession the paternal legs falter with growing suspicion of their powers to clear the flight it is in the affair of clothes that the right of succession tells and the hard heir strides about the land in trousers long ago framed for fraternal limbs frondes novas et non sua poma a bitter thing indeed of those pretty silken threads that knit humanity together high and low past and present none is tougher more pervading or more iridescent than the honest simple pleasure of new clothes it tugs at the man as it tugs at the woman the smirk of the wellfitted prince is no different from the smirk of the sunday clad peasant and the veins of the elders tingle with the same thrill that sets their freshfrocked grandchildren skipping never trust people who pretend that they have no joy in their new clothes let not our souls be wrung however at contemplation of the luckless urchin cut off by parental penury from the rapture of new clothes just as the heroes of his dreams are his immediate seniors so his heroes clothes share the glamour and the reversion of them carries a high privilege a special thing not sold by swears and wells the sword of galahad and of many another hero arrived on the scene already hoary with history and the boy rather prefers his trousers to be legendary famous haloed by his heros renown even though the nap may have altogether vanished in the process but putting clothes aside there are other matters in which this reversed heirship comes into play take the case of toys it is hardly right or fitting and in this the child quite acquiesces that as he approaches the reverend period of nine or say ten years he should still be the unabashed and proclaimed possessor of a hoop and a noahs ark the child will quite see the reasonableness of this and the goal of his ambition being now a catapult a pistol or even a swordstick will be satisfied that the titular ownership should lapse to his juniors so far below him in their kilted or petticoated incompetence after all the things are still there and if relapses of spirit occur on wet afternoons one can still nominally borrow them and be happy on the floor as of old without the reproach of being a habitual baby toycaresser also one can pretend its being done to amuse the younger ones none of us therefore grumbled when in the natural course of things the nominal ownership of the toys slipped down to harold and from him in turn devolved upon charlotte the toys were still there they always had been there and always would be there and when the nursery door was fast shut there were no kings or queens or first estates in that small republic on the floor charlotte to be sure chintilted at last an owner of real estate might patronize a little at times but it was tacitly understood that her title was only a drawingroom one why does a coming bereavement project no thin faint voice no shadow of its woe to warn its happy heedless victims why cannot olympians ever think it worth while to give some hint of the thunderbolts they are silently forging and why oh why did it never enter any of our thick heads that the day would come when even charlotte would be considered too matronly for toys ones socalled education is hammered into one with rulers and with canes each fresh grammar or musical instrument each new historical period or quaint arithmetical rule is impressed on one by some painful physical prelude why does time the biggest schoolmaster alone neglect premonitory raps at each stage of his curriculum on our knuckles or our heads uncle thomas was at the bottom of it this was not the first mine he had exploded under our bows in his favourite pursuit of fads he had passed in turn from psychical research to the white rose and thence to a childrens hospital and we were being daily inundated with leaflets headed by a woodcut depicting little annie of poplar sitting up in her little white cot surrounded by the toys of the nice kind rich children the idea caught on with the olympians always open to sentiment of a treacly woodcut order and accordingly charlotte on entering one day dishevelled and panting having been pursued by yelling redskins up to the very threshold of our peaceful home was curtly informed that her french lessons would begin on monday that she was henceforth to cease all pretence of being a trapper or a redskin on utterly inadequate grounds and moreover that the whole of her toys were at that moment being finally packed up in a box for despatch to london to gladden the lives and bring light into the eyes of london waifs and poplar annies naturally enough perhaps we others received no official intimation of this grave cession of territory we were not supposed to be interested harold had long ago been promoted to a knife a recognized birthday knife as for me it was known that i was already given over heart and soul to lawless abandoned catapults catapults which were confiscated weekly for reasons of international complications but with which edward kept me steadily supplied his school having a fine old tradition for excellence in their manufacture therefore no one was supposed to be really affected but charlotte and even she had already reached miss yonge and should therefore have been more interested in prolific curates and harrowing deathbeds notwithstanding we all felt indignant betrayed and sullen to the verge of mutiny though for long we had affected to despise them these toys yet they had grown up with us shared our joys and our sorrows seen us at our worst and become part of the accepted scheme of existence as we gazed at untenanted shelves and empty hatefully tidy corners perhaps for the first time for long we began to do them a tardy justice there was old leotard for instance somehow he had come to be sadly neglected of late years and yet how exactly he always responded to certain moods he was an acrobat this leotard who lived in a glassfronted box his loosejointed limbs were cardboard cardboard his slender trunk and his hands eternally grasped the bar of a trapeze you turned the box round swiftly five or six times the wonderful unsolved machinery worked and leotard swung and leapt backwards forwards now astride the bar now flying free ironjointed supplesinewed unceasingly novel in his invention of new unguessable attitudes while above below and around him a richlydressed audience painted in skilful perspective of stalls boxes dresscircle and gallery watched the thrilling performance with a stolidity which seemed to mark them out as made in germany hardly versatile enough perhaps this leotard unsympathetic not a companion for all hours nor would you have chosen him to take to bed with you and yet within his own limits how fresh how engrossing how resourceful and inventive well he was gone it seemed merely gone never specially cherished while he tarried with us he had yet contrived to build himself a particular niche of his own sunrise and sunset and the dinnerbell and the sudden rainbow and lessons and leotard and the moon through the nursery windows they were all part of the great order of things and the displacement of any one item seemed to disorganize the whole machinery the immediate point was not that the world would continue to go round as of old but that leotard wouldnt yonder corner now swept and garnished had been the stall wherein the spotty horse at the close of each laborious day was accustomed to doze peacefully the long night through in days of old each of us in turn had been jerked thrillingly round the room on his precarious back had dug our heels into his unyielding sides and had scratched our hands on the tin tacks that secured his mane to his stifflycurving neck later with increasing stature we came to overlook his merits as a beast of burden but how frankly how goodnaturedly he had recognized the new conditions and adapted himself to them without a murmur when the military spirit was abroad who so ready to be a squadron of cavalry a horde of cossacks or artillery pounding into position he had even served with honour as a gunboat during a period when naval strategy was the only theme and no false equine pride ever hindered him from taking the part of a roaring locomotive earthshaking clangorous annihilating time and space really it was no longer clear how life with its manifold emergencies was to be carried on at all without a fellow like the spotty horse ready to step in at critical moments and take up just the part required of him in moments of mental depression nothing is quite so consoling as the honest smell of a painted animal and mechanically i turned towards the shelf that had been so long the ararat of our weatherbeaten ark the shelf was empty the ark had cast off moorings and sailed away to poplar and had taken with it its haunting smell
