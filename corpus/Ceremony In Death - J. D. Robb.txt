 chapter one death surrounded her she faced it daily dreamed of it nightly lived with it always she knew its sounds its scents even its texture she could look it in its dark and clever eye without a flinch death was a tricky foe she knew one flinch one blink and it could shift it could change it could win ten years as a cop hadnt hardened her toward it a decade on the force hadnt made her accept it when she looked death in the eye it was with the cold steel of the warrior eve dallas looked at death now and she looked at one of her own frank wojinski had been a good cop solid some would have said plodding hed been affable she remembered a man who hadnt complained about the bilge disguised as food at the nypsd eatery or the eyesearing paperwork the job generated or eve thought about the fact that hed been sixtytwo and had never made it past the rank of detective sergeant hed been on the pudgy side and had let his hair gray and thin naturally it was a rare thing in for a man to bypass body sculpting and enhancements now in his clearsided view casket with its single spray of mournful lilies he resembled a peacefully sleeping monk from an earlier time hed been born in an earlier time eve mused coming into the world at the end of one millennium and living his life in the next hed been through the urban wars but hadnt talked of them as so many of the older cops did frank hadnt been one for war stories she recalled he was more likely to pass around the latest snapshot or hologram of his children and grandchildren he liked to tell bad jokes talk sports and had a weakness for soydogs with spiced pickle relish a family man she thought one who left behind great grief indeed she could think of no one who had known frank wojinski who hadnt loved him he had died with half his life still ahead of him died alone when the heart everyone had thought so huge and so strong had just stopped goddamn it eve turned laid a hand on the arm of the man who stepped up beside her im sorry feeney he shook his head his droopy camels eyes filled with misery with one hand he raked through his wiry red hair on the job would have been easier i could handle line of duty but to just stop to just check out in his easy chair watching arena ball on the screen its not right dallas a mans not supposed to stop living at his age i know not knowing what else to do eve draped an arm over his shoulder and steered him away he trained me looked after me when i was a rookie never let me down pain radiated through him and glinted dully in his eyes wavered in his voice frank never let anyone down in his life i know she said again because there was nothing else that could be said she was accustomed to feeney being tough and strong the delicacy of his grief worried her she led him through the mourners the viewing room was packed with cops as well as family and where there were cops and death there was coffee or what passed for it at such places she poured a cup handed it to him i cant get around it i cant get a hold of it he let out a long uneven breath he was a sturdy compact man who wore his grief as openly as he wore his rumpled coat i havent talked to sally yet my wifes with her i just cant do it its all right i havent talked to her either since she had nothing to do with her hands eve poured a cup for herself that she didnt intend to drink everybodys shook up by this i didnt know he had a heart problem nobody did feeney said quietly nobody knew she kept a hand on his shoulder as she scanned the overcrowded overwarm room when a fellow officer went down in the line of duty cops could be angry they could be focused fix their target but when death snuck in and crooked a capricious finger there was no one to blame and no one to punish it was helplessness she felt in the room and that she felt in herself you couldnt raise your weapon to fate or your fist the funeral director spiffy in his traditional black suit and as waxyfaced as one of his own clients worked the room with patting hands and sober eyes eve thought shed rather have a corpse sit up and grin at her than listen to his platitudes why dont we go talk to the family together it was hard for him but feeney nodded set the untouched coffee aside he liked you dallas that kids got balls of steel and a mind to match he used to tell me he always said if he was ever jammed youd be the one hed want guarding his back it surprised and pleased her and it simultaneously added to her sorrow i didnt realize he thought of me that way feeney looked at her she had an interesting face not one hed have called a heartstopper but it usually made a man look twice with its angles and sharp bones the shallow dent in the chin she had cops eyes intense and measuring and he often forgot they were a dark golden brown her hair was the same shade cut short and badly in need of some shaping she was tall and lean and toughbodied he remembered it had been less than a month since he had come across her battered and bloodied but her weapon had been firm in her hand he thought of you that way so do i while she blinked at him feeney squared his hunched shoulders lets talk to sally and the kids they slipped through the crowd jammed together in a room oppressed with dark simulated wood heavy red draperies and the funereal smell of too many flowers crammed into too small a space eve wondered why viewings of the dead were always accompanied by flowers and draping sheets of red what ancient ceremony did it spring from and why did the human race continue to cling to it she was certain that when her time came she wouldnt choose to be laid out for study by her loved ones and associates in an overheated room where the pervasive scent of flowers was reminiscent of rot then she saw sally supported by her children and her childrens children and realized such rites were for the living the dead were beyond caring ryan sally held out her hands small almost fairylike hands and lifted her cheek to feeneys she held there a moment her eyes closed her face pale and quiet she was a slim softspoken woman who eve had always thought of as delicate yet a cops spouse who had survived the stress of the job for more than forty years had to have steel against her plain black dress she wore her husbands twentyfiveyear nypsd ring on a chain another rite eve thought another symbol im so glad youre here sally murmured ill miss him well all miss him feeney patted her back awkwardly before drawing away grief was in his throat choking him swallowing it only lodged it cold and heavy in his gut you know if theres anything i know her lips curved slightly and she gave his hand a quick and comforting squeeze before turning to eve i appreciate you coming dallas he was a good man a solid cop yes he was recognizing it as high tribute sally managed a smile he was proud to serve and protect commander whitney and his wife are here and chief tibble and so many others her gaze drifted blindly around the room so many he mattered frank mattered of course he did sally feeney shifted from foot to foot you ah know about the survivors fund she smiled again patted his hand were fine there dont worry dallas i dont think you really know my family lieutenant dallas my daughter brenda short with rounded curves eve noted as they clasped hands dark hair and eyes a bit heavy in the chin took after her father my son curtis slim small boned soft hands eyes that were dry but dazed with grief my grandchildren there were five of them the youngest a boy of about eight with a pug nose dashed with freckles he eyed eve consideringly how come youve got your zapper on flustered eve tugged her jacket over her side arm i came straight from cop central i didnt have time to go home and change pete curtis shot eve an apologetic wince dont bother the lieutenant if people concentrated more on their personal and spiritual powers weapons would be unnecessary im alice a slim blonde in black stepped forward shed have been a stunner in any case eve mused but having sprung from such basic stock she was dazzling her eyes were a soft dreamy blue her mouth full and lush and unpainted she wore her hair loose so that it rained straight and glossy over the shoulders of her flowing black dress a thin silver chain fell to her waist at the end of it was a black stone ringed in silver alice youre such a zip head she flicked a cool glance over her shoulder toward a boy of about sixteen but her hands kept fluttering back to the black stone like elegant birds guarding a nest my brother jamie she said in a silky voice he still thinks namecalling deserves a reaction my grandfather spoke of you lieutenant dallas im flattered your husband isnt with you tonight eve arched a brow not just grief she deduced but nerves it was easy enough to recognize signals as well but they werent clear the girl was after something she mused but what no hes not she shifted her gaze back to sally he sends his sympathies mrs wojinski hes off planet it must take a great deal of concentration and energy alice interrupted to maintain a relationship with a man like roarke while pursuing a demanding difficult even dangerous career my grandfather used to say that once you had a grip on an investigation you never let go would you say thats accurate lieutenant if you let go you lose i dont like to lose she held alices odd gaze for a moment then on impulse crouched down and whispered to pete when i was a rookie i saw your grandfather zap a guy at ten yards he was the best she was rewarded with a quick grin before she straightened he wont be forgotten mrs wojinski she said offering her hand and he mattered very much to all of us she started to step back but alice laid a hand on her arm leaned close the hand eve noted trembled slightly it was interesting meeting you lieutenant thank you for coming eve inclined her head and slipped back into the crowd casually she reached a hand into the pocket of her jacket and fingered the thin slip of paper alice had pushed inside it took her another thirty minutes to get away she waited until she was outside and in her vehicle before she took the note out and read it meet me tomorrow midnight aquarian club tell no one your life is now at risk in lieu of a signature there was a symbol a dark line running in an expanding circle to form a sort of maze nearly as intrigued as she was annoyed eve stuffed the note back in her pocket and started home because she was a cop she saw the figure draped in black hardly more than a shadow in the shadows and because she was a cop she knew he was watching her o o whenever roarke was away eve preferred to pretend the house was empty both she and summerset who served as roarkes chief of staff did their best to ignore the others presence the house was huge a labyrinth of rooms which made it a simple matter to avoid one another she stepped into the wide foyer tossed her scarred leather jacket over the carved newel post because she knew it would make summerset grind his teeth he detested having anything mar the elegance of the house particularly her she took the stairs but rather than go to the master bedroom she veered off to her office suite if roarke had to spend another night off planet as expected she preferred to spend hers in her relaxation chair rather than their bed she often dreamed badly when she dreamed alone between the late paperwork and the viewing she hadnt had time for a meal eve ordered up a sandwich real virginia ham on rye and coffee that jumped with genuine caffeine when the autochef delivered she inhaled the scents slowly greedily she took the first bite with her eyes closed to better enjoy the miracle there were definite advantages to being married to a man who could afford real meat instead of its byproducts and simulations to satisfy her curiosity she went to her desk and engaged her computer she swallowed ham chased it with coffee all available data on subject alice surname unknown mother brenda nee wojinski maternal grandparents frank and sally wojinski working eve drummed her fingers took out the note and reread it while she polished off the quick meal subject alice lingstrom dob june first child and only daughter of jan lingstrom and brenda wojinski divorced residence west eighth street apartment new york city sibling james lingstrom dob march education high school graduate valedictorian two semesters of college harvard major anthropology minor mythology third semester deferred currently employed as clerk spirit quest west tenth street new york city marital status single eve ran her tongue around her teeth criminal record no criminal record sounds fairly normal eve murmured data on spirit quest spirit quest wiccan shop and consultation center owned by isis paige and charles forte three years in tenth street location annual gross income one hundred twentyfive thousand dollars licensed priestess herbalist and registered hypnotherapist on site wicca eve leaned back with a snort witch stuff jesus what kind of scam is this wicca recognized as both a religion and a craft is an ancient naturebased faith which stop eve blew out a breath she wasnt looking for a definition of witchcraft but an explanation as to why a steadyasarock cop ended up with a granddaughter who believed in casting spells and magic crystals and why that granddaughter wanted a secret meeting the best way to find out she decided was to show up at the aquarian club in a bit over twentyfour hours she left the note on the desk it would be easy to dismiss it she thought if it hadnt been written by a relative of a man shed respected and if she hadnt seen that figure in the shadows a figure she was sure hadnt wanted to be seen she walked to the adjoining bath and began to strip it was too bad she couldnt take mavis with her for the meet eve had a feeling the aquarian club would be right up her friends alley eve kicked her jeans aside leaned over to stretch out the kinks of a long day and wondered what she would do with the long night ahead she had nothing hot to work on her last homicide had been so open and shut that she and her aide had put it to bed in under eight hours maybe shed spend a couple hours glazing out watching some screen or she could pick a weapon out of roarkes gun room and go down and run a hologram program to burn off excess energy until she could sleep shed never tried one of his autoassault rifles it might be interesting to experience how a cop took out an enemy during the early days of the urban wars she stepped into the shower full jets on pulse she ordered ninetyeight degrees she wished she had a murder to sink her teeth into something that would focus her mind and drain her system and damn it that was pathetic she was lonely she realized desperate for a distraction and hed only been gone three days they both had their own lives didnt they theyd lived them before they met and continued to live them after the demands of both their businesses absorbed much time and attention their relationship worked and that continued to surprise her because they were both independent people christ she missed him outrageously disgusted with herself she ducked her head under the spray and let it pound on her brain when hands slipped around her waist then slid up to cup her breasts she barely jolted but her heart leaped she knew his touch the feel of those long slim fingers the texture of those wide palms she tipped her head back inviting a mouth to the curve of her shoulder mmm summerset you wild man teeth nipped into flesh and made her chuckle thumbs brushed over her soapy nipples and made her moan im not going to fire him roarke trailed a hand down the center of her body it was worth a shot youre back his fingers dipped expertly inside her slick and slippery so that she arched moaned and came simultaneously early she finished on an explosive breath god id say i was just on time he spun her around and while she was shuddering and blinking water out of her eyes he covered her mouth in a long ravenous kiss hed thought about her on the interminable flight home thought about this just this touching and tasting and hearing that quick catch in her breath as he did and here she was naked and wet and already quivering for him he braced her in the corner gripped her hips and slowly lifted her off her feet miss me her heart was thundering he was inches away from driving into her filling her destroying her not really well in that case he kissed her lightly on the chin ill just let you finish your shower in peace in a flash she wrapped her legs around his waist took a firm hold of his wet mane of hair try it pal and youre a dead man in the interest of selfpreservation then to torture them both he slipped into her slowly watched her eyes go opaque he closed his mouth over hers again so that her shallow breaths shuddered through him the ride was slow and slippery and more tender than either had expected climax came on a long quiet sigh her lips curved against his welcome home she could see him now those stunning blue eyes the face that was both saint and sinner the mouth of a doomed poet his hair was streaming with water black and sleek just touching broad shoulders roped with subtle and surprisingly tough muscle looking at him after these brief periodic absences always made something unexpected lurch through her she doubted she would ever get used to the fact that he not only wanted her but loved her she was smiling still as she combed her fingers through his thick black hair everything okay with the olympus resort adjustments some delays nothing that cant be dealt with the elaborate space station resort and pleasure center would open on schedule because he wouldnt accept any less he ordered the jets off then took a towel to wrap around her when she would have used the drying tube i began to understand why you stay in here while im away i couldnt sleep in the presidential suite he took another towel rubbed it over her hair it was too lonely without you she leaned against him a moment just to feel the familiar lines of his body against hers were getting so damn sappy i dont mind we irish are very sentimental it made her smirk as he turned to get robes he might have had the music of ireland in his voice but she seriously doubted if any of his business friends or foes would consider roarke a sentimental man no fresh bruises he observed helping her into her robe before she could do it for herself i take that to mean youve had a quiet few days mostly we had a john get a bit overenthusiastic with a licensed companion choked her to death during sex she belted the robe scratched fingers through her hair to scatter more water he got spooked and ran she moved her shoulders as she stepped into the office but he lawyered up and turned himself in a few hours later pa took it down to manslaughter i let peabody handle the interview and booking hmm roarke went to a recessed cabinet for wine poured them both a glass its been quiet then yeah i had that viewing tonight his brow furrowed then cleared ah yes you told me im sorry i couldnt make it home in time to go with you feeneys taking it really hard it would be easier if frank had gone down in the line of duty this time roarkes brow quirked youd prefer that your associate had been killed rather than say go gently into that good night id just understand it better thats all she frowned into her wine she didnt think it wise to tell roarke shed prefer a fast and violent death herself there is something odd though i met franks family the oldest granddaughters on the weird side how the way she talked and the data i accessed on her after i got home intrigued he lifted his wine to sip you ran a make on her just a quick check because she passed me this eve walked to the desk picked up the note roarke scanned it considered earth labyrinth what the symbol here its celtic shaking her head eve eased closer to look again you know the strangest things not so strange i spring from the celts after all the ancient labyrinth symbol is magical and sacred well it fits shes into witchcraft or something got herself the start of a topflight education harvard but she drops out to work in some west village shop that sells crystals and magic herbs roarke traced the symbol with a fingertip hed seen it before and others like it during his childhood the cults in dublin had run the range between vicious gangs and pious pacifists all of course had used religion as the excuse to kill or be killed you have no idea why she wants to meet you none id say she figures she read my aura or something mavis ran a mystic grift before i busted her for pinching wallets she told me people will pay most anything if you tell them what they want to hear more if you tell them what they dont want to hear which is why cons and legitimate businesses are very much the same he smiled at her i take it youre going anyway sure ill follow through naturally she would roarke glanced at the note again then set it aside im going with you she wants its a pity what she wants he sipped his wine a man accustomed to getting precisely what he wanted one way or another ill stay out of your way but im going the aquarian club is basically harmless but there are always unsavory elements that leak through unsavory elements are my life she said soberly then cocked her head you dont like own the aquarian do you no he smiled would you like to she laughed and took his hand come on lets drink this in bed o o relaxed by sex and wine she fell peacefully asleep draped around roarke thats why she was baffled to find herself suddenly and fully awake only two hours later it hadnt been one of her nightmares there was no terror no pain no cold clammy sweat yet she had snapped awake and her heart wasnt quite steady she lay still staring up through the wide sky window over the bed listening to roarkes quiet steady breathing beside her she shifted glanced down at the foot of the bed and nearly yelped when eyes glowed out of the dark then she registered the weight over her ankles galahad she thought and rolled her eyes the cat had come in and jumped onto the bed thats what had awakened her she told herself thats all it was she settled again turned onto her side and felt roarkes arm slide around her in sleep on a sigh she closed her eyes snuggled companionably against him just the cat she thought sleepily but she would have sworn shed heard chanting chapter two by the time eve was elbow deep in paperwork the next morning the odd wakefulness in the night was forgotten new york seemed to be content to bask in the balmy days of early autumn and behave itself it seemed like a good time to take a few hours and organize her office or rather to delegate peabody to organize it how can your files be this skewed peabody demanded her earnest square face expressed deep remorse and disappointment i know where everything is eve told her i want you to put everything where ill still know where it is but where it also makes sense for it to be too tough an assignment officer i can handle it peabody rolled her eyes behind eves back sir fine and dont roll your eyes at me if things are a bit skewed as you put it its because ive had a busy year as were in the last quarter of this one and im training you it falls to me to dump this on you eve turned and smiled thinly with the hope peabody that you will one day have an underling to dump shit assignments on your faith in me is touching dallas chokes me up she hissed at the computer or maybe its the fact that youve got yellow sheets in here from five years ago thats choking me these should have been downloaded to the main and cleared out of your unit after twentyfour months so download and clear now eves smile widened as the machine hacked then droned out a warning of system failure and good luck technology can be our friend and like any friendship it requires regular maintenance and understanding i understand it fine eve stepped over pounded her fist twice on the drive the unit hiccupped back into running mode see you have a real smooth touch lieutenant thats why the guys in maintenance shoot air darts at your picture still christ they hold a grudge with a shrug eve sat on the corner of the desk what do you know about witchcraft if you want to cast a spell on your machine here dallas its a little out of my field teeth clenched she juggled and compressed files youre a freeager lapsed come on come on you can do it she muttered at the computer besides she added freeagers arent wiccans theyre both earth religions and both are based on natural orders but son of a bitch whered it go what where did what go nothing shoulders hunched peabody guarded the monitor nothing dont worry im on it you probably didnt need those files anyway is that a joke peabody you bet ha ha a line of sweat dribbled down her back as she attacked the keys there there it is no problem no problem at all and off it goes into the main neat and tidy she let out an enormous sigh could i maybe have some coffee just to keep alert eve shifted her gaze to the screen saw nothing that looked ominous saying nothing she rose and ordered coffee from the autochef why do you want to know about wicca you thinking of converting at eves bland look peabody tried a smile another joke youre full of them today just curious well theres some overlap on basic tenets between wiccans and freeagers a search for balance and harmony the celebration of the seasons that goes back to ancient times the strict code of nonviolence nonviolence eve narrowed her eyes what about curses casting spells and sacrifices naked virgins on the altar and black roosters getting their heads chopped off fiction depicts witches that way you know double double toil and trouble shakespeare macbeth eve snorted ill get you my pretty and your little dog too the wicked witch of the west classic vid channel good one peabody admitted but both examples feed into the most basic of misconceptions witches arent ugly evil crones mixing up cauldrons of goop or hunting down young girls and their friendly talking scarecrows wiccans like to be naked but they dont hurt anything or anyone strictly white magic as opposed to black magic eve studied her aide you dont believe in that stuff magic and spells nope revived with coffee peabody turned back to the computer i know some of the basics because i have a cousin who shifted to wicca hes into it big time joined a coven in cincinnati youve got a cousin in a coven in cincinnati laughing eve set her own coffee aside peabody you never cease to amaze me one day ill tell you about my granny and her five lovers five lovers isnt abnormal for a womans lifetime not in her lifetime last month all at the same time peabody glanced up deadpan shes ninetyeight i hope to take after her eve swallowed her next chuckle as her telelink beeped dallas she watched commander whitneys face swim onscreen yes commander id like to speak with you lieutenant in my office as soon as possible yes sir five minutes eve disengaged shot a hopeful glance at peabody maybe weve got something going keep working on those files ill contact you if were heading out she started out stuck her head back in dont eat my candy bar damn peabody said under her breath she never misses o o whitney had spent most of his life behind a badge and a large part of his professional life in command he made it his business to know his cops to judge their strengths and weaknesses and he knew how to utilize both he was a big man with workingman hands and dark keen eyes that some considered cold his temperament on the surface was almost terrifyingly even and like most smooth surfaces it coated something dangerous brewing beneath eve respected him occasionally liked him and always admired him he was at his desk when she stepped into his office lines of concentration puckering his brow as he read over some hard copy he didnt glance up merely gestured toward a chair she sat watched an air tram rumble by his window baffled as always by the number of passengers with binoks and spy glasses what did they expect to see behind the windows where cops worked she wondered suspects being tortured weapons discharged victims bleeding and weeping and why would the fantasy of such misery entertain them i saw you at the viewing last night eve shifted her thoughts and attention to her commander i imagine most every cop in central made an appearance frank was wellliked yes he was you never worked with him he gave me some pointers when i was a rookie helped out on legwork a couple of times but no i never worked with him directly whitney nodded kept his eyes on hers he was partnered with feeney before your time you were partnered with feeney after frank shifted from the streets to a desk she began to get an uncomfortable feeling in the gut something here she thought somethings off yes sir this has hit feeney pretty hard im aware of that dallas which is why captain feeney isnt here this morning whitney propped his elbows on his desk linked his fingers folded his fingers over we have a possible situation lieutenant a delicate situation regarding ds wojinski the information im going to relay to you is confidential your aide can be apprised per your discretion but no one else on the force no one in the media i am asking you ordering you he corrected to essentially work alone on this matter the discomfort in her stomach spread into little licks of fear as she thought of feeney understood there is some question regarding the circumstances of ds wojinskis death question commander youll require some background data he laid his folded hands on the edge of the desk it has come to my attention that ds wojinski was either pursuing an investigation of his own off the clock or involved with illegals drugs frank nobody was cleaner than frank whitney didnt so much as blink on september twentysecond of this year ds wojinski was spotted by an undercover illegals detective allegedly conducting business in a suspected chemical distribution center the athame is a private club religious in theme which offers its members group and individual ritual services and is licensed for private sexual functions the illegals division has had it under investigation for nearly two years frank was seen making a buy when eve said nothing whitney drew a long breath this situation was subsequently reported to me i questioned frank and he was not forthcoming whitney hesitated then followed through frankly dallas the fact that he would neither confirm nor deny refused to explain or discuss seemed very out of character and it worried me i ordered him to submit to a physical including a drug scan advised him to take a weeks leave he agreed to both the scan was at that point clear due to his record and my personal knowledge and opinion of him i did not mark the incident in his file but sealed it he rose then turned to his window perhaps that was a mistake its possible if i had pursued the matter at that point he would still be alive and we wouldnt be having this discussion you trusted your judgment and your man whitney turned back his eyes were dark they were intense but not cold eve thought they felt yes i did and now i have more data the standard autopsy on ds wojinski detected traces of digitalis and zeus zeus now eve rose frank was not a user commander putting aside who and what he was a chemical as powerful as zeus shows you see it in the eyes in the personality shift if hed been using zeus every cop in his division would have known it the drug scan would have picked it up there has to be a mistake she dug her hands into her pockets willed herself not to pace yeah there are cops who use and there are cops who figure their badges shield them from the law but not frank no way was he dirty but the traces were there lieutenant as well as traces of other chemicals identified as designer clones the combination of those chemicals resulted in cardiac arrest and death you suspect he odd or selfterminated she shook her head thats wrong i repeat the traces were there then there had to be a reason digitalis she frowned thats heart medicine isnt it you said hed had a physical a couple of weeks ago why didnt it show he had heart trouble whitneys gaze remained level franks closest friend on the force is the top edetective in the city feeney eve took two strides forward before she could stop herself you think feeney covered for him doctored his records damn it commander its a possibility i cant ignore whitney said evenly nor can you friendship can and does shadow judgment i am trusting that your friendship with feeney will not in this case shadow yours he walked to the desk again his position of authority these allegations and suspicions must be investigated and resolved the hot licks in her stomach had grown and were burning like acid you want me to investigate fellow officers one of which is dead leaving a grieving family behind the other of which was my trainer and is my friend she put her hands on the desk is your friend hed expected the anger accepted it just as he expected she would do the job he wouldnt accept less would you prefer i gave this to someone who didnt care his brow lifted on the question i want this done quietly with each piece of evidence and all investigative records sealed for my eyes only it may be necessary for you to speak with ds wojinskis family at some point i trust you will do so discreetly and tactfully there is no need to add to their grief and if i turn something up that smears a lifetime of public service that will be for me to deal with she straightened its a hell of a thing youre asking me to do ordering you to do whitney corrected that should make it easier lieutenant on you he handed her two sealed discs view these on your home unit any and all transmissions on this matter are to be sent from your home unit to my home unit nothing is to go through cop central until i tell you differently dismissed she turned on her heel walked to the door there she paused but didnt look back i wont roll over on feeney damned if i will whitney watched her stride out then closed his eyes she would do what needed to be done he knew he only hoped it wasnt more than she could live with her temper was bubbling by the time she got back to her own office peabody sat in front of the monitor smirking just about got it knocked your units a real whiner dallas but ive been slapping it into shape disengage eve snapped and grabbed up her jacket and bag get your gear peabody weve got a case revving up peabody jumped out of the chair and hustled after eve what kind of case where are we going she broke into a trot to keep up dallas lieutenant eve slapped the control on the elevator and the single furious look she shot at peabody was enough to stifle any further questions eve stepped into the elevator shuffled into position with several noisy cops and stood in stony silence hey dallas hows the newly wed why dont you get your rich husband to buy the eatery and stock some real food she flicked a steely glare over her shoulder stared into a face of a grinning cop bite me carter hey i gave that a shot three years ago and you nearly broke all my teeth holding out for a civilian he said when laughter erupted holding out for somebody who isnt the major asshole of robbery someone else put in better than being the minor one forenski hey peabody carter continued want me to bite you is your dental plan up to date ill check on that and get back to you with a wink carter and several others piled out carter puts the moves on anything female peabody said conversationally worried that eve continued to stare straight ahead too bad hes an asshole no response ah forenskis kind of cute peabody continued he doesnt have a steady personal partner does he i dont poke into the private lives of fellow officers eve snapped back and strode out onto the garage level you dont mind poking into mine peabody said under her breath she waited while eve uncoded her car locks then climbed into the passenger seat am i to log in destination sir or is it a surprise then she blinked when eve simply laid her head against the wheel hey are you all right whats going on dallas log in home office eve drew a breath straightened ill fill you in on the way all information youre given and all records on the ensuing investigation are to be coded and sealed eve maneuvered out of the garage and onto the street all said information and records are confidential you are to report only to me or the commander yes sir peabody swallowed the obstruction that had lodged in her throat its internal isnt it its one of us yeah goddamn it its one of us o o her home unit didnt have the eccentricities of her official computer roarke had seen to that the data scrolled smoothly onscreen detective marion burns shes been undercover at the athame for eight months working as a bartender eve pursed her lips burns i dont know her i do slightly peabody scooted her chair a bit closer to eves i met her when i was you know during the casto thing she struck me as a solid eyesonthejob sort if memory serves shes third generation cop her mothers still on the job captain i think in bunko her grandfather went out line of duty during the urban wars i dont know why shed have fingered ds wojinski maybe she reported what she saw or maybe its something else well have to find out her report to whitneys pretty cut and dried at one hundred thirty hours september she observed ds wojinski seated at a private booth with known chemical dealer selina cross wojinski exchanged credits for a small package which appeared to contain an illegal substance the conversation and exchange lasted fifteen minutes at which time cross moved to another booth wojinski remained in the club another ten minutes then left detective burns tailed the subject for two blocks at which time he engaged a public transport so she never saw him use no and she never saw him return to the club that night or on any subsequent night during her watch burns goes top of our list for questioning yes sir dallas since wojinski and feeney were tight wouldnt it follow that wojinski would have confided in him or failing that that feeney would have noticed something i dont know eve rubbed her eyes the athame what the hells an athame i dont know peabody pulled out her palm pc and requested the data athame ceremonial knife a ritual tool normally fashioned of steel traditionally the athame is not used for cutting but for casting or banishing circles in earth religions peabody glanced up at eve witchcraft she continued thats quite a coincidence i dont think so she took the note from alice out of her desk drawer passed it to peabody franks granddaughter slipped this to me at the viewing turns out she works at some shop called spirit quest do you know it i know what it is troubled now peabody set the note down wiccans are peaceful dallas and they use herbs not chemicals no true wiccans going to buy sell or use zeus how about digitalis eve cocked her head thats kind of an herb isnt it its distilled from foxglove its been used medicinally for centuries its what like a stimulant i dont know that much about healing but yeah id think sos zeus i wonder what kind of effect youd get combining the two bad mix wrong dosage whatever i wouldnt be surprised if youd get heart failure you think wojinski selfterminated the commander suspects it and ive got questions eve said impatiently i dont have answers but im going to get them she picked up the note well start tonight with alice i want you there at eleven in civilian clothes try to look like a freeager peabody not a cop peabody winced ive got this dress my mother made for my last birthday but ill get really pissed off if you laugh ill try to control myself for now lets see what we can dig up on this selina cross and the athame club five minutes later eve was smiling grimly at her machine interesting our selinas been around spent some time in a cage just look at this yellow sheet peabody soliciting sex without a license assault charge also in subsequently dropped ran into bunko in running a medium scam what the hell do people want to talk to the dead for anyway suspected of animal mutilations not enough evidence for arrest manufacturing and distribution of illegals thats what tagged her and put her away from to all smalltime shit though but here in she was brought in and questioned in connection with the ritual slaying of a minor her alibi held illegals has had her under observation since she was sprung in peabody added but they havent brought her in like you said shes smalltime they must be looking for a bigger fish that would be my take well see what marion has to say look here it says selina cross owns the athame club free and clear eve pursed her lips now where would a smalltime dealer get the credit power to buy and run a club shes a front i wonder if illegals knows for who lets take a look at her computer display image of subject cross selina whew peabody gave a little shudder as the image floated onscreen spooky not a face youd forget eve murmured it was sharp and narrow the lips full and vibrant red the eyes black as onyx there was beauty there in the balance of features the white smooth skin but it was cold and as peabody had observed spooky her hair was as dark as her eyes parted perfectly in the center and it hung straight there was a small tattoo over her left eyebrow whats that symbol eve wondered zoom and enhance segment twenty to twentytwo thirty percent a pentagram peabodys voice quivered causing eve to glance over curiously inverted shes not wiccan dallas peabody cleared her throat shes a satanist o o eve didnt believe in such things the white or the black of it but she was prepared to believe others did and more inclined to believe that some used that misguided faith to exploit be careful what you discount eve distracted she glanced over roarke had insisted on driving she couldnt complain as any one of his vehicles beat the hell out of hers what do you mean i mean when certain beliefs and traditions survive for centuries theres a reason for it sure there is human beings are and always have been gullible and there are and always have been individuals who know how to exploit that gullibility im going to find out if someone exploited franks she had told roarke everything and had justified it professionally by telling herself since she couldnt tap feeney for his computer expertise she could and would tap roarke for his youre a good cop and a sensible woman often youre too good a cop and too sensible a woman he stopped for traffic turned to her im asking you to be particularly careful when delving into an area such as this his face was in shadows and his voice much too serious you mean witches and devil worshipers come on roarke were into the second millennium here satanists for christs sake she pushed her hair back from her face what the hell do they think theyd do with him if he existed and they managed to get his attention thats the problem isnt it roarke said quietly and turned west toward the aquarian club devils exist eve frowned as he slid his vehicle up to a secondlevel spot on the street and theyre flesh and blood they walk on two legs you and i have seen plenty of them she got out took the ramp down to street level it was breezy and the freshening wind had cleared the smells and smoke away overhead the sky was a thick black unrelieved by moon or stars crisscrossing beams from sluggish air traffic flickered chased by the muffled grumble of engines here on the street was an arty upmarket part of town where even the glida grill on the corner was spotless and its menu ran to fresh hybrid fruit rather than smoked soydogs most of the street vendors had closed up for the night but during the day they would unfold their carts and discretely hawk offerings of handmade jewelry hooked rugs and tapestries herbal baths and teas panhandlers in this area would likely be polite their licenses clearly displayed and they would probably spend their daily earnings on a meal rather than a chemical high the crime rate was low the rents murderous and the median age of its residents and merchants carelessly young she would have hated to live there were early she murmured scanning the street as a matter of habit then her mouth curved into a smirk look at that will you the psychic deli i guess you go in order the veggie hash and they claim they knew you were going to do that pasta salad and palm readings theyre open on impulse she turned to roarke she wanted something that would turn her sour mood you game you want your palm read what the hell she grabbed his hand itll put me in the groove for investigating satanic chemidealers maybe theyll cut us a deal and do yours for half price no you never know unless you ask im not having mine read coward she muttered and tugged him through the door i prefer the word careful she had to admit it smelled wonderful there was none of the usual overlay of onion and heavy sauces instead there was a light fragrance of spice and flowers that meshed perfectly with the airy music small white tables and chairs were arranged at a nice distance from the display counter where bowls and plates of colorful food were presented behind sparkling glass two customers sat together over bowls of clear soup both of them sported flowing white robes jeweled sandals and shaved heads behind the counter was a man with silver rings on every finger he wore a widesleeved shirt in quiet blue his blonde hair was neatly braided and twined with silver cord he smiled in welcome blessed be do you wish food for the body or for the soul i thought you were supposed to know eve grinned at him how about a reading palm tarot runes or aura palm enjoying herself eve stuck her hand out cassandra is our palmist if youd take a comfortable seat shell be happy to help you sister he added as she started to turn your auras are very strong vibrant you are wellmatched with this he picked up a wooden stick with a rounded edge and ran it gently over the rim of a white frosted bowl even as the vibration sang a woman stepped through the beaded curtain separating a back room she wore a silver tunic with a silver bracelet coiled above her elbow eve noted that she was very young barely twenty and like the man her hair was blonde and coiled into a braid welcome her voice held a hint of ireland please be comfortable would you both like a reading no just me eve took a seat at a far table whats it run the reading is free we request a donation only she sat gracefully smiled at roarke your generosity will be appreciated madam the hand you were born with i came with both of them the left please she cupped her fingers under eves offered hand barely touching at first strength and courage your fate was not set a trauma a break in the lifeline very young you were only a child such pain such sadness she lifted her gaze clear gray you were and are without blame she tightened her grip when eve instinctively drew back its not necessary to remember all until youre ready sorrow and selfdoubt passions blocked a solitary woman who chose to focus on one goal a great need for justice disciplined selfmotivated troubled your heart was broken more than broken mauled so you guarded what was left its a capable hand one to trust she took eves right hand firmly but barely looked at it those clear gray eyes stayed on eves face you carry much of what was inside you it will not be quiet it will not rest but youve found your place authority suits you as does the responsibility that marches with it youre stubborn often singlefocused but your heart is greatly healed you love she flicked a glance at roarke again and her mouth softened when she looked back at eve it surprises you the depth of this it unnerves you and you are not easily unnerved her thumb skimmed over the top of eves palm your heart runs deep it is choosy it is careful but when its given its complete you carry identification a badge she smiled slowly yes you made the right choice perhaps the only one you could have made youve killed more than once there was no alternative for you yet this weighs heavy on your mind and heart in this you find it difficult to separate the intellect from the emotion youll kill again the gray eyes went glassy and the light grip tightened its dark the forces are dark here evil lives already lost and others yet to lose pain and fear body and soul you must protect yourself and those you love she turned to roarke snagging his hand and speaking rapidly in gaelic her face had gone very white and her breath hitched thats enough shaken eve snatched her hand back hell of a show irritated that her palm tingled she rubbed it hard against the knee of her slacks youve got a good eye cassandra is it and an impressive spiel she dug into her pocket took out fifty in credits and laid them on the table wait cassandra opened a small embroidered pouch at her waist plucked out a smooth stone in pale green a gift a token she pushed it into eves hand carry it with you why why not please come again blessed be eve caught one last glance at her pale face before cassandra hurried into the back room with a musical jingle of beads well so much for youre taking a long ocean voyage eve muttered as she headed for the door what did she say to you her dialect was a bit thick id say shes from the west counties he stepped outside oddly relieved to draw in the night air the gist was that if i loved you as much as she believed i would stay close that youre in danger of losing your life perhaps your soul and you need me to survive it what a crock she glanced down at the stone in her hand keep it roarke closed her fingers over it couldnt hurt with a shrug eve pushed it into her pocket i think im going to steer clear of psychics an excellent idea roarke said with feeling as he walked with her across the street and into the aquarian club chapter three it was quite a place eve mused and certainly quieter than any club shed been in before both conversation and music were muted and both had an elegant little lilt tables were packed together as was the norm but they were arranged to provide circular traffic patterns that reminded eve of the symbol at the base of alices note ringing the walls were mirrors fashioned into the shapes of stars and moons each held a burning candle a white pillar that reflected light and flame between each mirror were plaques of symbols and figures she didnt recognize the small dance floor was circular as well as was the bar where patrons sat on stools that depicted signs of the zodiac it took her a moment to place the woman seated on the twin faces of gemini jesus thats peabody roarke shifted his gaze focused on the woman in a long sweeping dress in swirling hues of blue and green three long strands of beads sparkled to her waist and earrings of varicolored metals jingled beneath the fringes of her straight cropped hair well well he said and smiled slowly our sturdy peabody makes quite a picture she sure blends eve decided i have to meet with alice alone why dont you go over and talk to peabody a pleasure lieutenant he took a long look at her worn jeans battered leather jacket and unadorned ears you dont blend is that a dig no he flicked a finger over the dent in her chin an observation he strolled over slid onto the stool beside peabody now lets see what would be the standard line whats a nice witch like you doing in a place like this peabody slid him a sidelong look grimaced i feel like an idiot in this getup you look lovely she snorted not exactly my style you know the fascinating thing about women peabody he reached out tapped a finger against her dangling earrings to send them dancing you have so many styles what are you drinking ridiculously flattered she struggled not to flush a sagittarius thats my sign the drinks supposed to be metabolically and spiritually designed for my personality she sipped from the clear chalice actually its not bad whats your you know birth sign i have no idea i believe i was born the first week of october believe peabody mused how odd not to know well that would make you libran well then lets be metabolically and spiritually correct he turned to order drinks watched eve sitting at a table what sign would you attribute to your lieutenant shes a tough one to pin down indeed she is roarke murmured from her table on the outer circle eve watched everything there was no band or holographic image of one instead the music seem to come from nowhere and everywhere windy flutes and plucked strings a soothing female voice that sang with impossible sweetness in a language eve didnt recognize she saw couples in earnest conversations others laughing quietly no one flicked an eyelash when a woman in a sheer white sheath rose to dance alone eve ordered water and was amused when it was served in a goblet of simulated silver she tuned in to the conversation at the table behind her and was further amused to hear the groups sober discussion on their experiences with astral projection at a table in the next ring two women talked about their former lives as temple dancers in atlantis she wondered why former lives were always more exotic than the one being lived the only shot a person had in her opinion harmless weirdos eve thought but caught herself rubbing her still tingling palm on her jeans she saw alice the minute the girl walked in agitated eve thought nervous hands tensed shoulders jittery eyes she waited until alice scanned the room spotted her then she inclined her head in acknowledgment with a last backward glance at the door alice hurried over you came i was afraid you wouldnt quickly she dipped into her pocket and drew out a smooth black stone on a silver chain put this on please she insisted when eve only studied it its obsidian its been consecrated itll block evil im all for that eve slipped the chain around her neck better this is the safest place i know the cleanest still darting glances around the room alice sat i used to come here all the time she gripped the amulet she wore in both hands as a server glided to the table a golden sun please she took a deep breath as she looked back at eve i need courage ive tried to meditate all day but im blocked im afraid what are you afraid of alice that those who killed my grandfather will kill me next who killed your grandfather evil killed him killing is what evil does best you wont believe what i tell you youre too grounded in what can be seen only with the eyes she accepted the drink from the server closed her eyes a moment as if in prayer then slowly lifted the cup to her lips but you wont ignore it either youre too much a cop i dont want to die alice said and set her cup down that eve thought was the first sensible statement shed heard the fear was genuine enough she decided and unmasked tonight at the viewing alice had been careful to slick on a layer of composure and calm for her family eve realized who are you afraid of and why i have to explain all of it i have to purge before i can atone my grandfather respected you so i come to you in his memory i wasnt born a witch werent you eve said dryly some are and some like me are simply drawn to the craft i became interested in wicca through my studies and the more i learned the more i felt a need to belong i was drawn to the rituals the search for balance the joy and the positive ethics i didnt share my interest with my family they wouldnt have understood she dipped her head and her hair flowed down like a curtain i enjoyed the secrecy of that and was still young enough to find the experience of going skyclad at an outdoor celebration slightly wicked my family she lifted her head again theyre conservative and a part of me simply wanted to do something daring a small rebellion yes thats true if i had left it at that alice murmured if i had truly accepted my initiation into the craft and what it meant everything would be different now i was weak and my intellect too ambitious she picked up her drink again wet her dry throat i wanted to know to compare and analyze rather like a thesis the contrasts of white and black magic how could i fully appreciate the one without fully understanding its antithesis that was my rationale sounds logical false logic alice insisted i was deluding myself the ego and the intellect were so arrogant i would study the black arts on a purely scholarly level id talk to those who had chosen the other path and discover what had turned them away from the light it would be exciting she smiled tremulously i thought it would be exciting and for a short time it was a child eve thought in the body of a stunning woman bright and curious but a child nonetheless it was pitifully easy to tug information from the young is that how you met selina cross paling alice made a quick forking gesture with her forefinger and pinky how do you know of her i did some research i didnt walk in here blind alice as a cops granddaughter you shouldnt have expected me to be afraid of her alice compressed her lips be afraid of her shes a secondrate grifter and chemidealer no shes much more alice gripped her amulet again believe that lieutenant ive seen i know shell want you youll challenge her do you believe she had something to do with franks death i know she did tears swam into her eyes deepening the soft blue one huge and lovely drop spilled over and slid down her white cheek because of me eve leaned closer to comfort and to block the tearful face from any onlookers tell me about it about her i met her nearly a year ago on the sabbat of samhain all hallows eve more research i told myself i didnt realize how deeply id already been drawn in how utterly seduced i was by the power the pure selfish greed of the other side i hadnt performed any of the rituals not then i was still observing then i met her and the one they call alban alban he serves her alice lifted a hand laid her fingers against her mouth that night still isnt clear in my mind i realize now they cast a spell over me i let them lead me into the circle strip off my robes i heard the bells ring and the chant to the dark prince i watched the sacrifice of the goat and i shared in the blood her head drooped again as shame whirled inside her i shared in it drank of it and enjoyed i was the altar that night i was tied to the stone i dont know how or by whom but i wasnt afraid i was aroused her voice dropped to a whisper the music changed slid from strings to drums and bells cheerfully sexual alice never lifted her gaze each member of the coven touched me rubbed oils and blood over me the chanting was inside me and the fire was so hot then selina laid over me she did things id never had any sexual experience then while she slid up my body alban straddled me she watched me his hands were on her breasts and he was inside me and she watched my face i wanted to close my eyes but i couldnt i couldnt i couldnt stop looking into her eyes it was like she was the one the one inside me her tears plopped on the table now even though eve had shifted to shield her from most of the room and alices voice was barely more than a whisper several heads were turning curiously you were drugged alice and exploited you have nothing to be ashamed of her eyes lifted briefly and threatened to break eves heart then why am i so ashamed i was a virgin and there was pain but even that was arousing unbearably and the pleasure that came with it was huge monstrous they used me and i begged to be used again and was by the entire coven by sunrise i was lost enslaved i woke in bed between them alban and selina id already become their apprentice and their toy tears were running down her cheeks as she drank again sexually there was nothing i would not allow them or one of their choosing to do to me i embraced the dark and i became careless in my arrogance someone told my grandfather he would never give me a name but i know it was a wiccan he confronted me and i laughed at him i warned him to stay out of my affairs i thought he had saying nothing eve slid her water across the table gratefully alice picked it up drained it a few months ago i discovered selina and alban were performing private rituals id come down from college a day early i went to their house and i heard the ceremonial chant i opened the door of the ritual room they were there together performing a sacrifice her hands shook not a goat this time but a child a young boy eves hand closed tight over alices wrist you saw them murder a child murder is too tame a word for what they did the tears dried up in horror dont ask me to tell you dont ask me that she would have to eve knew but it could wait tell me what you can i saw selina the ritual knife the blood the screams i swear you could see the screams like black smears on the air it was too late to stop it she looked at eve again those swimming eyes begging to be believed in this one thing i was too late to do anything for the boy even if id had the power or the courage to try you were alone shocked eve said carefully the woman was armed the boy was dead you couldnt have helped him for one long moment alice stared at her then covered her face with her hands i try to believe that try so hard living with it is destroying me i ran away i just ran you cant change it eve kept her hand on alices wrist but her grip gentled she had once seen a child mutilated had been too late seconds too late she hadnt run she had killed but the child was just as dead either way you cant go back and change it you have to live with what is i know isis tells me that alice took a shuddering breath lowered her hands they were engrossed in their work and never saw me or i pray they never saw me i didnt go to my grandfather or the police i was terrified sick i dont know how much time went by but i went to isis the high priestess who had initiated me into wicca she took me in even after all id done she took me in you didnt tell frank what youd seen alice winced at the bite in eves voice not then i spent time in reflection and purification isis performed several cleansing rites and auric healings isis and i felt it best that i stay in seclusion for a while concentrate on finding the light and atonement eves eyes were hot and hard as she leaned closer alice you saw a child murdered and told no one but your neighborhood witch i know how it sounds her lip quivered before she caught it between her teeth and steadied it the childs physical being was beyond help i could do nothing for him but pray for the safe passage of his soul to the next plane i was afraid to tell grandpa afraid of what he might do and what selina would do to him when i did go to him last month i told him everything now hes dead and i know shes responsible how do you know i saw her wait eyes narrowed eve held up a hand you saw her kill him no i saw her outside my window i looked out the night he died and she was standing below looking up looking up at me the call came from my mother to tell me grandpa was dead and selina smiled she smiled and she beckoned to me alice buried her face in her hands again she sent her forces against him used her power to stop his heart because of me now the raven comes every night to my window and watches me with her eyes christ eve thought where were they going with this a bird alice laid her trembling hands on the table shes a shapeshifter she takes what form she wills ive protected myself as best i can but my faith may not be strong enough theyre pulling at me calling to me alice while sympathy remained eve found her patience waning selina cross might have had a part in your grandfathers death if we find that he didnt die of natural causes it wasnt some spell it was calculated simple murder if so therell be evidence and a trial and shell be dealt with you cant find smoke alice shook her head you wont find evidence in a curse enough was enough at this point youre a witness to a crime potentially the only witness and if youre afraid i can arrange a safe house for you her voice was flat and brisk all cop i need you to give me a description of the child so that i can check missing persons with your formal statement i can get a warrant to search the room where you allegedly witnessed the murder i need you to give me details straight details times places names i can help you you dont understand alice said shaking her head slowly you dont believe me i believe youre an intelligent and curious woman who got in over her head with some very nasty people and i believe youre confused and upset i have someone you can talk to who can help you sort things out someone alices eyes went cold and her voice hard a psychiatrist you think im imagining things making them up her body trembled as she surged to her feet its not my mind thats in danger its my life my life lieutenant dallas and my soul if you find yourself in battle with selina youll believe and may the goddess help you she whirled and ran out leaving eve cursing that seemed remarkably unsuccessful roarke commented as he came up behind her the girls whacked out but shes terrified eve heaved a long breath and rose lets get the hell out of here she signaled peabody then headed for the door outside a thin fog crept along the ground stealthily like twining gray snakes rain thin and chilly was just beginning to slick the street there she is eve murmured when she caught sight of alice rushing around the corner headed south peabody tail her make sure she gets home safe got her peabody headed off at a half trot that kids a mess roarke theyve fucked with her in every way possible disgusted she dug her hands into her pockets i probably couldve handled it better but i dont see how it would help to encourage her delusions spells and curses and shape shifters jesus darling eve he kissed her brow my own practical cop the way she tells it she was practically the bride of satan grumbling eve started for the car turned on her heel and paced back ill tell you how it went roarke she wanted to play wanted to dabble in the occult and she ran into real bad news shes a naive pretty girl and it doesnt take a crystal ball to see it so she went to one of their meetings or whatever the hell you call them and they drugged her then they gangraped her bastards shes drugged and in shock and vulnerable to suggestions and its easy for a couple of professional cons to convince her shes part of their cult pull a couple of magic tricks out of their hat and fascinate her use sex to keep her in line she got to you roarke murmured and touched her hair brushing away the wet maybe she did damn it did you look at her shes wellnamed looks like that kid in the fairy story probably believes in talking rabbits too then she sighed struggled to put her emotions back into place but were not in a fairy story here she claims she walked in on a ritual murder a little boy she said ive got to get her in to mira a shrink will be able to sort out the fact from fiction but i believe that murder was fact and if they killed one child theyve killed more people like them prey on the helpless i know he reached out to rub the tension in her shoulders close to home no its not like what happened to me or you but there were enough echoes to unnerve her were still here arent we she laid a hand on his but frowned into the shadows why didnt frank make a log of what shed told him why the hell did he go solo on this maybe he did make a log a private one she blinked stared at him god how could i be so slow she clapped her hands on either side of his face and kissed him hard youre brilliant yes i know he jerked her back as a figure darted out of the shadows and over the ramp black cat he said simultaneously uneasy and amused at himself bad luck yeah right she started up the ramp cocked her head as the cat sat at the side of roarkes car watching her out of bright and glittering green eyes you dont look hungry ace too sleek and glossy for an alley cat too perfect she realized must be a droid still she crouched reached out to stroke the cat hissed arched and swiped eve would have found her palm laid open if she hadnt been quick enough to dodge well thats friendly you should know better than to offer your hand to strange animals or droids but he stepped in front of eve to uncode the car and kept his eyes on the gleaming green of the cats when eve was in the car he spoke softly the cats fur bristled its tail switched then it leaped nimbly from the ramp to the street and it was swallowed by the fog roarke couldnt have said why hed given the order to go in gaelic it had simply come out that way he was still pondering it when he slid in beside eve listen roarke i cant tap feeney for any ework on this at least not until the commander loosens up i may have to go to the family for access to franks personal records but if i do that ill have to tell them something and youd rather not not yet in any case so how do you feel about using your skills to access franks personal unit and logs his mood lifted as he started the car guiding it down to street level that depends lieutenant do i get a badge her lips twitched into a smirk no but you get to have sex with a cop do i get to pick the cop he only smiled when she punched his arm id pick you probably and i suppose you want me to begin my unofficial consultation tonight thats the idea all right but i want sex first he tucked his tongue in his cheek as she chuckled how long do you think peabodys going to be busy just joking he said quickly but shifted into autodrive just in case eve got violent she did look quite appealing tonight though laughing he caught her fist in his hand then snuck the other one up to her breast listen pal youre in deep enough without trying that engaging in any sexual act in a moving vehicle is in violation of inner city codes arrest me he suggested and nipped her bottom lip i might when im done with you she wiggled free and shoved him back and just for that smartass remark about my aide no sex until after the consult he disengaged auto then slid her a slow smiling glance wanna bet she met that arrogant glance narroweyed fifty credits even odds done and he whistled his way through the iron gates that led home chapter four pay up eve rolled over rubbed her bare butt and wondered if shed have rug burns still vibrating from the last orgasm she closed her eyes again huh fifty credits he leaned over gently kissed the tip of her breast you lost lieutenant her eyes blinked open and stared into his gorgeous and very satisfied face they were sprawled on the rug of his private room and their clothes as best she could recall were scattered everywhere starting at the stairway where hed trapped her against the wall and had started to win the bet im naked she pointed out i dont generally keep credits up my im happy to take your iou he rose all graceful gleaming muscles and took a memo card from his console here you are handed it to her she stared down at it knowing dignity was as lost as the fifty credits youre really enjoying this oh more than you can possibly imagine scowling at him she engaged the memo i owe you roarke fifty credits dallas lieutenant eve she shoved the memo at him satisfied in every possible way he thought sentimentally that he would tuck the memo away with the little gray suit button hed kept from their very first meeting i love you dallas lieutenant eve in every possible way she couldnt help it she went soft all over it was the way he said it the way he looked at her that had rapid pulses beating under melting skin oh no you dont that kind of things how you took me for fifty she scrambled up before he could distract her again where the hell are my pants i havent the faintest idea he walked to a section of the wall touched a mechanism when the panel slid open he drew out a robe it was silk and thin and made her eyes narrow again he was always buying her things like that and they always seemed to find their way to various parts of the house conveniently thats not working attire we can do this naked but youd certainly lose another fifty when she snatched the robe out of his hand he turned and took out another for himself this could take some time well want coffee as she went to the autochef to get coffee roarke moved behind the console the equipment here was first flight and unregistered compuguard couldnt track it nor block him from hacking into any system still even with those advantages finding a personal log that may or may not have existed was like separating individual grains of sand from a bucketful engage he ordered more likely his home unit wouldnt you think anything on his unit at cop central would have been transferred and official units record all logging if he wanted to keep something to himself hed have used a private system do you have his home address never mind he said before eve could speak ill get it data wojinski frank what was his rank detective sergeant attached to records data on screen one please as it began to scroll roarke reached for the coffee eve held out to him then waved his fingers when his link beeped get that would you it was the careless order of a man used to giving them automatically she bristled then just as quickly bumped aside the annoyance she supposed the situation called for her to act as assistant roarkes residence peabody you didnt answer your communicator no i god knew where it was she thought whats up its bad dallas its bad though her voice was steady her face was dead white and her eyes too dark alice is dead i couldnt stop it i couldnt get to her she just where are you on tenth street between broad and seventh i called the mts but there was nothing are you in jeopardy no no i just couldnt stop her i just watched while secure the scene officer relay to dispatch im on my way call backup as required and stand understood yes sir yes dallas out oh christ she murmured when she disengaged ill take you he was already up his hand on her shoulder no this is my job and she prayed it wasnt her doing id appreciate it if youd stay here and get whatever data you can all right eve he took both of her shoulders now firmly before she could turn away look at me this was not your fault she did look at him and there was grief in her eyes i hope to god it wasnt o o there wasnt a crowd eve could be grateful for that it was after two in the morning and only a few gawkers huddled together behind the barricade she saw a rapid cab tipped drunkenly on the curb and a man sitting beside it his head in his hands as an mt spoke with him on the rainslicked street lit dimly by the glow of a security light with fog billowing like clouds was alice her body sprawled there faceup her arms and legs flung out as if in wild welcome blood her own had soaked through the filmy material of her dress and turned it to dark doomed red peabody stood by her assisting a uniform in the erecting of a privacy screen officer peabody eve said it softly waited for peabody to turn straighten her shoulders and cross to her your report i followed the subject to her residence as per your orders lieutenant i watched her enter the building and subsequently observed the light go on in the second window from the east third floor on my own initiative i decided to keep watch for a period of fifteen minutes to insure the subject remained inside she did not peabody trailed off and her gaze shifted to the body eve sidestepped blocked the view look at me when you report officer yes sir peabody snapped back subject exited building approximately ten minutes later she appeared agitated continually looked over her shoulder as she walked west at a rapid pace she appeared to be crying i maintained the standard distance thats why i couldnt stop her peabody had to suck in air i maintained the standard distance stop it eve snapped it out gave peabody a quick shake complete your report peabodys eyes went flat and cold as they met eves yes sir the subject stopped suddenly took several steps in retreat she spoke i was too far away to discern what she said but it was my impression that she was speaking to someone she played it back through her mind every step leaning on her training like a crutch i closed the distance somewhat in the event the subject was in jeopardy i observed no one on the street other than the subject herself the fog may have been a factor but there was no one on the sidewalk or the street that i could see she stood there talking to no one eve asked thats how it appeared lieutenant she became increasingly agitated she begged to be left alone her words were havent you done enough havent you taken enough why wont you leave me in peace peabody stared back at the sidewalk saw it all again heard it as well that hitch of desperation and despair in alices voice i thought i heard a response but cant be definite the subject was speaking too loudly and too rapidly for me to make a clear statement on that i decided to move closer to make myself known a muscle in her jaw jumped as she continued to stare over eves shoulder at this time a rapid cab traveling east approached the subject turned and ran into the street directly into the path of the oncoming vehicle the driver attempted to stop and evade but was unable to do so and struck the subject headon she paused just long enough to take another breath road conditions were fair to poor and played a minor factor even with optimum conditions it would be my opinion the driver would have been unable to avoid the collision understood continue i reached the body within seconds and though i observed that she was already dead i called for the medical technicians then attempted to contact you via your communicator when this was unsuccessful i utilized the portalink in my bag and reached you at home to report the situation following your orders i relayed to dispatch and requested a uniform then secured the scene it was hell to be too late eve knew and no amount of sympathy could ease that bitter guilt so she offered none very well officer thats the driver peabody continued to stare straight ahead and her voice was hollow yes lieutenant arrange for his vehicle to be taken in for analysis then consult with the mts and find out if hes in shape to give a statement yes sir peabody clutched her hand into a fist at her side she kept her voice low but it vibrated with emotion you had a drink with her barely an hour ago and it doesnt mean a damn to you eve took the hit and waited until peabody turned away before she walked back to alice yes it does she murmured and thats the problem opening her field kit she crouched down to do her job o o it wasnt homicide technically eve should have turned the matter over to traffic after peabodys report and the ensuing statement from the weeping cabbie but she watched alices body being loaded into the morgue wagon and knew she had no intention of doing so she took a last look at the scene the rain had nearly stopped and wouldnt wash away the blood the few gawkers who had gathered were already breaking up and moving along tearing the last thin curtains of fog as they shuffled home across at the curb a city tow unit was already hitching up the damaged cab for transferral to the police compound accidents some would say happened all too often and so eve thought did murder all too often youve had a long night peabody youre off duty i would prefer to stay on lieutenant and see this through you wont help her or me unless you can see it through objectively i can do my job sir my feelings are my own business eve hitched up her field kit took a long look at her aide yes they are just dont let them get in my way she took her recorder out of her kit held it out to peabody on record officer well examine the subjects residence do you intend to notify the next of kin sir when were done here they headed east back to alices building she hadnt gotten far eve thought barely a block what had driven her back out and what had driven her into the path of the cab the building was a pretty restored brownstone of three stories the entrance doors sported beveled glass with an etched design of peacocks the security camera was in full repair and the locks coded for palm prints eve disarmed them with a master code and entered a small wellscrubbed foyer with faux marble floors the elevator had a mirrored bronze sheen and ran with silent efficiency alice she thought had had taste and the financial resources to indulge it there were three apartments on the third floor and again eve used her master to gain entrance dallas lieutenant eve and aide peabody officer d entering residence of deceased for standard examination lights she ordered then frowned when the room remained dark peabody reached around the door flicked a switch she must have preferred manual to voiceactivated the room was cluttered and colorful pretty scarves and throws were draped over chairs tables tapestries depicting attractive naked people and mythological animals romped over the walls candles were everywhere on tables on shelves on the floor as were bowls of colored stones of herbs of dried flower petals chunks and wands of crystal sparkling clean crowded every flat surface a mood screen was engaged and showed a wide field of meadow grass and wildflowers blowing gently in the breeze its audio played the song of birds and zephyrs she liked pretty things eve observed and lots of them moving over she glanced at the controls of the mood screen and nodded as they corroborated her thought she flipped this on as soon as she walked in wanted to mellow out id say leaving peabody to follow she walked into the adjoining room the bedroom was small cozy and again cluttered the spread on the narrow bed was embroidered with stars and moons a glass mobile dancing with fairies hung above it and even now clinked musically in the breeze through the open window this would have been the window the light you saw come on yes sir so she flipped on the screen then came straight into the bedroom probably wanted to change get out of the damp dress but she didnt eve stepped on to a small area rug with the face of a smiling sun its cluttered but tidy in its way no sign of disturbance or struggle struggle you said she was agitated crying when she came back out the country meadow program didnt mellow her or didnt have enough time to she didnt bother to shut it down again no eve agreed she didnt theres the possibility someone was here when she got home someone who upset or frightened her well check the security logs she opened what she assumed was a closet and let out a hum well look at this shed turned it into a room of some kind not a lot of clutter here get this on record peabody stepped up scanned the recorder over a small whitewalled room the floor was wood with a white pentagram painted on it a ring of white candles were arranged in careful symmetry around the edge a small table held a clear crystal ball a bowl a mirror and a darkhandled knife with a short blunted blade eve sniffed the air but caught no hint of smoke or candle wax what do you figure she did in here id say it was kind of ritual room for meditation or casting spells jesus with a shake of her head eve stepped back well leave that for now and check out her link if no one was here to scare her back out maybe she got a call that did she came into the bedroom first eve murmured wandering back to the small bedside link maybe she intended to go in there and play witch after shed changed and calmed down she wasnt carrying anything when she went back out she didnt come in here to get something and go out again she was upset she came home eve engaged the link requested a replay of the last call transmitted or received and the room rilled with low rhythmic chanting what the hell is that i dont know uneasy peabody stepped closer replay eve demanded hear the names hear the names and fear them loki beelzebub baphomet i am annihilation i am revenge in nomine dei nostri santanas luciferi excelsi vengeance for you who strayed from the law hear the names and fear stop eve gave a quick involuntary shudder beelzebub thats devil shit isnt it the bastards were playing with her tormenting her and she was already on the edge no wonder she ran out of here where were you you son of a bitch where were you location of last transmission display her mouth thinned as she read the data tenth and seventh right down the goddamn street probably a public link fuckers she was heading right for them there wasnt anyone there but peabody was watching eves face now and the fury that fired in her eyes even with the fog the rain i would have seen someone if theyd been laying for her there wasnt anything there but a cat eves heart took a bad jump a what just a cat i caught a glimpse of a cat but there was no one on the street a cat eve walked to the window suddenly she felt the need for a good gulp of air there on the sill she saw the long black feather and a bird she murmured she took out tweezers held the feather up to the light weve still got the occasional crow in new york a crows the same thing as a raven isnt it more or less i think bag it eve ordered i want it analyzed she rubbed her fingers over her eyes as if to push away fatigue next of kin would be brenda wojinski mother run that for an address yes sir peabody took out her ppc then simply held it while shame washed over her lieutenant id like to apologize for my earlier comment and my behavior eve took the disc from the link sealed it herself i dont recall any comment peabody or any unsatisfactory behavior she gave peabody a level look while the recorder is still engaged do another scan of the apartment understanding peabody inclined her head im aware the recorder is still engaged lieutenant i want this on the record i was insubordinate and out of line both professionally and personally damn stiffnecked idiot eve thought and bit back an oath there was no insubordination in my opinion or in my recollection officer dallas peabody loosed a sigh i damn well was i was shaky and having a hard time dealing with the situation its one thing to see a body after its done and another to see a woman get tossed ten feet in the air and land on the pavement she was under my watch i was rough on you yes sir you were and you needed to be i thought that because you were able to maintain you were able to do your job it meant you didnt care i was wrong and im sorry acknowledged now put this on record peabody you followed orders you followed procedure you were not at fault for what happened tonight you could not have prevented it now put it aside so we can find out why shes dead o o eve thought that a cops daughter knew when another cop knocked on the door at five in the morning it was with news of the worst kind she saw the minute brenda recognized her that she was right oh god oh god mama no its not your mother ms wojinski there was only one way eve knew and that was fast its alice may we come in alice she blinked glazed eyes propped a hand on the door for balance alice i think we should go inside as gently as possible eve took her arm stepped through the door lets go in and sit down alice she said again grief cracked the glaze over her eyes tears poured through oh no not my alice not my baby brenda swayed would have slid to the floor but eve tightened her grip and headed quickly for the nearest seat im sorry im so sorry for your loss ms wojinski there was an accident early this morning and alice was killed an accident no youve made a mistake it was someone else it wasnt alice she clutched at eve flooded eyes pleading you cant be sure it was my alice it was im sorry she collapsed then burying her face in her hands pressing her hands to her knees so her body was balled in a defensive shield i could make her some tea peabody murmured yeah go it was the part of the job that made eve feel the most helpless the most inadequate there was no solution for fresh grief is there someone i can call for you do you want me to contact your mother your brother mama oh god alice how will we bear it there was no answer for that eve thought yet they would life demanded it i can give you a soother or contact your doctor if youd prefer mom as brenda continued to rock eve looked over the boy stood in the doorway blinking sleepy confused eyes his hair was tousled from sleep and he wore grubby sweatpants with holes at the knees alices brother eve remembered shed forgotten then he focused on eve his eyes suddenly alert and much too adult whats wrong he demanded whats happened what the hell was his name eve struggled to remember then decided it didnt matter at the moment she rose he was a tall boy she realized with sleep creases in his cheeks and a body already braced to take the worst theres been an accident im sorry but its alice his chin quivered but his eyes stayed steady on hers shes dead yes im sorry he continued to stare at her as peabody came in with a cup of tea set it awkwardly on the table what kind of accident she was hit by a car early this morning hit and run no eve watched him carefully considering she stepped into the path of a cab the driver was unable to stop were in the process of analyzing his vehicle and the scene but there was a witness who corroborates the drivers statement i dont believe he was at fault he didnt attempt to flee the scene and his driving record is clean the boy simply nodded dryeyed while his mothers weeping filled the room ill take care of her itd be best if you left us alone now all right if you have any questions you can reach me at cop central im lieutenant dallas i know who you are leave us alone now he repeated and went to sit by his mother the kid knows something eve stated as they stepped outside that would be my take maybe alice felt more comfortable talking to him than other members of the family they were pretty close in age brothers and sisters squabble but they confide in each other i wouldnt know she started her car pined for coffee where the hell do you live peabody why ill drop you at home you can catch some sleep report to central at eleven is that what youre going to do catch some sleep yeah that was probably a lie but it served her purposes which way i live on houston eve winced only a little well if its going to be inconvenient it might as well be way inconvenient she headed south houston peabody you bohemian it was my cousins place when she decided to move to colorado and weave rugs i took it over rent control a likely story you probably spend all your free time hanging at poetry bars and performance art clubs actually i prefer the mating lounges better food youd probably get more sex if you didnt think about it so much no i tried that too she yawned abruptly and hugely sorry youre entitled when you report in check on the status of the autopsy i want to be sure theres nothing weird in the tox report and make sure to change out of that silly dress peabody shifted on her seat its not that silly a couple guys at the aquarian seemed to like it so did roarke yeah he mentioned it jaw dropped peabody swiveled her head he did really foolishness eve thought helped soothe he said something about you looking appealing so i hit him just in case appealing jesus peabody patted her heart im going to have to dig through some of the other stuff my mothers made for me appealing she sighed roarke doesnt have any brothers cousins uncles does he as far as i know peabody hes one of a kind o o she found him dozing not in bed but on the sofa in the sitting area of the master suite the moment she stepped into the room his eyes opened youve had a long rough one lieutenant he reached out a hand come here im going to grab a shower some coffee ive got some calls to make hed tagged onto the police scanner and knew exactly what shed been dealing with come here he repeated and closed his hand over hers when she reluctantly obliged are the calls going to make any difference if you make them an hour from now no but so he tugged until she tumbled onto the sofa with him because her struggle was only halfhearted he managed to snuggle her down beside him quickly and wrapping an arm around her he kissed her hair sleep a little he said quietly theres no need to exhaust yourself she was so young roarke i know close it off just for a little while the data franks log did you find anything well talk about it after you sleep an hour just an hour linking her fingers with his she let herself go under chapter five sleep helped so did the hot shower and the food roarke ordered up eve shoveled eggs into her mouth as she studied the data hed unearthed onscreen more like a diary than an investigative log she decided lots of personal comments and obviously he was worried about alice im not sure how deeply theyve influenced her mind or hurt her heart he was thinking like a grandfather not like a cop you got this off his home unit yes he had it coded and passkeyed i suspect he didnt want his wife stumbling across it if he had it coded how did you access roarke took a cigarette from a carved box studied it you dont really want me to explain that do you lieutenant no eve forked up more eggs guess not still his personal thoughts and worries arent going to be a lot of help i need to know what he found out and how far his private investigation went before he died theres more roarke scrolled over dates there he talks about tailing selina cross and lists some of her associates but theres nothing there he suspects shes dealing illegals he believes shes holding unacceptable ceremonies in her club and perhaps her home he observes suspicious characters coming and going but he bases it all on emotion no facts frank had been off the streets too long eve set her plate aside and rose if he didnt want to involve cops why the hell didnt he at least hire a pi to handle the legwork whats this frowning she stepped closer to the screen i think she made me cant be sure but its almost as though shes leading me along now im going to have to make a move soon alice is terrified begging me to stay away from cross and from her the poor kid spends too much time with that isis character isis may be a harmless weirdo but she cant be a good influence on alice ive told sally im working late tonight im going in cross spends thursday nights at the club the apartment should be empty if i can get inside and find anything anything at all to prove alice saw a child murdered i can report to whitney anonymously shes going to pay for what she and her filthy lover did to my little girl one way or the other shes going to pay christ nighttime breaking and entering illegal search and seizure frustrated eve dragged both hands through her hair what the hell was he thinking he had to know that anything he found would get tossed out in court hed never nail them this way i have a feeling he wasnt worried about court eve he wanted justice and now hes dead isnt he and sos alice wheres the rest roarke scrolled to the last entry securitys too tight on the building couldnt get through it ive been off the streets too damn long i may have to tag someone to help me on this after all im going to see that witch pays if its the last thing i do thats all on this that entry was logged on the night before he died there may be more under a different code so he hadnt made her pay eve thought and he hadnt had time to get help not enough time she thought again with twin surges of relief and sorrow the entries went a long way toward clearing both frank and feeney but you dont think so you dont think theres anything else no i dont theres the timing of course and he wasnt that clever with electronics roarke explained it was childs play to find this still well look itll take some time to break through if theres anything there and itll have to be later i have several meetings this morning she turned to him odd she realized shed forgotten for a moment he wasnt working with her his business and the direction of it was in a much different sphere from hers so many billions so little time how true but i should be able to fiddle a bit more this evening she knew he hadnt so much as glanced at the stock reports or taken the morning calls that never failed to come in daily im taking up a lot of your time you are indeed he came around the console leaned back against it and the payment will be your time lieutenant a day or two away when we can both manage it then his smile faded he took her hand ran his thumb over the carving on her wedding ring eve i dont like to interfere with your work but ill ask you to be particularly careful in this matter a good cops always careful no roarke said looking into her eyes shes not shes courageous shes smart shes driven but shes not always careful dont worry ive dealt with worse than selina cross she kissed him lightly ive got to go in check on some reports ill try to let you know if im going to be late do that he murmured and watched her go she was wrong he mused he doubted very much if shed ever dealt with worse than selina cross and he had no intention of letting her deal with it alone moving to the link roarke called his assistant and arranged to have all his offplanet and outoftown trips for the next month canceled he intended to stay very close to home and his wife o o no drugs eve stated as she looked over the toxicology report on alice no alcohol she wasnt under the influence but you heard her talking to someone who wasnt there and she runs out into the path of an oncoming cab shes worked herself up into a state of terror then was triggered by the chanting on the phone they knew how to get to her how to manipulate her its not illegal to chant over a link no eve considered but is it illegal to threaten to harm over a public transmitter thats reaching peabody returned and its only a misdemeanor its a start if we manage to tie the transmission to selina cross we can hassle her in any case i think its time we met how about a little trip to hell peabody ive been dying to go who isnt but before she could rise feeney burst into her office his eyes were shadowed his face unshaven why are you primary on alices case a traffic accident why the hell is a homicide lieutenant handling a traffic fatality feeney she was my goddaughter you didnt even call me i heard it on the goddamn news im sorry i didnt know sit down feeney he jerked away when she touched his arm i dont need to sit down i want answers dallas i want some fucking answers peabody eve murmured and waited until her aide had gone out and closed the door i am sorry feeney i didnt know you were her godfather i spoke to her mother and her brother and simply assumed they would let the rest of the family know brendas under sedation feeney tossed out what the hell do you expect she lost her father and her daughter within days of each other jamies only sixteen by the time he called a doctor and saw to his mother got a hold of sally id already heard it onscreen jesus jesus she was just a kid he turned away pulled at his hair i used to give her piggyback rides sneak her candy this was what it was like to lose someone you loved she thought and was grateful she loved so few please sit down feeney you shouldnt have come in today i said i dont need to sit down his voice leveled as he turned back to study her i want an answer dallas why are you on alices accident she couldnt afford to hesitate couldnt afford not to lie peabody was a witness she began grateful she could give him that much she was on a free evening and shed been to a club she saw the accident it shook her feeney and she called me it was kneejerk i guess i couldnt be sure what had happened so i told her to relay to dispatch to secure the scene and i responded since i had and i had all the data i notified next of kin i figured it would be easier on the family if i handled it she moved her shoulders bitterly ashamed at using old friends i thought it was the least i could do for frank he never took his eyes off her face is that all of it what else is there listen i just got the tox report she wasnt using feeney she wasnt drunk maybe she was still upset about frank or something else i dont know could be she didnt even see the damn cab it was a lousy night fog rain the bastard was speeding wasnt he no she couldnt give him anyone to blame couldnt offer even that prickly comfort he was within the limit his records clean and so was the onsite drug and alcohol feeney she bolted out in front of him and there was nothing he could do i want you to understand that i talked with the driver myself and i investigated the scene it wasnt his fault it wasnt anyones it had to be someones he thought he couldnt lose two people back to back for no reason i want to talk to peabody give her a little time will you layers of guilt added onto the burden she already carried it really wrecked her id really like to keep her focused on something else until she settles with it he drew a deep breath shuddered it out beneath his tearing grief was gratitude that someone he trusted would care for his godchild youll close it then personally and give me all the data ill close it feeney i promise you he nodded rubbed his hands over his face okay im sorry i jumped you its all right it doesnt matter she hesitated then put her hand on his arm squeezed lightly go home feeney you dont want to be here today i guess i will he put a hand on the door she was a sweetheart dallas he said quietly my god i dont want to go to another funeral when he left eve sank into her chair misery and guilt and anger twisted around her throat like barbs she rose again grabbed her bag she was she told herself in the perfect mood to meet selina cross o o how do you want to play it peabody asked as they pulled up in front of an elegant old building downtown straight i want her to know alice talked to me and that i suspect her of harassment dealing and conspiracy to murder if shes got any brains shell know i dont have anything solid but ill give her something to think about eve stepped out of the car ran her gaze over the building with its carved glass windows and grinning gargoyles she lives here shes not hurting financially were going to have to find out just where she gets her money i want everything on record peabody and keep your eyes open i want your impressions ill give you one right now peabody clamped her recorder onto her uniform jacket but kept her eyes on the topmost window of the building a wide round glass intricately carved thats another inverted pentagram satanic symbol and those gargoyles dont look friendly she smiled wanly you ask me they look hungry impressions peabody try to keep the fantasies down to a minimum eve approached the security screen please state your name and your business lieutenant eve dallas and aide nypsd she held up her badge to be scanned to see selina cross are you expected oh i dont think shell be surprised one moment while she waited eve studied the street there was plenty of pedestrian and vehicular traffic she noted but most of those who walked used the other side of the street and many of those eyed her and the building warily oddly there wasnt a single glida grill or street hawker in sight you are cleared to enter lieutenant please proceed to elevator one it is already programmed fine eve looked up caught the shadow of movement behind the topmost glass look official peabody she murmured as they approached the heavily grilled front doors were under observation the grills slid back locks snicked open the light on a recessed security panel blinked from red to green a lot of hardware for an apartment building peabody commented and ignoring the fluttering in her stomach stepped in behind eve like a viewing parlor the lobby area was heavily into red a twoheaded serpent slithered over the bloodred carpet the gold threads of its eyes glinted as it watched a blackrobed figure slice a curved knife over the throat of a white goat lovely art eve lifted a brow as peabody carefully picked her way around the snake wool doesnt bite you cant be too careful she glanced back as they stepped to the elevator i really hate snakes my brother used to catch them out in the woods and chase me with them always had a phobia the ride up was smooth and fast but it gave eve enough time to detect yet another security camera in the small blackmirrored car the doors opened into a spacious foyer with floors of black marble twin red velvet settees flanked an archway and boasted carved arms of snarling wolves a floral arrangement speared out of a pot shaped like a boars head wolfbane peabody said quietly belladonna foxglove skullcap peyote she shrugged at eves considering look my mothers an amateur botanist i can tell you thats not your usual flower arrangement but the usual is so tedious isnt it they got their first facetoface look at selina cross exactly as she wanted to be seen flanked by the archway in a snug black dress that brushed the floor her feet bare with the toenails painted a violent red she posed and smiled her skin was vampire white the slash of red over her full lips glossy as fresh blood her eyes glittered green and feline in a narrow undoubtedly witchlike face that wasnt beautiful but was eerily compelling her hair fell black against black from that rigid center part to her waist the hand she gestured with held rings on every finger and her thumb a silver chain was attached to each and twisted into an intricate mesh over the back of her hand lieutenant dallas and officer peabody isnt it what interesting visitors on such a dull day will you come in to my parlor are you alone ms cross it would simplify this if we could speak with mr alban as well oh what a shame she turned silks whispering and slipped through the arch albans busy this morning sit down she gestured again encompassing a generous room crowded with furniture every seat boasted the heads or claws or beaks of some predator can i offer you something well skip the refreshments considering it apt eve chose a chair with the arms of a hound not even coffee that is your drink isnt it then she shrugged slicked a fingertip over the pentagram above her eyebrow but suit yourself with that same studied skill she lowered to a curved settee that stood on cloven feet and draped her long arms over the back now what can i do for you alice lingstrom was killed early this morning yes i know she continued to smile pleasantly as though discussing the nice run of weather i could tell you i witnessed the accident through my scrying mirror but i doubt youd believe that of course im not one to disdain technology and often watch the news and other forms of entertainment onscreen the informations been public for hours you knew her of course she was a pupil of mine for a time a dissatisfactory one as it turned out alice complained to you about my tutelage it wasnt formed as a question but she waited as if for an answer if you mean she reported to me that she was drugged sexually abused and was a witness to an atrocity then yes she complained drugs sex and atrocities selina let out a low purring laugh what an imagination our little alice had a shame she couldnt use it to broaden her vision how is your imagination lieutenant dallas she flicked the hand gloved with mesh in the small marble fireplace flames burst to life peabody jolted didnt manage to muffle a yelp but neither woman acknowledged her they continued to stare unblinking at each other or may i call you eve no you can call me lieutenant dallas its a little warm for a fire dont you think and a bit early in the day for parlor tricks i like it warm you have excellent nerves lieutenant i also have low tolerance for grifters and dealers and child killers am i all of that selina tapped her sharp red nails on the back of the settee her only outward sign of annoyance in eves lack of response prove it i will where were you last night between the hours of one and three am i was here in my ritual room with alban and a young initiate we call lobar we were engaged in a private sexual ceremony from midnight until nearly dawn lobar is young and enthusiastic ill want to talk to them both you can contact lobar any evening between eight and eleven at our club as for alban i dont keep his schedule but he is generally here or at the club most nights unless you believe in magic lieutenant youre wasting your time i could hardly have been here fucking two very entertaining men and out luring poor alice to her death is that what you consider yourself a magician eve glanced toward the still burning fire with a mild sneer thats nothing more than trickery and distraction of the eye you can be licensed to juggle on the streets for two thousand credits a year selinas muscles quivered as she sat forward her eyes were burning now as the fire did i am a high priestess of the dark lord our numbers are legion and i have powers that would make you weep i dont cry easily ms cross ah a temper eve thought with satisfaction and easily ruffled pride youre not dealing with an impressionable eighteenyearold girl now or her frightened grandfather which one of your legion called alice last night and played a tape of chanting threats i have no idea what youre talking about and youre beginning to bore me the black feather on the windowsill was a nice touch or simulated feather i should say but she wouldnt have known that are you into droid pets ms cross idly selina lifted a hand skimmed it through then down her hair i dont care for pets at all no no cats and ravens how predictable that would be alice believed you were a shapeshifter eve said and watched as selina smiled care to give us a demonstration of that little talent selinas nails began to tap again eves tone was as insulting as a backhanded slap im not here to entertain you or to be mocked by your small mind is that what you call it were you entertaining alice with cats and birds and threatening chants over her link how could she feel safe in her own home was she such a threat to you she was nothing to me but an unfortunate failure you were seen selling illegals to frank wojinski the abrupt switch had selina blinking when her lips curved now the smile didnt reach her eyes if that were true we wouldnt be having this discussion here in my home but in interview im an herbalist again licensed and i often sell or trade perfectly legal substances do you grow your herbs here as a matter of fact i do and distill my potions and medications id like to see them why dont you show me your work area youll need a warrant for that and we both know you havent cause for one youre right i guess thats why frank didnt bother with a warrant eve rose slowly spoke softly you knew he was onto you but did you suspect he might get in here inside you didnt see that in your magic ball did you eve said when selinas breath shortened and thickened what would you think if i told you he was in your house and he documented what he saw and what he found you have nothing nothing selina sprang to her feet he was an aging man with slow wits and bad reflexes i made him for a cop the first time he tried to tail me he was never in my home he told you nothing when he was alive and he cant tell you anything now no dont you believe in talking to the dead ms cross i make my living at it and do you think i dont recognize smoke and mirrors lieutenant her spectacular breasts strained against the material of her dress as she struggled to even her breathing alice was a foolish girl who believed she could flirt with dark forces then run back to her pathetic white magic and tidy little family she paid the price for her ignorance and her cowardice but not at my hand i have nothing more to say to you thatll do for now peabody she started toward the archway your fires going out ms cross she said mildly pretty soon youre going to have nothing but a mess of ashes selina stood where she was shaking with rage when the door closed and security engaged she balled her hands into fists and screamed with temper a panel on the wall slid open the man who stepped out was tall and golden his chest gleamed and rippled with muscle the tattoo over his heart was of a horned goat he wore only an open black robe carelessly belted at the waist with silver cord alban selina ran to him threw her arms around him there my love his voice was deep soothing on the hand that stroked her hair was a large silver ring carved with an inverted pentagram you mustnt unbalance your chakras fuck my chakras she was weeping now wildly pounding on him like a child in a blind tantrum i hate her i hate her she has to be punished with a sigh he let her go to storm the room cursing smashing crockery he knew the temper would pass more quickly if he stood back and let it purge i want her dead alban dead i want her to suffer agonies to scream for mercy to bleed and writhe and bleed she insulted me she challenged me she all but laughed in my face she doesnt believe selina she has no vision exhausted as always after a fit of temper she collapsed on the settee cops ive hated them all my life i know he picked up a tall slim bottle poured her some thick cloudy liquid well have to be careful with her shes very highprofile he passed her a chalice but well think of something wont we of course we will she smiled again sipped slowly at the brew something very special the master would want something inventive in her case now she laughed fullthroated head thrown back the police had been the bane of her existence until shed discovered a higher power well make a believer out of her wont we alban shell believe she drank deeply now felt the lovely haze coat her tangled emotions and let the chalice drop come here and take me eyes glittering she slid down force me and when he covered her body with his she turned her head bared her teeth and dug them into his shoulder to draw blood hurt me she demanded with pleasure he replied and when they lay apart their violent passion sated he lay quiet beside her she would revive now he knew she would cool and she would calm and she would think we should perform a ceremony tonight call together the entire coven for a black mass we need power alban she isnt weak and she wants to destroy us she wont with affection now he stroked her cheek she cant after all shes only a cop with no past and a limited future but youre right of course well call the coven well perform the rite and i think well provide lieutenant dallas with a distraction or two she wont have the time or inclination to worry overmuch about little alice for long fresh arousal rippled through her a dark wave that flooded into her eyes who dies my love he lifted her speared her sighed when her muscles clamped viciously around him you have only to choose o o you really pissed her off peabody struggled to ignore the light sweat of fear that dried on her skin as eve drove away from the building that was the idea now that i know control isnt her strong point ill be sure to piss her off again shes all ego eve decided imagine thinking wed fall for a secondrate trick like the fire yeah peabody managed a sickly smile imagine eve tucked her tongue in her cheek and decided against ragging on her aide since were into witches lets swing by and check out this isis at spirit quest she slid her eyes right well maybe shed rag just a little you can probably buy a talisman or some herbs she said solemnly you know to ward off evil peabody shifted in her seat feeling foolish wasnt nearly as bad as worrying about being cursed dont think i wont after we deal with isis we can grab a pizza sub with plenty of garlic garlics for vampires oh we can have roarke get us a couple of his antique guns with silver bullets werewolves dallas amused at both of them now peabody rolled her eyes a lot of good youre going to do if we have to defend ourselves against witchcraft what does it to witches then i dont know peabody admitted but im damn sure going to find out chapter six shopping wasnt something eve considered one of the small pleasures in life she wasnt a browser a window shopper or a electronic catalogue surfer she avoided whenever possible the shops and boutiques in above and below manhattan she shuddered at the very thought of a trip to one of the sky malls she imagined her outward resistance to the consumption of merchandise was the primary reason isis pegged her as a cop the minute she stepped into spirit quest as stores went eve considered it tolerable she wasnt interested in the crystals and cards the statues and candles even though they were attractively displayed the background music was soft more of a murmur than a tune and the light was allowed to play over the edges of raw crystals and polished stones in pretty rainbows the place smelled she thought not offensively of forest if witches were what she was dealing with eve decided isis and selina couldnt have been more dramatically opposed in appearance selina had been pale and slim and feline isis was an exotic amazon of a female with gypsy curls of flaming red round black eyes and cheekbones that could have carved wood her skin was the soft gold of a mixedrace heritage her features bold and broad eve measured her at just over six feet and a wellpacked and curvy oneseventy she wore a loose flowing robe of blinding white with a belt studded with rough stones her right arm was wound with gold coils from elbow to shoulder and her large hands winked and flashed with as many as a dozen rings welcome the voice suited her oddly accented and throaty her lips curved but it was a smile of grieving rather than pleasure alices cop eve lifted a brow as she took out her shield she figured she looked like a cop and since roarke her face had been in the media relentlessly dallas youd be isis then i would youll wish to talk excuse me she walked to the door graceful eve observed the way an athlete is graceful she turned an oldfashioned handlettered sign to closed pulled the shade over the glass of the door and flicked a thumb latch when she turned back her eyes were intense her mouth grim you bring dark shadows into my light she clings such a stench at eves narrowed look she inclined her head selina one moment she went to a wide shelf and began to light candles and cones of incense to purify and shield to protect and defend you have shadows of your own dallas she smiled briefly at peabody and not just your aide im here to talk about alice yes i know and youre impatient with what you see as my foolish window dressing i dont mind every religion should be open to questions and change will you sit she gestured to a corner where two chairs flanked a round table etched with symbols again she smiled at peabody i can get another chair from the back for you no problem ill stand she couldnt help it her gaze traveled the room lingering now and then wistfully on some pretty bauble please feel free to browse were not here to shop eve took a seat shot peabody a withering glance when did you last see or speak with alice on the night she died at what time i believe it was about two am she was already dead isis added folding her large beautiful hands you saw her after she was dead her spirit came to me you find this foolish i understand but i can only tell you what is and was i was asleep and i awoke she was there beside the bed i knew wed lost her she feels shes failed herself her family me her spirit is restless and full of grief her bodys dead isis thats my concern yes isis picked up a smooth rosecolored stone from the table worried it in her hand even for me with my beliefs its difficult to accept her death so young so bright the huge dark eyes swam i loved her very much as you would a younger sister but it wasnt meant for me to save her in this life her spirit will return be reborn i know well meet again fine lets concentrate on this life and this death isis blinked back the tears and managed a quick genuine smile how tedious you must find all of this you have such a logical mind i want to help you dallas for alice for myself perhaps for yourself as well i recognize you i gathered that no from another time another place another plane she spread her hands i last saw alice alive on the day of her grandfathers memorial service she blamed herself was determined to make an atonement shed strayed for a time been misled but she had a strong and bright heart her family was dear to her and she was afraid desperately afraid of what selina would do to her body and soul you know selina cross yes weve met in this life eve asked dryly and made isis smile again in this life and others shes no threat to me but she is dangerous she seduces the weak the confused and those who prefer her way her claims to be a witch she is no witch isis drew her shoulders back lifted her head we who embrace the craft do so in the light and live by an unbreakable code and it harm none she used what pitiful power she has to call on the dark to exploit its violence its ugliness we know what evil is dallas weve both seen it whatever form it takes doesnt change its basic nature we can agree on that why would she harm alice because she could because she would enjoy it theres no question that shes responsible for this death you wont find it easy to prove it you wont give up isis kept her eyes on eves looking long looking deep selina will be surprised and infuriated by your tenacity your strength death offends you and the death of the young cuts small slices from your heart you remember too well but not all you werent born eve dallas but youve become her and she you when you stand by the dead stand for the dead nothing moves you aside his death was necessary for your life stop eve ordered why should it haunt you isiss breathing was slow and thick her eyes dark and clear the choice was made correctly innocence was lost but strength took its place for some it must be so youll need all before this cycle passes a wolf a boar and a silver blade fire smoke and death trust the wolf slay the boar and live abruptly she blinked her eyes clouded as she lifted a hand to press fingers to her temple im sorry i didnt intend she let out a quiet moan squeezed her eyes shut headache vicious excuse me one minute she got shakily to her feet and hurried into the back jesus dallas this is getting way too weird do you know what she was talking about his death was necessary for your life her father eve thought fighting off a shudder a cold room a dark night and blood on the knife clutched in a desperate childs hand no its just jibberish her palms were damp infuriating her these people figure they have to pull out some magic tricks to keep us interested i studied at the kijinsky institute in prague isis said as she stepped back into the room and was studied she set a small cup aside managed a smile as the headache eased my psychic abilities are documented for those who need documentation but i apologize dallas i didnt intend to drift in that manner its very rare for it to happen without my consciously controlling it she came back to sit as she spoke spread the skirts of her robe gracefully it would be sheer hell to be privy to thoughts and memories without some power to control and block i dont like to pry into personal thoughts and it hurts she added gently rubbing her temple again i want to help you do what alice wanted so she can rest i want for personal and selfish reasons to see selina pay the proper price for what shes responsible for ill do whatever i can whatever youll allow me to do to help you trust didnt come easily for eve and she would check very thoroughly into isiss background but for now shed use her tell me what you know about selina cross i know shes a woman without conscience or morals i would think your term would be sociopath but i find that too simple and too clean for what she is i prefer the more direct term of evil shes a clever woman with a skill for reading weaknesses as for her power what she can read or see or do i cant say what about alban about him i know next to nothing she keeps him close i assume hes her lover and she finds him useful or she would have dispatched him by now this club of hers isis smiled thinly i dont frequent such establishments but you know of it one hears rumors gossip she lifted her broad shoulders dark ceremonies black masses the drinking of blood human sacrifice rape murder infanticide the calling up of demons then she sighed but then you might hear such talk about wiccans from those who have no understanding of the craft and who see black draped crones and eye of newt when they think of witches alice claimed to have seen a child murdered yes and i believe she did she couldnt have invented such a thing she was in shock and ill when she came to me isis pressed her lips together shuddered out a breath i did what i could for her such as encouraging her to report the incident to the police that was for her to decide isis lifted her chin again met the iced anger in eves eyes i was more concerned with her emotional and spiritual survival the child was already lost i had hoped to save alice from the same fate her eyes dropped now and dampened and i regret bitterly that i didnt act differently and that in the end i failed her perhaps it was pride she looked at eve again youd understand the power and the deception of personal pride i thought i could handle it that i was wise enough strong enough i was wrong so dallas to atone ill do anything you ask avail you of all knowledge and any power the goddess grants me information will do eve angled her head selina treated us to a little demonstration of what shed call power it impressed peabody it caught me off guard peabody muttered studying isis warily she didnt think she was up for another demonstration to peabodys surprise and eves isis threw back her magnificent head and laughed it was like hearing silver buoys clang in pearly fog should i call up the wind with one hand pressed to her breast she chuckled summon the dead strike the cold fire really dallas you believe in none of that so it would be a waste of my time and energy but perhaps youd be interested in observing one of our gatherings we have one at the end of next week i can arrange it ill think about it you smirk isis said lightly yet the pledge you wear on your finger carries the ancient symbol of protection what your wedding ring dallas with that quiet smile isis lifted eves left hand its carved with an old celtic design for protection baffled eve studied the pretty etching in the slim gold ring its just a design its a very specific and powerful one to give the wearer protection from harm amused she raised her brows i see you didnt know is it so surprising really your husband has the blood of the celts and you lead a very precarious life roarke loves you very much and you wear the symbol of it i prefer facts to superstitions eve said and rose as you should isis agreed but you will be welcome at the next gathering should you choose to attend roarke will also be welcome she smiled at peabody and your aide will you accept a gift its against the rules and rules are to be respected rising isis moved behind a display counter took out a small clear bowl with a wide lip then perhaps you will buy this i have after all lost potential business by closing to speak to you twenty dollars fair enough eve dug into her pocket for credits what is it well call it a worry bowl in this you place all your pain your sorrow your worries set it aside and sleep without shadows such a deal eve set the credits on the counter and waited for isis to wrap the bowl in protective paper o o eve got home early a rarity she thought she could dive into work in the quiet of her home office she could get past summerset easily enough she mused as she pulled up at the end of the drive the butler would simply sniff and ignore her shed have a couple of hours clear to run data on isis and to contact dr miras office and make an appointment with the psychiatrist it would eve decided be interesting to get miras take on personalities such as selina cross and isis eve got no farther than the front door when her plans disintegrated music pounded blasting out of the front parlor like compact nuclear explosions staggering against the waves eve slapped her hands over her ears and shouted she didnt have to be told it was mavis no one else in her sphere would play clashing discordant notes at that decibel when she reached the doorway the volume was still revved high her shouted demands reached neither the remote nor the single occupant of the room alone decked out in a micro robe of searing magenta that echoed the spiral curls shooting out of her head mavis freestone lounged on the couch doing the impossible she slept like a baby jesus christ since vocal commands were useless eve risked her eardrums and dropped her hands to fumble with the recessed control unit off off off she shouted stabbing buttons the noise shut down in midblast and made her moan maviss eyes popped open hey hows it going what eve shook her head to try to dispel the highpitched ringing what that was a new group i picked up this morning mayhem pretty decent what with a chuckle mavis unfolded her neat little body and bounced to a cabinet looks like you could use a drink dallas i must have zoned up pretty late the last few nights wanted to talk to you about stuff your mouth is moving eve observed are you talking to me it wasnt that loud have a drink summerset said it would be all right if i hung for awhile didnt know when youd check in for reasons that eluded eve the stiffnecked butler appeared to have a major crush on mavis hes probably in his cage composing odes to your legs hey its nothing sexual he just likes me so mavis clunked her glass against eves roarkes not around right with that music blasting eve snorted sipped figure it out well thats good because i wanted to roll it out with you but she sat twisted the glass in her hands and said nothing whats the problem you and leonardo have a fight or something no no you cant really fight with leonardo hes too sweet hes in milan for a few days some fashion deal why didnt you go with him eve sat rested her booted feet on the priceless coffee table crossed her ankles ive got the gig at the down and dirty i wouldnt let crack down after he bailed me hmm eve rolled her shoulders and began to relax maviss career as a performer it was difficult to use the term singer when defining maviss talents was moving along there had been some serious roadblocks but theyd been overcome i didnt figure youd work there much longer not with a recording contract yeah well thats the thing the contract you know after finding out jess was using me and you and roarke for his mind games i didnt figure the demo id cut with him would go anywhere it was good mavis flashy unique thats why it got picked up is it she rose again a tiny woman with wild hair i found out today that roarke owns the recording company that offered the contract gulping her drink she paced away i know we go back a ways dallas a long ways and i appreciate you putting roarke up to it but i dont feel right about it i wanted to thank you she turned then her silver eyes tragic and bleak and tell you that im going to turn it down eve pursed her lips mavis i dont know what the hell youre talking about are you telling me that roarke the guy who lives here is producing your disc its his company eclectic it produces everything from classical to brain drain its the company totally mag which was why i was so wired up about the deal eclectic eve mused the company it sounded just like him i dont know anything about it i didnt ask him to do anything mavis she blinked lowered slowly to the arm of a chair you didnt solid i didnt ask eve repeated and he didnt tell me which was also just like him id have to say that if his company is offering you a contract its because roarke or whoever hes put in charge of that stuff figures youre worth it mavis took slow breaths shed worked herself up to the selfless sacrifice unwilling to take advantage of friendship now she teetered maybe he arranged it like a favor eve cocked a brow roarkes business is business id say he figures youre going to make him richer and if he did do it as a favor which i doubt then youll just have to prove to him that youre worth it wont you mavis yeah she let out a long breath im going to kick ass you wait and see her smile beamed out maybe you could come by the d and d tonight ive got some new material and roarke could get another closeup of his latest investment have to pass tonight ive got work ive got to check out the athame mavis grimaced what the hell are you going there for nasty place you know it only by rep and the reps down below bad news someone ive got to talk to there connected with a case im working on she considered there was no one she knew more likely to have a line on the unusual know any witches mavis yeah sort of a couple of servers down at the blue squirrel were into it brushed a few way back when i was on the grift you believe in that stuff chanting and spells and palm reading mavis cocked her head and looked thoughtful its major bullshit you never fail to surprise me eve decided i figured youd be into it i ran a con once spirit guide i was ariel reincarnation of a fairy queen youd be amazed how many straights paid up for me to contact their dead relatives or tell them their future to demonstrate she let her head fall back her eyes fluttered her mouth went slack slowly her arms lifted palms turned up i feel a presence strong seeking sorrowful her voice had deepened attained a faint accent there are dark forces working against you they hide from you wait to do harm beware she dropped her arms and grinned so you tell the mark you need to have trust in order to offer protection from the dark forces all they have to do is put say a thousand cash cash is all that works in an envelope seal it you make sure you tell them to seal it with this special wax youre going to sell them then youre going to do this cool chant over it and bury the envelope in a secret place under the dark of the moon after the moons cycled youll dig up the envelope and give it back the dark forces will have been vanquished thats it people just hand over the money well you string it out a little longer do some research so you can hit them with names and events and shit but basically yeah people want to believe why because life can really suck o o yes eve thought when she was alone again she supposed it could hers certainly had for long stretches of time now she was living in a mansion with a man who for some reason loved her she didnt always understand her life or the man who now shared it but she was adjusting so well in fact that she decided not to go bury herself in work but to go outside into the golden autumn evening and take an hour for herself she was used to streets and sidewalks crowded skyglides jammed people movers the sheer space roarke could command always astonished her his grounds were like a welltended park quiet and lush with the foliage of rich mans trees in the dazzling flame of fall the scents were of spicy flowers the faintly smoky fragrance of october in the country overhead the sky was nearly empty of traffic and even that was a dignified hum no rumbling airbuses or lumbering tourist blimps over roarkes land and the world she knew and that knew her was beyond the gates and over the walls in the seamy dark here she could forget that for a short time forget new york existed with its death and its anger and its perpetually appealing arrogance she needed the quiet and the air as she walked over thick green grass she worried the ring with its odd symbols on her finger on the north side of the house was an arbor of thin somehow fluid iron the vines twisting and tumbling over it were smothered with flowers wildly red she had married him there in an old traditional ceremony where vows were exchanged and promises made a ceremony she thought now a rite that included music flowers witnesses words that were repeated time after time place after place century through century and so she thought other ceremonies were preserved and repeated and believed to hold power back to cain and abel she mused one had planted crops the other tended a flock and both had offered sacrifice one had been accepted the other dismissed thus she imagined some would say good and evil were born because each needed the balance and challenge of the other so it continued science and logic disproved but the rites continued incense and chanting offerings and the drinking of wine that symbolized blood and the sacrifice of the innocent annoyed with herself she rubbed her hands over her face philosophizing was foolish and useless murder had been done by human force and it was human force that would dispense justice that was after all the ultimate balance of good and evil she sat on the ground under the arbor of bloodred blossoms and drew in the burning scent of evening this isnt usual for you roarke came up quietly behind her so quietly her heart gave a quick trip before he settled on the grass beside her communing with nature maybe i spent too much time inside today she had to smile when he handed her one of the red flowers she twirled it in her fingers watched it spin before she looked over at him he was relaxed his dark hair skimming his shoulders as he leaned back on his elbows legs stretched out feet crossed at the ankles she imagined his pricey and beautiful suit would pick up grass stains that would horrify summerset he smelled male and expensive lust curled comfortably in her stomach successful day she asked well have bread on the table another day or two she flicked her fingers at the ends of his hair its not the money is it its the making it oh its the money his eyes laughed at her and the making it in a quick move she told herself she should have seen coming he reached up cupped the back of her neck and overbalanced her onto him and into a hot kiss hold on she didnt squirm quickly enough and ended up under him i am his mouth fastened greedily on her throat and sent little licks of heat straight down her body to her toes i want to talk to you okay you talk while i get you out of these clothes still wearing your weapon he observed as he hit the release for the harness thinking of zapping some wildlife thats against city ordinance roarke she caught his wrist as his hand closed sneakily over her breast i want to talk to you i want to make love with you lets see who wins it should have infuriated her the fact that he already had her shirt open and her breasts aching then his mouth closed over that sensitive flesh and had her eyes all but crossing in pleasure still it wouldnt do to let him win too easily she let her body go limp moaned and combed her fingers through his hair ran them over his shoulders your jacket she murmured and tugged at it when he shifted to shrug free she had him it was a basic tenet of handtohand never lower your guard she scissored shoved and pinned him with a knee to the crotch and an elbow to the throat youre tricky he calculated he could dislodge the elbow but the knee there were some things a man didnt care to risk he kept his eyes on hers and slowly carefully skimmed his fingertips up her bare torso circled her breast i admire that in a woman youre easy his thumb brushed lightly over her nipple quickening her breath i admire that in a man well youve got me now he unsnapped her waistband teased her stomach muscles to quiver be kind she grinned levered her elbow away to brace her hands on either side of his head i dont think so lowering her head she caught his mouth with hers she heard his breath suck in felt his arms come around her fingers digging in his groan thundered through her pulse your knee he managed hmm lust was fullblown now and raging she shifted lips and teeth to his throat your knee darling she moved to attack his ear and nearly unmanned him its very effective oh sorry snorting she lowered her knee lowered her body and let him roll her over forgot a likely story you may have caused permanent damage aw with a wicked grin she tugged open his trousers i bet we can make it all better his eyes went dark when she stroked him stayed open and on hers when their lips met again this kiss surprisingly tender twined that terrifyingly strong emotion with the easy lust the lower edges of the sky were as wildly red as the blossoms arching over them the shadows were long and soft she could hear birdsong and the whisper of air through the dying leaves the touch of his hands on her was like a miracle chasing away all the ugliness and pain of the world she walked in she didnt even know she needed to be soothed he thought as he stroked and he soothed so that arousal was slow and warm and liquid perhaps neither had he until they held like this touched like this the romance of the air the light the gradual surrender of a strong woman was gloriously seductive he eased into her watching her face as the first orgasm rolled through her feeling her body clench shudder go pliant as his fueled it and filled it she kept her eyes open as fascinated by the intensity of his stare as the silvery ripples of sensation that pumped through her she matched his pace silky and smooth even as her breath tore and when she saw those dark celtic eyes cloud go opaque she framed his face with her hands pulled his mouth to hers to savor his long long groan of release when his body was ranged weightily over hers his face buried in her hair she wrapped her arms companionably around him i let you seduce me uhhuh i didnt want to hurt your feelings thank you you tolerated it all so stoically too its the training cops have to be stoic he reached out ran a hand over the grass and plucked up her shield your badge lieutenant she snickered slapped him on the ass get off me you weigh a ton keep sweettalking me and god knows what could happen lazily he rolled aside noted that the sky had gone from cloudy blue to pearl gray im starving you distracted me and now its well past dinnertime its going to be a little more past she sat up and began to tug on her clothes you had your sex pal now its my turn we have to talk we could talk over dinner he sighed when she sent him a steely stare or we could talk here problem he asked and skimmed his thumb over the dent in her chin lets just say i have some questions i might have the answers what are they to begin with she broke off blew out a breath he was sitting there mostly naked looking very much like a sleek wellsatisfied cat put some clothes on will you youre going to distract me she tossed his shirt at him when he only grinned mavis was waiting for me when i got home oh he shook out his shirt noted its deplorable condition but slipped it on why didnt she stay shes got a gig at the down and dirty roarke why didnt you tell me you own eclectic its not a secret he hitched into his slacks then handed her her weapon harness i own a number of things you know what im talking about she would be patient here eve told herself because it was a delicate area for everyone eclectics offered mavis a contract yes i know i know you know she snapped slapping away his hand as he attempted to smooth down her hair damn it roarke you could have told me id have been prepared when she asked me about it asked you what its a standard contract shell certainly want an agent or representative to look it over but did you do it for me she interrupted and her eyes were focused on his face did i do what for you now her teeth went on edge offer mavis the recording contract he folded his hands cocked his head youre not planning on giving up law enforcement to be a theatrical agent are you no of course not i well then it has nothing to do with you youre not going to sit there and tell me you like maviss music music is a term im not sure applies to maviss talents there she jabbed a finger into his chest that talent however is i believe commercial eclectics purpose is to produce and distribute commercial recording artists she sat back tapped her finger on her knee so its a business thing straight business naturally i take business very seriously you could be snowing me she said after a moment youre good enough yes i am pleased that he was one of the very few who could snow her he smiled at her either way the deals done is that all no she hissed out a breath then leaned forward and kissed him thanks either way youre welcome next i have to hit the athame tonight check a guy out she saw the flicker in his eyes the tensing of his jaw id like you to go with me she had to bite her tongue to keep from snickering when he narrowed those eyes at her just like that its police business but youre not going to make an issue out of it no first because i think you might be helpful and second because it saves time wed argue about it and youd just go anyway this way i ask you to come and you go understanding im in charge clever of you he took her hand and drew her to her feet agreed but after dinner i missed lunch one more thing why did you have a celtic symbol of protection carved into my wedding ring he felt the jolt of surprise covered it smoothly excuse me no you werent quick enough that time it pleased her that shed spotted that minute and masterfully covered awareness you know exactly what im talking about one of our friendly neighborhood witches tagged it today i see caught he realized and he stalled by lifting her hand to examine the ring its an appealing design dont bullshit me roarke im a professional she stepped in until their eyes were level again you buy into it dont you you actually buy all this hocuspocus its not a matter of that he fumbled and knew it when she furrowed her brow youre embarrassed her brow cleared in surprise and amusement youre never embarrassed by anything this is weird and kind of sweet im not embarrassed mortified he decided but not embarrassed im simply not entirely comfortable explaining myself i love you he said and stilled her muffled chuckle you risk your life a life thats essential to me just by being who you are this he brushed his thumb over her wedding band is a small and very personal shield thats lovely roarke really but you dont really believe all that magic nonsense his gaze lifted and as twilight turned to night his eyes glinted in the dark like a wolfs she thought and it was a wolf she remembered she was to trust your world is relatively small eve you couldnt call it sheltered but its limited you havent seen a giants dance or felt the power of the ancient stones you havent run your hand over the ogham carving in the trunk of a tree petrified by time or heard the sounds that whisper through the mist that coats sacred ground baffled she shook her head its what an irish thing if you like though its certainly not limited to a single race or culture you are grounded he ran his hands up her arms to her shoulders almost brutal in your focus and your honesty and ive lived lets say a flexible life i need you and ill use whatever comes to hand to keep you safe he lifted the ring to his lips lets just call it covering the bases okay this was a new aspect of him it would take time to explore but you dont have like a secret room where you dance around naked and chant he tucked his tongue in his cheek i did but i turned it into a den more versatile good thinking okay lets eat thank god he took her hand and tugged her toward the house chapter seven the athame slicked a highgloss sheen over depravity like the babykissing smile on a corrupt politician one scan convinced eve shed have preferred to spend an evening in a lowlevel dive smelling stale liquor and staler sweat dives didnt bother with disguises revolving balconies of smoky glass and chrome trim ringed the main level in two tiers so that those who preferred a loftier view could circle slowly and check out the action the central bar speared out in five points and each was crowded with patrons perched on high stools fashioned to resemble optimistically exaggerated body parts a couple of women decked out in micro skirts sat spreadlegged on a pair of bulging fleshtoned cocks and laughed uproariously a skinheaded bar surfer checked them out by prying his hand down their snug blouses all the walls were mirrored and they pulsed with cloudy red lights some of the tables flanking the dance floor were tubed for privacy some were smoked so that silhouettes of couples in various states of fornication wavered against the glass to entertain the crowd and all were coated with a shiny black lacquer that made them resemble small dark pools on a raised platform the band pumped out harsh and clever rock eve wondered what mavis would think of their wildly painted faces tattooed chests and black leather codpieces studded with silver spikes she decided her friend would probably have dubbed them mag do we sit roarke murmured in her ear or case the joint we go up she decided for the overview whats that smell he stepped onto the autostairs with her cannabis incense sweat she shook her head there was something under that mix something metallic blood fresh blood hed caught it as well that broody underlayer in a place like this they put it in the air vents for mood enhancement charming they stepped off onto the second level here rather than tables and chairs there were floor pillows and thick rugs where patrons could lounge as they sipped their brew of choice those on the prowl leaned on the ornate chrome rail scoping eve imagined for a likely partner to lure into one of the privacy rooms there were a dozen such rooms on this level all with heavy black doors bearing chrome plaques with such names as perdition leviathan and more direct in eves opinion hell and damnation she could too easily imagine the personality type who would find such invitations seductive as she watched a man whose eyes were glazed with liquor began to slurp his way up his companions legs his hand snuck under her crotchskimming skirt as she giggled technically she could have busted them both for engaging in a sexual act in public what would be the point roarke commented reading her perfectly his voice was mild anyone taking a casual glance would have seen a man faintly bored with the ambiance but he was braced to attack or defend whichever became necessary youve got more interesting things to do than toss a horny couple from queens in lockup that wasnt really the point eve thought as the man tugged apart the selfstick fly on his baggy blue trousers how do you know theyre from queens before he could answer a young attractive man with a flowing mane of blond hair and bare gleaming shoulders hunkered down beside the busy couple whatever he said had the woman giggling again then grabbing him into a sloppy kiss why dont you come too she demanded in an unmistakable accent we could have ourselves a manage and twas eve lifted a brow at the borough massacre of the french term and at the easy skill with which the bouncer disengaged himself and led the staggering couple off queens roarke said smug definitely and that was smoothly done he inclined his head as the couple was taken through a narrow door theyd add the price of the privacy room to the tab and no harm done there was a scream of female laughter as the bouncer came back out and secured the door everyones happy queens might not be in the morning the cost of a privacy room in a place like this has to hurt then again she scanned the crowd ages varied from the very young many of whom she was sure had gained entrance with forged id to the very mature but from the wardrobe and jewelry the tone of faces and bodies that slyly hinted at salon enhancements the clientele was solidly upper middleclass money doesnt look to be a problem here ive spotted at least five highcredit licensed companions my count was more like ten she quirked a brow twelve bouncers with lowgrade palm zappers on that count we agree he slipped an arm around her waist and walked to the rail below the dance floor was packed bodies rubbing suggestively against bodies wild laughter bounced off the mirrored walls and shot upward the band was into their performance mode the two female vocalists were being bound to dangling silver chains with leather straps the music pounded heavy on the drums the dancers surged forward closing in as eager as a mob at a lynching audience participation was realized as a man was brought forward and accepted the invitation to strip the women out of their flimsy robes beneath they were naked but for glittery stars over nipples and pubes the crowd began to chant and howl as he coated them with thick oil and they writhed and screamed and begged for mercy thats skirting the line eve muttered performance art roarke watched the man scourge the first vocalist with a velvet cat o nine tails still within the law a simulation of debasement encourages the real thing she set her teeth as a band member began to lightly slap the second vocalist as their voices soared in fervent duet were supposed to be beyond this kind of female exploitation but were not we never are what are they looking for thrills of the cheaper and meaner variety his hand soothed the base of her back she knew what it was to be bound to be abused there was nothing artful and nothing entertaining about it theres no need to watch this eve what makes them do it she wondered what makes a woman let herself be used that way in simulation or in reality why doesnt she kick his balls into his throat shes not you he kissed her on the brow and firmly turned her away the railing was thick with people now straining to see the show as they took a quick tour of the top floor a woman in a sheer black gown glided up to them welcome to the masters level do you have a reservation enough was enough eve thought she flipped out her badge im not interested in what youre selling here fine food and wine the hostess said after only a quick hitch at the sight of police identification youll find were completely within code here lieutenant however if you wish to speak with the owner ive already done that i want to see lobar where do i find him he doesnt work this level with the subtlety and discretion that would have made the poshest maitre d proud the hostess steered eve back toward the stairs if you will go to the main level you will be met and a table provided ill contact lobar and send him to you fine eve studied her saw an attractive woman in her midtwenties why do you do this she asked and glanced at one of the screens where a woman screamed and struggled as she was strapped to a raised slab of marble how can you do this the hostess merely glanced down at eves badge then smiled sweetly how can you do that she countered and drifted away im letting it get to me eve admitted as they headed down to the main level i know better the band continued to play the music a frenzy now but the performance aspect had switched to a huge view screen that filled the wall behind the stage it took eve only a glance to see why the club wasnt licensed for live sex acts but such minor inconveniences were transcended by video the female vocalists were still bound still singing their hearts out without missing a beat but they were behind the stage now on camera along with the man from the audience and a second man who wore nothing but an ornate mask of a boars head pigs was all eve had to say then looked into gleaming red eyes your table is this way the young man smiled revealing gleaming teeth with incisors sharpened to vicious fangs he turned his hair streamed down his naked back black tipped with red like flames he opened the rounded door on a privacy tube stepped in ahead of them im lobar he grinned again ive been expecting you he might have been pretty without the affectation of vampire fangs and demon eyes as it was eve thought he looked like an overgrown child dressed up for halloween if he was of legal age she deduced it couldnt have been by much his chest was thin and hairless his arms slim as a girls but she didnt think it was the red tint of his eyes that took away his innocence it was the look in them sit down lobar sure he dropped into a chair ill have a drink youre buying he told eve you want my time during work hours you gotta pay he punched out a selection on the electronic menu adjusted his chair so that he could see the view screen great show tonight eve glanced over the script could use work she said dryly you got id lobar he peeled his lips back from his fangs lifted his hands palm out not on me unless you think i got secret pockets in my skin whats your legal name his smile disappeared and his eyes were suddenly the sulky eyes of a child its lobar thats who i am i dont have to answer your questions you know im cooperating youre a real sterling citizen eve waited while his drink slid out of the serving slot another show she mused as the heavy glass chalice smoked with some murky gray brew alice lingstrom what do you know about her not much except she was a dumb bitch he sipped the drink she hung around for awhile then went crying off it was fine with me the master doesnt need any weaklings the master he sipped again smiled satan he said relishing it you believe in satan sure he leaned forward slid his hand with its long blackpainted nails toward eve and he believes in you careful roarke murmured youre too young and stupid to loose a hand lobar snorted but he slid his hand back again your watchdog he said to eve your rich watchdog we know who you are he added fixing his red eyes on roarke big fucking deal you dont have any power here and neither does your cop bitch im not his cop bitch eve said mildly shooting a warning glance at roarke im my own cop bitch and as to power she leaned back well ive got the power to take you down to cop central and slap you into interview she smiled letting her gaze run over the naked chest and gleaming nipple rings the guys would just love to get a load of you cute isnt he roarke in an apprentice demon sort of fashion you must have a very interesting dentist as it was a privacy booth he took out a cigarette lighted it i could use one of those lobar said could you with a shrug roarke slid another cigarette onto the table when lobar picked it up looked at him expectantly roarke grinned sorry you want a light i assumed youd shoot flame out of your fingertips i dont do tricks for straights lobar leaned forward sucking on the filter as roarke flicked his lighter at the tip look you want to know about alice and i cant help you she wasnt my type too inhibited and always asking questions sure i banged her a couple of times but those were like community fucks you know nothing personal and on the night she was killed he blew out smoke sucked more in he hadnt had real tobacco before and the expensive drug made him lightheaded and relaxed never saw her i was busy i had a private ceremony with selina and alban sexual rites after we fucked around most of the night he took another deep drag holding it in as he would a toke from a prime joint then exhaling lustily through his nostrils selina likes double bangers and when shes done she likes to watch and get herself off was dawn easy before shed had enough and the three of you were together the entire night no one left even for a few minutes he moved his bony shoulders thats the thing about three people no waiting he lowered his gaze suggestively to her breasts want to try it you dont want to solicit a cop lobar and i like men not skinny boys in silly costumes who called alice and played the recording the chant he was sulky again his ego pricked if shed come alone he thought hed have shown her a few things a bitch was a bitch as far as he was concerned badge or no badge i dont know what youre talking about alice was nothing nobody gave a shit about her her grandfather did heard he was dead too the red eyes gleamed old fart desk cop button pusher means nothing to me enough to know he was a cop eve put in a cop who rode a desk howd you know that lobar realizing his mistake he crushed out what was left of the cigarette in quick vicious little jabs somebody mustve mentioned it he exposed his fangs in a wide grin probably alice did while i was banging her doesnt say much for your performance rating does it if she was talking about her grandfather when you were banging her i heard it somewhere all right he grabbed his drink gulped deeply whats the big fucking deal where he was old anyway did you ever see him in here i see a lot of people in here i dont remember any old cop he waved a hand place rocks like this most every night how the hell do i know who comes in selina hired me to keep the occasional asshole in line not to remember faces selinas got quite the enterprise going here is she still dealing she deal for you his eyes went sly i get power from my beliefs i dont need illegals have you ever participated in human sacrifice ever slice up a child for your master lobar he polished off his drink thats an outsiders hallucination people like you like to make satanists out to be monsters people like us roarke murmured skimming his gaze over lobar from the firetipped hair to the nipple rings yes obviously were biased when anyone can see youre simply devout look its a religion and weve got freedom of religion in this country you want to push your god down our throats well we reject him we reject him and all his weakkneed creeds and well rule in hell he shoved back from the table and stood ive got nothing more to say all right eve spoke quietly looking up into his eyes but you think about this lobar people are dead somebodys going to be next it might just be you his lips trembled then firmed it might just be you he shot back and slammed out of the booth what an attractive young man roarke commented i do believe hell be a delightful addition to hell that may be where hes going after a quick glance around eve nudged the empty glass into her bag i want to find out where he came from i can run his prints at home fine he rose took her arm but i want a shower first this place leaves something nasty coated on the skin i cant argue with that o o robert allen mathias eve stated reading data off her monitor turned eighteen six months ago born in kansas city kansas son of jonathan and elaine mathias both of whom are baptist deacons a pk roarke put in preachers kid some can rebel in extreme manners looks like little bobby has history of problems eve continued i got his juvie file here petty theft break in truancy assault ran away from home four times before he hit thirteen at fifteen after a joy ride that landed him a grand theft auto his parents had him termed legally incorrigible did a year at a state school which ended with him being kicked to a state institution after an attempted rape on a teacher bobbys a sweetheart roarke murmured i knew there was a reason i wanted to jab his little red eyes out they kept latching onto your breasts yeah unconsciously eve rubbed a hand over them as if to erase something vile psych profiles pretty much what youd expect sociopathic tendencies lack of control violent mood swings subject harbors deep unresolved resentment toward parents and authority figures particularly female displays both fear and resentment toward females intelligence rating high violence quotient high subject displays complete lack of conscience and an abnormal interest in the occult then what is he doing out on the street why isnt he in treatment because its the law you have to kick him when he turns eighteen until you nail him as an adult hes clear eve puffed out her cheeks blew out the air hes a dangerous little bastard but theres not much i can do about him he corroborates selinas statement for the night of alices death hed have been instructed to roarke pointed out still sticks unless i can break it she pushed back ive got his current address i can check it out knock on doors see if his neighbors can give me something on him if i can get him in on something lay on some pressure i think little bobby would break otherwise otherwise we keep digging she rubbed her eyes well deal with him sooner or later hell revert to type bust somebodys face assault some woman kick the wrong ass then well lock him in a cage your job is miserable most of the time she agreed then looked over her shoulder are you tired depends he glanced at the screen where lobars data scrolled he had an image of her diving deeper spending the quiet hours of night wading through the muck he didnt bother to sigh what do you need you she could feel her color rise as he lifted a curious brow i know its late and its been a long day i guess i was thinking of it kind of like the shower something to wash away the grime embarrassed she turned back stared hard at the screen stupid it was always hard for her to ask he mused for anything not the most romantic proposal ive ever had he laid his hands on her shoulders massaged gently but far from stupid disengage he ordered and the screen went dark he turned her chair around drew her to her feet come to bed roarke she put her arms around him held tight she couldnt explain how or why the images shed seen that night had left something inside her shaky with him she didnt have to i love you smiling a little she lifted her head and looked into his eyes its getting easier to say i think im starting to like it with a short laugh he pressed a kiss to her chin come to bed he repeated and say it again o o the rite was ancient its purpose dark cloaked and masked the coven gathered in the private chamber the scent of blood was fresh and strong the flames spearing above black candles flickered to send shadows slithering over the walls like spiders hunting prey selina chose to be the altar and lay naked a candle burning between her thighs a bowl of sacrificial blood nestled between her generous breasts she smiled as she glanced toward the silver bowl overflowing with the cash and credits the membership had paid for the privilege to belong their wealth was now her wealth the master had saved her from a scrabbling life on the streets and brought her here into power and into comfort she had gladly traded her soul for them tonight there would be more tonight there would be death and the power that came from the rending of flesh the spilling of blood they would not remember she thought she had added drugs to the bloodlaced wine with the right drugs in the right dosage they would do and say and be what the master wanted only she and alban would know that the master had demanded sacrifice for his protection and the demand had been happily met the coven circled her their faces hooded their bodies swaying as the drug the smoke the chanting hypnotized them at her head stood alban with the boars mask and the athame we worship the one he said in his clear and beautiful voice and the coven answered satan is the one what is his is ours ave satan as alban lifted the bowl his eyes met selinas he took up a sword thrust it at the four points of the compass the princes of hell were called the list long and exotic voices were a hum fire crackled in a blackened pot set on a marble slab she began to moan destroy our enemies yes she thought destroy bring sickness and pain on those who would harm us great pain unbearable pain when alban laid a hand on her flesh she began to scream we take what we wish in your name death to the weak fortune to the strong he stepped back and though it was his right to take the altar first he gestured to lobar reward to the loyal take her he commanded give her pain as well as pleasure lobar hesitated a moment the sacrifice should have come first the blood sacrifice the goat should have been brought out and slaughtered but he looked at selina and his drugclouded brain shut off there was woman bitch she watched him with cold taunting eyes he would show her he thought he would show her he was a man it wouldnt be like the last time when she had used and humiliated him this time he would be in charge he cast aside his robe and stepped forward chapter eight the steady beep of an alarm had eve rolling over and cursing it cant be time to get up we just went to bed its not thats security what now she sat up quickly our security roarke was already out of bed already pulling on slacks and answered with a grunt instinctively eve reached for her weapon first clothes second someones trying to break in apparently someone has his voice was very calm as the lights were still off she could see only his silhouette in the scattered light of the moon through the sky window and joining that silhouette was the unmistakable outline of a gun in his hand where the hell did you get that i thought they were all locked up goddamn it roarke thats illegal put it away coolly he plugged a round in the chamber of the antique and bannedforuse glock nine millimeter no damn it damn it she snatched up her communicator shoved it in the back pocket of her jeans out of habit you cant use that thing ill check it out thats my job you call dispatch report a possible intruder no he said again and started for the door she was on him in two steps if someones on the grounds or in the house and if you shoot him with that im going to have to arrest you fine roarke she grabbed at him as he reached for the door theres procedure for something like this and reasons for that procedure call it in his home he thought their home his woman and the fact that she was a cop didnt mean a damn at the moment and wont you feel foolish lieutenant if its a mechanical malfunction nothing of yours ever malfunctions she muttered and made him smile despite the circumstances why thank you he opened the door and there was summerset it appears someone is on the grounds wheres the breech section fifteen southwest quadrant run a full video scan employ full house security when were out eve and i will check the grounds absently he ran a hand down her back a good thing i live with a cop she looked down at the gun in his hand attempting to disarm him would likely prove unsuccessful and it would take too much time were going to talk about this she said between her teeth i mean it of course you do they went side by side down the stairs through the now silent house they havent gotten in he said as he paused by a door leading onto a wide patio the alarm for a breech of the house is different but theyre over the wall which means they could be anywhere the moon was waxing toward full but the clouds were thick and shadowed its light eve scanned the dark the sheltering trees the huge ornamental bushes all provided excellent cover for observation or ambush she heard nothing but the air teasing leaves going brittle with age well have to separate for christs sake dont use that weapon unless your lifes threatened most b and e men arent armed and most b and e men they both knew didnt attempt to ply their trade on a man like roarke be careful he said quietly and slipped like smoke into the shadows he was good eve assured herself she could trust him to handle himself and the situation using the dim and shifting moonlight as a guide she headed west then began to circle the quiet was almost eerie she could barely hear her own footsteps on the thick grass behind her the house stood in darkness a formidable structure of old stone and glass guarded she thought by a skinny snob of a butler her lips curled shed love to see an unsuspecting burglar come up against summerset when she reached the wall she scanned for any breech it was eight feet high three feet thick and wired to deliver a discouraging electric shock to anything over twenty pounds security cameras and lights were set every twelve feet she whispered out an oath when she noted the narrow beams were blinking red rather than green disengaged son of a bitch weapon drawn and ready she circled to the south roarke did his own circuit in silence using the trees hed bought this property eight years before had had it remodeled and rehabbed to his specifications hed supervised the design and implementation of the security system personally it was in a very real sense his first home the place hed chosen to settle after too many years of wandering beneath the icy control as he slipped from shadow to shadow was a bubbling grinding fury that his home had been invaded the night was cool clear quiet as a tomb he wondered if he was up against a very ballsy thief it could be as simple as that or it could be something someone much more dangerous a pro hired by a business competitor an enemy and he hadnt fought his way to where he was without making them particularly since many of his interests had been on the dark side of the law or the target could be eve she too had made enemies dangerous enemies he glanced over his shoulder hesitated then told himself not to secondguess his wife he knew of no one better equipped to take care of herself but it was that hesitation that instinctive need to protect that turned his luck as he paused in the shadows he caught the faint sound of movement roarke took a firmer grip on the gun stepped back stepped to the side and waited the figure was moving slowly in a crouch as the distance between them melted away roarke could hear the puff of nervous breathing though he couldnt make out features he judged male perhaps fiveten and on the lean side he could see no weapon and thinking of the difficulty eve might have explaining why her husband had held off an intruder with a banned handgun tucked the glock into the back of his slacks he braced looking forward to a little handtohand then lunged when the figure slunk by roarke had an arm around a throat a fist clenched and raised in anticipation of quiet perhaps petty revenge when he realized it wasnt a man but a boy hey you son of a bitch let go ill kill you a very rude and very frightened boy roarke decided the struggle was short and all onesided it took seconds only for roarke to pin the boy against the trunk of a tree how the hell did you get inside roarke demanded the kids breath was coming in whistles and his face was pale as a ghost roarke could hear the audible click in his throat as he swallowed youre roarke he stopped struggling and tried to smirk youve got pretty good security i like to think so not a thief roarke decided but ballsy certainly how did you get past it i he broke off eyes going huge as they shot over roarkes shoulder behind you with a smoothness the boy would later appreciate roarke pivoted keeping his grip unbreakable we have our intruder lieutenant so i see she lowered her weapon ordered her heart to slow to normal jesus roarke its just a kid its she stopped narrowed her eyes i know this kid then perhaps youd introduce us its jamie right jamie lingstrom alices brother good eye lieutenant now you want to tell him to stop choking me i dont think so she holstered her weapon stepped up what the hell are you doing breaking into private property in the middle of the night youre a cops grandson for christs sake you want to end up in juvie im not your big problem right now lieutenant dallas he made a valiant attempt to sound tough but his voice wavered youve got a dead body outside the wall really dead he added and began to shake did you kill someone jamie roarke asked mildly no man no way he was there when i came by terrified his stomach would revolt and humiliate him jamie swallowed hard again ill show you if it was a trick eve considered it a fine one she couldnt take a chance all right lets go and if you try to run pal ill zap you wouldnt make any sense to run would it when i went to all this trouble to get in this way his legs were rubber and he sincerely hoped neither of them noticed that his knees kept knocking together id like to know how you got in roarke said as they headed for the main gate how you bypassed security i fool around with electronics a hobby youve got a really highgrade system the best so i thought i guess i didnt disengage all the alarms jamie turned his head tried another weak smile you knew i was here you got in roarke repeated how this jamie pulled a small palmsized unit out of his pocket its a jammer ive been working on for a couple of years itll read most systems he began frowning when roarke plucked it out of his hand when you engage this he continued leaning over to point itll scan the chips run a cloning program then its just a matter of backing out the program step by step takes some time but its pretty efficient roarke stared at the mechanism it was no bigger than one of the egames one of his companies manufactured indeed the casing looked distressingly familiar you adapted a game unit into a jammer yourself one that read and cloned and breached my security well most of it jamies eyes clouded in annoyance i must have missed something one of the backups maybe your system must be ultra mag id like to see it not in this lifetime roarke muttered and shoved the unit into his pocket when they reached the gates he disengaged and opened them manually sliding a narrow look at jamie as the boy craned over his shoulder to see way impressive jamie commented i didnt figure i could get through this way thats why i had to come over the wall needed a ladder roarke simply closed his eyes a ladder he said to no one in particular he climbed up a ladder lovely and the cameras oh i blanked them from across the street the units got a range of ten yards lieutenant roarke snagged jamie by the collar i want him punished later now wheres this body youre supposed to have seen the cocky smile fell away from his face to the left he told her paling again keep a hold of him roarke stay here ive got him roarke replied but hed be damned if hed stay back he tugged jamie through the gate met eves annoyed stare blandly our home our problem she said something nasty under her breath and turned left she didnt have to go far it wasnt hidden it wasnt subtle the body was naked and strapped to a wooden form in the shape of a star no she realized a pentagram inverted so that the head with its dead doll eyes and gaping throat hung over the bloody sidewalk the arms were outstretched the legs parted in a wide vee the center of his chest was a mass of black blood and gore the hole hacked out of it bigger than a mans fist she doubted the me would find a heart inside when he opened the body for autopsy she heard the choked sound behind her and turned to see roarke shift his grip on jamie and step over to shield the boy from the view lobar was all he said yeah she stepped closer whoever had taken his heart had also plunged a knife through a sheet of paper and through his groin devil worshipper baby killer burn in hell take the boy inside will you roarke she glanced at the collapsible ladder tilted against the wall and get rid of that pass the kid off to summerset for now i cant leave the scene she turned her face blank and impassive her cop face will you bring me my field kit yes come on jamie i know who he is tears swam in jamies eyes and were viciously blinked away hes one of the bastards who killed my sister i hope he rots because his voice had broken at the end roarke slipped an arm around his shoulder he will come inside let the lieutenant do her job roarke sent eve one last look before hefting the ladder and leading jamie back through the gates with her gaze still fixed on the body eve pulled out her communicator dispatch dallas lieutenant eve dispatch acknowledged reporting homicide requesting assistance she gave the necessary data then replaced her communicator turning she stared across the wide quiet street into the dark shifting shadows of the great park in the east the sky was stripping off the first layers of night and the stars such as they were were blinking out murder had come into her life before and would again but someone would pay for bringing it into her home she turned as roarke approached not only with her field kit but her battered leather jacket it gets chilly this close to dawn he said and handed it to her thanks jamie all right he and summerset are eyeing each other with mutual dislike and distrust i knew i liked that kid you can go inside and referee she told him as she took out sealit and clearcoated her hands her boots ive called it in im staying since shed already figured he would she didnt argue then make yourself useful and record the scene she took her recorder out of the kit passed it to him then covered his hand with hers im sorry youre too smart to be sorry for something that isnt your responsibility he wasnt killed here was he no confident that roarke could function as her aide until peabody arrived eve approached the body again not nearly enough blood hed have gushed from the jugular that was likely the cause of death well find the other wounds are postmortem in any case thered be splatters all over hell and back wed be wading in it record on yes victim identified as robert mathias aka lobar white male eighteen years of age preliminary visual exam indicates death was caused by a sharpbladed instrument that severed the throat shutting off everything but training she took out a pencil light examined the chest wound additional insults include a wound in the chest probably inflicted by the same weapon the victims heart has been removed the organ is not on scene i need closeups here she said to roarke she took instruments out of her kit to calibrate the throat wound is six and a quarter inches across approximately two inches deep quickly competently she measured and recorded the other wounds a knife blackhandled with carving was left in the body in the groin area to anchor what appears to be a computergenerated note on treated paper she heard the shrill sound of sirens coming closer uniforms she told roarke theyll secure the scene not much traffic out this way at this time of night fortunately the body has been strapped by leather strips to a wooden structure pentagram shape the small amount of blood and blood patterns indicate victim was killed and mutilated elsewhere and transported to scene perimeter security to be scanned possibility of breech onto private property beyond security gate and wall body discovered at approximately fourthirty am by lieutenant eve dallas and roarke residents she turned and walked over as the first blackandwhite screeched up to the curb i want a privacy screen employed now block off the street in a twentyfoot perimeter i dont want gawkers here i dont want the fucking media got it sir the two uniforms hustled out of the car and to the trunk they wrestled out the privacy screen im going to be awhile she told roarke taking the recorder from him she passed it to another uniform you should go inside keep an eye on the kid wearily she watched the cruiser cops erect the screen he should call his mother or something but i dont want him to leave until i talk to him again ill take care of it ill cancel my appointments for the day ill be available that would be best she started to touch him wanted to badly then realized her sealed hands were smeared with blood and dropped them again it would help if you kept him occupied kept his mind off of it for now goddamn it roarke this bites a ritual killing he murmured and understanding laid a hand on her cheek but which side did it i guess im going to be spending a lot of time interviewing witches she huffed out a breath then frowned when she saw peabody striding doubletime down the street where the hells your vehicle officer her uniform might have been pressed to within an inch of its life but her face was flushed and her breathing short i dont have a vehicle lieutenant i use city transpo the closest public stop is four blocks from here she slanted a look at roarke as though it was his personal responsibility rich people dont use public transportation well requisition a damn vehicle eve ordered well be in as soon as were done out here she told roarke then turned away bodys behind the screen get the recorder from the uniform i dont trust his eye and his hands are shaking i want measurements on the blood pool and stills of the wounds all angles seal up i dont think the sweepers are going to find much here but i dont want anything compromised ill do the prelim for time of death the mes on the way roarke watched her march off flip through the screen and figured she was finished with him o o inside the house he found jamie guarded by a visibly irritated summerset you will not be allowed free range of this house summerset snapped out you will touch nothing if you break one piece of crockery soil one centimeter of fabric i will resort to violence jamie continued to pace continued to paw the statuary in the small and as summerset thought of it lesser parlor well now im shaking you really put the fear of god in me old man your manners continue to disintegrate roarke commented as he stepped into the room someone should have taught you to show some respect for your elders yeah well someone should have taught your guard dog to be polite to guests guests dont tamper with security systems climb over walls and skulk around private property you are not a guest jamie deflated it was tough to stand up under those cool blue eyes i wanted to see the lieutenant i didnt want anyone to know next time try using the link roarke suggested its all right summerset ill deal with this as you wish summerset shot jamie one last withering look then stalked stiffbacked out of the room whered you find count boredom jamie asked and slumped into a chair the morgue roarke sat on the arm of a sofa took out a cigarette summerset can eat runts like you for breakfast he said mildly and flicked on his lighter ive seen him right still jamie sent a cautious look toward the doorway nothing in this house was what hed expected so he wouldnt underestimate the butler speaking of breakfast you got anything to eat around here its been like hours since i had anything roarke blew out smoke you want me to feed you now well you know we got to hang anyway might as well eat cheeky little bastard roarke thought not without admiration only youth he supposed could have an appetite after seeing what was outside the wall and what did you have in mind crepes an omelette perhaps a few bowls of sugarsoaked cereal i was thinking more of pizza maybe a burger he fixed on a winning smile my moms a real nutrition fanatic we only get health shit at home its five in the morning and you want pizza pizza goes down smooth anytime you may be right and he thought he could use something himself after all lets go then its like a museum in here jamie said as he followed roarke into the hall with its luminous paintings and gleaming antiques i mean in a good way you must be rolling in it i must be people say you just touch something and the credits fly out do they yeah and you didnt make all of it exactly on the upside you know but being hooked up with a cop like dallas youd have to be straight one would think roarke murmured and swung through a door into a huge kitchen wow ultimate you got people who like cook things by hand and stuff its been known to happen roarke watched the boy prowl toy with controls on the compurange the subzero refrigerator its not going to happen this morning he walked to a large autochef what is it then pizza or burger jamie grinned both i could probably drink a gallon of pepsi well start with a tube roarke programmed the autochef then went to the refrigerator himself sit down jamie frigid but he kept his eye on roarke as he slid onto the padded bench of a breakfast nook after a short debate roarke punched in for two tubes slipped them out of the door slot when they slid down youll want to contact your mother he said you can use the link there no jamie put his hands under the table rubbed them on his jeans shes zoned she cant handle it alice shes tranqued out we the viewings tonight i see and because he did roarke let it drop he handed the drink to jamie then took a large bubbling pizza from the autochef he set it then the burger that followed on the table rocking a with the appetite of the young jamie grabbed the burger and bit in man man its meat he said with his mouth full its meat it took a master not to let his mouth twitch youd prefer soy roarke asked politely veggie no way jamie wiped his mouth with the back of his hand grinned really decent thanks roarke got two plates and a slicer he went to work on the pizza i suppose breaking and entering stimulates the appetite im always hungry without shame jamie transferred the first slice to his plate mom says its growing pains but i just like to eat shes real worried about junk intake so ive got to sneak real food in you know how moms are no actually i dont ill take your word and because hed never been quite as young as jamie or quite as innocent he took a slice for himself and prepared to enjoy watching the boy devour the rest parents are okay jamie shrugged alternating between the pizza and the burger i dont see my father not in a few years hes got a life over in europe the morningside community outside london structured programmed residential roarke put in very tidy yeah and very boring even the grass is programmed he digs on it though him and his foxy new wife his third already he jerked a shoulder sucked on the pepsi he isnt much on the father game it bothered alice a lot me i can take it or leave it no roarke thought he didnt think so wounds were there odd what deep and permanent injury a parent could cause a child your mother hasnt married again nah shes not into it she was bummed pretty bad when he took off i was six im sixteen now and she still thinks im a kid i had to nag for weeks to get her to let me go for my vehicle license shes okay really shes just he trailed off stared down at his plate as if he wondered how food had gotten there she doesnt deserve this she does the best she can she doesnt deserve this she loved grandpa they were really tight and now alice alice was really weird but she she was your sister roarke said quietly you loved her it shouldnt have happened to her he lifted his gaze slowly met roarkes with a kind of terrifying fury when i find them the one who hurt her im going to kill them you want to be careful what you say jamie eve stepped in her eyes were shadowed her face pale with fatigue though shed been careful there were a few smears of blood on her jeans and you want to put away any thoughts of revenge and leave investigation to the cops they killed my sister it hasnt been determined that your sister was a victim of homicide eve headed to the autochef programmed coffee and youre in enough trouble she added before he could speak without hassling me be smart roarke said when jamie opened his mouth again be quiet peabody stood in the humming silence she studied the boy felt a little tug she had a brother his age with this in mind she slapped on a smile pizza for breakfast she said with determined cheer got more help yourself roarke invited and patted the bench beside him in invitation jamie this is officer peabody my grandfather knew you jamie studied her with cautious appraising eyes did he peabody picked up a slice i dont think i ever met him i knew about him though everybody at central was sorry when he died he knew about you he told me dallas was molding you peabodys a cop eve broke in not a lump of clay annoyed she picked up the last slice of pizza bit in this is cold its great cold peabody winked at jamie nothing better than cold pizza for breakfast eat while you can respecting her own advice eve took another bite its going to be a long day she pinned jamie with a glance starting now until you have a guardian or representative present i cant record your statement or officially question you do you understand im not an idiot and im not a child i can you can be quiet eve interrupted with or without representation i can toss you into juvenile lockup for trespassing if roarke chooses to press charges eve really you be quiet too she rounded on him all frustration and fatigue this isnt a game its murder and the media is already outside sniffing blood youre not going to be able to step outside your own house without having them jump you do you think that disturbs me it disturbs me it damn well disturbs the hell out of me my job doesnt come here it doesnt come here she stopped herself turned away this she realized abruptly was what ate at her insides chewed at her control there was blood on her home and she had brought it there steadier she turned back thats all beside the point for now you have some explaining to do she said to jamie do you want to do it here or down at central after i contact your mother he didnt speak for a moment just watched her as if measuring it was she realized the same look that had been in his eyes when she had told him his sister was dead it was very adult very controlled i know who the dead guy is his name is lobar and hes one of the bastards who killed my sister i saw him chapter nine jamies eyes were fierce furious eve kept hers on his as she laid her palms on the table and leaned forward are you telling me that you saw lobar kill your sister jamies mouth worked as if he was chewing the words and the words were bitter no but i know i know he was one of them i saw him with her i saw all of them his chin wobbled and his voice cracked reminding her he was only sixteen but his eyes stayed ageless i got in one night in that apartment downtown what apartment spooky selina and asshole alban he shrugged a shoulder but the movement was more nervous than cocky i watched one of their devil shows his hand wasnt quite steady as he picked up his drink and sucked down the last of the pepsi they let you observe a ceremony they didnt let me do anything they didnt know i was there you could say i let myself in he glanced at roarke their security isnt nearly as jazzy as yours theres good news youve been a busy boy jamie eve said evenly planning on cat burglary as a career no he didnt smile im going to be a cop like you eve blew out a breath scrubbed her hands over her face and sat cops who make a habit of illegal entry end up on the wrong side of a cage they had my sister were they holding her against her will they messed with her mind thats the same thing touchy area eve mused she couldnt go back and stop the kid from breaking into private property his grandfather had been a solid cop she remembered and had tried to do the same the boy had simply succeeded im going to do you a favor because i liked your grandfather were going to keep this off the record as far as the record goes you were never there never inside that place you got that sure he jerked a shoulder whatever tell me what you saw dont exaggerate dont speculate jamies lips curved a little grandpa always said that thats right you want to be a cop give me a report okay cool alice was in weird city right shed been cutting classes making noises about dropping out mom was really wrecked over it she thought it was a guy but i knew it wasnt not that she was talking to me shed stopped talking to me he broke off then his eyes dark and miserable then he shook his head sighed once and continued but i knew her alice would get all moony over a guy dreamyeyed and spastic but with this she was different i figured shed started experimenting illegals i know my mom had talked to my grandfather and hed talked to alice but nobody was getting anywhere so i figured id check it out i followed her a couple times i thought it would be good practice surveillance she never tagged me none of them did a lot of people dont see kids or if they do they think theyre harmless idiots eve kept her eyes hard on his face i dont think youre harmless jamie his lips twisted in a smirk he recognized that eves statement wasnt exactly flattering so i tailed her to that club the athame first time i had to wait outside i wasnt prepped for it she went in about ten came out about twelve with the ghoul patrol he smirked again when eve lifted a brow okay subject exited premises in the company of three individuals two male one female you already got their descriptions so ill say they were later identified by investigator as selina cross alban and lobar they proceeded east on foot then entered multiunit housing structure owned by selina cross investigator observed light go on in top window after weighing the options investigator decided to enter building security was bypassed with minimal to average effort can i have another pepsi saying nothing roarke took the empty tube slipped it into the recycling slot and fetched the boy another it was really quiet inside jamie continued as he broke the seal like dead dark i had a minilight but i didnt use it i got upstairs bypassed the palm plate and the cameras the locks werent that tricky i figure they didnt think anybodyd have the nerve to come that far without an invite you know i got inside and the place was empty i couldnt figure it id seen them go in id seen the light but the place was empty so i poked around theyve got some screwy stuff in there and it smelled off sorta like the incense and junk in a freeagers shop but different just off i was in one of the bedrooms theres this wild statue in there this guy with a pig head and a mans body with a really monster cock at full alert he stopped flushed a little as he remembered he was talking to females as well as cops sorry ive seen cocks at full alert before eve said mildly go on okay so i was just sort of looking at it and this guy comes in i thought shit im busted but he didnt see me he got something out of a drawer turned around and walked out never even looked my way jamie shook his head sipped deeply as he reexperienced the bowelliquefying fear i got to the doorway just as he was going through the wall secret panel he explained with a quick grin i thought they were only in old videos i gave it a couple of minutes and went in after him at this eve simply pressed her hands to her face digging her fingers into the knots you went in after him yeah my luck was holding pretty good theres this stairway narrow i think it was stone i could hear music not really music more like voices sort of humming and that off smell was stronger the stairway turns and theres this room about half the size of this one with mirrored walls lots of candles and more horny statues its smoky somethings in the smoke because it makes me lightheaded i try to be careful not to breathe too much in he stared down at the drink in his hand this part was hard he realized harder than hed thought it would be theres this raised platform all this carving some sort of words i think but i cant make it out alice is lying on it shes naked the three of them are standing over her saying something singing it i guess but i cant understand them theyre doing things to her to each other he had to swallow again his face was bone white with high red blotches on the cheeks theyve got like sex toys and shes letting them both of them and she lets them she lets them do her while that cross bitch watches alice just lets them without realizing it eve reached out took his hand let him grip her fingers hard enough to rub bone i couldnt stay there i was sick seeing that and the smoke the sounds i had to get out his eyes were wet now as he looked up she wouldnt have let them do that if they hadnt messed with her mind she wasnt a slut she wasnt i know did you tell anyone i couldnt he swiped the back of one hand over his face it wouldve killed my mom i wanted to hit alice with it hit her hard with it i was so pissed off but i couldnt i was embarrassed id seen her like that i guess my sister its all right i went back to the club a couple nights later and got in they let you inside i got fake id places like that they dont care if you look twelve if you got id that says different securitys tighter there theyve got scanners electronic and human every damn where i spotted alice with that lobar creep they went upstairs all the way up to the fancy level i couldnt get in but i got close enough to see theyd disappeared again so i figure there must be a room up there too like the one in the apartment i was working out a way to get in after hours then alice ditched them she moved in with that isis character for awhile got her own place and that job and she didnt go to the club anymore or back to the apartment he let out a sigh i thought shed straightened herself out that it had gotten through what creeps they were she talked to me a little did she tell you about the people shed been involved with not really she just said shed made a mistake a terrible one that she was like atoning cleansing that zip brain stuff of hers i knew she was scared but she talked to my grandfather so i figured things would be mellow again did they kill him too theres no evidence of that im not going to discuss it with you she added when he lifted his haunted eyes to hers and youre not to discuss this with anyone youre not to go near that club or that apartment again if you do and i find out and i will find out ill slap a security bracelet on you and you wont be able to burp without a scanner picking it up its my family yes it is and if you want to be a cop youd better learn that if you cant be objective you cant do the job my grandfather wouldnt have been objective jamie said quietly and now hes dead she had no answer for that so she rose now the problem is getting you out of here and keeping your involvement out of the media theyll be watching the gate theres always an alternative roarke commented ill arrange it she had no doubt he could and nodded ive got to change get down to central peabody she flicked a meaningful look in jamies direction stand by yes sir she means guard dog me jamie muttered as eve and roarke left the kitchen yeah but peabody flashed a companionable smile want another pepsi i guess she got up to play with the delivery slot on the fridge helped herself to a cup of roarkes magnificent coffee so how long have you wanted to be a cop for as long as i remember me too she settled down to talk shop o o ill take him out by air roarke told her as he and eve cleaned up and changed in the bedroom by air ive been meaning to take the minichopper out for a spin anyway this area isnt zoned for personal choppers wisely he disguised a laugh with a cough say that again when youre wearing your badge she muttered to herself and pulled on a clean shirt take him home will you i appreciate it the kids lucky to be alive hes resourceful bright focused roarke smiled as he picked up the jammer admired it now if id had one of these at his age ah the possibilities you do well enough with your magic fingers true he tucked the jammer in his pocket he was going to have one of his engineers analyze and very possibly reproduce it im afraid youth today doesnt appreciate the satisfaction of hands on if young jamie changes his mind about law enforcement i think i could find a nice slot for him in my little world dont even mention it youll corrupt him roarke picked up his slim gold wrist unit fastened it on you did very well with him firm without being cold a nice authoritative yet maternal style she blinked huh youre good with children he grinned as she paled id wondered get a grip a good strong grip she advised and strapped on her weapon harness im going to hit central first file my report feed whitney the data thats not going into it officially jamies name isnt going to be linked with this im sure if necessary the two of you can work out a plausible story for his mother childs play roarke said with tongue in cheek hmm from my prelim lobar was killed at oh three thirty that would be about an hour after we left the club hard to tell how long hed been propped outside the gate but at a guess no more than fifteen minutes or so before jamie happened on him its not likely that whoever left lobar hanging lets say stuck around but if they did and spotted jamie he could be a target i want the kid under surveillance and until whitney uncuffs me i cant use a cop would you like me to put one of my trusted employees on him no but thats what im going to ask you to do she turned to the mirror raked fingers through her hair in lieu of a comb im bringing this home too many angles of it im sorry he walked to her turned her around caught her face in his hands you cant separate what you do from who you are i dont expect or want you to what touches you touches me thats what i expect and what i want the last case that touched me almost killed you she wrapped her hands around his wrist squeezed i need you too much its your own fault exactly he bent down kissed her thats what i want as well go to work lieutenant im going she strode to the door paused glanced back i dont want to hear from traffic that my husband was hotdogging the skyways in his minichopper you wont i bribe too well it made her laugh as she headed back down to fetch peabody and face the first media onslaught shed no more than strapped into her vehicle when she heard the throaty purr of an expensive engine wincing only a little she glanced east and saw the sleek little copter with its tinted oneway glass cabin and whirling silver blades rise circle playfully and illegally before bulleting off wow what a machine is that roarkes have you been up peabody craned her head to try to get a last look that is one rapid mother shut up peabody ive never been up in a personal with a wistful sigh peabody settled makes the units traffic use look like dog meat you used to be intimidated when i told you to shut up those were the good old days grinning peabody crossed her ankles you handled the kid really well lieutenant eve rolled her eyes i know how to interview a cooperative witness peabody not everybody can handle a teenager theyre brutal and fragile that ones seen more than anyone should i know so had she by that age eve remembered perhaps thats why shed understood prepare yourself peabody the sharks are circling peabody grimaced at the pack of reporters crowded outside the gate there were minicams recorders and hungry looks gee i hope they get my best side tough when youre sitting on it thanks ive been working out automatically peabody wiped off the grin and assumed a blank professional expression i dont see nadine she murmured shes around eve hit the remote for the gates furst wouldnt miss this one she timed it opening the gates seconds before the nose of the car would have brushed iron reporters streamed forward engulfing the car aiming their cameras shouting their questions one or two were ballsy or stupid enough to step onto private property eve took note switched the volume on her outside speakers to blast the investigation is ongoing she announced there will be an official statement at noon any media representative who trespasses on this property will not only be prosecuted but will be blocked from all data she all but slammed the gates on scrambling feet where the hell are the uniforms i left on duty probably eaten alive by now peabody stared through the reporter who plastered himself against her side of the windshield this ones kind of cute lieutenant try not to damage his face his choice she kept driving someone bounced off her fender and cursed there was a slight bump and a very loud scream thats ten points for the foot peabody commented secretly thrilled see if you can swipe that one there the woman with the yard of legs in the green suit thatll get you five more the reporter clinging to the windshield slid off as eve juggled the wheel missed her well cant win them all peabody eve shook her head hit the accelerator and headed downtown sometimes i worry about you she wanted to see whitney first but wasnt surprised to find nadine waiting in ambush at the firstlevel interior glide at central busy night dallas thats right and im still busy therell be a press release by noon you can give me something now nadine elbowed her way onto the glide she wasnt a big woman but she was a sneaky one you didnt get to be one of the top onair reporters in the city without some quick moves just a nibble dallas something i can take to the public for my ten oclock bumper dead guy eve said shortly identification withheld until next of kin are notified so you know who he was got any leads on who opened his throat my professional opinion would be someone with a sharp implement eve said dryly umhmm nadines eyes narrowed theres a rumor rolling around that there was a message left at the scene and that it was a ritual killing goddamn leaks i cant comment on that wait a minute at the top of the glide nadine took eves arm you want me to hold something you know ill hold it give me something and let me work trusting the media was a dicey business but shed trusted nadine before to their mutual benefit as a research tool eve knew nadine was a finely honed instrument if it was a ritual killing which is not substantiated and not for broadcast my next step would be to gather all pertinent data on established cults and their members registered and otherwise in the city there are all kinds of cults dallas then youd better get busy she shook her arm free before dropping one more crumb funny cult must be the root word for occult or maybe its just a coincidence maybe it is nadine swung to the downward glide ill let you know that was tidy peabody decided lets hope it stays that way im for whitney i want you to find out the names of every uniform that was on scene this morning i want to have a talk about internal security with every one of them ouch damn right eve muttered and stalked to the elevator o o whitney didnt make her wait she noted as she took her seat in his office that he didnt appear to have slept any more than she the night before internal affairs is beefing on the wojinski matter theyre pushing for an official investigation you cant hold them off not past end of shift today my report should help she took a disc out of her bag there is absolutely no evidence that ds wojinsky was using illegals theres every indication that he was running his own sting on selina cross his reasons were personal commander but even iad should understand them i have alices statement recorded and fully transcribed in the report in my opinion she had been drugged and her naivete exploited she was used sexually she became involved with the cult established by selina cross and alban and when she broke with them she was threatened and she was frightened eventually she went to frank why did she break loose she claims she witnessed the ritual slaying of a child what his knuckles went white as he surged up from his desk she witnessed a murder reported this to frank and he didnt file she waited some time before telling him commander there was no evidence to support her allegations i cant substantiate them now but i can say that alice believed she saw the killing and she was terrified for her life she also felt she was responsible for the death of her grandfather she believed strongly that he had been murdered because of his private investigation of selina cross her claim was that selina cross has expert knowledge of chemicals and essentially poisoned frank we dont have enough to prove foul play not yet alice was certain she would be next and she died the same night she gave her statement to me she also claimed cross was a shapeshifter excuse me she believed that cross could take other forms a raven for one she thought cross could become a crow and fly jesus dallas the boys in iad are going to love that one it doesnt have to be real for her to have believed it she was a terrified young girl tormented by these people i found a black feather on her windowsill the night she died a simulated feather and there was a threatening message on her link they were tormenting her commander theres no mistake there what frank did he did to try to protect his family maybe he went about it wrong but he was a good cop he died a good cop iad isnt going to change that well make sure they dont he locked the disc away for now this stays here feeney not at this time lieutenant damn if shed be brushed off like a fly she thought and set her jaw commander my investigation to this point discloses absolutely no connection between ds wojinskis private investigation and captain feeney i can find no evidence that feeney tampered with any records for frank do you actually believe feeney would leave evidence dallas she kept her eyes level id know if he was involved hes grieving for both his friend and his goddaughter and he doesnt know anything other than the official line on either he doesnt know commander and he has a right to it was going to cost them whitney knew all of them but it couldnt be helped i cant take his personal rights into consideration lieutenant believe me iad wont all data here is on needtoknow only its a rough spot youll have to handle it it ate a hole in her gut but she nodded ill handle it what connection is this to the body left outside your home this morning left with no choice she fell back on training and delivered data robert mathias known as lobar white male eighteen years my report on cause of death is the throat wound but the body was also mutilated the victim was a member of crosss cult i also interviewed him last night at his place of employment a club called the athame owned by selina cross people you talk to are ending up dead very quickly dallas he was crosss alibi for the night alice was killed hers and albans he corroborated this during questioning she opened her bag he wasnt killed at the scene and he was left there in a manner designed to indicate a ritual killing she placed one of the death stills on whitneys desk the murder weapon was likely the knife hes got stuck in his groin its an athame a ritual knife supposedly wiccans dull the blade and use it only for symbolism she took out another shot a closeup of the note the message appears to indicate the murder was done by an enemy of the church of satan church of satan whitney muttered the death photo didnt sicken him it tired him hed seen far too many the ultimate oxymoron someone took a dislike to the practices and took him out the scene was set that way its possible and ive got a couple of lines i can tug on that angle he looked up from the photo youre thinking cross had a hand in this shed execute her own alibi shed execute her own progeny if she had any i think shes smart eve continued and i think shes crazy ill be consulting with mira on that end but i also think shed get a real bang out of doing this out of rubbing it in my face she didnt need him anymore i had his statement whitney nodded pushed the photos back to her talk to her again and this alban yes sir she put the photos away theres more its delicate what ive deleted any reference to this from the official report slightly altered the timing for the record roarke and i were awakened by the security alarm which was tripped when the body was placed against the perimeter wall off the record we didnt discover the body initially jamie lingstrom did jesus whitney said after a long minute he pressed his fingers over his eyes how eve cleared her throat and gave a quick and concise report of everything that took place after the alarm she concluded with what jamie had told her at the breakfast table i dont know how much of that you want to feed to iad jamies statement corroborates alices contention that frank was trying to trap cross ill filter out what i can he continued to rub his eyes first his granddaughter now his grandson i think i shook him enough to keep him in line dallas teenagers are remarkably hard to shake ive been there i do want him to have some protection as well as surveillance using my own judgment im arranging for this privately whitney lifted a brow you mean roarkes arranging it eve folded her hands the boy will be watched well leave it at that he leaned back a homemade handheld jammer you said one the kid jerryrigged that managed to bypass the outer layers of the security on that fortress you live in so it would seem where is it you didnt give it back to him im not an idiot she said as if shed been slapped on the wrist roarke has it and as she completed the sentence and the thought her training slipped enough for her to wince roarke has it despite the situation whitney threw back his head and laughed oh thats rich you gave the wolf the key to the henhouse he caught her narroweyed scowl and muffled the next chuckle just trying for a little levity lieutenant yes sir ha ha ill get it back no offense dallas but if youre taking bets ive got a hundred ill put on roarke in any case unofficially the department appreciates his assistance and cooperation youll excuse me if i dont relay that itll only go to his head recognizing dismissal she rose commander frank was clean iad is going to confirm that whether his death was of natural causes or induced is going to be more difficult to establish i could use captain feeney you know you dont need feeney on this dallas not in an investigative sense i appreciate your feelings but this stays here until further notice you might find yourself sitting in this chair one day he said and watched her brow furrow in surprise difficult decisions sit here with you and giving unpleasant orders is every bit as frustrating as taking them keep me posted yes sir she walked out knowing that she didnt want his chair his rank or his responsibilities chapter ten her first duty was to inform lobars next of kin once it was done eve spent a few moments pondering family they hadnt cared the womans face onscreen had stayed blank as if eve had informed her of the death of a stranger rather than a son she had birthed and raised she had thanked eve politely asked no questions agreed that the remains be sent home when released they would shed said give him a decent christian burial she imagined they would have done the same for a family pet what calcified the feelings to that extent she wondered if there had been feelings to begin with what made one mother grieve so pitifully as alices mother was and another take the news of her childs death without a single tear what had her own mother felt on her birth had she been happy or simply relieved to have the ninemonth intruder finally evicted from her body she had no memory of a mother not even some shadowy female form in her life only of her father of the man who had dragged her from place to place kept her in locked rooms who had raped her and the memories of him after so many years of denial were much too clear perhaps some people were fated to survive without family she thought or simply to survive them because her thoughts were dark it was with mixed feelings she called dr miras office for a consultation after shed managed to intimidate miras assistant into squeezing her in the next day she grabbed her bag beeped peabody and headed out she didnt miss peabodys wary expression as they pulled up in front of selinas apartment but she ignored it it was starting to rain a nasty surprisingly cold drip out of suddenly leaden skies the wind was up whistling down the long canyon of street and biting where it struck exposed flesh on the opposite sidewalk a man rushed east huddled under a black umbrella he turned quickly into a shop with a grinning skull and the words the arcane painted on the door perfect day to pay a visit to satans handmaid peabody strained for false cheer and surreptitiously fingered a bit of saintjohnswort shed stuck in her pocket her mothers advice for protection against black magic the stalwart peabody had discovered she believed in witches after all they went through the same routine with security only the wait was longer and more unpleasant as the rain began to stream down in earnest nasty forks of lightning jabbed at the sky their tines bright bloodred at the edges eve glanced up then back at her aide her smile was hard and cold yeah perfect they trailed water into the lobby into the elevator and into the foyer of selina crosss apartment and it was alban who greeted them lieutenant dallas he offered a beautifully sculptured hand graced with a single ring of thick brushed silver im alban selinas companion im afraid shes meditating at the moment i hesitate to disturb her let her meditate youll do for now well then come in and sit down please his manner was sophisticated faintly formal and at odds with the barechested black leather unisuit he wore can i get you something some tea perhaps to ward off the chill such an interesting change in the weather nothing eve thought shed have preferred a quick hit of zeus to anything brewed in that place the gloom suited it she decided the dank light the wicked hiss of rain and wind on the windows then there was alban with his pretty poets face and warrior god body a perfect fallen angel id like your whereabouts for last night between the hours of three hundred and five hundred hours three and five am he blinked as if translating the military time last night or this morning rather why here i think we got back from the club a bit before two we havent been out yet today we selina and myself we had a coven meeting which concluded around three we cut it a little short as selina wasnt feeling herself normally we might entertain afterwards or continue with a smaller more private rite but you didnt do so last night no as i said selina wasnt feeling well so we went to bed early early for us he explained with a smile were night people who attended the coven meeting his smile shifted into a serious almost studious expression lieutenant religion is a private matter and still in this day and age one such as ours is persecuted our membership prefers discretion one of your membership was indiscreetly murdered last night no he rose slowly keeping his hand braced on the arm of his chair as if unsteady i knew it was something horrible she was so disturbed he took a deep breath as if preparing both mind and body who lobar selina said the name as she stepped through a narrow archway she was deathly pale her cats eyes shadowed she wore her black hair loose today with a wide dip over generous breasts it was lobar she repeated i saw it just now in the smoke alban she pressed a hand to her head swayed quite a show eve murmured as alban rushed across the room to catch her to hold her against him you saw it in the smoke eve cocked her head thats handy maybe i should take a look at the smoke myself see who cut his throat theres nothing in the smoke for you but your own ignorance leaning on alban selina walked slowly to the sofa she sat with a rustle of her robes lifted a hand to albans im all right my love he brought her hand to his lips ill get you a soother yes yes thank you she bowed her head while he went quietly out oh it was hard to keep a cat grin off her face to stop the glorious images from playing back in her brain of the rite the sacrifice the blood and only she and alban knew of the excitement the power of that moment when lobar had been offered to the master only she fully understood the thrill of making that sacrifice with her own hand she shuddered once with dark pleasure stirred by the memory the way lobars eyes had met hers the way the athame had fit cold in her hand then the hot fountain of blood when shed used it imagining the shock the fury eve must have felt when shed found lobar so carefully positioned at the entrance to her own sanctuary selina nearly snickered she pressed her fingers to her lips a moment as if holding back a sob alban was a genius she thought for truly only a genius would have created such beautiful irony visions can be a blessing or a curse she continued in a voice strained with weariness i prefer to think of them as blessings even when they cause me sorrow lobar is a heavy loss laying it thick arent you selinas head shot up and her eyes glimmered with something more of hate than grief dont mock my feelings dallas do you think power such as mine means i dont have them i feel i experience i bleed she added and with a lightning movement raked one of her long lethal nails over her own palm blood welled dark and red a demonstration wasnt necessary eve said easily i know you bleed lobar certainly did his throat yes thats what i saw in the smoke she reached out for alban when he came in carrying a shallow silver bowl but there was more something else she took the bowl tipped it up to her lips mutilation oh how they despise us they the weak and the white she took a black swatch of cloth from the pocket of her robe passed it to alban he lifted her injured hand raised it to his lips with quick efficiently he bound up her wounded palm selina never spared him a glance those who view our master with hate she continued and more those who practice the magic of the foolish so in your opinion this was a religious murder of course i have no doubt she finished the soother set the bowl aside do you quite a number of them but then i have to investigate the oldfashioned way i cant call up the devil and ask for a consult lobar was here last night yes until nearly three he would have taken the mark soon selina sighed idly running her redtipped nails up and down albans arm one of his last acts was to join his body with mine you had sex with him last night yes sex is an important part of our rituals i chose him last night she shuddered again because the choice had been hers and the deed something must have told me a bird maybe a big black bird lifting a brow eve studied alban so its no problem with you to watch while other men have sex with your companion most men are a little territorial they might harbor unhealthy resentments we dont believe in monogamy we find it limiting and foolish sex is pleasure and we dont put restrictions on our pleasures consensual sex in a private home or licensed club isnt against your laws lieutenant he smiled im sure you engage in it yourself you like to watch alban his brows lifted is that an invitation at selinas quick chuckle he shifted and took her hand there youre feeling better now grief passes doesnt it selina it must she agreed nodding at eve life is to be lived youll look for who did this and perhaps youll find them but the punishment of our master is greater and more terrible than any you could invent your master isnt my concern murder is since you have an interest in the deceased maybe youll let me take a look around get a warrant and youre welcome the tranq had clouded her eyes but her voice was strong enough when she stood youre more a fool than i originally thought if you believe i had anything to do with this he was one of ours he was loyal it is against the law to harm a loyal member of the cult and he talked to me last night in a privacy booth did the smoke tell you what he told me selina her eyes shifted darkened youll have to find other waters to fish in dallas im tired alban show them out she glided a way back through the arch theres nothing we can do for you lieutenant selina needs to rest he glanced toward the arch worry in his eyes i need to tend her got you trained does she with light disdain coating her voice eve rose do you do tricks too sadly he shook his head my devotion to selina is personal she has powers and the powerful have needs i meet hers gratefully he walked back into the foyer opened the door we would like to take lobars body when its possible we have our death ceremony so does his family and they come ahead of you o o what do we have on this alban eve demanded the moment they were outside in the now drenching rain next to nothing peabody ducked into the car and immediately felt more at ease she knew it was foolish to hope she never had to go back inside that building but she hoped in any case no priors next to no background if he was born with a name other than alban it doesnt pop theres more theres always more not so eve thought drumming her fingers against the wheel shed once investigated another suspicious character and had found little to nothing his only name was roarke look again she ordered and pulled away from the curb funny isnt it she continued while peabody plugged in her data unit theres next to no traffic on this block turn the corner she did so and immediately hit a snarl of nasty and comforting vehicular traffic bumping badtemperedly through the rain people hustled along sidewalks and glides huddled in doorways two glidecart operators on opposing corners hunched under ratty awnings and scowled at each other people have instincts theyre not even aware of still less than comfortable peabody glanced back as if expecting something not quite human might be scrabbling behind them theres a bad feeling around that building its brick and glass yeah but places tend to take on the personalities of the people who live in them a car turned the corner ahead blasting its horn at the sea of pedestrians who streamed across against the go light insults were cheerfully hurled both verbally and through equally graphic hand signals someone spat steam poured up through the vents from the underground system in dirty clouds it tangled thickly with the smoke belching from a ratty and obviously under code glida grill fighting its way through the mass of wet humanity a level up the nearest skywalk shuddered to a halt and sent all its passengers into a riot of cursing and complaints overhead a tourist blimp blasted out a spiel of the advantages and highlights of living in an urban wonderland peabody took a cleansing breath pleased to be back in the midst of the arrogant and crowded new york she understood take roarkes place she continued its grand and elegant and intimidating but its also sexy and mysterious she was too busy riddling with the unit to notice the amused look eve shot her my parents place its all open and warm and a little confused what about your place peabody whats that temporary peabody said definitely dallas your car unit isnt cooperating here i should be able to transfer data to she broke off as eve leaned over smacked the dash above the car screen an image popped on wobbling drunkenly thats some better peabody decided and requested a run on alban alban no known alternate name born omaha nebraska funny eve interrupted he didnt look corn fed id number the computer continued with a definite hiccup in its program lrt parents unknown marital status single no known means of support no financial data available interesting sounds like hes leeching off selina criminal records all arrests no criminal record education unknown our boys wiped or had somebody wipe records eve told peabody you dont get to be nearly forty years old without generating more data than this hes got connections somewhere she needed feeney she thought grumpily feeney could tickle the computer and trick additional data instead she was going to have to go to roarke and add another layer to his involvement well shit she pulled up in front of spirit quest frowned at the closed sign on the door run up for a looksee peabody maybe shes inside got an umbrella or a rain shield eve arched a brow are you trying to be funny peabody only sighed then pushed out of the car she plodded and splashed through the rain peered into windows shivering a little she turned back shook her soaking head then groaned when eve jerked a thumb toward the apartment over the shop resigned peabody trudged around the side climbed a set of rickety metal stairs moments later she was back streaming water no answer she told eve minimal security unless you count the swatch of saintjohnswort over the entrance she has a swatch of warts thats disgusting not warts despite her wet uniform and dripping hair peabody indulged in a good laugh its a plant saintjohnswort amused enough she dug into her pocket for her sprig like this its for protection guards against evil you carry plants in your pocket officer i do now peabody pushed it back in her pocket want some no thanks i prefer trusting my weapon to guard against evil i consider this my clutch piece whatever works for you eve scanned the area lets try that cafe place across the street maybe they know why shes closed in the middle of a business morning maybe theyve got decent coffee peabody said and sneezed twice hard if i catch a cold ill kill myself it takes me weeks to throw one of those suckers off maybe you need a plant to cart around that wards off common germs leaving it at that eve hopped out of the car coded the locks and jogged across the street into coffee ole the stab at a mexican theme wasnt bad she decided bright colors heavy on orange gave it a sunny appearance even on a filthy day it might have fallen far short of roarkes gorgeous villa on the west coast of mexico but it had a certain tacky charm with its plastic flowers and papiermache bulls bright mariachi music piped through the speakers either the rain or the ambiance had brought in a crowd but as eve scanned the room she noted that the people packed around tables werent wolfing down plates of enchiladas most were huddled over single stingy cups of what smelled remotely like overboiled soy coffee baseballs closing in on the league titles isnt it peabody peabody sneezed again baseball i guess arena balls my game uhhuh seems to me there a pennant race going on pivotal game today i imagine lots of moneys going to change hands peabodys head was starting to feel stuffy a very bad sign but it was still clear enough for her to latch on you figure this is a front an illegal betting parlor just a hunch we may be able to use it she sidled up to the counter tagged a harassedlooking man short of stature dark of complexion weary of eye eat in or carry out neither she began then relented as she heard peabody sniffle one coffee for her and a couple of answers ive got coffee he swiveled around to plug thick dark brew into a cup barely bigger than a thimble i got no answers maybe you should hear the questions lady i got a full house here i serve coffee i got no time for conversation he dumped the cup on the counter and would have backed away but eve snagged his wrist what are the house odds on the game today his eyes shifted left and right before settling on her face but hed spotted peabody and her uniform dont know what youre talking about you know if me and my pal here settle in for a few hours your business is going into the recycler personally i dont give a good damn about your business any of your business but i could still holding his wrist she turned her head and stared hard at two of the men seated at the counter it took less than ten seconds for them to decide to drink coffee elsewhere how long do you think itd take me to clear this place out what do you want i make my contribution im covered she let him go it annoyed her to find out that he had cop protection didnt surprise her just annoyed im not going to interfere unless you irritate me tell me about the shop across the street spirit quest he snorted visibly relaxed she wasnt after him feeling cooperative he refilled peabodys cup then picked up a rag and wiped the counter he ran a clean place the witch she dont come in here dont drink coffee if you know what i mean shes closed today yeah he narrowed his eyes to try to see through the window through the rain not usually when did you see her last shit he scratched the back of his neck lets see seems i saw her yesterday closing time yeah yeah she closes about six and i was washing the front windows you gotta keep on the windows in this city dirt just jumps right on them i bet she closed about six then what went off with that guy she lives with walking they dont got transpo you havent seen her today now that you mention it guess not she lives up above you know me i live across town keep business and personal life separate thats my motto any of her people ever come over here nah some of her customers sure and some of mine go over there looking for lucky charms we bump along okay she aint no problem for me even bought the wife a birthday present over there pretty little bracelet colored stones kinda stiff in the price but women like that glitter shit he tossed the rag aside and ignored the request for coffee from down the counter look she in trouble shes okay in my book weird maybe but aint no harm in her what do you know about the girl who used to work there young girl about eighteen blonde the spooky one sure i used to see her come and go always looking over her shoulder that one like somebody was going to jump out and say boo someone did eve thought thanks if you see isis come back today give me a call she slipped a card onto the counter along with credits for the coffee no problem wouldnt like to see her get in trouble though shes okay for a whacko hey he lifted a finger as eve started to turn speaking of whackos i saw one a couple of nights ago when i was closing up what sort of whacko just a guy well might have been a woman couldnt tell cause they was all wrapped up in this black robe hood and everything just standing there on the curb staring across the street at her place just standing and staring gave me the creeps i walked the other way twice as far to the bus stop but i didnt like the feel of it and you know what i looked back and there wasnt no one there nothing but a damn cat whacko huh yeah eve murmured whacko i saw a cat peabody began when they headed back to the car on the street when alice was killed there are lots of cats in the city but eve remembered the one on the ramp sleek and black and mean well follow up with isis later i want to check with the me before i feed the statement to the media she uncoded the car as peabody sneezed again maybe hell have something for that cold peabody rubbed her hand under her nose id just as soon stop by a pharmacy if you dont mind i dont want dr death treating me until absolutely necessary o o after she was back in her office and peabody was off changing into a dry uniform and dosing herself with a small fortune of overthecounters eve studied the autopsy report on lobar shed had the time of death right in the prelim and the cause then again she mused it was tough to miss a milewide gash in the throat and a crater in the chest and fancy that there had been traces of a hallucinogen a stimulant and a mind hazer all of the illegals variety in his bloodstream so hed died sexually fulfilled and zoned some she imagined would say that wasnt such a bad deal but then most of them hadnt had a knife raked over their throats she lifted the sealed weapon studied it no prints of course and none expected no blood on it but for the victims she studied the carved black handle scanning the symbols and letters that meant nothing to her it appeared to be old and rare but she doubted that would help her pin ownership the blade was under legal limit required no registration still she would check antique shops knife shops and she supposed witch shops that would only take weeks she thought in disgust and was unlikely to lead anywhere since she had twenty minutes before she had to face the media she turned to her machine and got started shed no more than plugged in the description of the weapon when feeney walked in shut her door heard you had a rude awakening this morning yeah her stomach clutched not in memory of what had come into her home but at knowing she would have to weigh every word with him not the kind of package i like to receive you need help on it he smiled wanly im looking for busy work ive got it covered for now but ill let you know he paced to her narrow window back to her door he looked exhausted she thought so tired so sad whats the story did you know the guy not really oh christ what did she do here id talked to him once about a case i was on didnt pan out could be he knew more than he was telling me its going to be hard to say now she took a deep breath hating herself i figure it was someone who wanted to take a swipe at me or roarke most cops can keep their home addresses quiet i cant she shrugged price you pay for falling for a public figure you happy he said abruptly and turned to study her face sure she wondered if guilt was plastered on her forehead like a neon sign good good he paced again jiggling the bag of nuts he habitually carried in his pocket and no longer seemed to have the appetite for its tough to be on the job and make a decent personal life frank did i know alices viewing is tonight you going to make it i dont know feeney ill try it rips me dallas it really rips me my wifes with brenda now shes wrecked just wrecked i couldnt handle it anymore so i came in but i cant focus why dont you go back home feeney she rose reached out to touch his arm just go home maybe you and your wife could go away for a few days youve got the time coming get away from this maybe his eyes were bleak heavy with bags but where do you go to get away from whats always there listen roarkes got this place in mexico its great she was fumbling and knew it desperate to give its got a monster view and its fully equipped it would be she managed a smile its roarkes ill square it with him you can go there take your family take the family he repeated it slowly finding the idea was almost soothing maybe i will you never seem to make time to be with your family ill think about it he decided thanks its nothing its roarke its just there she turned blindly toward her desk im sorry feeney ive got to get it together for a media statement sure he worked up a smile for her i know how much you love that ill let you know about using the place yeah do that she stared hard at her screen until he went out shed followed orders she reminded herself shed done the right thing so why did it make her feel like a traitor chapter eleven she made the tail end of the viewing grateful that roarke had come with her it was too familiar the same memorial parlor the same scents many of the same people i hate this she murmured sanitized death it comforts eve looked over to where brenda was supported by her mother and her son while tears ran slowly down her cheeks she had the glazed and delicate look of the heavily medicated does it it closes he corrected and took her cold hand in his for some when its my turn dont do this recycle the parts burn the rest get it done he felt the fist clutch around his heart and gave her hand a hard squeeze dont sorry i tend to have morbid thoughts in places like this well her room scan stopped when she spotted isis theres my witch roarke followed her gaze and studied the imposing woman with flamecolored hair and wearing a simple robe of pure white she stood by the viewing box beside a man a full head shorter than she he wore a plain almost conservative suit also in white their fingers were linked the man with her i dont know him might be a member of her sect or whatever lets check it out they moved across the room and by tacit agreement flanked the couple eve looked down at alice first at the young face composed now death had a way of relaxing the features after the insult had passed shes not here isis spoke quietly her spirit still searches for peace id hoped id hoped to find her here im sorry i missed you today dallas we were closed in alices memory you werent at home either no we gathered at another place for our own ceremony the man across the street told me youd been looking for me a faint smile wisped around her mouth he was concerned that i had a cop on my trail he has a good heart despite a certain imbalance she stepped back to introduce the man beside her this is chas my mate training kept eves eyes bland but she was surprised he was as ordinary as isis was spectacular his hair was a washedout blond thin in texture his body was almost fragile narrow in the shoulders short in the leg his square unremarkable face was stopped just short of homely by a pair of surprisingly lovely deep gray eyes when he smiled it was with a sweetness that demanded a smile in return im sorry to meet you under such sad circumstances isis told me you were a very strong and purposeful soul i see she was right as always she nearly blinked at his voice it was a deep creamy baritone any opera singer would have wept for she caught herself watching his mouth move and imagining a ventriloquists dummy it wasnt a voice that should have come out of that body and that face i need to talk to you both as soon as possible she glanced around wished for a discreet way to slip out and conduct an interview it would have to wait this is roarke yes i know isis offered a hand weve met before have we his smile was politely curious i cant imagine forgetting meeting a beautiful woman another time another place her eyes stayed on his another life you saved mine once that was wise of me yes it was and kind perhaps someday youll revisit the county of cork and see a small stone dance alone in a fallow field and youll remember she slipped the silver cross she wore off her neck handed it to him you gave me a talisman then similar to this celtic cross i suppose thats why i wore it tonight to close a circle the metal was warmer against his hand than it should have been and it stirred something in cloudy memory he didnt care to explore thank you he slipped it into his pocket one day i may return the favor you did me she turned to eve then ill speak with you whenever you like chas of course whenever its convenient for you lieutenant dallas will you attend our ceremony wed very much like to share it with you night after next we have a small place upstate its quiet and private and when the weather cooperates perfect for outdoor rites i hope you he broke off his stunning eyes going dark his thin body shifting to what eve recognized immediately as a guard stance hes not one of us he said she glanced around spotted a man in a dark suit his face was cellblock white and framed by a black wedge of hair the suit was expensive his skin wan making him appear both sickly and successful he started toward the viewing box saw the group already there in one jerky move he turned on his heel and hurried out ill check it out she was moving quickly when roarke caught up with her well check it out it would be better if you stayed inside with them im staying with you she only shot him a frustrated look dont cramp my style wouldnt dream of it the retreating man was nearly at a run as he hit the door eve only had to touch his arm to have him jolt what what do you want he whirled pressing the door for release backing out of it into the rainy night i havent done anything no he sure looks guilty for an innocent man doesnt he she took a firmer grip on his arm to keep him from rabbiting away maybe you should show me some id i dont have to show you anything its not necessary roarke said smoothly hed gotten a better look now thomas wineburg isnt it of wineburg financial youve nabbed yourself a deadly type here lieutenant a banker third generation or is it fourth its fifth wineburg said struggling to look down his narrow nose at what his family would consider new and not quite decent money and ive done nothing to warrant being accosted by a police officer and a financial rogue im the cop eve decided glancing at roarke you must be the financial rogue hes just mad because i dont use his bank roarke flashed a wolfish grin arent you tommy i have nothing to say to you well then you can talk to me whats the rush i i have an appointment id forgotten im quite late then a couple more minutes wont matter are you a friend of the deceaseds family no oh i get it you just like to while away a rainy evening at a viewing parlor ive heard thats the coming thing for singles i id mistook the address i dont think so what did you come to see or who i his eyes widened when isis and chas stepped out stay away from me im sorry dallas we were concerned when you didnt come back isis turned her exotic eyes on wineburg your aura is dark and muddy you dabble without belief toy with power beyond your scope if you dont change your path you damn yourself keep her away from me straining against eves grip wineburg cringed back shes not hurting you what do you know about alices death wineburg i dont know anything his voice went shrill i dont know anything about anything i mistook the address i have an appointment you cant hold me no she couldnt but she could scare the hell out of him i could take you down to central play with you awhile before your representative managed to get there wouldnt that be fun i havent done anything to eves surprise and mild disgust he began to sob like a baby you have to let me go im not part of this part of what it was just for sex thats all just for sex i didnt know anybody would die blood everywhere everywhere dear god i didnt know where what have you seen he continued to sob and when she started to shift her grip he rammed his bony elbow hard into her gut sending her flying violently back into roarke so that they both hit the pavement later she could curse herself for letting him catch her off guard with his sniveling but for now she scrambled up struggling to suck in air and gave chase son of a bitch she could only think it hed knocked the wind out of her and prevented her from swearing aloud or shouting out an order for him to freeze she reached for her weapon just as he dove into an underground garage and darted into the forest of vehicles shit she had enough air for that then snarled at roarke as he rushed in behind her get out damn it hes probably not armed but youre sure as hell not call it in if you want to do something the day i let a pissant banker knock me on my ass and walk away has not come he veered off to circle around and left her scowling at him the security lights were blinding but the opportunity for cover was endless echoes of running footsteps bounced off the floor and walls and ceiling trusting instinct she moved left wineburg you arent helping yourself youve got assaulting an officer on you now you come out without making me dig you out i might cut you a break crouched she swung toward the narrow opening between cars scanned under behind moved on roarke hold still a minute goddamn it so i can tag location the echoes softened a bit allowing her to strain her ears and venture farther to the left at running speed he was heading up she decided hoping to lose himself on the next level she darted up the first ramp then whirled and braced weapon aimed when footsteps pounded behind her i should have known was all she said as roarke passed her she dug in and continued pursuit hes heading up she snapped out he keeps going hell corner himself all the idiot has to do is stop lay low it would take a fucking platoon to find him in here hes scared when youre scared you run away he glanced at eve and felt ridiculously exhilarated as they hit the next ramp or some do then the footsteps silenced eve threw out an arm to hold roarke in place held her breath as she strained to hear what is that she whispered what the hell is that sound chanting her heart jumped jesus christ she broke into a fresh run just as one long terrified scream ripped the air it seemed to go on endlessly high and inhuman and horrible then it snapped off into silence she dragged out her communicator without breaking stride officer needs assistance officer needs assistance parking garage fortyninth and second dallas lieutenant eve in pursuit of goddamn it dispatch dallas lieutenant eve please say again she didnt bother to stare at the body spread in a growing pool of blood on the concrete floor one glance at the terrified wide eyes and the carved hilt of a knife plunged into the heart had been enough to determine death wineburg had run the wrong way i need backup immediately ive got a homicide perpetrator or perpetrators possibly still on premises dispatch all available units to this address for blockade and search i need a field kit and my aide received units en route dispatch out ive got to look she said to roarke understood i dont have my clutch piece or id give it to you i need you to stay here with the body roarke looked down at wineburg and felt a stir of pity hes not going anywhere i need you to stay here she repeated in case they come back this way dont be a hero he nodded you either she took one last glance at the body fuck she said wearily i should have had a better grip on him she moved off slowly scanning cars and corners but without much hope o o hed watched her work before studied and admired the efficient concentrated field she created around the dead roarke wondered if she fully understood why she did it or how she could while examining a lifeless violently dispatched body with such clearcut objectivity see through the pity that haunted her eyes hed never asked her he doubted he ever would he watched her order peabody to record the scene from a different angle saw her jerk her thumb at a uniform obviously a rookie who wasnt holding up well sending him off on an errand roarke imagined so he could be sick in private some of them never got used to the blood or the smell of bladder and bowels releasing with death the lights were viciously bright merciless really the heart wound had bled profusely shed worn heels and a little black suit to the viewing of course she would ruin both now she was kneeling beside the body tearing her stockings on the concrete and removing the murder weapon now that the scene had been duly recorded she sealed it bagged it for evidence but hed gotten a good look at it the handle was a deep brown possibly horn of some sort yet there had been no mistaking its similarity to the one left at the last murder an athame the knife of ritual bad business roarke made a sound of assent as feeney walked up to him the man looked uncharacteristically fragile roarke observed eve was right to be concerned about him you know anything about it im not getting much buzz except that dallas was talking to him outside he ran and ended up dead thats about it he seemed nervous about something apparently he had reason to be it wasnt a place they could go together roarke decided and shifted away from it i hope youll take eve up on the offer of the house in mexico ill talk it over with my wife i appreciate it then he moved his shoulders i guess she doesnt need me here i should get home but he studied the scene another minute behind the fatigue in his eyes lurked the cop screwy business some guy getting stuck in here fancy knife took out that stiff left at your place last night too right the other had a black handle some sort of metal i think yeah well he rocked back on his heels a moment id better head home he crossed to eve careful to avoid getting too close in his untreated shoes she looked up distracted wiping the blood off her sealed hands with a rag and she watched him walk away until he was out of sight she rose raked her not quite clean hands through her hair bag him she ordered and walked to roarke im going to go in do the report while its fresh in my mind all right he took her arm no you should go home ill catch a ride with one of the team ill take you peabody peabody can catch a ride with one of the team she needed a few minutes he knew to decompress he touched a button on his wrist unit to signal his driver i feel stupid going into central in a limo she muttered really i dont he walked her out of the garage then around to the front of the funeral parlor the limo streamed up to the curb you can catch your breath he suggested as he slid in behind her and i can have a brandy he poured one from a crystal decanter and knowing eve programmed her coffee well since were going it this way you can tell me what you know about wineburg one of the irritating rich and pampered she took the hot rich coffee served in a thin classy cup of bone china and gave roarke his plush limo his pricey brandy a long cool look youre rich yes he smiled but pampered certainly not he swirled his brandy kept smiling thats what stops me from being irritating you think so the coffee helped got her circuits running so he was a banker he ran wineburg financial hardly his fathers still hale and hearty this little fish would have been more of a minion the type given busywork and a useless title and a big office hed gobble up his expense account shuffle forms and have his cosmetician in for weekly sessions okay you didnt like him i didnt know him actually he gave the brandy a lazy swirl and sip just the type i dont have any business dealings with wineburg in the dawn of my career i needed some backing for a couple of projects legal projects he added at eves speculative look they wouldnt let me in the door i wasnt up to their level of client so i went elsewhere got the backing and made a killing figuratively speaking the wineburg organization took it poorly so theyre a conservative established familyrun institution exactly it would be embarrassing to have the scion would he be like the scion if theres such a thing as a minor scion i suppose okay if he was into satanism it probably wouldnt go down well at the company picnic it would turn the board of directors white with shock and family or not this little wineburg would have been out on his ass he didnt look like the type to risk it but you never know sex he said just for the sex he could have been one of the ones who had at alice then hes guilty or cunous and comes by the viewing the one thing he was was scared he saw something roarke he saw someone murdered i know it if id gotten him in id have pulled it out of him i could have broken him in ten minutes apparently someone else thought so too someone who was right there on the spot watching him watching the viewing or watching you roarke finished which is more likely i hope they keep watching because before long im going to turn around and bite them on the throat she glanced up as the limo pulled up to the front of cop central vaguely embarrassed she peered out hoping no cops were loitering nearby shed be ragged on for days ill see you at home couple hours ill wait dont be ridiculous go home he simply leaned back ordered the screen to engage and list the latest stock information ill wait he repeated and poured another brandy hardhead she muttered as she got out then winced when someone called her name woowee dallas going to slum with us working poor for awhile bite me carter she muttered and rushed inside before the delighted laughter forced her to break someones face o o an hour later shewas back bone weary and sparking mad carter just had it announced over the main that my carriage awaited anon what an idiot i dont know whether to kick his ass or yours kick his roarke suggested and draped an arm around her hed switched from work to pleasure mode and had an old video on screen she caught the scent of expensive tobacco clinging to the air and wished she could claim it irritated her but it soothed along with his arm and the ancient blackandwhite video what is this bogart and bacall first film together she was nineteen i think heres the line eve stretched out her legs and listened to bacall ask bogie if he knew how to whistle her lips twitched clever its a good film well have to watch it all the way through sometime youre tense lieutenant maybe well have to fix that he shifted poured a stemmed glass full of strawcolored liquid drink what is it wine just wine she sniffed it suspiciously he wasnt above doctoring it she knew i was going to work a little when we get home i need my head clear you have to shut down sometime relax your head can be clear in the morning he had a point she had too much data in her head and none of it was helping four deaths now and she was no closer maybe if she backed off for a few hours shed see better whoever did wineburg was quick and quiet and smart going for the heart hit the throat like lobar and you get blood all over you hit the heart its over fast and with minimal mess ummhmm he began to knead the back of her neck it was always a magnet for her stress what were we thirty forty seconds behind fast really fast if wineburg cracked there could be another ive got to get the membership list there has to be a way she sipped at the wine what were you and feeney talking about mexico stop worrying okay okay she leaned her head back closed her eyes for what seemed like three seconds but when she opened them again they were through the gates and pulling up in front of the house did i fall asleep for about five minutes that was just wine right absolutely the next part of our program is a hot bath a bath isnt she reconsidered as they stepped inside actually that sounds pretty good ten minutes later while water gushed into the tub and swirled in the power of jets it began to sound better but she arched a brow when she saw roarke begin to undress whos the bath for me or you us he gave her a tap on the butt nudging her forward thats fine then itll give you a chance to tell me all about saving the life of a beautiful woman hmm he slipped into the frothy water facing her oh i cant be held responsible for actions that took place in a former life he passed her another glass of wine hed had the foresight to pour now can i i dont know isnt the theory something like you repeat things or learn from them or dont she held the glass aloft and dunked herself down resurfacing with a sigh you figure you were lovers or what considering he trailed a fingertip up and down eves leg if she looked then the way she looks now id certainly hope so she gave him a sour smile yeah id guess youd go for the big beautiful exotic type then and now with a shrug she drank more wine then toyed with the stem most people figure you stepped wide of the mark with me most people she downed the rest of the wine set the glass aside sure i get the drift when weve got to make time with some of those rich and hightoned business associates of yours cant blame them for wondering what came over you im not big beautiful or exotic no youre not slim lovely strong its a wonder i looked twice she felt ridiculous and flustered he could do that to her just by the way he looked at her im not fishing she muttered and it surprises me that youd give a damn what any of my associates thought of either one of us i dont damn it shed stepped right in it i was just making an observation the wines got my tongue running away with me you annoy me eve his voice was dangerously cool a warning she recognized criticizing my taste forget it she dunked again surfaced like a shot when his hands clamped over her waist hey what are you doing trying to drown me she blinked water out of her eyes and saw that his were indeed annoyed listen no you listen or better yet he crushed his mouth to hers hot hungry hurried it made the top of her lead lift off and spin well just move to the third part of our program a little early he said when he let her suck in a gulp of air and ill show you why im precisely on the mark with you lieutenant precisely i dont make mistakes she scowled at him even as the blood hummed under her skin that arrogant routine doesnt work for me i said it was the wine you wont blame what i can do to you on the wine he promised he tilted his hands so that his thumbs traced the vulnerable fold between thigh and crotch you wont blame it on the wine when i make you scream i wont scream but her head fell back as a moan tore through her lips i cant breathe when you do that then dont dont breathe he lifted her up until her breasts were above water and his hands busy below he dipped caught one dripping point between his teeth im going to take you youre going to let me i dont want to be taken unless i take back but even as her arms came around him he ripped her to peak made her body buck and her arms go limp not this time he was suddenly ravenous for her just this way limp and open and mindless how do you do that her voice was weak and slurred he nearly chuckled though the need was growing painful saying nothing he stood lifted her her eyes fluttered open as he carried her out of the bath i want you in bed he said i want you wet inside and out i want to feel your body tremble when i touch you he laid her down fastened his mouth on her throat and taste you she felt drunk too loose for control too pliant for shock as his hands got busy again she bucked she reached for him but he slipped away sliding down her damp body hands fast mouth urgent she couldnt keep up now her body was tight a whiteknuckled fist ready to strike she came abruptly violently and didnt hear her own scream he took what he wanted everything his blood pounded harder and hotter every time he dragged her over the next edge their flesh was wet with sweat now as he drove them both ruthlessly when the need to be inside of her was unbearable he pulled her up parted her legs until they clamped around his waist and when her arms were around him as well clinging her body trembling hard against his he gripped her hips and filled her in one deep stroke his mouth found her breast felt the wild ragged beat of her heart beneath the damp flesh and when she climaxed again vising around him like silkcoated iron he held himself back look at me he arched her back watching as her body shuddered her hips moved arousal built fresh as he took himself deeper into her look at me eve he stroked his hands over her molding each curve again while he continued to thrust slow steady his breath came in pants his control vibrated on a thin fraying wire she opened her eyes they were glazed heavy but they watched him youre the one he said and braced himself over her youre the only his mouth swooped down to hers found it eager and open as he emptied himself into her o o for once he slept first she lay in the dark listening to him breathe stealing a little of his warmth as her own body cooled since he was asleep she stroked his hair i love you she murmured i love you so much im stupid about it with a sigh she settled down closed her eyes and willed her mind to empty beside her roarke smiled into the dark he never slept first chapter twelve in his midtown office high above the city roarke dealt with his last meeting of the morning as originally scheduled he should be concluding this business in rotterdam but he had arranged to take the meeting holographically so as to remain close to home close to eve he sat at the head of his gleaming conference table aware that his image sat at a similar one an ocean away his assistant sat on his left feeding him the necessary hard copy for his approval and signature his translator sat on his right as backup should there be any problem with the computer headsets language program the board of scanair filled the other seats or their images did it had been a very good year for roarke enterprises and its subsidiaries it had not been a good year nor a good several years for scanair roarke was doing them the favor of buying them out from the stony expressions on several holographic faces they were not entirely grateful the company needed to be rightsized which meant several of the cushier positions would be adjusted in salary and responsibility some would be eliminated altogether he had already handpicked several men and women who were willing to relocate to rotterdam and whip the skyline back into shape as the computergenerated translation of the contract droned in his ears he watched the faces the body language occasionally he conferred with his translator for subtleties and syntax he already knew every phrase every word of the buyout agreement he wasnt paying what the board had hoped for then again they had hoped his examination of the company wouldnt turn up some of the more delicate and wellhidden financial difficulties he couldnt blame them for that he would have done the same but his examinations were always thorough and turned up everything he signed his name on each copy added the date then passed the contracts to his assistant for her to witness and seal she rose fed the contacts into a laser fax seconds later the copy was across the ocean and being signed by his counterpart congratulations on your retirement mr vanderlay roarke said pleasantly when the countersigned and witnessed copies were faxed back to him i hope youll enjoy it this was acknowledged by a brief nod and a short formal statement the holograms winked off roarke eased back amused people arent always grateful when you give them large quantities of money are they caro no sir she was tidy with hair shockingly white and gloriously styled she rose taking both the hard copy and the record disc of the transaction for filing her trim rustcolored suit showed off beautifully shaped legs theyll be less grateful when you turn scanair into a financial success within a year id say ten months he turned to the translator thank you petrov your services were invaluable as always my pleasure sir he was a droid created by one of roarkes science arms his body was slim garbed in a wellcut dark suit his face was attractive but not distractingly so and formed to simulate trustworthy middle age several of his line were leased by the un give me an hour caro before the next i have some personal business to tend to you have a one oclock lunch with the department heads of sky ways to discuss the absorption of scanair and the publicity strategies here or off site here sir in the executive dining hall you approved the menu last week she smiled in anticipation right i remember ill be there he moved through the side door and into his office before going to the desk he engaged locks it wasnt strictly necessary caro would never come in unannounced but it paid in certain areas to be cautious the work he intended to do couldnt go on his log he would have preferred to handle it at home but he was squeezed for time and so he thought was eve at his desk unit he engaged the jamming field that would block any scan by compuguard the law frowned on unauthorized hacking and the penalties were stiff computer membership data church of satan new york city branch under direction of selina cross working that data is protected under religious privacy act request denied roarke only smiled hed always preferred a challenge oh well i think we can change your mind about that prepared to enjoy himself he slipped off his suit jacket rolled up his sleeves and got to work o o downtown eve paced dr miras pretty designedtosoothe office she was never completely relaxed there she trusted miras judgment she always had more recently she had come to trust the doctor on a personal level as much as it was possible but it didnt make her relax mira knew more about her than anyone more eve suspected than she knew about herself facing someone with that kind of intimate knowledge wasnt relaxing but she hadnt come to talk about personal matters eve reminded herself she was here to talk murder mira opened the door and stepped in her smile was slow and warm and personal she always looked so perfect eve decided never too glossy never undone never less than competent today instead of her customary suit mira wore a slim pumpkincolored dress with a singlebutton matching coat of the same abovetheknee length her shoes were of a slightly darker tone and boasted the skinny heels that eve always marveled a woman would wear by choice mira offered both hands a gesture of affection that simultaneously baffled and pleased eve its good to see you back in fighting shape eve no problem with the knee oh with a faint frown eve glanced down remembering the injury shed suffered while closing a recent case no the mts did a good job id forgotten about it a side affect of your job mira settled in one of her scoop chairs id think it would be a bit like childbirth excuse me the ability to forget the pain the trauma to both body and mind and go on to do the same thing again ive always believed women make good cops and doctors because theyre inherently resilient that way wont you sit have some tea tell me what i can do for you i appreciate you fitting me in eve sat shifted restlessly she always felt inclined to bare her soul once she was settled in this room with this woman its about a case im working on i cant give you many details theres an internal block i see mira programmed tea tell me what you can one subject is a young woman eighteen very bright and apparently very impressionable its an age for explorations mira took out the tea steaming fragrantly in delicate china cups offered one to eve eve would drink it but she wouldnt particularly like it i suppose the subject has family close family though the father is out of the picture there is extended family grandparents cousins that kind of thing she wasnt isnt eve corrected alone mira nodded eve had been alone she thought brutally alone the subject had an interest in ancient religions and cultures was studying same over the past year she developed a certain interest in the occult hmm thats also fairly typical youth often explores various creeds and beliefs in order to find and cement their own the occult with its mystique and its possibilities is very attractive she became involved in satanism as a dabbler eve frowned shed expected mira to show some surprise or disapproval instead she was sipping tea with that slight attentive smile playing around her mouth if that means was she toying with it id say she went deeper initiated im not sure what that involves depending on the sect there would be slight variations broadly it would entail a waiting period the taking of vows a physical mark on the body generally on or near the genitalia the initiate would be accepted into the coven with a ceremony there would be an altar a human one probably female within a circle the princes of hell would be called while the initiate or initiates knelt symbolism would include flame smoke the ringing of a bell graveyard dirt preferably from an infant they would be given water or wine mixed with urine to drink then the high priest or priestess would mark the initiate with a ceremonial knife an athame yes mira smiled as though pleased with a bright student and though its illegal if the coven is able they will then sacrifice a young goat with some the blood of the goat is mixed with wine and consumed once done the coven engages in sex the altar may be used by all or many it would be considered both a duty and a pleasure sounds like youve been there no but i was allowed to observe a sabbat ceremony once it was quite fascinating you dont actually believe that stuff stunned eve set the cup aside calling up the devil mira lifted a smoothly arched brow i believe in good and evil eve and i dont by any means discount the likelihood of an ultimate good or an ultimate evil in my profession and yours we see too much of both to deny it humans committed evil eve thought evil was human but devil worship those who choose to focus their lives and shall we say souls on this creed generally do so for its freedom its structure and its celebration of selfishness others are seduced by the promise of power and many by the sex it was just sex thats what wineburg had said had sobbed eve remembered before he died your young woman eve was likely drawn in first by the intellect satanism is centuries old and like most pagan religions predates christianity why does it survive and in some eras even prosper its filled with secrets and sins and sex its rites are mysterious and elaborate she would have wondered and coming from a close and likely sheltered homelife was at an age ripe for rebellions against the status quo the ceremony you described was similar to one she described to me but she had only begun to observe and she was sexually used she was a virgin and was i suspect drugged i see there are always sects that diverge from the established rules of law some can be dangerous she had blanks time losses and became almost slavishly devoted to two of the members she backed away from her family and her studies until she witnessed the ritual murder of a child human sacrifice is an old practice and a deplorable one mira sipped delicately if drugs were involved its highly possible she was made an addict dependent upon these people that would explain the blanks i take it the murder she witnessed shocked her away from the cult and its rituals she was terrified she didnt go to her family didnt report the incident she ran to a witch a white witch a wiccan eve compressed her lips she did what i expect would be considered a religious one eighty started burning white candles instead of black and she lived in terror claimed that one of the membership could turn into a raven shapeshifting thoughtfully mira rose to program more tea interesting she believed they would kill her had killed someone close to her though that death is for now officially listed under natural causes i have no doubt they tormented her found a way to play on her delusions and fears im thinking some of that came from her own sense of guilt and shame you could be right emotions influence the intellect just how much eve demanded enough for her to see things that werent there enough for her to run from an illusion into the path of an oncoming car and kill herself mira sat again shes dead then im sorry are you quite sure she ran from an illusion a trained observer was on the scene there was nothing there except eve added with a twist of her lips a black cat the traditional familiar that alone might have been enough to push her over the edge even if the cat was planted in order to frighten her you would have a difficult time terming it homicide they played on her mind drugged her possibly used hypnosis they tormented her with tricks and link transmissions then they pushed her over damned if that isnt murder and i will make it stick taking religion particularly religions the masses dont wish to acknowledge into court wont be easy i dont care about easy the people behind this cult are dirty and i believe they have killed four people in the last two weeks four mira paused set the cup down the body that was left near your home the details in the media were sketchy its connected yeah he was an initiate and he had his throat slit by an athame it was left in him stuck in his groin with a note that condemned satanism he was strapped to an inverted pentagram mutilation and murder mira pursed her lips if it was wiccans its very much out of character very much against their creed people do things out of character and against their creeds all the time eve said impatiently but at this time i suspect a member or members of his own cult another man was killed last night with an athame we held it from the morning reports but itll be all over the media within a couple of hours i was on scene chasing him down i didnt run fast enough he was killed quickly without ritual with a police officer in pursuitmira shook her head a desperate or arrogant move if this was committed by the same people it shows a growing boldness and maybe a taste for it blood becomes addictive i want to know where the weaknesses are in the kind of personality who runs a cult like this ive got a female long yellow sheet involving illegal sex and drug trafficking bisexual she heads up the club lives well her companion is a wellbuilt male who caters to her she likes to show off eve added remembering the fire trick she claims to be clairvoyant shes edgy with a slippery temper pride would likely be the first weakness if shes in a position of power and authority she would likely take disrespect badly is she clairvoyant are you serious eve mira sighed lightly psychic abilities exist and always have studies have established that yeah yeah eve waved a hand in dismissal the kijinsky institute for one ive got a detailed report on the white witch from there they claim shes off the charts and you dont agree with the kijinsky institute crystal balls and palm reading youre a scientist yes i am and as such i accept that science is fluid it changes as we learn more about the universe and what inhabits it many wellrespected scientists believe that were born with what we can term this sixth sense or a heightened sense if you will some develop it some block it most of us retain at least some level wed call it instinct hunches intuition you rely on that yourself i rely on evidence on facts you have hunches eve and your intuition is a finely crafted tool and roarke she smiled when eves brows drew together a man doesnt rise so high so young without a strong instinct for making the right move at the right time magic if you want to use a more romantic term exists youre telling me you believe in mind reading and spell casting i can intuit whats going through your mind right now mira chuckled finished her tea mira youre thinking is full of shit eves lips curved in a reluctant smile of her own close enough let me say this since i believe its part of what you came here for witchcraft black and white has existed since the dawn of humanity and where there is power there is benefit and there is abuse that too is the nature of humanity we cant through all our scientific and technical skill destroy one without damaging the other power requires tending as do beliefs so we have our ceremonies and our rituals we need the structure the comfort and yes the mystery of them i dont have any problem with ceremonies and rituals dr mira unless they cross the line of the law i would agree but the law can also be fluid it changes adapts murder stays murder whether its accomplished with a stone spear or a laser blast her eyes were dark and fierce or whether its done with smoke and mirrors ill find the perpetrator and no magic in the world is going to stop me no a small niggling fear what might have been called a hunch knotted in miras gut i would agree with that as well youre not without power eve and youll match yours against this she folded her hands i can provide you with a more detailed analysis on both satanism and wicca if it might help i like to know what im dealing with id appreciate it can you give me a profile of a typical member of both cults there isnt a typical member any more than there are typical members of the catholic faith or of buddhism but i can generalize certain personality types who are often attracted to the occult the wiccan the young woman went to is she a suspect shes not the prime but shes a suspect revenge is a strong motive and if satanists keep ending up with a ritual knife in vital organs i wont overlook revenge unable to resist eve ran her tongue over her teeth but i suppose shed be more likely to put a curse on them check the nails and hair of your victims or of any subsequent ones if a curse is involved there should be signs of recent snippings yeah ill do that eve rose i appreciate the help ill get you a report by tomorrow great she started out paused you seem to know a lot about all of this is it the kind of thing you study for psychiatry to some extent but i have a more personal interest and studied fairly extensively her lips curved my daughter is wiccan eves jaw dropped oh what the hell did she say now well i guess that explains it uncomfortable she dug her hands into her pockets around here no she lives in new orleans she finds it less restrictive there i may be a bit unobjective on the matter eve under the circumstances but i think youll find its a lovely faith very earthy and generous sure eve edged for the door im going to observe a meeting tomorrow night youll have to let me know what you think and if you have questions im unable to answer im sure my daughter would be happy to speak with you ill let you know she headed to the elevator blowing out a long breath miras daughter was a witch for christs sake she thought that was a hell of a capper o o she headed back to central with the intention of rounding up peabody then heading to wineburgs townhouse she wanted to get a look at his lifestyle his logs and his personal records she had a feeling a drone like him would have kept some private list of names and places the sweepers had already been through routinely and had turned up nothing of particular interest but she could get lucky she passed peabody in the bullpen as she swung through my vehicle fifteen minutes i want to check my messages make a couple of calls yes sir lieutenant later eve said shortly hurrying by and missing peabodys wince the reason for it was waiting in her office feeney she tugged her jacket off tossed it on a chair you decide to head to mexico youre going to need to call roarke for the details he should be she broke off when feeney stood up walked over and shut her door it had only taken one look at his face to know you lied to me there was a quaver in his voice that came as much from hurt as anger but his eyes were flat and cold you fucking lied to me i trusted you youve been investigating frank behind my back over his own dead body there was no point in denying less in asking how hed found out shed known he would there was going to be an internal investigation whitney wanted me to clear him and thats what ive done internal investigation my ass nobody was cleaner than frank i know that feeney i was but you investigated you went through his records and you did it around me thats the way it had to be bullshit i goddamn trained you youd still be in uniform if i hadnt put you here and you back stab me he stepped closer fists clenched at his sides she preferred him to use them youve got alices file open suspected homicide she was my goddaughter and you dont tell me you think some son of a bitch killed her you block me out of the investigation you lie to me you looked right in my face and lied to me her stomach had gone to ice yes you think shed been drugged and raped and murdered and you dont take me in hed gotten into the records the reports she realized theyd been sealed and coded but that wouldnt have stopped him if hed gotten a whiff and she decided hed gotten one the night before over wineburgs body i couldnt she said in a flat voice even if i hadnt been under orders i couldnt you were too close you cant objectively assist on an investigation involving family what the hell do you know about family he exploded and made her jerk yes shed have preferred his fists orders he continued bitterness spewing out and scalding her fucking orders is that your line dallas is that your reason for treating me like some lame rookie take a vacation feeney use my rich husbands fancy house in mexico his lips peeled back in a sneer that would have been fine for you wouldnt it get me out of your way shuffle me off and out from underfoot because im useless to you on this one no god feeney ive gone through doors with you his voice was abruptly quiet and made her throat burn i trusted you id have put my back up against yours anytime anyplace but no more youre good dallas but youre cold the hell with you she said nothing when he walked out leaving her door swinging open could say nothing hed nailed it she decided and hed nailed her dallas peabody rushed the door i couldnt eve cut her off simply lifting a finger turning her back slowly with slow even breaths she pulled her guts back in even then they ached she could still smell him in the room that stupid cologne his wife always bought him were going to do a followup sweep of wineburgs townhouse get your gear peabody opened her mouth closed it again even if shed known what to say she didnt imagine it would be welcome yes sir eve turned back her eyes were blank cool composed then lets move chapter thirteen she was in a pisser of a mood by the time she got home shed turned wineburgs townhouse inside out reworking every step already taken by the sweepers for three hours she and peabody had searched closets and drawers run logs and traced link records she found two dozen allbutidentical dark suits shoes so glossy shed seen her own scowl reflected in the tips an incredibly boring collection of music discs though hed had a lock box the contents hadnt been very illuminating two thousand in cash another ten in credits and an extensive collection of hardcore pornographic videos might have given some insight into the man but no solid leads toward his killer hed kept no personal diary and his appointment book listed times and dates and very little about the content of any meeting personal or professional his financial records were ordered and precise as one might expect from a man who dealt with money as an occupation all expenses and income were carefully logged though the large and regular bimonthly withdrawals from credit into cash over the last twoyear period of wineburgs fussy life gave eve a solid notion just how selina managed to live so well the withdrawals were all logged under personal expenses the consistency of latenight appointments over the last two years again bimonthly and always on the same date as the personal cash withdrawal wasnt enough to establish a solid connection with selina crosss cult the lady herself was never mentioned hed been divorced childless and hed lived alone so she knocked on doors talked to neighbors eve learned wineburg hadnt been the sociable sort hed rarely had visitors and none of his neighbors had been curious enough or would admit to paying close enough attention to any of those rare visitors to give a description she came away with nothing but a raw feeling in the gut and a mounting sense of frustration she knew without a doubt that wineburg had been part of crosss cult that hed paid heavily first monetarily and then with his life for the privilege but she was no closer to proving it and her mind wasnt as focused on the business at hand as it should have been when she headed home alone feeneys angry face and bitter words played back in her head and frustration slammed up hard against misery shed more than let him down she knew she had betrayed him by doing precisely what he had helped train her to do shed followed orders shed been a cop shed done her job but she hadnt been a friend she thought as her temples throbbed with stress shed weighed her loyalties and in the end had chosen the job over the heart cold hed called her she remembered and squeezed her eyes shut and cold she had been the cat padded to her the moment eve stepped in the door winding around her legs as she stepped into the foyer she kept walking cursing lightly when he tripped her summerset slipped out of a doorway roarke has been trying to reach you yeah well ive been busy she nudged galahad away impatiently with her foot is he here not as yet you might reach him at his office ill talk to him when he gets home she wanted a drink something strong and mindmisting recognizing the danger and the weakness of that crutch she turned away from the parlor and walked in the opposite direction im not here to anybody else get it certainly summerset said stiffly as she strode away summerset bent and picked up the cat to stroke something he never would have done had anyone been around to observe the lieutenant is very unhappy summerset murmured perhaps we should make a call galahad purred stretched his neck in appreciation of summersets long bony fingers their mutual affection was their little secret it would have surprised eve though she wasnt thinking of either of them she took the stairs moved through the indoor pool and garden area and into the gym physical exertion she knew blocked emotional distress keeping her mind blank she changed into a black skin suit and high tops she programmed the full body unit ordering the machine to take her through a brutal series of reps and resistance exercises gritting her teeth as the clipped computer voice demanded that she squat lift stretch hold repeat shed worked up a satisfactory sweat by the time she switched machines for aerobics the combounit took her on a punishing run up inclines down them a race up endless flights of stairs shed set it for variety and found the change of texture on her running surface from simulated asphalt to sand to grass to dirt interesting but it wasnt doing anything to ease the ache in her belly you could run she thought with dull fury but you couldnt hide her heart was pumping hard her skin suit soaked with sweat but her emotions were still fragile as glass what she needed eve decided as she tugged on soft protective gloves was to pound on something shed never tried out the sparring droid it was one of roarkes newest toys the unit was a middleweight six feet one ninety and firmly muscled good reach eve decided with her hands on her hips as she sized him up she punched in the code on his storage tube there was a faint hum as circuits were engaged the unit opened dark polite brown eyes you wish a match yeah pal i wish a match boxing karate korean or japanese tae kwon do kung fu street style selfdefense programs are also available contact is optional straight handtohand she said backing up and gesturing full contact timed rounds hell no we go till one of us is down pal and out she curled her fingers in a comeahead gesture acknowledged there was a faint humming from the unit as he selfprogrammed i outweigh you by approximately seventy pounds if you prefer my program includes a handicap she brought her fist up hard and fast an uppercut to the jaw that snapped his head back theres my handicap come on as you wish he crouched as she did and began to circle you did not indicate if you desired vocal additions to the program taunting insults he staggered back as her foot whipped up and plowed into his guts compliments or suitable exclamations of pain are available come at me will you for christs sake he did with a swiftness and force that had her stumbling back nearly losing her footing this she decided as she pivoted and caught him backhanded was more like it he blocked her next blow shifted weight and wrapped his arm around her throat eve planted her feet elbowed and flipped him over her shoulder he was up like lightning before she could attempt a pin his gloved fist made a solid connection with her solar plexus pushing a whoosh of air out of her lungs and ringing bright pain straight into her head doubled over she followed through with a head butt stomped hard on his instep when roarke walked in ten minutes later he watched his wife fly through the air and go skidding across the mat lifting a brow he leaned back against the door and settled down to watch she didnt have time to gain her feet before the droid was on her so she grabbed one of his ankles twisted hauled and thrusted her mind was a blank now a black blank her breath was heaving and she could taste the metallic flavor of blood inside her mouth she went at her opponent like a hail storm cold and relentless each jab each blow each kick given or received sang through her body with icy primitive rage her eyes were flat with violence now her fists merciless as she concentrated on the head working the droid back back frowning roarke straightened her breath was wheezing out now all but sobbing yet she didnt stop when the droid staggered went down on its knees she crouched for the kill end program roarke ordered and caught his wifes rigid arm before she could kick the droids lolling head youre going to damage the unit he said mildly it isnt designed for to the death she bent over resting her hands on her knees to catch her breath her mind was full of red now red rage and she needed to clear it sorry i guess i got carried away she eyed the droid who remained slumped on his knees mouth slack eyes blank as a dolls ill run a diagnostic on it dont worry about it he started to turn her to face him but she broke away moved across the room for a towel in the mood for a fight i guess i wanted to pound something should i suit up he was smiling a little until she lowered the towel the rage had drained from her face all that was left in her eyes was misery what is it eve what happened nothing just a rough day she tossed the towel aside moved to the cold box unit for a bottle of mineral water so far wineburgs house is a bust nothing there to help us sweepers didnt find anything in the garage either didnt expect them to i jabbed some at cross again and at alban the magnificent had a consult with mira her daughters a wiccan can you beat that it wasnt work he thought that put that painful unhappiness in her eyes what is it isnt that enough its going to be tough to get an objective consult from mira when her daughters into spellcasting then theres peabody shes caught a damn cold and her heads so full of snot i have to say everything twice before it gets through she was talking too fast eve realized words were tumbling out of her mouth and she couldnt seem to stop them a hell of a lot of good shes going to be to me hacking and sneezing all goddamn day the media picked up on wineburg and the fact that you and i were on scene when it went down my links jammed with fucking reporters leaks everywhere fucking leaks everywhere feeney found out ive been holding back on him ah roarke thought there we are he was hard on you why shouldnt he be her voice rose as she whirled and searched for temper to cover the hurt he shouldve been able to trust me i lied to him right to his face what choice did you have theres always a choice she bit the words off heaved the halfempty bottle at the wall where it bounced and spewed out bubbling water theres always a choice she repeated i made mine i knew how he felt about frank about alice but i blocked him out i followed orders i walked the line she could feel the pain rising straining to spew as the water had spewed out of the bottle she fought to block it back he was right everything he said to me everything i could have gone to him on the side is that what you were trained to do is that what he trained you to do he made me she said fiercely i owe him i should have told him how it was going down no he stepped to her took her by the shoulders no you couldnt i could have she shouted it i should have i wish to god i had and broke covered her face with her hands and broke oh god what am i going to do roarke gathered her close she cried rarely a last resort and always when the tears finally came they were vicious he needs time hes a cop eve part of him already understands the rest just needs to catch up no her hands fisted in his shirt held on the way he looked at me ive lost him roarke ive lost him i swear id rather lose my badge he waited while the tears stormed out while her body shook with them there was such strong emotions in her he thought rocking as her hands clenched and unclenched against his back emotions shed spent a lifetime bottling up so they were only the more potent when they broke free damn it she let out a breath long and shaky her head felt achy muffled her throat raw i hate doing that it doesnt help more than you think he stroked a hand over her hair then tipped it under her chin to lift her face you need food and a decent nights sleep so you can do what you need to do what i need to do close the case once you have you can put all this behind you yeah she pushed her hands over her hot wet cheeks close the case thats the bottom line she hissed out a breath thats the goddamn job thats justice he brushed a thumb over the dent in her chin isnt it she looked up at him her eyes reddened swollen exhausted i dont know anymore o o she didnt eat and he didnt press her there had been grief in his life and he knew food wasnt the answer hed considered browbeating her into taking a sedative that he knew would have been an ugly business so he was grateful when she went to bed early he made some excuse about a conference call from his office he watched on the monitor until her restless twists and turns stopped and she slept what he had to do would take no more than an hour or two he doubted shed surface before then and miss him o o hed never been to feeneys the apartment building was comfortably shabby wellsecured and unpretentious roarke thought it suited the man because he didnt want to risk being refused entrance he bypassed the security buzzer and entrance locks that suited him he strolled through the tiny lobby caught the faint scent of a recent insect extermination though he approved the intent he disliked the lingering reminder of it and made a note to have it dealt with after all he owned the building he stepped into an elevator requested the third floor he noticed when he stepped out again that the corridor carpet could use replacing but it was well lit the tiny beam on the security cameras blinking efficiently the walls were clean and thick enough to muffle all but a faint hum of life behind closed doors a low drift of music a quick rumble of laughter a fretful babys nighttime wail life roarke thought and a pleasant one he rang the bell at feeneys door and waited his eyes stared soberly at the peep screen continued to stare when feeneys irritated voice came through the intercom what the hell do you want you slumming i dont think this building qualifies as a slum anything does compared to that palace you live in do you want to discuss the difference in our living arrangements through the door or are you going to ask me in i asked what you want you know why im here he quirked a brow making sure it was just insulting enough youve got guts enough to face me dont you feeney it had as roarke had expected the right effect the door swung open feeney stood blocking entrance with his compact body braced for war his rumpled face bright with fury its none of your fucking business on the contrary roarke stood where he was kept his voice even its very much my fucking business but i dont believe its any of your neighbors teeth clenched feeney stepped back come in and say what you have to say then get the hell out is your wife at home roarke asked when feeney slammed the door at his back shes got a girls thing tonight feeney inclined his head much like a bull roarke thought preparing to charge you want to take a shot at me you go ahead i wouldnt mind pounding that pretty face of yours christ jesus shes just like you shaking his head roarke wandered the living room homey he decided not quite tidy the viewing screen was set on the ball game the sound muted the batter swung the ball flew in total silence whats the score yanks are up by one bottom of the seventh he caught himself on the verge of offering roarke a beer then stiffened again she told you didnt she filled you in right from the getgo she wasnt under orders not to and she thought i could help he could help feeney thought and tasted bitterness her rich fancy husband could help but not her former trainer not her former partner not the man who had worked side by side with her with pride and goddamn it affection for ten years doesnt make you less of a civilian his tired eyes went broody you didnt even know frank no i didnt but eve did she cared wed been partners me and frank we were friends family she had no business bumping me out of it thats how i feel thats what i told her im sure you did roarke turned away from the view screen looked feeney dead in the eye and however you told her it broke her heart dented her feelings some feeney walked away picked up a halfempty bottle of beer even through the murky haze of his fury hed seen the devastation in her eyes when hed come down on her and had willed himself not to give a damn shell get over it he drank deeply knowing the taste wouldnt overpower the bitterness lodged in his throat shell do her job she just wont do it with me anymore i said you broke her heart i meant it how long have you known her feeney roarkes voice hardened demanding attention ten years eleven how many times have you seen her fall apart i imagine you could count them on the fingers of one hand well i watched her fall apart tonight he took a careful breath temper wasnt the answer here not for any of them if you wanted to crush her you succeeded i told her how things were thats all guilt was already seeping in he slammed down the bottle determined to chase it away cops back each other they trust each other or theyve got nothing she was digging on frank she should have come to me is that what youd have told her to do roarke countered is that the kind of cop you helped her become it wasnt you in whitneys office taking the orders doing the job he went on without giving feeney time to answer and suffering for it no a fresh wave of bitterness passed through him it wasnt me he sat deliberately turned up the sound and stared at the ancient battle on the screen stubborn thickheaded irish bastard roarke thought with twin tugs of sympathy and impatience you did me a favor once roarke began when i was first involved with eve and i hurt her because i misunderstood a situation you straightened me out on that so im going to do you a similar favor i dont want your favors youll have it anyway roarke sat in a chair comfortably sprung he helped himself to feeneys nearly empty bottle what do you know about her father what baffled now feeney turned his head and stared what the hell does that have to do with anything it has everything to do with her did you know he beat her tortured her raped her repeatedly until she was eight years old a muscle worked in feeneys jaw as he turned away again muted the screen hed known that shed been found in an alley at eight beaten broken sexually abused that was on record and he never worked with anyone without knowing their official data but he hadnt known it was her father whod done it hed suspected as much but he hadnt known his stomach twisted his hands clenched im sorry for that she never brought it up she didnt always remember or more likely she did and refused to remember she still has nightmares flashbacks you got no business telling me this shed likely say the same but im telling you anyway she made herself what she is and you helped shed go to the wall for you you know that cops back up cops thats the job im not talking about the job she loves you and she doesnt love easily its difficult for her to feel it and to show it part of her may always be braced for betrayal for a blow youve been her father for ten years feeney she didnt deserve to be broken again roarke stood and saying nothing more walked out alone feeney raked his hands up over his face into his wiry red hair then let them drop on his lap o o it was six fifteen when eve rolled over blinked at the light streaming through the windows roarke preferred waking to sun unless she snuck out of bed or climbed in well after him she didnt get her shot at pulling the privacy screens she felt logy decided it was too much sleep and started to slip out of bed roarkes arm swept out and pinned her not yet his voice was husky his eyes still closed as he tugged her back over im awake i can get an early start she wiggled ive been in bed nearly nine hours i cant sleep anymore he opened one eye sufficient to note that she did indeed look rested youre a detective he pointed out ill bet if you investigated youd uncover the startling fact that there are activities that can be done in bed other than sleep his lips curved as he rolled on top of her allow me to give you the first clue it shouldnt have surprised her that he was already hard or that she would be so instantly ready for him he slid inside her smooth slow deep and watched the lingering sleep clear from her eyes into awareness i think ive figured it out already she lifted her hips matched his lazy pace youre such a quick study he lowered his lips to nuzzle just under her jawline i like this spot he murmured and this one his hand trailed up her rib cage cupped her breast the arousal was sweet simple and made her sigh let me know when you get to something you dont like she wrapped her arms around him her legs he was so solid so warm the steady beat of his heart against hers so comforting pleasure built in gauzy layers floating over her mind stroking through her body go over for me he nibbled her lips then swept his tongue inside to tangle with hers to nip to suck go over he repeated slow well her breath was already hitching catching in her throat since you ask so nice the climax rolled through her one long lingering wave she felt him follow caught in the same current and pressed her cheek to his was that like a cookie she wondered hmmm you know have a cookie youll feel better she put her hands on either side of his face lifting it as he laughed were you making me feel better i certainly hope so it worked for me he dipped his head to kiss her lightly i wanted you i always do its funny how men can wake up with their brains in their cocks it makes us what we are still chuckling he rolled her over him patted her butt lets take a shower ill give you another cookie o o thirty minutes later she stumbled out of the shower and into the drying tube he was a quick change artist when it came to mood she thought dizzily from lazy to amused to hot steamy mindnumbing sex all in one short morning because her system was still frazzled she braced a hand against the curve of the tube as warm air blew around her when he stepped out of the shower she jabbed out a finger stay away from me you grab me again ill have to take you down i mean it ive got work he hummed a tune and used a towel i like making love to you in the morning you only wake up fast if you get a call from dispatch or if i seduce you im awake now she stepped out pushed a hand through her hair giving herself safe distance she reached for a robe go look at the stock reports or something i intend to youll want breakfast he added as he left the room ill order it up she started to tell him she wasnt hungry she wasnt but she knew without fuel she wouldnt make it through the day when she joined him in the bedroom he was slipping into a shirt his gaze focused on the table monitor where he could view the headlines and financial reports she walked past him to her closet chose plain gray trousers im sorry i lost it last night he lifted his gaze noted she kept her back to him as she pawed out a shirt you were upset you had a right to be anyway i appreciate you not making me feel like an idiot how do you feel now she jerked a shoulder ive got a job to do shed come to that end while shed tossed her way into sleep im going to do it maybe well maybe if i do it right feeney wont hate me so much when its over he doesnt hate you eve when she didnt answer he let it drop hed already programmed their meal in the recessed autochef i thought ham and eggs would do the trick this morning he got the coffee first brought it to the table in the sitting area itll do the trick any morning she pasted on a determined smile went over to get the food herself he ordered the viewing screen on channel while she shoveled in creamy eggs she scowled as the onair reporter glossy as a china doll at seven thirty in the morning recited the data on the wineburg homicide though lieutenant eve dallas assigned to the homicide division of nypsd was on the scene only yards away from the murder site the police have no solid leads the investigation continues this is the second stabbing death connected with lieutenant dallas in as many days when asked if the cases are linked dallas refused to comment a tenyearold kid with a vision defect could see theyre linked for christs sake she had been eating on automatic and now shoved the plate aside that cross bitch is sitting in her hell house laughing springing up she began to pace roarke took it as a good sign if she was angry she wasnt feeling sorry for herself he chose some fresh strawberry jam for his croissant im going to nail her i swear to god im going to nail her for all of them i need to connect wineburg to her if i can do that i can harass her some more may not be enough to get me a warrant to toss her place but i can keep on her ass well then roarke wiped his fingers with a pale blue linen cloth set it aside i should be able to help you with that as she continued to pace and mutter he rose walked to a dresser took a sealed disc from a drawer lieutenant what im thinking then i wont interrupt your train of thought with the list of membership from crosss cult with a half smile on his face he tapped the disk against his palm and waited for her eyes to clear and shoot to him the list you got the membership roster how he cocked his head you dont really want to know how do you no she said it immediately no i guess i dont just tell me hes on it she closed her eyes briefly just tell me wineburgs on the list he certainly is her grin flashed quick and fever bright i love you roarke handed her the disc i know you do chapter fourteen feeney wanted to see whitney first so he made it early and he made it personal they too went back together a long way feeney thought as he pulled up in front of the neat twolevel home in the burbs hed been here socially over the years the commanders wife loved to throw parties his mood wasnt sociable now as he strode up the pebbled walk toward the quiet house in the wakening neighborhood a few yards down a dog was barking in high monotonous yips the bark had none of the faintly metallic ring that said droid but held a vibrancy of flesh and blood the kind of dog that shit in the yard feeney thought with a shake of his head and scratched at fleas leaves skittered playfully along the street most of them making beelines for lawns lawns that were in a neighborhood like this tended like a religion feeney himself didnt get burb life where you had to rake and mow and water or hire someone to rake and mow and water hed raised his family in the city used the public parks hell you had to pay for them anyway he moved his shoulders restlessly not quite comfortable with the morning silence anna whitney answered his knock and though she couldnt have been expecting company at that hour she was already decked out in a trim jumpsuit her light hair waved stylishly and her makeup was subtle and perfect her lips curved in welcome her eyes may have flickered with surprise and curiosity but she was too much the cops wife to ask questions feeney how nice to see you come in please have some coffee jacks just having his second cup in the kitchen sorry to disturb you at home anna i need a few minutes of the commanders time of course and hows sheila she asked as she led the way down the hall toward the kitchen shes fine she looked just wonderful the last time i saw her her new stylist is terrific jack youve got company for coffee she breezed into the kitchen caught the surprise then the speculation in her husbands eyes she knew enough to make a quick exit ill let you two chat ive got a million things to do this morning feeney you give sheila my best now i will thanks he waited until the door swung closed never taking his eyes off whitneys goddamn it jack this should be discussed in my office feeney im talking to you feeney jabbed a ringer to someone ive known twentyfive years to someone who knew frank whyd you cut me out of this why did you order dallas to lie to me that was my decision feeney the investigation had to be on a needtoknow basis and i didnt need to know no whitney folded his big hands you didnt need to know frank and i raised some of our kids together alice was my godchild frank and i rode as partners for five fucking years our wives are like sisters who the hell are you to decide i dont need to know hes being investigated your commander whitney said shortly and pushed his still steaming coffee aside and the reasons you just stated are the very reasons i made the decision you pushed me aside you know damn well my division should have been involved you needed records records were part of the problem whitney said evenly there was no record of a heart defect in his medical files no record of a connection personal or professional between him and a known chemidealer frank had nothing to do with illegals no records whitney continued and his closest friend is the best edetective in the city feeneys eyes went wide and his color rose hot you think i wiped records you had dallas looking at me no i didnt think you wiped records but it wasnt something i could ignore with iad breathing down my neck who would you have picked to do the work feeney whitney demanded with an impatient gesture i knew that lieutenant dallas would be thorough and careful and that shed bust her ass to clear both you and frank i knew she had contacts that could access those records deluged by emotion feeney turned to stare out of the gleaming window into the backyard with its tidily mowed grass and majestic fall flowers you put her in a bad spot you ordered her into a lousy position jack is that what happens when you command you put your troops backs to the wall yeah thats what happens whitney ran a hand over his dark grizzled hair you do what needs to be done and you live with it i had iad drooling my priority was to clear frank and shield his family from anymore hardship dallas was my best shot you trained her feeney you know she was my best shot i trained her feeney agreed sick inside what would you have done whitney demanded straight feeney youve got a dead cop whos been tagged buying illegals from a suspected dealer whos under surveillance there were drugs in his system when he died your gut tells you no way no way he was dirty and maybe your hearts telling you too because you remember when you were both rookies but iads got no gut and its got no heart what would you have done and because hed had a sleepless night to think on it to worry the steps feeney shook his head i dont know but i know i dont want your job commander youve got to be crazy to want this job whitneys wide face relaxed slightly dallas has gone a long way to clearing frank and she took you out of it within the first twentyfour hours shes hardly had more than a week on this and shes already cleared a path with her reports ive been able to back iad off theyre not happy about frank setting up his own sting but theyve eased the pressure thats good feeney dug his hands into his pockets as he turned back shes good christ jack i hit her hard whitneys brows knit you should have come to me going after her was off feeney i gave the orders i took it personal i made it personal he remembered how shed looked at him her face pale her eyes blank hed seen people with that look before victims he thought now who were used to taking a fist in the face ive got to fix it with her she called in a couple minutes before you showed up shes doing a followthrough on a new lead at home feeney jerked his head in a nod id like a couple hours personal time youve got it and i want in on this whitney sat back considered thatll be up to dallas shes primary if were opening this up she chooses her own team o o answer the link will you peabody eve continued to scan the data onscreen as her link beeped insistently it was a wonder to her how many names she recognized from the social political and professional registers it was doubtful shed have recognized quite so many a year before but connecting with roarke had broadened her horizons doctors lawyers she muttered christ this guys been to dinner here and i think roarke used to sleep with this woman this dancer shes got a hit on broadway and a mile of leg its nadine peabody announced and wondered if eve was talking to herself or really wanted to share that particular information she hacked sneezed then added in her now raspy voice furst perfect eve cleared the screen just in case and turned to the link so nadine whats the story youre the story dallas two dead people its dangerous to know you youre still breathing so far so good i thought you might be interested in some data thats come my way we can do a trade show me yours maybe ill show you mine exclusive one on one in your home with you discussing the investigation of both knifings for the noon broadcast eve didnt bother to snort one on one reporting the status of my investigation in my office for the evening broadcast the first body was found at your house i want in it was found outside on the sidewalk and youre not getting in nadine huffed out a breath the pout was for her own benefit she knew better than to think it would budge eve i want the noon eve checked her watch calculated considered ill clear you into my office arrival time eleven fortyfive if i can make it ill be there if not damn it we need setup time fifteen minutes isnt its enough nadine for someone as good as you are be sure your data makes this worth my while make sure you dont look like a rag picker nadine shot back do something with your hair for gods sake rather than respond eve ended transmission what is this obsession people have with my hair and wardrobe she raked a badtempered hand through the hair in question mavis told me youre overdue for a style session leonardos bummed about it you hanging with mavis ive gone down to catch her act a couple times she blew her nose heartily overthecounters were pure crap she decided i like watching her i havent had time for a style session eve muttered i trimmed it myself a couple days ago yeah i could tell at eves narrow look peabody smiled blandly it looks just lovely sir kiss ass eve switched her screen back on and if youre finished with your critique of my personal appearance maybe youd like to run a few of these names i recognize some of them peabody bent over eves shoulder louis trivane big shot celebrity lawyer gets the stars out of legal jams marianna bingsley department store heiress and professional manhunter carlo mancinni cosmetic enhancement guru medical doctor you have to be way rich to have him even consider doing body sculpting on you i know the names peabody i want background personal data financial data medical data any arrests i want to know the names of their spouses and kids and pets i want to know when and how they connected with cross and why they decided satan was a cool guy itll take days peabody said it mournfully and reminded eve painfully of feeney even shooting them into the ircca eve said nothing the international resource center on criminal activity was one of feeneys prides and joys if i could tag someone in the edivision for help we could cut the time in half maybe less peabody jerked a shoulder so where do you want me to start weve got a hop on wineburg so dig deeper there and on lobar robert mathias then start at the top and work down ill start at the bottom and work up look for withdrawals of large amounts at regular intervals we damn well better have what we need when we meet in the middle she narrowed her eyes thinking the financial data on selinas cult would be protected by the privacy act and its status as a registered religion still there was a chance a slim one that shed been cocky enough to make deposits in her personal account that was a simple matter to check on for the other she would have to decide if the data would hold solid if she was able to access it and to access it she needed roarke shed wait she decided a day or two once they ascertained how much money the membership list was suspected of feeding into selinas pockets shed reassess it would be tough to sell the pa on religious contributions as extortion but it might be a start with wineburgs name linked to crosss cult i can pull her into interview i think well make it say around eleven thirty youve got the spot with nadine at eleven fortyfive yeah eves smile spread thatll work oh its not my fault if some bignosed reporter finds out im questioning selina cross knows im primary on two recent homicides then puts two and two together and goes on air with it might shake up some of these fine upstanding satanists some people get real chatty when theyre shook get me that data and i can shake them harder i bow to you save it until we see if it works you use this unit i can use one of roarkes to make the first pass computer copy disc print out hard copy she glanced up at the movement in the doorway went very still abort she murmured and braced to take the next hit from feeney peabody he sent her a quiet look out of sleepstarved eyes i need a moment with your lieutenant sir though she rose peabody waited for eves signal take a break peabody get yourself some coffee yes sir she headed out feeling the needles of edgy tension prickling the air eve didnt speak simply stood her body was set he noted not to defend but to absorb the next blow her eyes were carefully empty but her hand that she braced on the desk shook he stared at it a moment amazed and ashamed that hed caused that your ah summerset said i should just come up it was warm in the room but he didnt remove his rumpled overcoat instead he shoved his hands in the pockets i was off yesterday coming down on you was off you were doing your job he saw her lip tremble as if she would speak or make some sound then she firmed it again and said nothing she looked he realized whipped you broke her heart her father beat her tortured her raped her youve been her father for ten years how the hell was he supposed to deal with that and how could he possibly ignore it the things i said i shouldnt have he pulled his hands free to scrub them hard over his face jesus dallas im sorry did you mean them it was out before she could stop it she held up a hand turned away stared blindly out the window i wanted to mean them i was pissed he crossed to her his hands flapping uselessly i got no excuse he began he touched her then snatched his fingers away from her shoulder when she cringed i got no excuse he said again after a steadying breath and you got a right to step back from me i jumped hard where i shouldnt have jumped you dont trust me now she skimmed the back of her hand over her cheek ashamed the single tear had gotten past her guard thats bullshit dallas theres nobody i trust more look goddamn it it takes a laser hit to get me to apologize to my own wife im telling you im sorry impatient now he grabbed her arm pulled her around she froze her eyes were bright tears sheening them but not thank christ falling dont go female on me dallas i cant kick myself in the ass much harder than i already am he jerked up his chin tapped a finger on it go ahead free shot we wont say anything about you punching out a superior officer i dont want to hit you goddamn it i outrank you i said take your shot a ghost of a smile flitted around her mouth he looked so fierce she thought those drooping camel eyes sparking with temper and frustration maybe after you shave that stubbled skin my knuckles relief flooded through him at the slight curve of her lips youre going soft living the high life with that rich irish son of a bitch i beat hell out of a sparring droid last night one of roarkes finest yeah pride swelled in him ridiculously she tucked her tongue in her cheek i pretended it was you he grinned took out the bag of candied almonds from his pocket offered it edetectives dont have to use their fists they use their brains you taught me to use both and to follow orders he added his eyes resting on hers again id have been ashamed of you if youd forgotten that you did right dallas for frank for the department for me he said and watched her eyes swim again dont do that his voice shook with the plea dont start that shit thats an order she swiped the back of her hand under her nose im not doing anything he waited a moment just to be sure she wasnt going to lose it and embarrass them both when her eyes cleared he nodded in both relief and approval good he jiggled the bag in his hand now are you going to let me in she opened her mouth shut it ive seen whitney he told her feeney found he wanted to smile this was the cop hed trained solid sturdy and straight chewed him out in his own kitchen did you she lifted her brows id like to have seen it trouble was once it was over i had to agree with him hed picked the best cop for the job i know youve been busting ass to push iad out of the picture clear frank me he added and i know youve been working on finding out who did him and alice he had to take a breath because it hurt still hurt i want in dallas im going to tell you straight i need in to clear this out of my gut whitney said it was up to you the tension seeped out of her she could give him this give both of them this lets get to work o o eve was so pleased to have selina cross in interview shed missed anticipating the obvious bonus of having her represented by louis trivane she flashed grins at both of them as she secured the door to interview room a ms cross i appreciate your cooperation mr trivane eve lieutenant dallas she corrected snapping off the grin were not socializing here you know each other selinas eyes went icy pinned her lawyer your representative knows my husband on a social level im acquainted with a number of attorneys in the city ms cross this doesnt affect my or their job performance well go on record eve engaged the recorder recited the pertinent data after reading the revised miranda she sat youve exercised your right to an attorney ms cross i certainly have ive already been harassed by you twice lieutenant dallas i prefer that this continued harassment go on record me too eve smiled you were acquainted with robert mathias also known as lobar he was lobar selina corrected it was his chosen name was is the operative word seeing as hes in a refrigerated unit at the morgue and so is thomas wineburg are you acquainted with him i dont believe ive had the pleasure well thats interesting he was a member of your cult selina set her chin waved away trivane as he leaned forward to speak to her i cant be expected to recognize the name of every member of my church dallas we are she spread her hands on the small table legion maybe this will refresh your memory eve opened a file took a still out and slid it across the table death shots were always ugly selina studied it with a small smile tugging at her mouth a finger of the hand she wore webbed again today traced the spread of harsh red blood i cant say for certain we meet in the dark her gaze lifted to eve its our way i can say for certain both he and lobar were yours and both were murdered with a style of knife used in your rituals an athame yes we are not the only religion who uses such an instrument in ceremony i feel after this violence this persecution of members of my church the police should be concerned with protecting us rather than pointing fingers obviously there is a person or persons determined to eliminate us i figured you had your own protection doesnt your master look out for his own your mockery only shows your ignorance having sex with an eighteenyearold delinquent shows yours did you have sex with wineburg too i said i cant be sure i knew him but if i did i very likely had sex with him selina trivane cut her off his voice firm youre goading my client lieutenant shes stated she cant positively identify this victim she knew him both of you did he was a weasel do you know what a weasel is in copspeak ms cross an informant eve rose leaned over bending her body close to selinas were you worried about how much hed told me is that why you arranged for him to die were you having him followed she slanted her gaze toward trivane briefly maybe you have all your faithful followed i see whatever i need to see in the smoke yeah in the smoke the psychics version of the peeping tom it was risky for wineburg to come by the viewing room why do you suppose he wanted a look at alice had he been there the night she was drugged raped did you let him have her alice was an initiate a willing one she was a child a confused one you like luring the young dont you theyre so much more interesting than stubby fools like wineburg with their firm bodies their malleable minds people like wineburg and the distinguished counsel here theyre just for the money and the cachet but those like alice theyre so tender so tasty selina looked up smugly through her thick dark lashes she was she enjoyed and was enjoyed she didnt have to be lured dallas she came to me now shes dead three deaths your members must be getting nervous eve smiled thinly at trivane i would be martyrdom isnt new dallas people have been killed because of their faith for centuries and still the faith survives well survive well triumph eve took out another still slapped it on the table he didnt it was lobar his mutilated body caught it the garish lights of the crime scene the wound on his throat gaped open like a scream it was trivane who eve watched his eyes blinked rapidly horror flickering through his skin went pasty and his chest rose and fell in jerks he didnt survive eve said softly did he selina his death is a symbol he will not be forgotten do you own an athame i own several naturally like this she took out another photo this one a closeup of the weapon left pinned into lobar blood crusted the blade i have several selina repeated some similar to this as one might expect but i dont recognize this particular one hallucinogens were found in lobars system you use drugs during rituals herbals and some chemicals all legal not everything found in lobars system was on the legal list i cant be responsible for the choices other people make he was with you the night he died was he using he had taken the ritual wine if he took something otherwise it was without my knowledge you have priors as a chemidealer and paid my debt to socalled society you have nothing on me lieutenant i have three bodies and theyre yours ive got a dead cop and hes on you too im closing in on you selina step by step keep out of my face or do you know pain dallas selinas voice went low and thick do you know the pain that eats at the stomach like drops of acid spreading you beg for relief but none comes the pain becomes agony and agony almost pleasure the pain becomes so intense so unspeakable that if a knife came to your hand you would gladly slice through your own guts to cut out the source of it would i eve said coolly would i really i can offer you that i can offer you pain eve smiled and her smile was slow and humorless that slips into the area of threatening a police officer and thatll get you some time in a cage until your lawyer finesses you out again you bitch furious that shed been trapped so neatly and with so little effort selina sprang to her feet you cant hold me for that sure i can selina cross youre under arrest for verbal threat to physically harm a police officer she was fast but eves reflexes were sharp she blocked the first blow as selina flew at her but the second rapid swipe caught her along the throat with those lethal dark nails she smelled her own blood and indulged herself by bringing her elbow up to ram selinas chin the dark eyes rolled back went glassy looks like we add resisting arrest youre going to have your hands full for the next couple hours counselor he hadnt moved not a muscle trivane continued to sit staring at the photos of the dead when feeney opened the door a uniform behind him eve nodded book her she ordered verbal threat and resisting selina staggered as eve passed her to the uniform but her eyes cleared and fixed on eves face with bubbling malice she began to speak softly in a chant that rose and fell almost musically she swiveled her head looking over her shoulder as the uniform took her out eve dabbed ringers on her throat disgusted when they came away smeared with blood did you catch what she was saying there feeney took out a handkerchief handed it to her sounded like latin bastardized some my mother made me learn when i was a kid had delusions about me becoming a priest see if you can make any of it out from the record we may be able to add to the charges shit this burns interview is concluded she added and logged the time and date trivane you want to talk to me what he looked over swallowed shook his head ill see my client lieutenant as soon as shes booked these charges wont hold eve held out her bloody fingers oh i think they will take a good look louis she stepped closer jammed her fingers under his nose it could be yours next time ill see my client he repeated and his face was still white as death as he hurried from the room that bitch is loony feeney commented tell me something i dont know she hates your ever fucking guts he said pleasantly happy to be in tandem again but you knew that too put the hoodoo on you huh cursed you he winked at her let me know if you start getting stomach cramps youre starting to get to her not enough eve murmured but my moneys on the lawyer lets keep a man on him feeney i dont want him ending up dead before he breaks it was the way he looked at the shot of lobar shock then something like recognition she shook her head lets not lose him she glanced at her watch hummed with satisfaction just in time to make my nooner with nadine you want to have that neck looked after nasty later she headed out moving fast nadine wouldnt miss the injury nor eve thought would the allseeing eye of the camera o o what the hell happened to you nadine demanded she stopped pacing stopped looking at her watch little problem in interview you cut it close dallas we got two minutes before air you dont have time to clean up fine well go like we are get a voice and light level nadine told her camera operator she took out a mirrored compact polishing up her face when she sat looks like female she added long nasty nails four separate grooves yeah eve patted the already stained handkerchief against the wound somebody was curious they could check booking get the data nadines eyes went sharp i imagine someone could she purred you didnt do anything with your hair i cut it i meant anything constructive coming up in thirty set suzanna the operator made a circle of forefinger and thumb the fresh blood shows up real good nice touch gee thanks eve settled back hooked one booted foot over her knee lets keep this short nadine i havent seen yours yet heres a preview then what local white witch is the son of infamous mass murderer david baines conroy who is currently doing five separate life stretches no parole options in maximum lockup on penal station omega who in five nadine said sweetly delighted to have snagged eves full attention four three she signaled the last of the countdown with her fingers below camera level on cue she stared into the camera with sober eyes good afternoon this is nadine furst leading off the noon hour with an exclusive interview with homicide lieutenant eve dallas in her office at cop central eve was prepared for the questions she knew nadines style well too well to allow herself to be rattled by the information that had been dumped on her seconds before air time as she imagined nadine had hoped she answered briefly carefully and knew she was bumping up channel s and nadines rating points with every ontheair second the department is proceeding with the belief that the cases are connected as evidence indicates though different weapons were left at the scene of each murder they are of similar style can you describe the weapons i cant comment on that but they were knives they were sharp instruments im not at liberty to go into any more detail doing so would jeopardize our investigation at this point the second victim you were pursuing him at the time of his death why she was ready for this had already decided to exploit the question for her own benefit thomas wineburg had indicated he had information which would be useful to my investigation what information zip eve thought but kept her eyes level im not at liberty to divulge that i can only say we spoke and he became agitated and ran i pursued and he was killed thats correct running didnt help him annoyed that her director indicated her time was up through her earpiece nadine wound the interview to a close and were clear suzanna nadine simply gestured to the door and sent her operator out off the record she began nope gimme all right then nadine sat back crossed her pretty legs charles forte took his mothers maiden name legally twelve years ago after his father was convicted of the ritual slayings of five people its believed he killed countless others but its never been proved the bodies have never been found i know the story behind conroy i didnt know he had a kid that was kept locked privacy act the family was already out of it the mother had divorced and relocated a few years before baines was caught the kid was sixteen when she took him and left twentyone when his father was tried and convicted my sources claim the son attended court every day eve thought of the small unassuming man shed met at alices viewing son of a monster how much of that came through the blood she thought of her own father nearly shuddered i appreciate it if it comes to anything ill owe you yeah you will ive got lots of data on cults in the city nothing as dramatic as this but it may lead somewhere meanwhile if you were in interview with someone pissed off enough to try to slice your jugular should i assume you have a suspect eve studied her nails she supposed some would have said she was overdo for a manicure i cant comment on that you know nadine cameras arent allowed down in booking damn shame thanks for the spot dallas ill be in touch do that eve watched her stroll out had no doubt nadine was making tracks to booking and that selina cross was going to have her name broadcast by the end of the noon report all in all she decided not a bad morning wincing she dragged through her drawers hoping for a first aid kit chapter fifteen i wont make it home eve juggled the call to roarke while her computer searched for all data on david baines conroy can you swing by here about six we can drive upstate for the witch party roarke lifted an elegant brow as long as its not in your vehicle he frowned gestured come a little closer to the screen what now he asked what do you mean what now im busy no your neck oh that she touched her fingers to the stillraw scratches shed never found that first aid kit a difference of opinion i won naturally put something on it lieutenant i should be able to make it there by six thirty we can eat on the way fine eat on the way wait a minute dont bring the limo he only smiled six thirty i mean it roarke dont she hissed when the screen blanked damn with a sigh she swiveled back to the computer the ircca was a fount of data on this one she thought she skimmed through pausing over pertinent facts on david baines conroy divorced one child male charles born january custody awarded to mother ellen forte big surprise eve thought mass murderers werent generally given custody of minor children lets get down to it she murmured charges and convictions charged and convicted murder in the first torture killing posthumous rape and dismemberment of doreen harden mixed race female age sentenced to life maximum facility no parole option charged and convicted murder in the first rape torture killing and dismemberment of emma tangent black female age sentenced to life maximum facility no parole option charged and convicted murder in the first sodomy rape torture killing and dismemberment of lowell mcbride white male age sentenced to life maximum

charged and convicted murder in the first sodomy posthumous rape torture killing and dismemberment of martin savoy mixed race male age sentenced to life maximum facility no parole options currently serving term on penal station omega suspected of twelve additional murders cases open insufficient evidence to charge primary investigators available on request list primaries eve ordered and watched as names and data scrolled moved around did you conroy she muttered noting that the detectives in charge were scattered all over the country shed still been a teenager when conroy had dominated the news she remembered snatches weeping family members begging conroy to tell them where to find the remains of loved ones grimfaced cops giving statements and conroy himself a quiet face slashed with vicious dark eyes theyd called him evil she remembered the antichrist that was the term used over and over again to describe him to try perhaps to separate him from the human but hed been human enough to conceive a child a son and that son was on her current list of suspects maybe just maybe shed been focused too relentlessly on selina cross the son was drawn to power she mused witchcraft was about power wasnt it hed known at least one of the victims and two had been killed with a knife conroy had been very handy with a knife hed also claimed to have been the instrument of a god she recalled scanning data yes there there in one of his rambling statements she highlighted give me audio on this working i am a force beyond you conroys voice crooned out beautiful diction almost musical the sons voice eve thought was equally charismatic i am the instrument of the god of vengeance and pain what i do in his name is grand tremble before me for i will never be vanquished i am legion you are garbage eve corrected legion cross had used the same term interesting had conroy dabbled in satanism she wondered in witchcraft and had the son been attracted to the same areas just how much she wondered did charles forte know about his fathers work and how did he feel about it computer run charles forte of this city formerly charles conroy son of david baines conroy all data working as the information beeped on she tapped her fingers on the desk and considered the mother had taken her son to new york which meant eve mused that the boy had traveled back to attend the trial hed made the effort likely over his mothers objections dropped out of college second term studied pharmaceuticals very interesting licensed as a chemical drone worked on drug cloning and manufacture moved around quite a bit she noted like his dear old dad then settled back in new york coowner of spirit quest she leaned back unconsciously rubbing her wounded throat no marriages no children no arrests she played a hunch medical data charles forte age six broken hand age six minor concussion abdominal bruising age seven seconddegree bums forearms age seven concussion and fractured tibia the list went on through childhood in a pattern that made eves stomach clench hold probability of child abuse probability ninetyeight percent why the hell wasnt it picked up medical records indicate treatment was issued at varying hospitals in varying cities over course of ten years no record of requested search through national child abuse prevention agency idiots idiots she rubbed her hands over her face pressing hard on the headache now brewing in the center of her forehead it was too close to home list any psychiatric treatment or available psychological profiles subject entered miller clinic voluntarily as outpatient doctor of record ernest renfrew from february to september files sealed no other data okay thats enough to chew on save data file forte charles case number h crossreference conroy disengage when complete she glanced up as feeney stuck his head in her doorway cross just got sprung well it was too good to last you have anybody look at those cat scratches i will got a minute sure david baines conroy feeney whistled made himself comfortable on the corner of her desk thats going back sick bastard cut his victims up when he was done with them kept the parts in a portable cold box had a trailer traveled around preaching preaching well thats not exactly the term set himself up as a sort of antichrist lots of shit about anarchy freedom to pursue carnal pleasures opening the gates of hell that sort of thing figures he plucked most of his victims off the road itinerant lcs at least three they pinned him on were licensed companions hookers have always been easy marks for psychos he was found competent to stand trial passed the tests legally he was sane in reality a real whacko he had a family yeah yeah thats right feeney closed his eyes to try to bring it back i was still working homicide then and there wasnt a cop on planet who wasnt personally caught up by the case never did any of his work here that we know of but i remember he had a wife pale jumpy little woman left him before he got snagged seems to me and there was a kid a boy spooky why he had his old mans eyes except they were dead you know i remember thinking we might be tracking him one day in his fathers footsteps then they ducked under the privacy act and nobody ever heard of them again until now eve kept her eyes level im seeing conroys son tonight at a witchs coven o o roarke brought the limo shed been certain he would just to annoy her shed have stayed annoyed if he hadnt seen that the autochef was stocked italian style eve was wolfing down manicotti before they crossed the jacqueline onassis bridge but she shook her head at the burgundy he poured im on duty she said with her mouth full im not he sipped studied her why havent you taken care of that he asked brushing gentle fingers over her throat i got tied up now thats something weve yet to explore he smiled genially when she goggled at him just a thought i caught the replay of your little teteatete with nadine on the way over to central im surprised you agreed to it it was a trade i got my share she leaned forward engaged the privacy shield between them and the driver and id better fill you in before we join in tonights festivities she detailed the new line she was pursuing then sampled one of the sweet fat olives on the antipasto tray it bumps him up a few notches on the list she concluded the sins of the father sometimes it works that way he said nothing a moment they both had reason to be uncomfortable with the theory you know best lieutenant but isnt it just as likely circumstances would push him to the opposite pole he knew alice he has knowledge of chemicals her grandfather had chemicals in his system and shed been hallucinating the other two victims were ritual slayings forte belongs to a cult i cant ignore the steps he looked remarkably unhomicidal to me she poked through the antipasto selected a marinated pepper i once took down this little old lady looked like everybodys favorite granny she took in stray cats and baked cookies for the neighborhood kids grew geraniums on her windowsill enjoying the bite eve chose another pepper shed lured a half a dozen kids into her apartment and had fed their internal organs to the kitties before we nailed her charming story roarke slipped his plate into the holding slot point taken reaching into his pocket he took out the amulet isis had given him the night before slipped it over eves neck whats this for it looks better on you than me she narrowed her eyes at him bull youre being superstitious no im not he lied and set her plate in with his before he shifted and began to unbutton her shirt hey what are you doing passing the time his hands clever and quick swooped down to take her breasts itll take an hour to get there by car im not having sex in the back of a limo she told him its delicious he finished and replaced his hands with his mouth o o she felt remarkably limber and relaxed by the time the limo turned onto a narrow country road here the trees were plentiful the stars brilliant and the dark complete halfdenuded trees arched over the roadway tunneling them in she caught the glinting gold eyes of what might have been a fox as a shadow darted across the road and into the woods feeney and peabody still behind us hmm roarke tucked his shirt back into his trousers it would seem so youre putting that on inside out he said mildly and grinned hell eve struggled back out of the shirt pulled the arms through and tried again dont look so smug i just pretended to enjoy that darling eve he took her hand kissed it youre too good to me youre telling me she slipped the amulet off looped it over his head you wear it before he could object she caught his face in her hands please you dont believe in it anyway no she tucked it under his shirt patted it but i think you do your driver knows where hes going the directions from isis are programmed in he checked his watch by my calculations we should be nearly there looks like were nowhere if you ask me she stared out the window nothing but dark trees and more dark id rather be on my own turf hard to believe theres this much nothing less than two hours drive from new york youre such an urbanite and youre not he moved his shoulders the countrys an interesting place to visit for short periods of time quiet can be restful it makes me edgy they turned onto another winding road and everything looks the same theres no action she decided now you stroll into central or greenpeace park and youre bound to run into a mugger or chemihead at least maybe an unlicensed hooker couple of perverts she glanced back saw he was grinning at her well life with you has such color she snorted strapped on her side arm yeah like everything was gray in your little world before i came along all that wine women and money must have been pretty tedious the ennui he said on a sigh was unspeakable i might have faded away from it if you hadnt tried to hang a murder or two on me just your lucky day she caught the glimmer of lights through the trees as the car turned up a steep rutted incline thank christ looks like the partys already under way try not to sneer roarke patted her knee it would offend our hosts im not going to sneer she already was i want impressions not just of forte of everybody and if you happen to recognize a face let me know she took a small device out of her bag slipped it into her pocket micro recorder roarke clucked his tongue i believe thats illegal not to mention rude i dont know what youre talking about and unnecessary he added he turned his wrist tapped a tiny button on the side of his watch this one is much more efficient i should know i manufacture both brands he smiled as the car stopped at the edge of a small clearing i believe weve arrived eve spotted isis first she was impossible to miss the sheer white robe she wore seemed to glow out of the dark like moonlight her hair was left long and loose flowing over her shoulders a gold band studded with colored stones circled her brow her long narrow feet were bare blessed be she said and disconcerted eve by kissing both her cheeks she greeted roarke the same way then turned back to eve youre injured before eve could respond she lay fingers against the scratches poison poison eve had visions of vicious nails dipped into a slowacting brew that crept through the bloodstream not of the physical but of the spiritual kind i feel selina here her eyes stayed on eves as she lowered her hand to eves shoulder this wont do mirium please welcome our other guests she spoke to a small darkskinned woman as feeneys rattletrap of a car bumped up the road chas will see to your wound its fine ill see an mt in the morning i dont think that will be necessary please come this way its unhealthy to have even this much of her here she led the way around the clearing eve could see a wide circle formed by a ring of white candles people stood outside it chatting she mused as they might at a midtown cocktail party dress varied robes suits long and short skirts twenty in all by her count ranging in age from eighteen to eighty with a mixture of race and gender there seemed no specific type coolers were stacked nearby which she supposed explained why several members were sipping drinks conversation was muted punctuated by the occasional laugh chas turned from a folding table as they approached he wore a simple blue unisuit and soft shoes in the same tone he smiled noting eves suspicious scan of the table witchs tools he told her red cords a whitehandled knife an athame she thought she saw more candles a small brass gong a whip a gleaming silver sword colored bottles bowls and cups interesting its an old ritual requiring old tools but youre hurt he took a step toward her his hand lifting then pausing when she aimed a cool warning look i beg your pardon it looks painful chas is a healer isis curved her lips in challenge consider this a demonstration after all you did come to observe didnt you and your mate wears protection and so eve thought feeling the comfortable weight of her weapon did she okay demonstrate she tilted her head inviting chas to examine the scratches his fingers were surprisingly cool surprisingly soothing as they played over her abraded skin she kept her eyes on his watched them focus then flicker youre fortunate he murmured the result didnt equal the intent will you relax your mind his gaze lifted from his hand met hers the mind and body are one he said quietly in that lovely voice one guides the other one heals the other let me ease this she thought she felt warmth move through her from the point where his fingers lay into her head down through her body until a drowsiness seeped through she jerked herself alert saw him smile quietly i wont hurt you he turned picked up an amber bottle uncorked the stopper and dabbed clear floralscented liquid on his hands this is a balm an old recipe with modern additions he spread it gently his fingers following the path selinas nails had raked it will heal clean and there will be no more discomfort you know your chemicals dont you this is an herbal base he took a cloth from his pocket wiped his fingers but yes i do id like to talk to you about that she waited a beat her eyes keen and about your father she saw the demand hit home in the way his pupils dilated then contracted then isis was stepping between them fury glorious on her face youve been invited here this place is sacred you have no right isis chas touched her arm she has a mission we all do he looked at eve seemed to gather himself yes ill speak with you when you wish but this isnt the place to bring despair the ceremonys about to begin we wont stop you will tomorrow nine oclock at spirit quest be suitable thats fine excuse me do you always repay kindness with pain isis demanded in a furious undertone as chas stepped away then she shook her head aimed her gaze deliberately at roarke you are welcome to observe and we hope you and your companions will show the proper respect for our rite tonight you arent permitted within the magic circle as she swept away eve slipped her hands into her pockets well now ive got two witches pissed off at me she looked over as peabody hurried to her side its an initiation peabody whispered i got it from the big gorgeous witch in the italian suit she smiled across the clearing at a man with burnished bronze hair and a millionwatt smile jesus makes a woman consider converting get a grip on yourself peabody eve nodded at feeney my sainted mother would be saying half a dozen rosaries tonight if she knew where i was he pushed on a grin to cover nerves damn spooky place nothing out here but a lot of nothing roarke sighed slipped an arm around eves waist cut from the same cloth he murmured and turned as the rite began the young woman isis had called mirium stood outside the circle of candles and was bound and blindfolded by two men everyone but for the observers was now naked skin glowed white and dark and gold in the streaming moonlight deeper in the woods night birds called liltingly itchy eve slid a hand inside her jacket felt the weight of her weapon the red cords were used for the binding of the initiate leaving a kind of tether as the ankle cord was attached chas spoke feet neither bound nor free and there was unmistakable joy and reverence in his voice curious eve watched the casting of the circle the opening ritual the mood was she had to admit happy overhead the moon swam sprinkling light silvering the trees owls hooted an odd sound that rippled through her blood nudity seemed to be ignored there was none of the surreptitious groping or sly glances she knew shed have seen at any city sex club chas took up the athame making eves hand close on her weapon as he held it to the postulants heart he spoke his words rising and falling on the smoky breeze i have two passwords mirium answered perfect love and perfect trust he smiled all who have such are doubly welcome i give you a third to pass you through this dread door he handed the knife to the man beside him then kissed mirium as a father might kiss a child eve thought frowning chas walked around the postulant embraced her then gently nudged her forward into the circle behind them the second man traced the tip of the athame over the empty space as if to close them in there was chanting now as chas led mirium around the circle as she was turned by hands after hands in a playful childs game of dizziness and disorientation a bell rang three times it was chas who knelt speaking then kissing the postulants feet her knees her belly just above the pubis her breasts then her lips shed thought it would be sexual eve mused but it had been more loving than that impressions she murmured to roarke charming and powerful religious he slid his hand up and covered the one that still curled around her weapon gently tugging it away and harmless sexual certainly but in a very balanced and respectful sense and yes i see one or two people i recognize ill want names as the rite continued she reached up absently to rub her throat she found the skin smooth unbroken and free of pain as she dropped her hand chas looked at her met her eyes and smiled again chapter sixteen spirit quest wasnt open for business when eve arrived with peabody but chas was there waiting on the sidewalk sipping something that steamed out of a recycle cup good morning the air was just chilled enough to have slapped color into his cheek i wonder if we could talk upstairs in our apartment rather than in the shop cops bad for business eve asked well we could say that the early customers might be disconcerted and we do open in half an hour i assume you dont need isis not at the moment i appreciate it if you could ah give me just a moment he shot her a sheepish look isis prefers not to have caffeine in the house im weak he said taking another sip she knows i sneak off every morning to feed my addiction and pretends not to its foolish but it makes us happy take your time you get that across the street that would be a little too close to home and to be honest the coffees filthy there they make a decent cup down at the corner deli he sipped again with obvious pleasure i gave up cigarettes years ago even herbals but i cant quite do without a cup of coffee did you enjoy the ceremony last night it was interesting since the morning air was sharp she tucked her ungloved hands in her pockets traffic both street and air was beginning to thin a little with the first commuter rush passing getting a little brisk to run around naked in the woods isnt it yes we probably wont hold any more outdoor ceremonies this year certainly not skyclad but mirium had her heart set on being initiated to firstdegree witch before samhain samhain halloween he and peabody said together she shuffled her feet as he smiled at her freeager she muttered ah there are some basic similarities he finished off his coffee stepped over to a recycling bin and neatly slipped the cup in the slot you have a cold officer yes sir peabody sniffled determinedly blocked a sneeze i have something that should ease that one of our members recognized you lieutenant she said shed given you a reading lately on the night actually that alice died thats right cassandra is very skilled and very sweetnatured chas began as he started up the steps she feels she should have been able to see more clearly to tell you that alice was in danger she believes you are he paused looked back she hoped that youre still carrying the stone she gave you its around somewhere he let out a sound that might have been a sigh hows your neck good as new i see its healed cleanly yeah and quickly what was in that stuff you put on it humor flickered in his eyes surprising her oh just some tongue of bat a little eye of newt he opened the door to a musical chime of bells please be comfortable ill get you some tea to warm you up since i kept you standing you dont have to bother its no bother at all just be a moment he slipped through a doorway and eve took the time to study his living quarters she wouldnt call them simple obviously a lot of the stock from the shelves downstairs made its way up here large manyspeared hunks of crystals decorated an oval table and circled a copper urn filled with fall flowers an intricate tapestry hung on the wall over a curved blue sofa men and women suns and moons a castle with flame spewing from the arrow slits the major arcana peabody told her as eve stepped up for a closer look she sneezed once violently and dug out a tissue the tarot it looks old handworked expensive eve decided art such as this didnt come cheaply there were statues in pewter and carved from smooth stone wizards and dragons twoheaded dogs sinuous women with delicate wings another wall was covered with odd attractive symbols in splashes of color from the book of kells peabody lifted her shoulders at eves curious glance my mother likes to embroider the symbols like on pillows and samplers they look nice its a nice place and it didnt give her the willies like the cross apartment eccentric but nice business must be good for them to be able to afford the antiques the metalwork the art the business does well enough chas said as he came back with a tray laden with a flower patterned ceramic pot and cups and i had some resources of my own before we opened inheritance no he set the tray down on a circular coffee table savings investments chemical engineers are well paid but you gave it all up to work retail i gave it up he said simply i was unhappy in my work i was unhappy in my life therapy didnt help he met her eyes again though it seemed to cost him it didnt hurt please sit down ill answer your questions she cant make you go through this chas isis slipped into the room like smoke her gown was gray today the color of storm clouds and swirled around her ankles as she moved to him youre entitled to your privacy under any law i can insist that he answer my questions eve corrected im investigating murder here he is of course entitled to counsel it isnt a lawyer he needs but peace isis whirled her eyes alive with emotion and chas took her hands lifted them to his lips pressed his face to them i have peace he said quietly i have you dont worry so you have to go down and open and i have to do this let me stay he shook his head and the look they exchanged had eve staring in surprise it was baffling enough to speculate on their physical relationship but what she saw pass between them wasnt sex it was love it was devotion it should have been laughable the way isis had to lean down bend that goddess body to reach his lips with hers instead it was poignant you have only to call she told him only to wish for me i know he gave her hand a quick intimate pat to send her off she shot eve one last look of barely controlled rage and swept out i doubt i would have survived without her chas said as he stared at the door youre a strong woman lieutenant it would be difficult for you to understand that kind of need that kind of dependence once she would have agreed now she wasnt so sure id like to record this conversation mr forte yes of course he sat and as peabody engaged her recorder mechanically poured the tea he listened without glancing up as eve recited the traditional caution do you understand your rights and obligations yes would you care for sweetener she looked down at her tea with some impatience it smelled suspiciously like what mira insisted on serving her no ive added a bit of honey to yours officer he sent peabody a sweet smile and a bit of something else i think youll find it soothing smells pretty good cautious peabody sipped tasted home and smiled back thanks whens the last time you saw your father caught off guard by the abruptness of eves question chas looked up quickly the hand holding his cup shook once violently the day he was sentenced i went to the hearing and i watched them take him away they kept him in full restraints and they closed and locked the door on his life and how did you feel about that ashamed relieved desperately unhappy or perhaps just desperate he was my father chas took a deep gulp of tea as some men might take a gulp of whiskey i hated him with all of my heart all of my soul because he killed because he was my father i hurt my mother deeply by insisting on attending his trial but she was too battered emotionally to stop me from doing as i chose she could never stop him either though she did leave him eventually she took me and left him which was i think a surprise to all of us he stared down into his cup as if contemplating the pattern of the leaves skimming the bottom i hated her too for a very very long time hate can define a person cant it lieutenant it can twist them into an ugly shape is that what happened to you nearly ours was not a happy home you wouldnt expect that it could be with a man like my father dominating it you suspect i could be like him chass sensual voice remained calm but his eyes were swirling with emotions it was the eyes you watched during interview eve thought the words often meant nothing are you blood will tell is that shakespeare he shook his head a little im not quite sure but isnt that what all children live with and fear no matter what their parents that blood will tell she lived with it she feared it but she couldnt allow herself to be swayed by it how strong an influence was he on your life there couldnt have been a stronger one youre an efficient investigator lieutenant im sure youve studied the records by now run the discs watched them you would have seen a charismatic man terrifyingly so a man who considered himself above the law any and all laws that kind of steely arrogance is in itself compelling evil can be compelling to some yes his lips curved without humor youd know that in your line of work he wasnt a man you could fight on a physical or emotional level hes strong very strong chas closed his eyes a moment reliving what he was constantly struggling to put to death i was afraid i could be like him considered giving back the most precious gift id been given life you attempted selftermination i never got as far as the attempt just the plan the first time i was ten he sipped tea again determined to soothe himself can you imagine a child of ten pondering suicide yes she could all too well shed been younger yet when she had pondered it he abused you abuse is such a weak term dont you think he beat me he never seemed to be in a rage when he did he just struck out at unexpected moments snapping a bone raising a fist with the absent calm another man might display while flicking away a fly his fist was clenched on his knee deliberately chas opened his hand spread his fingers he struck like a shark fast and in utter silence there was never a warning never a gauge my life my pain was totally dependent on his whim ive had my time in hell he said softly almost as a prayer no one helped you eve asked attempted to intervene we never stayed in one place very long and were allowed to form no attachments or friendships he claimed he needed to spread the word and he would snap a bone raise a fist then take me into a treatment center himself a concerned father you told no one he was my father it was my life chas lifted his hands let them fall who was i to tell neither had she told anyone eve thought neither had she had anyone to tell and for quite a while i believed him when he said it was just chass eyes flickered and i certainly believed him when he told me there would be terrible pain and terrible punishment if i said anything i was thirteen when he sodomized me for the first time it was a ritual he told me when he bound my hands and i wept a rite of passage sex was life it was necessary to take it he would take me on the journey as was his duty and his right he picked up the tea pot poured set it neatly aside i dont know if it was rape i didnt struggle i didnt beg him to stop i simply cried without sound and submitted it was rape peabody said and her voice was very quiet well he found he couldnt drink the tea hed just poured but lifted the cup held it i told no one even years later when they had him in a cage i didnt tell the police i didnt believe they would hold him i simply didnt believe they could he was too strong too powerful and all the blood on his hands seemed to add to it oddly enough it was the sex that pushed my mother to run and take me not the violence not the little boy with broken bones or even the deaths i think she knew hed caused it was the sight of him kneeling over me on his altar with the black candles lit he didnt see her but i did i saw her face when she stepped into the room she left me there let him finish with me and that night when he went out we ran and still she didnt go to the police no he looked at eve i know you believe if she had lives might have been saved but fear is a very personal emotion survival was her only goal when they arrested him i went to the trial every day i was sure he would stop it somehow even when they said they would lock him away i still didnt believe i erased his name and i tried to slip into normality i took a job that interested me that i had some talent for and i allowed myself to get close to no one there was a rage in me i would look at a face and hate it because it was happy or it was sad i hated them all for their unshadowed existence and like my father i didnt stay in one place very long and when i found myself considering suicide again with great calm and great seriousness i was frightened enough to seek help he was able to smile again it was though i didnt realize it at the time the beginning for me taking that step allowing myself to speak the unspeakable i learned to accept my own innocence and to forgive my mother but the rage was still there this hard secret knot inside me then i met isis through your interest in the occult eve prompted through my study of it as part of my therapy he drank his tea now and his lips were curved i was angry and rude religion of any kind was an abomination to me and i detested what she stood for she was so beautiful so full of light i hated her for that she challenged me to come to a ceremony to observe much as you did last night i preferred to think of myself as a scientist i would go i thought to prove there was nothing in her faith but old words repeated by fools just as there had been nothing in my fathers creed but an excuse to hurt and dominate i stood back separate cynical and secretly enraged i hated them for their simplicity and their devotion hadnt i seen that same captured look on the faces of those whod gathered to hear my father speak i wanted nothing to do with it with them but i was drawn back three times i went back and watched and though i didnt know it i had begun to heal and one night on alban eilir the spring equinox isis asked me into her home when we were alone she told me that she had recognized me i panicked id tried so hard to bury all of that all of him she said she hadnt meant from this life though i could see in her eyes that she knew she knew who i was what id come from she told me i had a great capacity for healing and i would discover it once i had healed myself then she seduced me he gave a short laugh and in it was great warmth imagine my surprise when this beautiful woman led me to her bed i went along like a puppy half eager half terrified she was the first woman id had and the only one ive been with and on the night of the spring equinox that hard secret knot inside me began to dissolve she loves me and the miracle of that made me believe in other miracles i became wiccan i embraced and was embraced by the craft i learned to heal myself and others the only person ive ever harmed in my life has been myself but i understand better than isis with all her insights the lure of violence of selfishness of bowing to another master she believed him yet too much of his past mirrored her own for her to trust her instincts youve gone to a great deal of effort to hide your connection with your father wouldnt you did alice know alice was innocence she was youth there were no david baines conroys in her life until selina cross and cross is an intelligent and vindictive woman if shed discovered your secret she might have used alice and others to blackmail you would the members of your cult trust you if they knew your history since thats never been tested i dont have the answer id prefer certainly to keep my privacy and on the night alice was killed you were here alone with isis yes and we were here alone on the night lobar was killed you know i was on hand at the last murder again with isis and yes he smiled slightly i have no doubt she would lie for me but while she would live with a murderers son she would never live with a murderer its against everything she is she loves you yes and you love her yes he blinked and horror filled his eyes you cant believe shed have a part in any of this beyond the fact that she loved alice cared for her as a mother would a sick child shes incapable of hurting anyone mr forte everyone is capable o o you dont think hes involved peabody said as they started down the outside stairs theres history of aberrant behavior in his family he has an expert knowledge of chemicals including hallucinogens and herbals he has no alibi for any of the incidents he was associated with alice closely enough that she may have stumbled across the secret hes been hiding for years and that exposed could destroy his cult she paused tapping her fingers against the rail as she ticked off her mental list he has good reason to hate selina cross and her membership to want to punish them as he couldnt punish his father he was on hand when wineburg started to break and could have easily circled around and killed him that gives him motive and opportunity and with his background the potential for violent behavior hes made himself a decent life after a nightmare childhood peabody protested you cant condemn him for what his father did eve stared out at the street and fought her own demons im not condemning him peabody im investigating every possibility consider this she turned if alice knew and told frank his reaction might very well have been to demand she break off the connection its likely following this line of speculation that he confronted forte himself even threatened him with exposure if he didnt break off his influence he was in homicide when conroy was taken in and hed have known and remembered every filthy detail yes but and alice moved into her own place she continued to work part time for isis but she no longer lived here why did she move out away from here when she was afraid i dont know peabody admitted and we cant ask her eve turned back started down the stairs again then swore when she saw the boy leaning on her vehicle well hell she strode down straight over to jamie get your butt off my hood this is an official vehicle an official piece of shit he corrected with a quick sassy grin the city puts you cops into recycled garbage heaps a highprofile detective like you ought to have better ill tell the chief you said so next time im in the tower what are you doing here just hanging his grin flashed again and i ditched the shadow you put on me hes good jamie tucked his thumbs in his pockets im better why arent you in school dont bother to call the truant brigade lieutenant its saturday how the hell was she supposed to keep track then why arent you terrorizing one of the sky malls like a normal delinquent his grin spread i hate sky malls theyre so yesterday caught you on channel did you drop by for my autograph you scrawl it on a credit slip i could outfit this heap of yours and make it rock he looked past her toward the shop i got a load of the witch through the glass shes doing some heavy retail today eve glanced back noted the customers browsing inside youve seen her before yeah couple times when i tailed alice ever see anything interesting nope everybodys always wearing clothes in there he wiggled his brows a guy has to hope i studied up on wicca they liked to be naked a lot did see the head witch kick a guy out of the shop once really it was eves turn to lean on the hood why couldnt say but she was maximum pissed i could see they were having words and i thought she was going to belt him especially when he shoved her he shoved her yeah i thought about going in then though she was a hell of a lot bigger than he was still guys got no business pushing women around but whatever she said had him backing off backing way off until he was backing right out of the door and he went off in a big hurry what did he look like skinny dude five ten maybe a hundred and twentyfive couple years older than me long black hair red tips long face with his incisors fanged red eyes light complexion turned out in tight black leather no shirt couple of tattoos but i was too far away to make them out he shot her a smile grim around the edges sounds familiar doesnt it last time i saw him he wasnt looking so jazzy lobar eve thought exchanging a glance with peabody the kid had given a solid and nearly professional description and when was this when did you see the incident the day his voice cracked a little so he cleared his throat the day before alice died and what did isis do after lobar she made a call couple minutes later the dude she lives with came on the run they talked for a couple minutes real intense then she put up the closed sign and they went into the back room ticked me off he added i could have followed the leather guy you want to stop tailing people jamie they make you they tend to get annoyed people i tail dont make me im too good you thought you were good at b and e too she reminded him dryly and watched as his color rose that was different look the guy that was stabbed he was right there at alices viewing it has to be connected to her to that lobar creep and i got a right to know she straightened are you requesting the status of my investigation yeah yeah right he rolled his eyes skyward whats the status of your investigation ongoing she said shortly then jerked a thumb now scram i got a right to know he insisted survivors of victims and all that youre the grandson of a cop she reminded him you know im not going to tell you anything and youre a minor i dont have to tell you anything now go play somewhere else kid before i have peabody here roust you for loitering the muscles of his jaw tightened and jumped im not a kid and if you dont deal with alices killer i will eve snagged his arm by the jacket before he could storm away dont cross the line she said very quietly she kept her face close to his forcing him to look directly into her eyes you want justice youll get it ill by god get it for you you want revenge ill slap you in a cage you remember what frank stood for and what your sister was and then you think it all through again now get out of here i loved them he jerked his arm free but not before she saw tears rush into his eyes fuck your justice and fuck you she let him walk because though the language had been an adults the tears had been a childs the kids hurting peabody murmured i know so was she now tail him will you just to be sure he doesnt get in any trouble give it thirty minutes until he calms down then beep your location ill pick you up you going to talk to isis yeah lets see what she and lobar had to say to each other oh and peabody watch your step jamies a clever kid if he made one of roarkes men hes likely to make you peabody flashed a smile i think i can manage to tail a kid for a few blocks trusting her aide to keep jamie out of trouble eve walked into spirit quest the air swam with incense and the scented melted wax from dozens of candles the october sun was strong and gleamed in shooting colors through hanging prisms the look isis sent her held none of that exotic welcome youve finished with chas lieutenant for now id like a few minutes isis turned to answer a question from a customer on a blend of herbs to enhance memory steep it for five minutes isis told her then strain it youll need to drink it daily for at least a week if it doesnt help let me know she turned her head back to eve as you can see this is a bad time ill be quick im just curious about the visit you had from lobar here a few days before he ended up with his throat slashed shed kept her voice down but left her intention clear they would talk in private or in public the location was up to isis i dont think i misjudged you isis said quietly but you make me doubt myself she signaled to a young woman eve recognized from the initiation rite jane will handle the customers isis said as she started toward the back room but i dont want to leave her long shes very new at shop work alices replacement isiss eyes burned no one could replace alice she entered what appeared to be a combination of office and storeroom on the reinforced plastic shelves were gargoyles candles sealed bins of dried herbs clear stoppered bottles filled with liquids of varying hues on the small desk was a very modern and efficient computer and communication system jazzy equipment eve commented very now we dont eschew technology lieutenant we adapt and we use what is available to us its always been so she gestured to a chair with a high carved back took another for herself one with armrests shaped like wings you said you would be quick but first i need to know if you intend to leave chas in peace my priority is closing a case not the peace of mind of a suspect how could you suspect him her hands curled around the armrests as she leaned forward you of all people know what hes overcome if his past is relevant is yours isis demanded is the fact that you survived a nightmare to your credit or to your detriment my past is my business eve said evenly and you know nothing about it what comes to me comes in flashes and impressions stronger in some cases than others i know you suffered and were innocent just as chas is i know you carry scars and harbor doubts as he does i know you struggle to make your own peace and i see a room her voice changed deepened just as her eyes did a small cold room washed with dirty red light and a child battered and bleeding huddled in a corner the pain is unspeakable beyond endurance and i see a man hes covered with blood his face is stop it eves heart was hammering choking off her air for a moment shed been back there back in that child whod crawled whimpering like an animal into the corner with blood staining her hands damn you im sorry isis lifted a hand to press it to her own heart and it trembled im so very sorry thats not my way i let anger take over she shut her eyes tight im so very sorry chapter seventeen eve lurched out of the chair there was no room to pace to prowl to steam off the dregs of memory im aware she began coldly that you have what is commonly called heightened psychic skill hps is still being studied i have a report on my desk right now so youve got a talent isis congratulations now stay the hell out of my head i will pity swam in her eyes and couldnt be blinked away shed seen much more than shed expected or intended i can only apologize again part of me wanted to hurt you i didnt control it it must be hard to control it when youre angry when youre threatened when you see a weakness and can exploit it isis took a careful breath her system was still rocked not only by what shed seen but what shed done it isnt my way its against the foundation of my faith i will cause no harm she lifted her hands rubbing her fingertips under her eyes to dry them ill answer your questions you wanted to know about lobar you were seen arguing with him here in the store the day before alice died was i she drew her composure back cloaked it over her its always a mistake to believe yourself alone yes he was here yes we had words about alice most specifically he was a misguided young man filled with a dangerous selfimportance he thought himself powerful he was not alice wasnt here she wasnt working that day no id hoped shed spend time with her family connect with them again through her grandfathers death that was the primary reason id encouraged her to move out of here and into a place of her own id asked her not to come in for a few days lobar expected her to be here i dont believe he was sent but came on his own maybe to prove himself and you argued yes he said that i couldnt hide her that shed never get away shed broken the law the law that cross and those who belong to her subscribe to he said her punishment would be torture and pain and death he threatened her life and you didnt tell me i was here before and i questioned you no i didnt tell you i considered it no more than a clash of wills his against mine he was no more than a pawn i didnt require hps to intuit that he only wanted to upset me to prove his superiority his way of doing so was to describe graphically what he had done to alice sexually she drew another breath and he told me that i had been promised to him that when i was taken in when my power was crushed he would be the first to lay hands on me then he told me what he intended to do and how much i would enjoy it he invited me to sample some of his many talents then and there so that i would see how much more of a man he was than chas i laughed at him did he assault you he pushed me he was angry id deliberately baited him into it then i used it an old spell she said with a flick of her hand what you might call a mirror or boomerang spell so that what he was sending toward me all the darkness the violence the hate was reflected back at him and when reflected enlarged she smiled a little he left quickly and very frightened he didnt come back and you were frightened yes on a physical level i was you called forte hes my mate isis lifted her chin i have no secrets from him and i depend on him hed have been angry no eyes level she shook her head concerned yes we cast a circle performed a rite for protection and for purification we were content i should have seen she continued with regret shimmering in her voice i should have seen that alice was their goal pride made me believe they would turn on me that they wouldnt dare touch her while she was under my protection maybe i wasnt as honest with you as i might have been dallas because without my pride blinding me i know alice might still be alive guilt was there eve decided as she drove off to pick up peabody and guilt could lead to retribution frank and alice had been killed by a different method than lobar and wineburg the deaths were connected she was certain but the connection didnt mean theyd all been committed by the same hand she wanted to get back to central run a probability scan there was enough data for it now and if the numbers warranted it she could go to whitney and request the manpower for a twentyfourseven watch on both groups of suspects damn the budget she thought as she fought traffic shed need a high probability ratio to wangle the expense of time money and manpower but peabody and feeney werent enough to keep roundtheclock tabs on everyone involved including jamie she thought the kid was looking for trouble she believed he was smart enough to find it peabody hopped in when eve swung to the curb at seventh and fortyseventh across the sidewalk the rowdy noise and computerized warfare of a vr den spilled out of the open doorway it nicked the ordinance on noise pollution but eve figured the proprietors were willing to risk a fine or two in order to lure in tourists and the bored he in there yes sir peabody looked hopefully at the rising steam from a glida grill she could smell fresh soy burgers and oil fries it was near enough to lunch to make her stomach yearn and her heart sink at the thought of facing the slop served at the eatery back at central do you mind if i grab something from this cart eve shot an impatient look out the window arent you supposed to starve a cold or something i never could keep that straight anyway peabody took a long deep breath through her nose i feel great that tea did the trick yeah yeah make it quick and eat it on the way do you want anything peabody asked over her shoulder as she pushed out of the car no snap it up and lets roll drugs sex satan and power eve mused a religious war hadnt humans fought and died for beliefs since the dawn of time animals fought for territory people fought for territory as well and for gain for passion for beliefs for the hell of it they killed she thought very much for the same reasons got two of everything peabody announced and set the thin cardboard filled with food on the seat between them just in case if you dont want it i can probably choke it down its the first time ive had an appetite in two days she bit into the loaded burger while eve waited for a break in traffic the kid led me on quite a route walked off his mad for ten blocks caught an uptown tram got off headed west and talk about appetite he hit a cart on sixth and downed two real pig dogs and a mega scoop of fries hit another a block down for an orange freezie which happens to be a personal favorite of mine before he went into the vr den he tagged this guy for three candy bars growing boy eve commented and shot out like a bullet when she saw a slim gap in traffic horns bellowed in protest as long as hes eating junk and playing vr he should stay out of trouble o o inside the whoops and whistles of the arcade jamie sneered at the holograms battling on his personal screen he listened to the exchange in eves car courtesy of his earpiece and the micro recorder and location device hed planted yeah it had been worth the risk he decided diddling with the vr controls with his mind wandering of course it hadnt been that much of a challenge not only was the cop car a rolling heap of refuse but its security system was rinky at least when it came up against the skills of the master of electronics dallas wouldnt tell him what was going on he thought grimly and destroyed the holo image of an urban tough hed just keep tabs on things his own way and hed deal with things his own way whoever had killed his sister had better prepare to die o o eve ran the probability program with mixed results the computer agreed by a ninetysix percentile that the four cases were connected the numbers dropped ten points when it came to tagging different perpetrators charles forte scored high on the index as did selina cross for alban she continued to run up against insufficient data frustrated she buzzed feeney ive got some data i want to download on you for a probability scan can you see what you can do with the numbers he wiggled his brows you want them higher or lower she laughed shook her head i want them higher but i want it solid could be im missing something shoot it over ill take a look appreciate it and theres something else im running into blanks every time i try to access data on this alban character the guys in his thirties there has to be more on him im not getting education medical family history theres no criminal record not even an illegal zone stop my take is he had it wiped takes a lot of talent and a lot of money to wipe it clean somethings always somewhere she thought of roarke and the suspiciously limited data on record well he had a lot of talent she reminded herself and a lot of money i figured if anybody could find anything yeah flatter me kid he winked ill get back to you thanks feeney was that feeney mavis bounced in literally on new air pump stackheeled neon yellow sneakers shoot you zipped off i wanted to talk to him eve ran her tongue around her teeth mavis was decked out in classic mavis style her hair matched her sneakers and made the eyes burn she wore it in a spiral mass of curls that exploded up as much as down her slacks were glossy simulated rubber dipped well below the glinting red stone in her navel and hugged every curve her blouse if it could be called that was a snug band of material that matched the slacks and almost covered her breasts over it all she wore a transparent duster anybody try to arrest you on the way in no but i think the desk sergeant had an orgasm mavis fluttered emerald green lashes and dropped into a chair great outfit huh just off leonardos drawing board so are you ready ready for what weve got a salon date trina shuffled you in i left the message on your unit twice she narrowed her eyes at eve dont tell me you didnt get it because i know you did you logged it out logged it out eve remembered and ignored it mavis i dont have time to play hair you havent taken lunch today i checked with the desk sarge mavis said smugly before his orgasm you can eat while trina whips you into shape i dont want to be whipped into shape it wouldnt be so bad if you hadnt hacked at it again yourself mavis rose picked up eves jacket you might as well come quietly im just going to keep hounding you log out for lunch take an hour youll be back and making our city safe by one thirty because it was easier than arguing eve snatched the jacket shrugged it on just the hair im not having her put all the gunk on my face dallas relax mavis began to tug her out enjoy being a girl eve snapped out her log book to mark time scanning maviss rubber clad butt bouncing along i dont think that means the same thing to you as it does to me o o maybe it was the fumes the potions and lotions the oils and dyes and lacquers so typical in salons but eve found inspiration striking as she tipped back in her treatment chair she wasnt sure how theyd gotten her to take off her clothes submit to the indignity of the body smoother the facial the poking and prodding she had managed to put her foot down her bare now toenailpainted foot down when the discussion had veered toward temporary tattoos and body piercing otherwise she was a hostage coated with goop her hair covered with the spermlike cream trina swore by privately she could admit she was deeply terrified of trina with her snapping scissors and green glop thats why she kept her eyes shut during the procedure so as not to imagine herself emerging looking like a trina clone with frizzed fuchsia hair and torpedo breasts been too long trina lectured i told you you need regular treatments you got the basics but you dont enhance you lose the edge if you came in regular it wouldnt take so long to bring you back she didnt want to be brought back eve thought she wanted to be left alone she suppressed a shudder as she felt something buzzing around her eyes brow shaping she reminded herself and struggled to calm trina was not tattooing a smiley face on her forehead ive got to get back ive got work dont rush me magic takes time magic eve thought and rolled her eyes causing trina to hiss at her everybody was obsessed with magic it seemed she frowned listening to mavis chirp happily about a new body polish that gave the skin a gold glow this is mag trina ive got to try it full body leonardo would lap it up you can get it temp and edible six flavors on the market now apricots real popular potions and lotions eve thought smoke and mirrors rites and rituals she opened her eyes to slits saw mavis and trina huddled over a vial of gold liquid mavis with her neon hair she thought with odd affection trina with her pink frizz weird sisters weird sisters she thought again and sat up trina let out another hiss back down dallas you got two minutes left mavis you said you used to run a psychic con sure mavis fluttered her newly painted neon nails madam electra sees all knows all or ariel the sadeyed sprite she dipped her head managed to look delicate and forlorn i guess i had about six grifts on that theme you could spot somebody pulling the same grift shit are you kidding from three blocks with sunshades on you were good eve considered i never saw you in that gig but you were good in the others you busted me im better eve flashed a smile and felt the glop on her face ooze listen theres this place you could check out for me she began as trina marched over and shoved her back into the horizontal both of you she added eyeing trina hey is this a cop deal maybe frigid trina said and pushed eve back toward the rinsing bowl you could scope it out eve squeezed her eyes shut as water flooded see if you can get the clerk her names jane to talk give me a rundown they dont come clean with cops who does trina wanted to know i want impressions eve continued youre interested in herbs in mind expansion love potions sex enhancers soothers illegals it didnt take mavis long to catch on you think they might be dealing its a possibility i need to confirm or eliminate you could spot it every bit as quick as an undercover and you could spot a grift if theyre hosing customers if theyre playing any cons the moneys coming from somewhere this could rock mavis trina grinned you and me a couple of detectives like sherlock and dr jekyll decent i thought it was dr holmes though eve closed her eyes again must be the fumes she decided o o when she arrived home mavis and trina were there entertaining roarke with their exploits eve scooped up the cat and followed the laughter i bought this lotion to rub on trina was saying its supposed to bring out the animal in men like pheromones she stuck her long arm under roarkes nose whats it do for you if i wasnt married to a woman who carries a weapon id he trailed off grinned hello darling you could finish the thought eve told him and dumped galahad in his lap ill wait until youre unarmed dallas it was so so decent mavis popped up waving her glass of wine so that the strawcolored liquid sloshed to the rim i cant wait to get home and tell leonardo but trina and i we wanted to grab some nutrition you know and come right over and report you should see all the stuff i bought she started to dive into one of several shopping bags with the spirit quest logo eve resisted groaning and tugged maviss arm talk now show later i must have lost my mind sending the two of you in there i tell you she said whirling to roarke its the fumes in those places thats what makes people sit there and let themselves be shaved and painted and pierced his eyes clouded briefly pierced where exactly oh she wouldnt go for the nipple job trina waved a hand said shed zap me if i came near her with the jabber good girl roarke murmured im proud of your restraint because her head was starting to ache eve poured herself a glass of wine did the two of you do anything in there but spend your credits we had readings mavis told her genuinely iced ive got an adventurous soul and my narcissism is balanced by a generous heart eve couldnt help it she laughed you dont have to be psychic to read that one mavis you just have to have eyes you did go in dressed like that right mavis dangled her neon sneaker sure jane the clerk was real helpful seemed to know her herbs we judged her sincere right trina jane was sincere trina agreed soberly kinda dull i could fix her up with a couple sessions a little highlighter some body work now the goddess hard to improve on that one isis eve sat up she was there she came out of the back while we were doing the herb thing mavis put in i was saying how i wanted something to improve my performance level boost my stage energy see when youre working a grift you hang better if you believe the con so if you can do true its mag i was looking for sex stuff trina smiled sinuously stuff to attract men lift sexual performance and i said how i had this stressful job kept me tense and edgy overthecounters just werent cutting it for me so i thought they might have something more potent and i didnt mind the cost they had lots of blends mavis took up the story i didnt see anything off fact is she said how drugs werent the answer what we wanted was the natural way like holistic holistic trina agreed we nudged her flashed credits and stuff but she wasnt buying or i guess that would be selling the amazon queen went into the back mavis picked up the story came back with this mix hair flying mavis dug into her shopping bag tossed the smaller clear bag to eve said i should sample it and wouldnt charge me she wants me to let her know if it worked for me you can test it out but id say its clean who gave you the reading isis she didnt look too keen when she came in mavis tipped back her glass we were playing it up you know i went with the wideeyed giggle act oohed and aahed a lot over the stock eve shifted her gaze to the shopping bags i see you carried the act through i liked the stuff mavis grinned unrepentant then aq you know amazon queen she started to get into it i had my sights on this aone crystal ball a green one what did she call it trina tourmasomething tourmaline roarke provided yeah right tourmaline she steered me away said it was for relaxing for soothing and if i wanted energy i should go for the orange one for like vitality more expensive eve assumed no cheaper way cheaper she said how the green one wasnt for me she thought i had a friend who could use it someone close to me who carried too much stress but she should choose it for herself when she was ready eve grunted frowned then she gave us a reading mega she said how she was glad wed come in shed needed the positive energy she wouldnt charge us for the readings i liked her dallas she hasnt got the eyes of a grifter okay thanks ill check out the package one way to make money eve mused was to round up repeat customers and a sure way to insure repeaters was to addict them we got to make it mavis was up again gathering her bags i bought this candle for romance i want to see if it works see you tuesday night tuesday mavis tapped her platform sneaker our halloween party dallas you said youd come i must have been drunk no you werent nine oclock our place everybodys coming i even tagged feeney see you loosen up trina advised as she strolled out wear a costume not in this lifetime eve muttered well she bounced the small bag of leaves and seeds in her hand that was probably a monumental waste of time they enjoyed themselves and youll feel better once you analyze that mix i suppose im not getting anywhere eve set the bag on the table i keep taking wrong turns i can feel it enough wrong turns and you usually end up in the right place after all he leaned forward set his hands on her shoulders and began to rub mavis has a close friend who carries around too much stress he worked on the knots i wonder who that could be shut up he chuckled kissed the nape of her neck you smell wonderful its that goop trina poured all over me she mentioned it she said id enjoy it he sniffed her neck again made her chuckle and i am she also said she managed to hold you down for a full body treatment im to pay particular attention to your butt she certainly did she tried to talk me into a temp tattoo of a rosebud on my right cheek she started to sigh then bolted up grabbing her ass jesus christ she had me on the table for ten minutes you dont think she snuck one on roarke lifted a brow then smiled slowly as he rose ill have to make it my job to find out chapter eighteen she had a rosebud on her ass and wasnt happy about it standing naked in the bathroom eve adjusted the trifold mirror until she could get a good look i think i could bust her for this she muttered decorating a cops posterior without a license roarke suggested as he strolled in felonious reproduction of floral imagery youre getting a big charge out of this arent you miffed eve snagged a robe off the hook darling eve i thought i made it perfectly clear last night i was on your side of the issue didnt i do my best to chew it off she would not laugh she ordered herself as she bit down hard on her tongue there was nothing funny about it ive got to get some solution or something whatever they make to get it off whats your hurry its rather sweet what if i have to go in for a disinfect or need to shower or change at the station do you know what kind of grief a butt tattoos going to get me he slid his arms around her clever enough to get them under rather than over the robe youre not working today im going in ive got to check my unit see if feeney shot back some data and it wont make any difference if you do it monday morning weve got the day off to do what he merely smiled slid his hands lower to stroke her rosebud didnt we just do that it bears repeating he mused but it could wait a bit why dont we spend the day lazing around the pool lazing around the pool it had a certain appeal well maybe in martinique dont bother to pack he told her planting a quick kiss on her mouth you wont need anything but what youre wearing she spent the day in martinique wearing nothing but a smile and a rosebud that might have been why she was dragging a bit more than usual on monday morning you look tired lieutenant peabody dug a bag out from her field kit set two fresh cream donuts on the desk she was still beaming over the fact that shed gotten them through the bullpen without the hounds sniffing them out and sort of tanned she peered closer you get a flash no just got some sun yesterday thats all it rained all day not where i was eve muttered and filled her mouth with pastry ive got a probability ratio to run by the commander feeney worked some numbers were still pretty light but im going to shoot for roundtheclocks on the top suspects i dont suppose you want my probability ratio on your chances of getting it new interoffice came down this morning about excess overtime fuck it its not excess if its necessary whitney could play it to the chief and the chief could play it to the mayor weve got two highprofile homicides generating a lot of media we need the manpower to close them and turn off the heat peabody risked a smile you rehearsing your pitch maybe she blew out a breath if the numbers were a few points higher i wouldnt have to pitch so hard there are too many people involved thats the problem lifting her hands she pressed her fingers to her eyes weve got to run the name of every member of both cults over two hundred people say we eliminate half on data and profile then weve still got a hundred to tag check alibis days of work peabody agreed the commander would probably spring for a couple of uniforms to knock on doors sweep out the obvious noninvolved im not sure there are any obvious noninvolved eve pushed away from her desk it took more than one person to transport lobars body strap him onto that form and it took a vehicle none of the primes owns a vehicle large enough to have carried and concealed the body and the pentagram maybe one of the membership does we run names through vehicle licensing failing that we start checking on rentals vehicles reported stolen on the night of the murder she pushed at her hair and its just as likely whoever dumped him jumped a vehicle from one of the longterm lots and nobody ever noticed do we check anyway yeah we check anyway maybe feeney can spare somebody in edd to do some of the grunt work meanwhile you get started and ill go begging to the commander she punched her link when it beeped dallas homicide i need to talk to you louis eve cocked a brow you want to talk about the charges against your client regarding resisting you talk to the pa i need to talk to you he repeated and she watched as he lifted his hand to his mouth and began to gnaw away his perfect manicure alone privately as soon as possible she lowered a hand signaling peabody to keep back and out of view what about i cant talk about it on the link im on my pocket unit but even thats risky i need you to meet me come here no no they may be following me i dont know i cant be sure im being careful had he made the shadow feeneyd put on him eve wondered or was he just being paranoid who might be following you youve got to meet me he insisted at my club the luxury on park level five ill leave your name at the desk give me some incentive louis ive got a full plate here i think i think i saw a murder just you eve i wont talk to anyone else make sure youre not followed hurry eve pursed her lips at the blank screen well thats incentive i think weve caught a break peabody see if you can sweettalk feeney into giving you an extra pair of hands from edd youre not going to meet him alone peabody protested as eve grabbed her bag i can handle one scared lawyer eve bent down checked the clinch piece strapped to her ankle weve got a man outside the club in any case and im leaving my communicator on monitor yes sir watch your back o o the fifth floor of the luxury club held twenty private suites for the members use meetings of a professional or private nature could be held there each suite was individually decorated to depict its own era and each contained a complete communication and entertainment center parties could be held there of the large or the intimate nature the catering department was unsurpassed in a city often preoccupied with food and drink licensed companions were available through the concierge for a small additional service charge louis always booked suite c he enjoyed the opulence of the eighteenthcentury french style with its emphasis on the decorative the rich fabrics of the upholstery on curvedbacked chairs and velvet settees appealed to his love of texture he enjoyed the thick dark draperies the gold tassels the gleam of gilt on pier glass mirrors he had entertained his wife as well as an assortment of lovers in the wide high canopy bed he considered this period to have embodied hedonism selfindulgence and a devotion to earthly pleasures royalty had ruled and had done as it pleased and hadnt art flourished if peasants had starved outside the privileged walls that was simply a societal mirror of natures natural selection the chosen few had lived life to the hilt and here in midtown manhattan three hundred years later he could enjoy the fruits of their indulgence but he wasnt enjoying them now he paced drinking unblended scotch in quick jerky gulps terror was a dew on his brow that refused to be wiped away his stomach roiled his heart rabbitted in his chest hed seen murder he was nearly sure of it it was all so hazy all so surreal like a virtual reality program with elements missing the secret room the smoke voices his own among them lifted in chant the taste lingering on the tongue of warm tainted wine those were all so familiar a part of his life now for three years hed joined the cult because he believed in its basic principles of pleasure and hed enjoyed the rituals the robes the masks the words repeated and repeated while candles guttered into pools of black wax and the sex had been incredible but something was happening he found himself obsessing about meetings desperately craving that first deep gulp of ceremonial wine and then there were the blackouts holes in his memory hed be logy and slow to focus the morning after a rite recently hed found blood dried under his nails and couldnt remember how it had gotten there but he was starting to the crime scene photos eve had shown him had clicked something open in his mind and had filled that opening with shock and horror images swirled behind his eyes smoke swirling voices chanting flesh gleaming from sex the moans and grunts of vicious mating dank black hair swaying bony hips pumping then the spray of blood the gush of it spurting out like that final cry of sexual release selina with her feral feline smile the knife dripping in her hand lobar god it had been lobar sliding from the altar his throat gaping wide like a screaming mouth murder nervously he twitched the heavy drapes open a fraction let his frightened eyes search the street below hed seen a blood sacrifice and not of a goat of a man had he dipped his fingers into that open throat had he slipped them between his lips to taste the fresh blood had he done something so abhorrent my god dear god had there been others other nights other sacrifices could he have witnessed and blanked it from his mind he was a civilized man louis told himself as he jerked the draperies back into place he was a husband and a father he was a respected attorney he wasnt an accessory to murder he couldnt be with his breath coming fast and short he poured more scotch stared at himself in one of the ornately framed mirrors he saw a man who hadnt slept hadnt eaten hadnt seen his family in days he was afraid to sleep the images might come more clearly in sleep he was afraid to eat sure the food would clog in his throat and kill him and he was mortally afraid for his family wineburg had been at the ceremony wineburg had stood beside him and had seen what he had seen and wineburg was dead wineburg had had no wife no children but louis did if he was in danger and went home would they come for him there he had begun to understand during those long sleepless nights when liquor was his only company that he was ashamed at the thought of his children discovering what he had participated in he had to protect them and himself he was safe here he assured himself no one could get inside the suite unless he opened the door possibly he was overreacting he mopped his sweating forehead with an already sodden handkerchief stress overwork too many late nights perhaps he was having a small breakdown he should see a doctor he would he would see a doctor he would take his family and go away for a few weeks a vacation a time to relax to reevaluate he would break off from the cult obviously it wasnt good for him god knew it was costing him a small fortune in the bimonthly contributions hed gotten in too deeply somehow forgotten hed entered into the cult out of curiosity and a thirst for selfish sex hed swallowed too deeply of wine and smoke and it was making him imagine things but hed had blood under his nails louis covered his face tried to catch his breath it didnt matter he thought none of it mattered he shouldnt have called eve he shouldnt have panicked she would think him mad or worse an accessory selina was his client he owed his client his loyalty as well as his professional skill but he could see her a knife gripped in her hand as she sliced it across exposed flesh louis stumbled across the suite into the master bath and collapsing vomited up scotch and terror when the cramps passed he pulled himself up he leaned over the sink croaked out a request for water at forty degrees it poured out of the curved gold faucet splashed into the blindingly white sink and cooled his fevered skin he wept a moment shoulders trembling sobs echoing off the shining tiles then he lifted his head forced himself to look in the mirror once more he had seen what he had seen it was time to face it he would tell eve everything and shift his burden into her hands he felt a moment of relief sweet in its intensity he wanted to call his wife hear his childrens voices see their faces a movement reflected in the glass had him whirling had his heart bounding into his throat how did you get in here housekeeping sir the dark woman in the trim blackandwhite maids uniform held a stack of fluffy towels she smiled i dont want housekeeping he passed a shaking hand over his face im expecting someone shortly just leave the towels and his hand slid slowly to his side i know you i know you through the smoke he thought through the cracked ice of fresh terror one of the faces in the smoke of course you do louis her smile never wavered as she dropped the towels and revealed the athame she held we fucked just last week he had time to draw breath for a scream before she plunged the knife into his throat o o eve strode out of the elevator bristling with annoyance the reception droid had kept her waiting five full minutes while he checked her id hed given her a hassle over taking her weapon into the club shed been considering just using it on him to shut him up when the day manager had bustled out full of apologies the fact that theyd both been aware hed been apologizing to roarkes wife rather than eve dallas had only irritated her shed deal with him later she promised herself see how the luxury club would like a fullscale inspection by the department of health maybe a visit from vice to check out their lcs she had strings she could pull to insure the management a couple of days of minor hell she turned toward c started to punch the buzzer under the peep screen her gaze flickered over the security light it beeped green for disengaged she drew her weapon peabody here sir though her voice was muffled against eves shirt pocket the doors unlocked here im going in do you want backup lieutenant not yet stay on me she slipped inside soundlessly shut the door at her back she kept to her defensive crouch sweeping her weapon and her gaze through the room fancy furniture ugly and overdone in her mind a rumpled suit jacket a halfempty bottle drapes drawn quiet she stepped farther into the room but kept near the wall guarding her own back as she circled no one hid behind the furniture behind the drapes the small kitchen was empty and apparently unused she stepped to the doorway of the bedroom again crouched again sweeping her weapon the bed was made heaped with decorative pillows and apparently hadnt been slept in her gaze moved to the closet the firmly shut carved doors she sidestepped toward it then heard the sounds from the bathroom quick heavy breathing grunts of effort a distinctly female chuckle it passed through her mind that louis might be having a quick roll with the lc of his choice and she gritted her teeth in annoyance but she didnt relax her guard she stepped left shifted her weight and swung to the doorway the smell hit her an instant before she saw it jesus jesus christ lieutenant peabodys voice ringing with concern piped out of her pocket back off eve leveled her weapon at the woman drop the knife and back off sending backup now give me your situation lieutenant ive got a homicide really fresh i said back the hell off the woman only smiled she straddled louis or what was left of him blood pooled on the floor splattered the white tiles coated her hands and face the stench of it and the gore was thick as smoke louis eve noted was well beyond hope hed been gutted and disemboweled and he was busily being eviscerated hes already dead the woman said pleasantly i can see that put down the knife eve took a step closer gesturing with the weapon put it down and move away from him slow face down on the floor hands behind your back it had to be done she slid her leg over the body until she was kneeling beside it like a mourner over a grave dont you recognize me yeah even through the mask of blood eve had made the face and shed remembered the voice the sweetness of it mirium right firstdegree witch now drop the fucking knife and kiss the floor hands behind you all right obligingly mirium set the knife aside barely glancing at it when eve trapped it under her heel sent it skidding across the room well out of reach he told me to be quick in and out i lost track of time eve tugged her restraints from her rear pocket snapped them in place over miriums wrists he chas he said i could do this one all by myself but to be fast she let out a sigh i guess i wasnt fast enough with her mouth thin eve looked down at louis trivane no she thought i wasnt fast enough you copy that peabody yes sir pick up charles forte for questioning do it personally and take two uniforms for backup dont approach him alone affirmative do you have the situation under control there lieutenant eve stepped back from the blood running in a rivulet toward her boots yeah she said ive got it she showered and changed before the interviews the ten minutes it took was necessary shed all but bathed in louis trivanes blood before shed released his body to the me if anyone in the lockers noticed the elegant little flower on her ass there was no comment the buzz on the state of this particular crime scene had already swarmed through the station im taking mirium first eve told feeney as she studied the dainty woman through the oneway glass you could take a break dallas word is it was pretty rough over there this morning you always think youve seen it all she murmured but you never do theres always something else she blew out a breath i want to do it now i want to close this okay duet or solo solo shes going to talk shes on something eve shook her head maybe shes just plain crazy but i think shes using im going to get her to sign for a chemiscan the pa doesnt like confessions given under the influence ill order one up thanks she moved past him walked into the room miriums face had been washed clean of blood she wore a baggy disposable shift in police station beige and still managed to look like a young eager fairy eve set the recorder entered standard then sat you know ive got you tagged mirium so we dont have to take that dance you murdered louis trivane yes what are you on on doesnt look like straight zeus youre too mellow will you agree to a drug scan i dont want to her pretty mouth pouted her dark eyes sulked maybe later ill change my mind she pursed her lips and plucked at the thin skirt of the shift can i get some of my own clothes this things itchy and it offends the eye yeah were real worried about that right now why did you kill louis trivane he was evil chas said so by chas youre referring to charles forte yes but no one calls him charles its just chas and chas told you louis was evil did he ask you to kill louis he said i could other times i just got to watch but this time i got to do it myself there was a lot of blood she lifted a hand studied it carefully gone now what other times mirium oh other times she moved her shoulders blood purifies did you assist or witness other murders sure death is a transition i got to do this one it was a very powerful act i cut the demon out of him demons exist and we fight them by killing the people they inhabit yes he said you were smart mirium beamed at her out of slanted black eyes but youll never touch him hes too far removed from your law lets go back to louis tell me about it well i have a friend on staff at the luxury all i had to do was screw him and that was okay i like to screw then i slipped one of the master codes in my pocket you can get in most anywhere with a master i put on one of the maids dresses so no one would bother me and i went right on in louiss suite i took him towels he was in the bathroom hed been sick i could smell it then i stabbed him i went for the throat just like i was supposed to then i guess i got into it she moved her shoulders again sent eve a mischievous smile its kind of like punching a knife through a pillow you know and it makes this sucky noise then i cut the demon out of him and you came i guess id finished anyway yeah i guess you had how long have you known chas oh a couple of years we like to make it in the park in the daytime because you never know if somebodys going to come along and see how does isis feel about that oh she doesnt know mirium rolled her eyes she wouldnt like it how does she feel about the murders miriums brows knit and her eyes unfocused for a moment the murders she doesnt know does she no we wouldnt tell her about that so its just between you and chas between me and chas her eyes fluttered stayed blank i guess sure have you told anyone else in the coven the coven she laid her fingers on her lips tapped them no no its our secret our little secret what about wineburg who in the parking garage the banker do you remember i didnt get to do that she bit her bottom lip now shook her head no he did that he was supposed to bring me the heart but he didnt he said there wasnt time and lobar lobar lobar her fingers kept tapping no that was different wasnt it i cant remember im getting a headache her voice turned petulant i dont want to talk anymore now im tired she laid her hands down on her folded arms and closed her eyes eve watched her for a moment there wasnt any point in pushing now she decided she had enough eve signaled a uniform mirium murmured sulkily as eve slipped the restraints back into place take her down to psych get mira to do the evaluation if possible make a note to request permission for a drug scan yes sir eve stepped to the door behind them pushed a call button have forte brought to interview room c it occurred to her that she would like to lay her head on pillowed arms herself instead she turned down the corridor into the observation area peabody stood beside feeney i want you in on this peabody what did you think of her feeney shes whacked he held out his bag of nuts whether its psych or induced i dunno looks like a mix of both to me that was my take how come she seemed so damn normal the other night then she pulled her hands through her hair and laughed i cant believe im saying that she was standing naked in the woods letting forte kiss her crotch she lowered her hands pressed them to her eyes then dropped them his father never used a partner that was never hinted at he worked alone so hes got a different style feeney said whacked or not the girl pinned forte it doesnt feel right to me peabody murmured and eve turned to her with a mildly interested glance what doesnt feel right officer detecting the light trace of sarcasm peabody lifted her jaw wiccans dont kill people kill eve reminded her and not everybody takes their religion seriously had any red meat lately the flush worked up from under peabodys starched uniform collar freeagers were strict vegan and used no animal byproducts thats different i walked in on a murder eve said shortly the woman with the knife in her hand identified charles forte as her accomplice thats fact i dont want you to take anything but fact into that interview room understood yes sir peabody stiffened her shoulders perfectly but she stood in place a moment longer when eve strode off shes had a rough morning feeney said sympathetically i got a quick scan of the first crime scene shots it doesnt get any rougher i know but she shook her head watching as charles forte was led into the room behind the glass but it just doesnt feel right she turned away headed around the corner and stepped into the interview room just as eve was reading forte his rights i dont understand you dont understand your rights and obligations no no i understand them i dont understand why im here there was puzzlement and a vague sense of disappointment as he turned his gaze toward peabody if youd wanted to speak with me again you had only to ask i would have met you or come in voluntarily it wasnt necessary to send three uniformed officers to my home i thought it was necessary eve answered shortly do you want counsel or representation at this time mr forte no he shifted in agitation tried to ignore the fact that he was inside a police facility like his father just tell me what you want to know ill try to help you tell me about louis trivane im sorry he shook his head i dont know anyone by that name do you usually send your handmaids out to murder strangers what his face went white as he pushed himself to his feet what are you talking about sit down eve snapped the order out louis trivane was murdered two hours ago by mirium hopkins mirium thats ridiculous thats impossible its very possible i walked in while she was cutting out his liver chas swayed then sank onto his chair theres a mistake it couldnt be i think the mistake was yours eve rose wandered over then leaned over his shoulder you should pick your weapons more carefully when you use defective ones they can turn on you i dont know what you mean may i have some water i dont understand this eve jerked a thumb to peabody signaling her to pour a glass mirium told me everything chas she told me that you were lovers that you neglected to bring her wineburgs heart as promised and that youd allowed her to execute trivane herself blood purifies no he lifted the glass in both hands and still slopped water over the edge as he tried to drink no your father liked to slice people up did he show you how it was done how many other defective tools have you used did you dispose of them after youd finished with them keep any souvenirs she continued to hammer at him while he sat just sat shaking his head slowly from side to side was this your version of a religious war chas eliminate the enemy cut out the demons your father was a selfstyled satanist and hed made your life a misery you couldnt kill him you cant get to him now but there are others are they substitutes when you kill them are you killing him hacking him to pieces because of what he did to you he squeezed his eyes tight began to rock god my god oh god you can help yourself here tell me why tell me how explain it to me chas i may be able to cut you a break tell me about alice about lobar no no when he lifted his head his eyes were streaming im not my father eve didnt flinch didnt look away from the desperate plea in his eyes arent you then she stepped back and let him sob chapter nineteen she worked him for an hour relentlessly pushing then backtracking then shifting directions she kept the death photos on the table dealt out like grisly playing cards how many more she demanded how many more images of the dead should there be through it all he wept and denied wept and was silent when she turned him over to holding his eyes stayed on hers until he was led around the corner and away but it was the look in peabodys eyes that caught her and had her waiting until they were alone problem officer observing the interrogation had been like watching a wolf toy and tear at a wounded deer peabody drew a breath braced yes sir i didnt like your interview technique didnt you it seemed overly harsh cruel using his father over and over again directing him to look at the stills eves stomach was raw her nerves scraped clean but her voice was cool her hands steady as she gathered up the stills maybe i should have asked him politely to please confess so we could all go home and get back to our comfy lives dont know why i didnt think of it ill make a note to try it the next time i have a murder suspect in interview peabody wanted to wince managed not to it just seemed to me lieutenant particularly since the suspect had no representation did i read him his rights officer yes sir but did he verify that he understood those rights peabody pulled back nodded slowly yes sir can you estimate officer peabody how many interviews youve conducted on homicide cases sir i i cant eve snapped and her eyes went from cool to hot i cant because theres been too fucking many of them you want to take a look at the stills again you want to see this guy with his guts spilled out all over the tiles maybe itll toughen you up a little because if my interview techniques upset you peabody youre in the wrong career eve strode to the door then whirled back while peabody stood where she was at rigid attention and i expect my aide to back me up not question me because she happens to have a soft spot for witches if you cant handle that officer peabody ill approve your request for transfer understood yes sir peabody let out a shaky breath as eves boots clicked down the corridor understood she said to herself and shut her eyes a little rough on her feeney commented when he caught up dont you start on me he only held up a hand isis came in voluntarily i put her in room b with a jerk of the head eve changed directions and pulled open the door of room b isis stopped her restless pacing and spun around how could you do this to him how could you bring him here hes terrified of places like this charles forte is being held for questioning in the stabbing death of louis trivane among others in contrast to isiss raised and furious voice eves was cold and flat he has not yet been charged charged her golden skin paled you cant believe chas had anything to do with a murder trivane we dont know any louis trivane and you know everyone forte knows isis eve set the file on the table kept her hand on it as if to remind herself what was inside you know everything he does and thinks and plans we are as close as its possible for human bodies and minds and souls to be there is no harm in him the temper drained out of her now her voice trembled let me take him home please eve met the pleading eyes straight on forced herself not to feel did you know being as close as its possible that hed decided to get equally close bodily speaking with mirium mirium isis blinked once then nearly laughed thats ridiculous she told me herself she smiled when she told me remembering that bringing that image back dried up any sympathy she smiled as she straddled what was left of louis trivane while his blood was smeared all over her hands and her face and the knife she held as her legs went weak isis reached out blindly to brace a hand on the back of a chair mirium killed someone thats impossible i thought all things were possible in your sphere i walked in on her little ceremony myself eves fingers curled on the file but she didnt open it there was still pity after all for the woman who loved and believed she was very cooperative happily told me that forte had allowed her to kill trivane herself unlike the others where she only observed using her hand to keep her balance isis stepped unsteadily around the chair eased herself into it shes lying there was a lance in her heart quivering there chas has nothing to do with this how could i have missed this part of her closing her eyes isis rocked herself gently how could i not have seen we initiated her we took her in we made her one of us cant see everything can you eve angled her head i think you should be more worried about your vision as it applies to charles forte no she opened her eyes again there was misery in them but behind it was a steel eve recognized theres no one i see more clearly than chas shes lying shell be tested in the meantime you may want to rethink allowing yourself to be used as his alibi hes betrayed your trust eve said stepping closer it could have been you isis at any time miriums younger probably more biddable i wonder how much longer hed have pretended to let you run the show how can you not understand what there is between us when you have it yourself do you think the word of some disturbed young woman would make me doubt the man i love would it make you doubt roarke its not my personal life thats in dire straits here eve said evenly its yours if you care for him so much then cooperate with me its the only way to stop him and to get him help help isiss mouth twisted you dont want to help him you want him to be guilty you want him to be punished because of where he came from because of his father eve looked down at the folder in her hands the plain tan cover that hid the terrible images of terrible death youre wrong she spoke quietly now almost to herself i wanted him to be innocent because of his father then she lifted her gaze met isiss the warrant will have come through by now well search your shop and your apartment whatever we find can be used against you as well it wont matter isis forced herself to stand you wont find anything to help you youre entitled to be present during the search no ill stay here i want to see chas youre not related or legally married dallas isis interrupted quietly you have a heart please listen to it and let me see him yes she had a heart and it ached to see the plea in the eyes of a strong woman i can give you five minutes through security glass as she wrenched the door open she set her teeth tell him to get a lawyer for gods sake o o in the storeroom of spirit quest and in a workroom in the apartment above were dozens of bottles and containers and boxes they were filled with liquid and powder and leaves and seeds she found organized records detailing the contents and their uses eve ordered everything sent to the lab for analysis she found knives carved handles and plain longbladed and short she tagged a sweeper ordered him to scan for traces of blood ceremonial robes and street clothes were scanned as well she blocked out the voices sweepers never worked quietly and went about her job with focused efficiency and there under a neatly folded stack of robes kept fresh in a chest smelling of rosemary and cedar she found the balledup and bloody black robe here she signaled to a sweeper scan it nice sample the sweeper snapped her gum ran the nozzle of her shoulder unit over the cloth mostly on the sleeves behind her protective goggles the sweepers eyes were mildly bored human she confirmed a neg cant tell you much more with a portable thats enough eve slid the robe into a bag sealed and labeled it for evidence wineburg was a negative she looked at peabody as she handed the bag to her careless of him wasnt it yes sir dutifully peabody stored the bag in her evidence kit it would seem so lobar was o positive she moved to another chest hauled back the domed lid keep looking twilight had settled with its dim light and fitful breezes when she climbed back in her car since the tension was still simmering between her and peabody she didnt bother to speak but engaged her car link instead lieutenant dallas for dr mira dr mira is in session the receptionist said politely ill be happy to log your message has she tested mirium hopkins one moment while i check the logs the receptionist slid her gaze to the side then back that session has been rescheduled for eight thirty tomorrow morning rescheduled why the log notes indicate that the subject complained of severe head pain and on examination by the physician on duty was medicated who was the physician on duty eve asked through clenched teeth dr arthur simon simon says figures disgusted eve whipped her car around a slowmoving maxibus packed with commuters hell give you a double tranq for a hangnail the receptionist grimaced in sympathy im sorry lieutenant but the subject was already medicated before her scheduled testing dr mira is unable to proceed until morning fine terrific ask her to let me know as soon as shes done eve broke transmission son of a bitch im going in to take a look at her myself deliver the bags to the lab peabody with a request for rush for what good that does then youre off duty youll interview forte again tonight thats right sir i request to be present during interview request denied eve said shortly as she pulled into the garage at central i said youre off duty she shoved out of the car and walked away o o it was midnight and her own head was aching viciously the house was quiet when she slipped in dragged herself up the stairs it didnt surprise her to see roarke awake and on the bedroom link she glanced at the monitor as she passed through and recognized the young eager face of one of the engineers assigned to the olympus resort it made her think of the last few days of her honeymoon there had been death there as well big surprise she thought as she leaned over the sink and splashed her face with cold water there was never any escaping it she toweled off then walked to the bed to sit and remove her boots when they hit the floor the effort of undressing further seemed beyond her she crawled onto the bed and lay across it facedown roarke listened to his engineer with half an ear while he watched her he knew the signs the shadowed eyes the pale skin the slow deliberate movements shed worked herself to the breaking point again a habit that both fascinated and frustrated him ill get back to you on that tomorrow he said and abruptly ended transmission youve had a bad one lieutenant she didnt stir when he straddled her and began to knead her neck and shoulders i know theres been worse she murmured i just cant think of when right now louis trivanes murder has been all over the news goddamn vultures he unhooked her weapon harness wiggled it off her and set it aside a prominent attorney gets himself hacked up in an exclusive private club its news competently he worked his thumbs up her spine nadines called here several times yeah shes buzzed central too i dont have time for her mmm he tugged her shirt free of her slacks and used the heels of his hands did you walk in on it or was that added for entertainment value no i walked in on it maybe if that idiot droid at the desk hadnt she broke off shook her head i was too late shed already opened him up she was still working on him like a kid with a science project she implicated charles forte thats out too of course it is she said with a sigh you cant plug all the leaks you have him in custody were questioning him im questioning him he denies everything i found physical evidence in his apartment but he still denies everything denies she thought while looking shocked dislocated terrified oh shit she turned her head pressed her face into the spread oh shit come on he kissed the top of her head lightly lets get you undressed and into bed dont baby me try to stop me she started to shift then moved quickly before shed realized her intent or the need she had her arms around him her face buried against his shoulder her eyes squeezed tight as if to block out visions youre always here even when youre not were not alone anymore either of us because he thought she needed it he lifted her onto his lap talk to me youve got more than murder and evidence on your mind im not a good person she blurted it out before she could stop herself im a good cop but im not a good person i cant afford to be thats nonsense eve its not its true you just dont want to see it thats all she pulled back so she could look at him when you love somebody you can handle the little faults but you dont want to see the big ones you dont want to admit what the person youve attached yourself to is capable of so you pretend its not there what are you capable of that im blind to i beat forte into pulp not physically she continued dragging her hair away from her face thats too easy thats too clean i ripped him to pieces emotionally i wanted to i wanted him to tell me what hed done so i could finish it close it away and when peabody had the balls to tell me she disapproved of my interview techniques i trounced her i sent her off duty so i could go back in and hammer at him again he was silent a moment then rose to turn the covers down so let me recap you walked in on a mutilation in progress took the killer into custody a killer who implicated charles forte in this and in other murders this is a matter of days after you discover a mutilated body on your doorstep it cant be personal i beg your pardon lieutenant but thats bullshit to continue he said coming around to unbutton her shirt you then take charles forte in for interview a man you suspect with good cause is responsible for several violent deaths you play hardball something which your aide whom youre training and who though highly competent has considerably less experience than yourself in these matters disapproves of a police officer who did not walk into a room and find a woman gleefully carving a man into pieces the news reports were quite specific he told her and he added before eve could speak you then reprimanded your aide when she questioned your judgment subsequently sending her off duty so that you could resume your interrogation does that about sum it up frowning she studied the top of his head as he bent to pull off her slacks youre making it black and white its not it never is he swung her legs into bed pushed her down gently ill tell you what it makes you eve it makes you a good cop a dedicated one and a human one he undressed slipped into bed beside her and that being the case its probably best if i divorce you and get on with my life he pulled her close until her head cozied into the curve of his shoulder obviously up till now ive been blind to your hideous character flaws you make me sound like an idiot good i intended to he kissed her temple ordered the lights to dim now go to sleep she turned her head so that she could smell his skin on her way to sleep i dont think i can let you have that divorce she said on a sigh no uhuh no way im giving up the coffee o o eve arrived at her office at eight am she had already been by the lab to harass them which had in part cheered her her link was beeping with an incoming when she opened the door and peabody stood at attention beside her desk youre early peabody eve moved to the link coded in and waited for the messages to dispense youre not on for thirty minutes i wanted to speak to you lieutenant before i came on duty all right eve put the messages on hold turned to give peabody her full attention you look like hell she commented peabody kept her gaze steady she knew how she looked she hadnt eaten or slept symptoms she knew that were embarrassingly similar to those she displayed when a love affair ended badly and this shed realized during the long night was worse than any breakup with a man i would like to formally apologize lieutenant for statements made after the forte interview it was insubordinate and incorrect to question your methods i hope that my lack of judgment in this matter will not influence you to dismiss me from this case or from this division eve sat leaned back in a chair that creakily begged for lubricant is that all officer peabody yes sir except to say if youve got more to say pull the stick out of your butt first youre off duty and off the record peabodys shoulders slumped slightly but in defeat rather than relaxation im sorry watching him fall to pieces that way got to me i wasnt able to divorce myself from the situation and view it objectively i dont believe dont want to believe she corrected that hes responsible it tainted my viewpoint objectivitys essential and more often than any of us want to admit impossible i wasnt completely objective either which is why i overreacted to your comments i apologize for that surprise and relief spread through her peabody found them both easier to swallow than crow and fear will you keep me on ive got an investment in you leaving it at that eve turned back to her link behind eves back peabody closed her eyes tightly dug for composure she took a breath swallowed hard and found it so does this mean weve made up eve slanted a look at peabodys hopeful grin why dont i have any coffee she engaged the link let her messages run the first had barely begun when peabody set a steaming cup at her elbow come on dallas come on give me a break i can go on with an update any time day or night get back to me damn it just a couple details not going to happen nadine eve murmured and zipped through the next three messages from the reporter all increasingly desperate there was a communication from the me with the autopsy report eve downloaded and ordered a hard copy print finally a relay from the lab which verified the blood on the robe was wineburgs i cant see it peabody said quietly why cant i see it its all there she lifted her shoulders let them fall its all right there we charge him and book him eve rubbed a finger up and down the center of her forehead murder one on wineburg well hold off on the conspiracy to murder on trivane until miras done the testing have him brought up for interview again peabody well see how many more we can pin to him why alice peabody asked why frank he didnt do them theyre not his separate cases you still think selinas responsible for them i know she is but were a long way from proving it o o she spent the day going over reports filing her own by noon when she faced chas in interview again she was ready to try a different tack she studied his chosen representative a young sadeyed woman who by eves estimate could barely be old enough to have passed the bar she didnt bother to sigh as she recognized the woman from the initiation ceremony a lawyer witch she mused and wondered if that would be considered a redundancy this is your chosen counsel mr forte yes his face was a sickly gray his eyes shades darker leila has agreed to help me very well youve been charged with murder mr forte ive requested a bail hearing leila began and passed eve some paperwork its scheduled for two pm today you wont get bail eve handed the papers to peabody and it wont delay this very long i didnt even know the man who was killed chas began id never seen him before that night i was with you which puts you on the scene at the time giving you opportunity motive she leaned back you were there you knew he was about to break to talk his blood wasnt the first to spill was it mr forte i dont know anything about it his voice quavered he took a breath laid his hand over leilas as if for support their fingers linked and his voice came stronger ive never harmed anyone in my life its against everything i believe everything ive made myself ive told you i held nothing back from you trusting you to understand do you own a black robe natural silk wrap style floor length i own many robes but i dont care for black eve held a hand out waited until peabody put the sealed garment into it then you dont recognize this its not mine he seemed to relax a little that doesnt belong to me no yet it was found in a chest in the bedroom of the apartment you share with isis carelessly perhaps quickly hidden under a stack of other robes theres blood on it mr forte wineburgs blood no he cringed back thats not possible its a fact your representative is free to study the lab report i wonder if isis will recognize it it might jog her memory she has nothing to do with this nothing to do with any of this panic had him lurching up you cant suspect her of of what eve cocked her head of being an accessory she lives with you works with you she sleeps with you even if shes just been protecting you it puts her in it she cant be drawn into this she cant be put through this leave her alone he leaned forward resting trembling hands on the table leave her alone promise me that and ill tell you whatever you want to hear chas leila stood put a firm hand on his shoulder sit down dont say anything else my client has nothing further to say at this time lieutenant i need to confer with him and request privacy to do so eve took her measure the woman no longer looked young and sadeyed but cool and determined there wont be a deal counselor not on this one she rose signaled peabody but a full confession might get him a psych facility rather than a maximum lockup think about it she swore under her breath once she was outside the room shell put a lid on him hell do what she tells him because hes too scared not to eve paced a yard down the corridor then back ive got to get to mira shes bound to be done by now with testing you contact the pas office we need somebody down here maybe if we have a prosecutor talk to his rep lawyer to lawyer we can open it up isis cracked him peabody glanced back toward the door as they headed away he really loves her theres all kinds of love isnt there i dont get why he had sex with mirium theres all kinds of sex too some is straight manipulation she turned into her office to call mira chapter twenty delusional sociopathic an addictive and easily influenced personality eve tossed miras report aside she hadnt needed a psychiatrist to tell her mirium was a lunatic with no conscience shed seen that for herself or that she had obsessive leanings toward the occult a low intelligence quotient and a capacity for violence miras recommendation for further testing and for treatment as a mentally defective might have been sound but it didnt change the facts mirium had butchered a man in cold blood and would more than likely do her time in the quiet rooms of a mental health facility the truth testing hadnt been much more helpful it indicated the subject was telling the truth as the subject saw the truth there were gaps and hitches and confusion likely due eve noted glancing at the drug scan results from having a half dozen illegal substances bouncing around in her system lieutenant peabody stepped in waited for eve to look up schultz from the pas office just tagged me whats the status the lawyer wont budge shes pushing for a truth test but forte keeps refusing schultz thinks shes stalling says she wants fortyeight to study all the reports and evidence itll keep forte in since bail was denied but shes insisting schultz thinks fortes ready to roll over but shes keeping him on a short leash schultz give you all that yeah well i think he was looking to make time fresh divorce oh eve lifted a brow and he likes a woman in uniform id say its more like he likes a human with breasts at this point bottom line he doesnt think were getting any more tonight the lawyer exercised her clients right for minimum break schultz agreed to talk more in the morning hes headed out all right maybe its best to give them both time to stew well swing by isiss place may be able to shake her youve got it pretty well wrapped peabody fell into step beside her youll be able to relax some tonight at the party party eve stopped dead maviss party thats tonight hell so speaks the party animal peabody said dryly personally im looking forward to it its been a shitty week halloweens supposed to be for kids so they can blackmail adults into forking over junk food grown men and women running around in dopey costumes its embarrassing actually its an old revered tradition with its roots in earth religions dont get started eve warned as they rode down to the garage she eyed peabody suspiciously youre not actually wearing a costume how else can i guarantee getting my share of candy peabody brushed some lint from the front of her uniform o o the store was dark and so was the apartment no one answered the knock on any door eve considered checked her watch im going to stake it out for a couple of hours id rather hit her tonight shes probably at the sabbat ceremony i dont figure shes in the mood for naked dancing under the circumstances ill stick you can catch transpo from here i can stay its not necessary if she doesnt show in a couple hours ill head to maviss like that peabody scanned eves faded jeans worn boots and battered jacket dont you want to wear something more festive no ill see you there eve climbed back in the car lowered the window so what are you wearing its a secret peabody said with a grin and walked off to catch a tram home embarrassing eve decided and settling back engaged her link the system put her through to roarke at his midtown office just caught me he told her and noted the edge of the steering wheel on the monitor obviously youre not at home getting yourself ready for tonights festivities obviously not ive got a couple more hours here so ill meet you at maviss we can duck out early i can see youre already looking forward to an exciting evening halloween she glanced over as a ghoul a sixfoot pink rabbit and a mutant transexual crossed the street in front of her car i just dont get it darling eve for some its simply an excuse to be foolish for others its a serious holy day samhain the beginning of celtic winter the beginning of the year the turn of it with the old dying and the new yet unborn on this night the veil between is very thin boy she gave a mock shudder now im spooked tonight well concentrate on using it as an excuse to be foolish want to get drunk and have wild sex yeah her lips twitched that sounds pretty good we could get started now a little link sex that would be illegal over an official line besides you never know when dispatch is going to get nosey then i wont mention how much i want to get my hands on you my mouth on you how exciting it is to feel you under me when im inside you and you arch back struggling to breathe and fist your hands in my hair no dont mention it she told him as the muscles in her thighs tingled and went lax ill see you in a couple hours well ah go home early then you could mention it eve yeah i adore you with a silky satisfied smile on his face he disengaged she blew out a long slow breath when am i going to get used to this she muttered the sex was mindscrambling enough shed never thought of the act as any more than a necessary and mildly pleasurable physical release until roarke he could turn her drymouthed and needy with a look but more was the hold he had on her heart in that firm possessive grip that was alternately comforting and terrifying shed never understood the demanding power of love frowning she looked back at the apartment across the street hadnt that been what shed seen there power and love isis was a strong powerful woman could love have blinded her so completely it wasnt impossible eve mused but it was disappointing she admitted for herself she knew roarke had spent much of his life skirting the law hell she thought hed stomped on it she knew hed stolen cheated finagled she knew hed killed the abused child from the mean streets of dublin had done what hed needed to do to survive then had done as hed liked to profit she couldnt entirely blame him for either yet if he used his power and his position today to kill what would she do would she stop loving him she wasnt sure but she was sure that she would know and the code that she lived by wouldnt allow her to turn a blind eye to murder maybe the code isis lived by wasnt as strong and yet as she sat in the dark with the sharp little teeth of the wind biting at her windows she found she couldnt balance it forte had all but confessed now she reminded herself once shed confronted him with the robe with the evidence hed started toward surrender that wasnt entirely true she thought it was when shed brought isis into it that hed changed directions protecting her shielding her sacrificing for her with a new theme playing in her mind she got out of the car crossed the street a number of people wandered the street many of them in costumes even as she stepped over the curb a gaggle of teenagers rushed by making enough noise to wake the dead no one paid any attention to a lone woman in a leather jacket climbing the stairs to a dark apartment she stood on the landing a moment scanning the street the surrounding buildings it was an area where people minded their own business she decided and wouldnt the neighbors be accustomed to seeing people perhaps thelessthanusual type of person going up and into the apartment to test her theory farther eve tried the door finding it locked she simply fished a master code out of her pocket she had the door open in seconds and waited just outside it for the sound of a security alarm there was only silence inside no security she decided and resisted the temptation to go in the average civilian wouldnt have access to a master but there were other ways of popping unsecured locks hadnt the apartment been empty the day before with both forte and isis at central how easy would it have been for someone to slip in to plant a bloodstained robe in an obvious place eve shut the door again and stood arguing with herself mirium had implicated him shed said his name as she sat on the floor blood still running from her hands delusional sociopathic easily influenced damn it eve trooped down the steps back to her car the evidence was there wasnt it motive opportunity it was a fucking textbook checklist she even had a confessed accomplice in custody an accomplice hed been sleeping with on the side having sex in central park using his influence to bring her into the coven right under his lovers nose it fit she told herself and that was the trouble it slid so well into place it was as if someone had oiled the slot all you had to do was leave out love selfless devoted unquestioning love add that and it scraped along the sides of that slot screaming in protest if there was a chance it was a setup and that she was being used to make it click she was damn well going to find out she considered calling peabody started to reach for her link when she heard the scream she was out of the car her hand on her weapon when she spotted the blackrobed figure dragging a woman into the shadows police she rushed forward drawing back off he did more than that he ran when eve reached the woman she was lying facedown moaning holstering her weapon she crouched down how bad did he hurt you as she rolled the woman over she saw the glint of a blade it was pressed keenedged against her stomach before she saw selinas face all i have to do is push just a little selina smiled id enjoy that but for now her hand tapped against eves throat she felt the pressure and the sting an instant before her vision blurred now youre going to help me to the car or its going to look that way if anyone notices smiling selina put her arms around eve keeping close so it appeared she was being lifted to her feet and if you dont do exactly what i say your guts will hit the sidewalk and ill be gone before you realize youre dead eves head was swimming her legs like rubber as selina led her down the sidewalk get in selina ordered slide over she found herself obeying dully while a part of her mind screamed in protest not so smart now are you lieutenant dallas not so cool we led you right where we wanted you stupid bitch how do you set this thing to auto i she couldnt think fear couldnt get through the haze nor could anger or training she stared blankly at the controls auto her voice was enough the vehicle shuddered then hummed discordantly i dont believe youre in any shape to drive selina threw back her head and laughed give it the address my apartment we have a very special ceremony in mind for you mechanically eve repeated the address and stared straight ahead as the vehicle slowly slid from the curb not forte she managed struggling to snap back it was never him that pathetic excuse for a man he couldnt kill a fly if it landed on his dick if hes got one but he and that halfbreed wiccan are going to pay youve seen to that havent you they thought they could save poor little alice well so did her stupid grandfather see where it got them no one challenges me and lives youll find out just how much power i have very soon now and youll beg me to kill you and end it you killed them all every one of them selina leaned closer and more many more i enjoy the children most theyre so fresh i walked right in on the grandfather used his weakness for females sobbed told him i was afraid for my life alban would kill me then i slipped the drugs into his drink and i killed him i wanted blood but well it was nearly as satisfying to watch his eyes as he realized he was dying youve seen how the eyes die first havent you dallas they die first yes the mists were moving back to the corners of her mind she could feel her legs and arms tingle as the nerves pumped back to life yes they do and alice i was almost sorry when we had to end that tormenting her day after day was so arousing they way she would jump at a cat or a bird droids easily programmed we used the cat that night had it speak to her with my voice we were waiting for her we had plans for her but she ran into the street and killed herself instead so well do to you what wed planned for her here we are now as the car veered toward the curb eve tested her hand forced it into a fist she struck out backhanded felt the satisfying connection with flesh and bone then the door was wrenched open behind her hands clenched around her throat and the world went black o o she should be here by now though her apartment was filled with people and noise and wildly spinning lights mavis pouted she promised shell be right along roarke managed to avoid being butted by a redrobed bull lifted a brow at the manic call of toro an angel spun by desperately dancing with a headless corpse i really wanted her to see what leonardo and i have done with the place proud mavis turned a quick circle shed never recognize her old digs would she roarke scanned the magenta walls with their uninhibited splashes and streaks of cerise and periwinkle the furniture consisted of heaps of glossy pillows and glass tubes in keeping with the event streamers of orange and black swayed everywhere skeletons danced witches flew and black cats arched no he could agree with complete honesty shed never recognize her old apartment youve done wonders we just love it and weve got the best landlord on planet she kissed him enthusiastically while he hoped her purple lipstick hadnt transferred to his face he smiled my favorite tenant could you call her roarke with fingers tipped the same shade she plucked at his sleeve just give her a little goose of course go play hostess and dont worry ill get her here thanks she rolled off on glittery redwheeled shoes roarke turned with the idea of hunting up somewhere quiet to make his call then blinked at the apparition peabody her elaborately painted face fell you recognized me barely with a faint smile he stepped back to take a full measure long blonde hair swirled over her shoulders down her back over the tiny scallopshaped bra that covered her breasts from the waist down she was encased in shimmering green you make a lovely mermaid thanks she perked up again it took me forever to rig myself out how the hell do you walk ive got a cutout for my feet the skirt of the tail covers it she wiggled back pretty restrictive to movement though wheres dallas she twisted her head to search i want her to get a load of it she isnt here yet no because she hadnt worn her watch she peered down at his its almost ten she was only going to stake out isiss place for a couple hours then come straight here i was about to call her good idea peabody tried to ignore the prickle of nerves shes probably stalling she hates stuff like this yes youre right but shed have been there for mavis he thought as he slipped into the corner and for him when her link went unanswered he bypassed security and called through her communicator there was a humming buzz that indicated it was on standby but it went unanswered somethings wrong he said when he stepped back up to peabody she isnt picking up let me get my bag try her communicator i already tried it he said shortly she isnt picking up she was staking out spirit quest yeah she wanted to talk to isis let me get out of this costume well go check it out i cant wait for you he pushed his way through the crowd as peabody shuffled and looked for feeney o o she thought it was a dream at first when she woke groggy and hot her head spun and when she tried to lift a hand to it she found she couldnt move panic rushed in first her hands were bound hed often tied her hands when she was a child tied her to the bed clamped a hand over her mouth to hold in her screams when he raped her she pulled at them felt the vague faraway pain of the straps cutting into her wrists her breath sobbed out as she struggled her legs were secured as well tied down at the ankles so that her thighs were spread she whipsawed her head trying to see shadows shifted through the room chased by the flickering lights of dozens of candles she could see herself in a mirror a wall of black glass that reflected images and light she wasnt a child and it wasnt her father who had tied her she forced down the panic it wouldnt help it never did shed been drugged she told herself shed been brought here stripped naked and tied to a marble slab like a piece of meat selina cross meant to kill her and maybe worse unless she could keep her mind clear and fight back she continued to work at her wrist straps twisting tugging while she forced her mind to focus where was she in the apartment most likely though she couldnt quite remember the club would have been too dangerous full of people it was more private here in this room this room where alice had seen a child sacrificed what time was it god how long had she been out roarke was going to be pissed she bit her lip hard enough to draw blood to hold back the bubble of hysteria they would miss her wonder about her peabody knew her last location and they would check it out and what good would that do her eve closed her eyes to wait for calm she was on her own she told herself and she meant to survive the mirrored wall slid open and selina draped in an open black robe slipped through ah youre awake i wanted you awake and aware before we started alban stepped in behind her he wore a similar robe and the fierce toothed mask of a boar saying nothing he picked up a thick candle set it between eves thighs he stepped back lifted an ivoryhandled athame from a black pillow then held it aloft now we begin o o roarke opened the door of his car when his pocket link beeped he whipped it out eve its jamie i know where she is theyve got her you have to hurry where is she as he spoke roarke climbed behind the wheel that cross bitch theyve got her inside the apartment or i think they do i lost transmission when they got her out of the car roarke didnt wait but pushed the accelerator and flew through traffic what transmission i bugged her car i wanted to know what was going on i planted a transmitter i heard stuff tonight cross told her to put the car on auto go to the apartment dallas mustve been drugged or something because she sounded weird and cross said how shed killed my grandfather and alice his voice flooded with tears she killed them both and kids and christ where are you im right outside their place im going in stay out goddamn it you listen to me stay out ill be there in two minutes call the cops report a breakin a fire anything but get them there understand me she killed my sister jamies voice was suddenly calm and cold and im going to kill her stay out roarke repeated swearing as the transmission ended digging for control he called maviss snapped out a demand for peabody when the call was answered with wild laughter he was already pulling up at selinas building when peabody answered roarke feeney and i are heading to spirit quest right shes not there cross has her most likely in the apartment building im there now and im going in jesus dont do anything crazy ill call for a cruiser feeney and i are on our way theres a young boy in there too youd better hurry with no weapon but his wits and his will he rushed the door o o they were chanting over her alban had lighted a fire in a black cauldron and the smoke was thick and overly sweet selina had discarded her robe and was now slowly rubbing glistening oil over her body ever been raped by a woman im going to hurt you when i do it so will he and we wont kill you quickly the way we did lobar the way we told mirium to kill trivane its going to be slow and unspeakably painful eves head was clear now brutally clear her wrists burned slicked with her own blood as she continued to strain against the straps is this how you call up your demons your religions a sham you just like to rape and kill it makes you a degenerate just like any creep crawling in the gutter selina brought her hand back whipped it down hard over eves face i want to kill her now soon my love alban crooned it you dont want to rush the moment he reached into a box pulled a black cockerel out it clucked and squawked wings flapping as alban held it over eves body he spoke in latin now his voice musical as he took the knife and sliced off the head blood gushed out steaming over eves torso beside her selina moaned in ecstasy blood for the master yes my love he turned to her the master must have blood and very calmly very quickly he raked the knife over selinas throat you have been so tedious he murmured when she stumbled back breath gurgling as she grabbed at her throat useful but tedious when she collapsed he stepped over her removed the mask set it aside enough of the pageantry she enjoyed it i find it stifling he smiled charmingly i dont intend to make you suffer theres no purpose in it the stench of blood was nauseating using all her will eve concentrated on his face why did you kill her shed ceased to be useful shes quite insane you know too many chemicals i suspect in addition to a defective personality she liked me to beat her before sex he shook his head there were times i actually enjoyed it the beating part anyway she was very clever with chemicals absently he ran a hand up and down eves calf and i discovered with the right direction the proper incentive she was a clever businesswoman weve made an enormous amount of money over the last couple of years and of course theres the membership contributions people will pay ridiculous amounts of money for sex and the possibility of immortality so it was just a con come on dallas calling up demons selling the soul he chuckled delighted its the best grift ive ever run but its hit its peak now selina he glanced down idly rubbed a thumb over his chin she became quite serious about it she actually believed she had power he studied the sprawled body with something like amused pity that she could see in the smoke call up the devil he smiled again made the ageless sign for lunacy by circling his finger at his temple a sham eve thought from the beginning nothing but a long con for profit most grifters dont add human sacrifice to the theme im not most grifters and a few realistic ceremonies kept selina in line she developed a taste for blood so did i he admitted that i did find addicting taking a life is a powerful thing an arousing thing he let his gaze roam over her appreciating the slim subtle lines selina had been all lush curves just on the point of overabundance i may have you first after all it seems a waste not to everything in her revolted at the thought you were the one who had sex with mirium you were the one who told her to kill trivane to infiltrate the wiccans she is the most malleable of women and under a little chemical inducement some posthypnotic suggestion selectively forgetful it was never selina thats where i was off you werent her lap dog she was yours thats very accurate she was losing control ive known that for some time she did the cop on her own his mouth thinned in annoyance that was the beginning of the end for this and for her hed never have pinned us and should have been left to fumble around until he gave up youre wrong frank wouldnt have given up hardly matters now does it he turned away taking up a small vial and a pressure injector ill give you just a bit to take the edge off youre really quite attractive i can make you enjoy it when i rape you there arent enough drugs in the world for that youre wrong he murmured and walked toward her o o roarke had to force himself not to enter the apartment at a run if she was inside and in trouble his rushing in could do her more harm than good he closed the door quietly at his back since the security had already been bypassed he knew jamie had gone in still the movement at his side had him lashing out grabbing at the throat its me its jamie i cant get into the room theyve installed something new i cant bypass where is it there that wall i havent heard anything but theyre in there they have to be go outside i wont and youre wasting time then stay back roarke ordered refusing to waste more he approached the wall running his fingers over it ordering himself to be thorough methodical while every instinct in him screamed to hurry if there was a device it was well concealed reaching into his pocket he took out his daily log tapped in a program he thought he caught the distant wail of a siren what is that jamie demanded in a whisper jesus is that a jammer ive never seen one worked into a pocket diary youre not the only one who knows the tricks he began to play it over the wall cursing it for being too slow too inefficient abruptly it emitted a low hum beeped twice theres the little bastard as the door slid open he crouched and baring his teeth prepared to spring o o she strained away from the injector but it pressed against her upper arm then just as quickly was removed no with a quick laugh alban set it aside not for sex that would be unfair to you and a blow to my pride afterward ill put you under deeply so you wont feel the knife its the least i can do just kill me you son of a bitch with a final vicious pull she popped the strap dragged one arm free and shot her fist into his face but when she reached for the knife lying beside her it clattered to the floor then for just a moment she thought the demons of hell had been loosed after all he came in like a wolf with a snarl and a lunge the force of roarkes attack sent alban flying back sent candles flying to gutter out in pools of blood rearing up eve struggled to free her other hand and panic left no room for shock as she spotted jamie hurry up for christs sake get the knife cut me loose hurry his stomach was heaving but he stepped over selinas body grabbed the knife keeping his eyes locked on her wrist he hacked at the strap give it to me i can get the rest her gaze was locked on roarke the desperate struggle over the bloody floor fire was beginning to live in the corner growing from upended candle to hungry flame theres the cops she said when she heard the siren go let them in the doors unlocked he said it calmly flatly as he moved to her feet to cut her ankles free do something about that fire in the corner she ordered as she scrambled down no let it burn let the whole damn place burn to the ground put it out she snapped again then leapt like a madwoman onto albans back you bastard you son of a bitch even as she dragged his head back roarkes fist flew up and cracked against his face get the hell back roarke demanded hes mine they rolled over in a violent tangle of limbs to discover only two of them were still conscious did he hurt you roarkes eyes were still wild when he grabbed her arms did he put his hands on you no she had to be calm now she realized for he wasnt she wasnt entirely sure what roarke was capable of when he was in this state he never touched me you took care of that im all right you were taking care of yourself as usual when i got here he lifted her hand stared at the blood seeping from the abrasions on her wrist and lifted it to his lips i could kill him for that just for that alone stop its part of the job he was struggling to accept that his jacket was ruined a bloody mess but he took it off and wrapped it around her youre naked yeah i noticed i dont know what they did with my clothes but id just as soon be wearing something other than skin when the troops get here she rose discovered she wasnt entirely steady on her feet they drugged me she explained shaking her head to clear it as roarke moved her away eased her down to sit on a clear spot on the floor just get your breath back i have to put out that fire good thinking she drew a couple of cleansing breaths as he used one of the robes to smother the flames flicking along the floor then she shot to her feet cried out no jamie dont she took the first running steps forward but it was already too late face white jamie got to his feet the knife still wet with albans blood was in his hand they killed my family his eyes were huge the pupils pinpricks as he offered the knife to eve i dont care what you do to me he wont ever kill anyone elses sister she heard the footsteps rushing through the outside door and following instinct gripped the athame by the handle so that her own fingerprints were on it shut up just shut the hell up peabody eve turned as her aide rushed in weapon drawn get me something to wear will you peabodys breath came out in three unsteady puffs as she scanned the carnage yes sir are you all right im fine cross and alban ambushed me drugged me up and got me here theyve both confessed to the murders of frank wojinski and alice lingstrom lobar wineburg and conspiracy to murder trivane alban killed selina for reasons i will detail in my report alban was killed during the struggle to contain him it was confusing im not sure exactly how it happened i dont think it matters no feeney stood beside peabody scanned jamies face then eves and he knew i dont think it matters now come on jamie you shouldnt be in here now lieutenant with respect i think it would be best if you and roarke went home and cleaned up youre a little too in tune with the season so to speak eve glanced at roarke grimaced blood and smoke coated his face you look disgusting you should see yourself lieutenant he slipped an arm around her i think peabody has a point well find a blanket that should be sufficient to get you home without you freezing or getting arrested she wanted a bath so desperately she could have wept okay ill be back in an hour dallas it isnt necessary for you to come back tonight an hour she repeated secure the scene call the me get that boy an mt hes shocky contact whitney hell want to know what happened here and i want charles forte released as soon as possible eve tugged roarkes jacket more securely around her you were right about him peabody your instincts were on target theyre good instincts thank you lieutenant use them again if that boy says anything that doesnt jibe with my brief statement of the events ignore him hes emotionally wrecked and in shock i dont want him questioned tonight by anyone peabody nodded kept her eyes carefully blank yes sir ill see that hes taken home ill remain on scene until you return do that eve turned started to button the jacket by the way dallas what peabody thats a lovely tattoo new eve clamped her teeth together strode toward the door with as much dignity as she could manage see she jabbed a finger into roarkes chest as they walked down the corridor i told you id be humiliated by that stupid rosebud youve been drugged slapped tied up naked and nearly killed but a rose on your butt humiliates you all that other stuffs the job the rosebuds personal laughing he swung his arm around her shoulders hugging her close christ lieutenant i love you
