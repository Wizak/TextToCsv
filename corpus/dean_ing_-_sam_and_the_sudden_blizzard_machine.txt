sam and the sudden blizzard machine by dean ing sams sudden blizzard is history now and like all motor racing disasters its memory is rusting out in a junkyard of legends some claim sams design was faulty others say the fault was mine for listening to him smythe our sports car club archivist warns that we all orbit too closely around sam like moths around a rally car spotlightbut smythes a poly sci professor so thats got to be wrong i blame it on the weather the snow came a month early and all at once and froze out our plans for late fall competition teeboned yer slalom event did it sam grunted happily as we slumped at his fireplace blackflagged us i admitted i sat watching flames as sam arranged blazing chunks of hardwood now anybody can poke at a fire with a bugatti dipstick but sam was feeding his fire with old trophy bases pretty expensive way to heat a hangar from the standpoint of effort expended actually sam only had to heat the living quarters in his surplus hangar which is the only structure on his property the rest of the place is crammed with machine tools surplus aerospace materials his vehicles and his clean room where he doesnt build racing cars i mean he doesnt anymore that is he does but not as a business now sam was with lockheeds skunk works until after the u and sr were public knowledge and then he turned to designing racing cars his series of fabled cars might have gone on forever had he not stolen computer time from lockheed to make a study of racing trends sam took one hard scan at the printout and quit serious competition in mingled disgust and fear in he predicts gocarts will outgun indy cars and dune buggies wont need wheels something to do with new power units he says with a glint in those gray granite eyes with all his engineering knowhow and all his stolen hardware and both of his magicians hands in that hangar sam is roughly as important and predictable as the weather his sudden blizzard was inevitable from the moment sam softly rasped as if to the fire you dont really have to hole up all winter yknow i glared at him no i could get me a sled and name it rosebud i grumped great sport sled mm yeah brief pregnant pause then breech delivery you remember the old quarry course i shivered and not from the cold the quarry racecourse had been outlawed after our first competition event there we had had entrants and didnt finish and canny dudes found excuses not to start any idiot could add that up it was a week before we got the last car hauled out of there i reminded sam of this yup and if you remember i told you not to touch it with or without gloves sam countered but with a few ah minor changes i just might give it a try this winter he nodded in thirty inches of snow he hummed a snatch of white christmas youre weird i said wed kill somebody quoth the craven he said shut up and let me think im convinced now that sam cheated he mustve been plotting the idea for a long time he cupped his big stubby hands over one knee and smiled to himself ever do any sledding exactly once me too never got used to the lack of power on the uphill straights but whats that gottadowith sam raised a restraining hand just listen he soothed take the old quarry course and run down it instead of up build your own frame useheh hehany power plant you please add steering put a windscreen on and be a hero at the quarry i gnawed my lip a moment sounds simple i hedged but if anybody goes off the edge hell hit a nice cushy snowdrift instead of a bale of hay i figure you hay raisers might find that a welcome change choice of power train is up to you wheels chains propeller spikes ducted fan or a team of oxen if thats yer karma use any brake system that works at tech inspection skys the limit sam had something there and it was catching i tingled at the vision of sledding specials specially built racers midwifed in our garages it would be fun hell it could become a winter revolution speed week in springville sam ah would you propose it to your club i just did sams smile seemed open guileless maybe it was a leer in any event no pun intended sams recommendation was as good as a direct order twentyseven members of the club swore to build specials and oddly enough many of us did the rest including me gave help i wanted to help sam when he announced that he was building a surprise entry i shouldve saved my breath the appointed saturday dawned with a knifing chill in the clear sky snowballs flurried between early arrivals at the quarry i checked off the conical pylons fire extinguishers doctor and timing equipment wishing we had attracted some racing journalists the man from the local bugle was worse than nothing but him we had like it or not i fought the temptation to steal his hat for a pylon it was already the right shape scanning the entry list i could see our first mistake was the lack of ground rules several guys used open propellers one of em a front mounted rig that nearly blew the driver off while it was idling he got chilblains and became an instant spectator another theorist put six little tires across the rear axle to get more adhesion it worked fine on firm snow but at the technical inspection he gunned it and his wheels hungrily chewed a hole twofeet deep of course it dropped backward into the hole like a sounding whale and killed the engine and caught fire with the usual result we buried the hulk under a pile of slush and went on with tech inspection sams pickup eased up the access road with a towering tarpshrouded lump looming over its cab everything got very quiet sam had refused us even the slightest peek at his secretive entry small wonder with his usual stolid care sam flipped back the tarpaulin and revealed most of his special one of the tech inspectors screamed saving me the trouble to being with thethingbroke all the rules or rather the assumptions everybody but sam used heavy frames sand filled tubes bags of birdshot or corvette body parts to add weight sam had a gossamer birdcage frame of aluminum wrapped with quartz fiber tape for a maniacal moment i wondered if hed crocheted it everybody with wheels used fat little studded tires but sams wheel was two and a half meters high towering between a rear pair of ski runners was a single viciously cleated monstrosity of magnesium like a kulaks ferris wheel a half a meter wide it was mounted on an axle held by that spidery tubing frame nearly everybody had cart engines mounted near the wheels sam used a turbine powered by a liquid that he handled with something very like terrorand sam crimps dynamite caps with his teeth the turbine wasnt near the wheel it was inside sam had bolted it to the nonrotating axle within his hellish great wheel if i forgot the gear teeth around the inside of the wheel forgive me a simple drive gear transmitted the turbines torque to the big wheel studying the gear ratio i calculated that the monster wouldnt be very quick to be competitive the turbine would have to run at over rpm later sam told me his little aerospace fugitive didnt run well at it ran much better at thousand which partly explainsbut im getting ahead of myself the steering mechanism was a disappointment at first a forward pair of skis pivoted from a box on the frame ahead of the drivers location god only knows how any driver would dare to hunker down kneeling his fanny up to tempt those cleats and guide that flailing juggernaut over patches of glare ice on a twisty trail near sheer drops at the quarry to any sane driver that rig was a case of shove at first sight a murmur from the crowd drew me back to the course high on the trail a propellerdriven sled had just started when its brakes failed worse the driver was a firsttimer our only woman entrant wife of an inept mechanic darling daughter of a city councilman she had never learned to drive and thought it entertaining to start with something little and cute i exchanged nervous tics with our club treasurer bernie feinbaum but everything was fine until turn one it always is when i first spotted it the sled was spitting snow slowly rotating down a short straight until it was directly bassackwards and aimed off the cliff face thats when bernie crossed himself and down she came idling the prop on down slopes to build up speed a surge of backward thrust nearly stopped her at each bend she paddled around the course in just over seven minutes three more stalwarts made their runs the converted garden tractor managed to convert a patch of ice into hot water halfway down and did not finish my money was on a twintread rig until its driver saw the short straight beyond turn two and tromped on it the thing did a treadstand just long enough to barf him out crashed down ruptured an oil line that made weewee under one tread and hihoed away overland as a free and driverless spirit until it bisected a chicken house a kilometer away the guy on skis sporting five little bitty model engines with propellers on each ski was protested but he tried anyhow in deference to sam the printed rules stated the skys the limit propheticallyand the sitzmark artist was judged within his rights he made his mark all right just past turn four during all this sam completed tech inspection and only once was seen actually driving his special he had to fire it up for his braking test and by the time the crowd leaped around to see what the ruckus was it was over the great thing accelerated for meters on a thimbleful of fuel with the wail of a lost soul in a sausage grinder then reversed power in a geyser of snow but it stopped like a christmas tachymeter sam suggested that the course be walked again to be sure it was still open very few people could testify one way or the other he also asked if he could make the tour afoot and some fool said he could after all sam wasnt competing for a trophy his was to be a demonstration run like a dragster at the soapbox derby one more advantage wouldnt matter so we thought sam spent a few minutes dallying with a black box that evidently plugged into his special finally content he ambled up the gentle black slope of the hill carrying the little box i followed at a distance striding away from the start line sam pushed something on the box and tucked it under his arm i watched him pace down the course absently positioning himself for a fast approach to the first turn and then i got involved with the bugle reporter the scribbler is the sort who sniffs a story with gore potential from any distance and will end up manufacting most of the story if he feels like it i got a list of entrants he mused but durn if i recognize anybody important you might as well go home i urged this is just a local funtype event no big prizes yeah he gloomed after sam jerked his head in sams direction whos the tough old curmudgeon walking down the last mile i told him about the former rocket man pause waitaminnit dont i know that name from someplace i was casual possibly indy atlanta le mansbut sam doesnt crave publicity these days hes public property the pencil pusher snorted but he musta turned chicken in his old age hes registered as the owner of that rube goldberg waterwheel but the drivers some lunatic named botts while i fought myself to keep from feeding this guy a few knuckles a nagging doubt clung to me why wasnt sam driving had he finally lost his nerve on a measly smalltime event the reporter wheedled more information he had faucet charm and turned it on and off as it suited him you a good of friend of good of sam that pleasure is mine i said maybe you can gimme some details on his uh whatchamacallit the bugle prides itself on accuracy his look dared me to disbelieve it sure kinda hard to know where to start i hedged wondering if i could get away with wild inaccuracies i invented quickly you could mention the desmodromic valves i began i intended to uh how dyou spell it like the inventor i lied warming to the game herr desmond droemik i spelled it out and youll notice the hydrodynamic spoilers he was writing like mad come again to spoil the hydrodynamics i frowned with a wisp of scorn and the outerspace frame obviously with unlimitedslip differential and and a chromed roll center when physicists learn to chrome plate the equator or any other imaginary line then sam will be able to put chrome on a roll center which is also an imaginary line my twinge of guilt evaporated in a warm rush of fresh fantasy and of course it has computer designed steering i concluded reaching wildly enough to grasp a great truth by the tail but how could i know i shrugged otherwise sams rig is pretty ordinary he cranked his spigot on for me hey you were lotsa help fella maybe i could mention your name immortality in print gaston martin i perjured and shook his hand then i sloped off down the hill whistling an innocent medley sam had finished his trek before i reached bottom and was fiddling with something under his tarp the word was spreading that sam had lost his nerve nobody could locate botts his driver sam drove up the hill by the easy back way and parked near the start line the start official was in brief conversation with him and we watched them wrestle a ramp from the pickup to the ice presently the last serious entrant made his run it was a conventional gocart and expired conventionally in a deep snowdrift by the time the driver was exhumed from his own personal avalanche sam had his vehicle fueled and waiting at the start line sure enough sam wasnt driving a chubby stranger in a sleek black coverall was strapped in place inhumanly calm under the circumstances during his lastminute checks sam was in a lively dialogue with the official i was heartbroken that sam could accept another driver in his place and through my misting eyes it seemed that sam and the official were actually arguing i heard the muted buzz around me everybody had a theory because nobody knew anything the p a system crackled the sambott special it boomed driver r o botts then like everybody else it fell silent high above us the tiny figure of sam made an adjustment at his power unit a spurt of steam billowed like an omen in the frosty air a moment later its harsh toothloosening wail reached us and sam was fooling around near the steering i could swear the little black box was nestled there sam knelt clear of the great machine intent on the steering the official stamping and yelling with hands over his ears slipped on the ice and caught himself on the controls and engaged the drive gear and was flung into sam and botts didnt bother to hit the reverse as a matter of cold fact botts had no brakes in an instant sam was on his feet running after the special an exercise in pure loserism the machine keened its airraid siren song the big wheel churning down the slope a roostertail of snow lofting up up and away behind the gasp from the crowd mustve lowered ambient air pressure by five pounds we all expected a godawful smash at turn one but the special simply laid over at an angle and disappeared around the bend when it reappeared near turn tree a cheer went up and sam went down having blindly run through the roostertail into banked snow next came a twisty uphill stretch and judging by the noise the turbine was revving harder than ever sam abandoned his direct chase and halfclambered halffell straight down the embankment it was a maneuver that would bring him to the course just past the last turn before the timer at the finish line i wondered if he intended to trip the damned thing intimidate botts or signal himassuming they both survived that long the special was surviving but only by inches turn six was a fiendish righthander of decreasing radius bounded by the bluff on the outside and thin air on the inside botts would have to shut down his power long before he reached it but botts was not shutting down at all before our bulging eyes the machine angled toward the outside and running flatout swept up the side of the bluff that followed the curve of the course like a trick cyclist at a carnival botts and the machine shrieked around the curving wall while absolutely horizontal then shot out of the curve onto the course again still accelerating the scream of the turbine grew nearer higherpitched impossibly abrasive on the ears sam scrambled to his feet just as the special slued around the last turn now there was nothing ahead of it but a straight path and a gaggle of timing people flanking the finish line this group got one glimpse of the thundering wheel saw it gaining speed and trailing a sevenstory roostertail of snow and abandoned ship like cats on polished linoleum all that is except for the girl at the timer who had earmuffs on and wasnt looking and will always describe the passage of sams special as the sudden blizzard of seventynine sam had his windbreaker off as the thing howled past him and in one deft swoop he threw it into the blur of the great wheel it was he told me later his only hope of jamming something because there was lots more fuel to be burned and he did not own an antitank gun the wadded cloth was effective in its way for an instant the wheel skipped a beat digested the offering then belched shreds of nylon in all directions something probably a sleeve caught in a cleat and started to beat botts rhythmically the special accelerated down the straight at something over kilometers an hour sam wiped slush from his eyes and watched now helpless the pounding was too much for botts and suddenly the driver was ejected the botts trajectory was simply unbelievable if you didnt know what you were watching from the driving position of a praying moslem botts rose majestically toward heaven and began to pirouette in the air to one side tiring of this botts jerked seemed to shrug then fell in a series of falling leaf aerobatics before hitting flat in the snow flatter than we knew the special was bumping hard now every bump caused a higher bounce and as it headed toward our parked cars the wheel steadied a few inches above the surface then the errant sleeve sailed away carrying the cleat with it and the big machine arrowed upward it was airborne and more so every second the course physician sprinted after botts aspirin jouncing from his open bag the rest of us gaped at the special daring and swooping above us in a pattern that seemed vaguely familiar half a minute later it rocketed away again still higher and began the same routine it was then that sam reached us the doctor returned flintyeyed holding up a rubber suit whered you hide the body he accused sam nodded at the suit thats him i just took an old scuba suit sealed it stuck a helmet on it and pumped it up ill give it two hot patches and call you in the morning you cant run a race without a driver someone said thats what the start official kept hollering sam responded and i kept explaining that my driver was really in the programming box he squinted toward the sky but i wasnt finished programming it when the idiot hit the controls the box was set to go where i had taken it before but i didnt get a chance to program a stop the facts interlocked in my head sam your driver was a robot welcome to the machine age sam said dryly i didnt figure on my driver springing a leak though thought i had of botts strapped in pretty well the reporter huffed up looking grimly pleased what about thatthat thing up there he pointed on high where a contrail of steam followed a flashing silver streak at that height it sounded like a sexcrazed mosquito whos to say that iron windmill wont chew up a satellite or something i am sam said quietly i knew thered be a lowpressure area over the wheel but that piece of nylon created a higher differential when it bent the cleats more lift now the special will go as high as thin air will let it and then itll run out of peroxide and itll keep running the same damn course i programmed until thenonly skewed upwards the doctor a nice guy but a bit out of his element now shambled off dragging the punctured scuba suit and muttering about an autopsy with cousteau a group of rescuers dug out the girl at the finish line she was still at her post and only a little stunned under her mound of powder snow she swore that sams machine had clocked the course in seconds roughly a kilometeranhour average that figured the reporter still trying to promote fireworks drew a crowd with the old citizens arrest gambit you stand accused of reckless driving he began only i wasnt driving sam reminded him unauthorized flying of unlicensed aircraft he ployed god knows that much was true if you can prove it sam murmured glancing up ill impound it when it comes down ah it will come down it was a statement but it was a question too how very right you are sam said glancing at his chronometer and it should be out of fuel shortly good the reporter folded his arms fletcher christian on the bountys deck and glared into the sky and you should be jailed for improper construction i know a few things mister front page news sam replied name one you can embrittle something if you dont put the chrome on right i read it somewhere right sam chewed an ebony cuticle reflectively it happens he conceded i thought so snarled the reporter and you went and embrittled your roll center sam blinked shook his head as if to clear it i drew him aside and whispered how id had some sport with the bugleboy who didnt know an imaginary reference line from a breadline sam tried to hide the smile that was growing as he listened then he called to the reporter you were right guess youll have to write me up for that course workers stopped to listen and one other thing the special is your impounded property but barring wind drift id say you have a problem sam headed for his pickup truck cheerily shouting when it comes down it will be doing roughly mach two your problem is not being anywhere near where it hits when it hits he made a quick one fingered obeisance from his pickup wear it in good health the quarry was innocent of human life in two minutes flat sam never recovered the special though we found a new sinkhole near the quarry later it was too cold to dig and anyway sam and i were too busy the bugles coverage was everything wed hoped and the writer of the best sarcastic letter to the editor won a place on sams pit crew true to his resolve against serious competition sam was preparing his old nash metropolitan for that race wherebut everybodys heard about that
