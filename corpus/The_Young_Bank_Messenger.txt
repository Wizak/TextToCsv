just on the edge of the prairie in western iowa some thirty years since stood a cabin covering quite a little ground but only one story high it was humble enough as a home but not more so than the early homes of some who have become great let us enter the furniture was scanty being limited to articles of prime necessity there was a stove a table three chairs a row of shelves containing a few articles of crockery and tinware and a bed in the far corner of the room on which rested a man he had a ragged gray beard and hair and a face long and thin with preternaturally black eyes it was evident that he was sick unto death his parchmentcolored skin was indented with wrinkles from time to time he coughed so violently as to rack his slight frame and his hand thin and wrinkled as it rested on the quilt that covered him shook as with palsy it was hard to tell how old the man was he looked over seventy but there were indications that he had aged prematurely there was one other person in the room one whose appearance contrasted strongly with that of the old man it was a boy of sixteen a boy with dark brown hair ruddy cheeks hazel eyes an attractive yet firm and resolute face and an appearance of manliness and selfreliance he was well dressed and though the tenant of such an humble home would have passed muster upon the streets of a city how do you feel uncle peter he asked as he stood by the bedside i shall never feel any better ernest said the old man in a hollow voice dont say that uncle rejoined ernest in a tone of concern there seemed little to connect him in his strong attractive boyhood with the frail old man but they had lived together for five years and habit was powerful yes ernest i shall never rise from this bed isnt there anything i can get for you uncle is there is there anything left in the bottle asked peter wistfully ernest walked to the shelf that held the dishes and took from a corner a large black bottle it seemed light and might be empty he turned out the contents into a glass but there was only a tablespoonful of whisky left it is almost all gone uncle peter will you have this much yes answered the old man tremulously ernest lifted the invalid into a sitting posture and then put the glass to his mouth he drained it and gave a sigh of satisfaction it is good he said briefly i wish there were more it goes to the right spot it puts strength into me shall i go to the village and buy more i i dont know i can get back very soon very well go then like a good boy i shall have to trouble you for some money uncle peter go to the trunk you will find some there was a small hair trunk in another corner ernest knew that this was meant and he knelt down before it and lifted the lid there was a small wooden box at the lefthand side opening this ernest discovered three fivedollar gold pieces usually his uncle had gone to the trunk for money but the boy knew where it was kept there are but three gold pieces uncle he announced looking towards the bed take one of them ernest i wonder if that is all the money he has left thought ernest he rose from his kneeling position and went to the door i wont be gone long uncle he said he followed a path which led from the door in an easterly direction to the village it was over a mile away and consisted only of a few scattering houses a blacksmiths shop and a store it was to the store that ernest bent his steps it was a onestory structure as were most of the buildings in the village there was a sign over the door which read joe marks groceries and family supplies joe stood behind the counter there were two other men in the store one tall gaunt of the average western type with a broadbrimmed soft felt hat on his head and in the costume of a hunter he looked rough but honest and reliable and that was more than could be said of the other he may best be described as a tramp a man who looked averse to labor of any kind a man without a settled business or home who picked up a living as he could caring less for food than for drink and whose mottled face indicated frequent potations of whisky ernest looked at this man as he entered he didnt remember to have met him before nor was there anything to attract him in his appearance how are you ernest said joe marks cordially hows uncle peter hes pretty bad joe he thinks hes going to die not so bad as that surely yes i guess hes right hes very weak well well hes a good age how old is he i dont know he never told me hes well on to seventy im thinking but what can i do for you you may fill this bottle joe uncle peter is so weak he thinks it will put new life in him so it will ernest theres nothing like good whisky to make an old man strong or a young man for that matter it may be easy to see that joe did not believe in total abstinence i dont drink myself said ernest replying to the last part of joes remark theres nothing like whisky remarked the tramp in a hoarse voice youve drunk your share im thinking said luke robbins the tall hunter not yet returned the tramp i havent had my share yet theres lots of people that has drunk moren me why havent you drunk your share you hadnt no objections i reckon i hadnt the money said the tramp sadly ive never had much money i aint lucky if you had had more money youd maybe not be living now youd have drunk yourself to death if i ever do commit suicide thats the way id like to die said the tramp joe filled the bottle from a keg behind the counter and handed it to ernest the aroma of the whisky was diffused about the store and the tramp sniffed it in eagerly it stimulated his desire to indulge his craving for drink as ernest with the bottle in his hand prepared to leave the tramp addressed him say young feller aint you goin to shout what do you mean aint you goin to treat me and this gentleman indicating luke robbins no answered ernest shortly i dont buy it as drink but as medicine i need medicine urged the tramp with a smile i dont said the hunter dont you bother about us my boy if we want whisky we can buy it ourselves i cant whined the tramp if i had as much money as you for he had noticed that ernest had changed a gold piece id be happy but im out of luck ernest paid no attention to his words but left the store and struck the path homeward whos that boy asked the tramp its ernest ray whered he get that gold he lives with his uncle a mile from the village is his uncle rich folks think so they call him a miser is he goin to die thats what the boy says and the boyll get all his money its likely id like to be his guardian joe and luke robbins laughed youd make a pretty guardian said luke i wont get it said the tramp mournfully i never had no luck chapter ii a deathbed revelation ernest made the best of his way home for he knew his uncle would be waiting for him the old mans eyes were closed but he opened them when ernest entered the room was i gone long asked the boy i dont know i think i fell asleep shall i give you some of the drink yes he drank a small amount and it seemed to brighten him up so much that ernest said you look better uncle peter you may live some time peter shook his head no boy he replied my time has come to die i know it i would like to live for your sake you will miss me when i am gone ernest yes uncle i shall miss you very much the old man seemed gratified ernest was the only one he cared for in all the world i dont care so much about dying but i am anxious for you i wish i had money to leave you ernest but i havent much i am young and strong i can get along i hope so you will go away from here yes uncle i dont think i shall care to stay here after you are gone you will need money to take you away there is a little more in the trunk but only a little it is not quite all i have i have a hundred dollars in gold laid away for you ernest looked surprised i must tell you where it is while i still have life do you remember the oak tree on the little knoll half a mile away yes i know it dig under that tree five feet in a westerly direction there is a wooden box about half a foot below the surface of the earth theres nothing to mark the spot for it was buried a year since and the grass has grown over it hiding all traces of the earths being disturbed after i am gone go there and get the money yes uncle dont let any one see you when you visit the spot it will be best to go at night there are evildisposed men who would rob you of it if they had the chance i am sorry it is so little ernest but it seems to me a good deal to a boy it may seem so once i thought i might have a good deal more to leave you go to the trunk and search till you find a paper folded in an envelope and inscribed with your name shall i search now yes ernest went to the trunk and followed the old mans directions he found the envelope readily and held it up is that it uncle yes put it in your pocket and read it after i am gone then be guided by circumstances it may amount to something hereafter very well uncle i have told you ernest that i do not expect to live long i have a feeling that twentyfour hours from now i shall be gone oh no uncle not so soon exclaimed ernest in a shocked tone yes i think so if you have any questions to ask me while i yet have life ask for it is your right yes uncle peter i have long wished to know something about myself have i any relatives except you i am not your relative answered the old man slowly ernest was amazed are you not my uncle he asked no there is no tie of blood between us then how does it happen that we have lived together so many years i was a servant in your fathers family when your father died the care of you devolved upon me where was i born in a large town in the western part of new york state your grandfather was a man of wealth but your father incurred his displeasure by his marriage to a poor but highlyeducated and refined girl a cousin of your father took advantage of this and succeeded in alienating father and son the estate that should have descended to your father was left to the cousin is he still living yes but my father died yes he had a fever which quickly carried him off when you were five years of age was he very poor no he inherited a few thousand dollars from an aunt and upon this he lived prudently carrying on a small business besides your mother died when you were three years old your father two years later and then you took care of me yes and i have been a burden to you these many years no dont give me too much credit a sum of money was put into my hands to spend for you we lived carefully and it lasted we have been here three years and it has cost very little to live in that time the hundred dollars of which i spoke to you are the last of your inheritance you are not indebted to me for it it is rightfully yours what is my uncles name stephen ray he lives a few miles from elmira on the erie road and is he quite rich yes he is probably worth a quarter of a million dollars it is money which should have gone to your father then the wicked are sometimes prospered in this world yes but this world is not all has there been any communication with my cousin in all these years yes two years ago i wrote to him what did you write you must forgive me ernest but i saw you growing up without an education and i felt that you should have advantages which i could not give you i wrote to your cousin asking if he would pay your expenses in a preparatory school and afterward at college what did he reply go to the trunk you will find his letter there it is in the tray and addressed to me ernest found it readily may i read it he asked yes i wish you to do so it ran thus peter brant sir i have received your letter making an appeal to me in behalf of ernest ray the son of my cousin you wish me to educate him i must decline to do so his father very much incensed my revered uncle and it is not right that any of his money should go to him or his heirs he must reap the reward of his disobedience so far as i am personally concerned i should not object to doing something for the boy but i am sure that my dead uncle would not approve it besides i have myself a son to whom i propose to leave the estate intact it is my advice that you bring up the boy ernest to some humble employment perhaps have him taught some trade by which he can earn an honest living it is not at all necessary that he should receive a collegiate education you are living at the west that is well he is favorably situated for a poor boy and will have little difficulty in earning a livelihood i dont care to have him associate with my boy clarence they are cousins it is true but their lots in life will be very different i do not care to communicate with you again stephen ray ernest read this letter with flushed cheeks i hate that man he said hotly even if he is a relative uncle peter i am sorry you ever applied to him in my behalf i would not ernest if i had understood what manner of man he was i may meet him some time said ernest thoughtfully would you claim relationship never declared ernest emphatically it was he you say who prejudiced my grandfather against my poor father yes in order to secure the estate himself undoubtedly that was his object nothing could be meaner i would rather live poor all my life than get property by such means if you have no more questions to ask ernest i will try to sleep i feel drowsy do so uncle peter the old man closed his eyes and soon all was silent presently ernest himself lay down on a small bed near by when he awoke hours afterward he lit a candle and went to peters bedside the old man lay still very still with quick suspicion ernest placed his hand on his cheek it was stone cold he is dead cried ernest and a feeling of desolation came over him i am all alone now he murmured but he was not wholly alone there was a face glued against the windowpane a face that he did not see it was the tramp he had met during the day at the village store chapter iii a successful robbery the tramp stood with his face glued to the pane looking in at the boy he could not quite understand what had taken place but gathered that the old man was dead so much the better he said it will make my task easier he had hoped to find both asleep and decided to wait near the house till the boy went to bed he had made many inquiries at the store of joe marks and the answers to his questions led him to believe that old peter had a large amount of money concealed in his cabin now tom burns was a penniless tramp who had wandered from chicago on a predatory trip ready to take any property he could lay his hands on the chance that presented itself here was unusually tempting to a man of his character earlier in the evening he had reached the cabin but thought it best to defer his plans until later for ernest was awake and stirring about the room the tramp withdrew to some distance from the cabin and lay down under a tree where he was soon fast asleep curiously it was the very oak tree under which peters little hoard was concealed but this of course he did not know had he been aware that directly beneath him was a box containing a hundred dollars in gold he would have been electrified and full of joy tom burns in his long and varied career had many times slept in the open air and he had no difficulty in falling asleep now but asleep he took no note of time and when he woke up it was much later than he intended however without delay he made his way to the cabin and arrived just as ernest discovered the death of the old man whom he had supposed to be his uncle what time it was the tramp did not know for it was years since he had carried a watch but as he stood with his face glued to the windowpane he heard a clock in the cabin striking the hour of three three oclock he ejaculated well i did have a nap the boy was awake and he thought it best to wait a while why didnt i get here a little sooner he grumbled then i could have ransacked the cabin without trouble probably the old man has been dead some time he watched to see what ernest would do he wont be such a fool as to sit up with the corpse he muttered a little apprehensively that wouldnt do no good apparently ernest was of this opinion for after carefully covering up the inanimate body he lay down again on his own bed he did not fall asleep immediately for the thought that he was in the presence of death naturally affected his imagination but gradually his eyes closed and his full regular breathing gave notice that he was locked in slumber he had left the candle burning on the table by the light which it afforded the tramp could watch him and at the end of twenty minutes he felt satisfied that he could safely enter he lifted the window and passed into the room noiselessly he had one eye fixed on the sleeping boy who might suddenly awake he had taken off his shoes and left them on the grass just under the window when tom burns found himself in the room he made his way at once to the trunk which his watchful eye had already discovered thats where the old man keeps his gold likely he muttered i hope it isnt locked usually the trunk would have been fastened but the conversation which ernest had had with old peter so engrossed his mind as to make him less careful than usual tom burns therefore had no difficulty in lifting the lid with eager fingers he explored the contents and was not long in discovering the box which contained the two gold coins the discovery pleased and yet disappointed him only ten dollars he muttered there ought to have been a pile of these yellow boys perhaps there are more somewhere meanwhile he slipped the two coins into his vest pocket it was not much but it was more than he had had in his possession for months he continued his search but failed to discover any more money he felt indignant it seemed to him that he was badly used that a miser should have but a paltry ten dollars in his trunk was very discreditable he must have some more somewhere burns reflected it occurred to him that there might be hoards hidden under the floor or in the immediate neighborhood of the cabin but it was night and there would be no profit in pursuing the search now tomorrow he reflected the boy will be off making preparations for buryin the old man and then i can make another visit he closed the lid of the trunk and with a general glance to see if there was anything more worth taking he rose to his feet and prepared to leave the room just at this moment ernest who was probably dreaming of the old man spoke in his sleep uncle peter he murmured the tramp stood still apprehensive that ernest would open his eyes and detect his presence but the boy did not speak again i had better get soliloquized burns he got out of the window quietly but as the boy stirred again he hurried away with out stopping to shut it when a little after seven oclock ernest woke up the sun was streaming in at the open window and the cool air entered with it how came the window up thought ernest wondering i am sure i didnt leave it open last night there was nothing else to indicate that the cabin had been entered but the more ernest thought it over the more convinced he was that there had been a visitor what could have been his motive with sudden suspicion he went to the trunk and opened it it was evident that things had been disturbed his eyes sought out the box that contained the gold pieces he opened it and found that he had been robbed who could have done it he asked himself he could not think of any one he was acquainted with every one in the little village and he knew none that would be capable of theft he never thought of the illlooking tramp whom he had met in joe marks store ten dollars was a considerable loss to him for he had estimated that it would defray the expenses of old peters interment it was not so bad as it might have been however for the hundred dollars of which peter had told him were still safe when i get that i must be careful he said to himself though his rest had been disturbed he felt ready to get up there was work for him to do he must arrange for the burial of the old man with whom he had lived so long the only friend he felt he could claim ernest rose and after dressing himself made a frugal breakfast he looked sadly at peter death was to him something new and strange for he did not remember ever having seen a dead man before he must get help and with that object in view he went to the village and sought the store of joe marks what brings you out so early my lad asked joe matter enough joe my uncle is dead he still called him uncle though he knew now that peter was no kin to him old peter dead ejaculated marks when did he die some time during the night i wish youd help me for i dont know what to do so i will boy well stand by you wont we luke this was said as luke robbins entered the store to be sure we will ernest we all like you oh i forgot to say continued ernest the cabin was entered last night and some money taken chapter iv alone in the world joe marks and luke robbins looked at each other in amazement your cabin entered exclaimed joe what do you say to that luke i did not know there were any thieves around here answered luke what was taken an old trunk was opened i carelessly left it unlocked and two fivedollar gold pieces were stolen out of it at any rate i couldnt find them this morning two fivedollar gold pieces said joe quickly then i know who took them what do you mean joe said luke out with it you know that tramp who was here yesterday luke yes he came round an hour ago just after i had opened and called for a glass of whisky where is your money i asked ive got plenty you neednt be afraid he said then i called upon him to show it and he pulled out a fivedollar gold piece of course i was surprised where did you get it i asked suspiciously yesterday you said you had no money i had that he answered but i didnt want to spend it you see it was a gift from my dyin mother and i wanted to keep it for her sake with that he rolled up his eyes and looked sanctimonious then i asked him how it happened that he was ready to spend it now what did he say he said that he was so parched with thirst that he felt obliged to do it did you take his money no i was short of change you see i changed a gold piece for the boy yesterday besides i wasnt sure the piece was good seeing who offered it i thought it might be bogus then he didnt get his whisky no he went away disappointed i dont doubt ernest that the gold piece was one of yours how did the fellow get in through the window i found it open when i woke up you must have slept sound i did i slept an hour later than i generally do was anything else taken not that i could discover do you mean to say that your uncle had but ten dollars asked joe incredulously it was all he had in the trunk i always thought him a rich man he was not said ernest quietly was that all the money he had he had the reputation of being a miser with hoards of gold hidden in or near the cabin i know of one sum of money he had concealed but it was not a large amount he told me about it before he died im glad you wont be left penniless lad did he own the cabin nobody owned it said joe marks it was built years ago by a man who suddenly left it and went away nobody knew where it wasnt worth much and no one ever took the trouble to claim it when your uncle came here he found it empty and took possession of it and there he has lived ever since so youll have some money ernest only a hundred dollars what will you do what are your plans i dont know i havent had time to think i might find a place for you in the store we wouldnt like to have you go away thank you joe you are very kind but theres no chance for me around here ill take the money and go somewhere but first i must see uncle peter buried will you help me to be sure we will was he your only relation he was not my relation at all why you have always called him uncle i supposed him to be my uncle but yesterday he told me that he was only a servant in my fathers family and that on my fathers death he was placed in charge of me i reckon thats so you didnt favor the old man at all you look as if you came from better stock all the same i shall miss him said ernest sadly he was a good friend to me peter was did he tell you whether you had any kin yes i have a cousin of my fathers living in new york state he is a rich man he inherited the property that ought to have gone to my father how did that happen he prejudiced my grandfather against my father and so the estate was willed to him the mean scoundrel exclaimed luke indignantly id like to have him in my hands for a few minutes id give him a lesson i should pity him if ever you got hold of him luke said joe marks but we must consider what we can do for the boy i wish we could get hold of that thief of a tramp probably we shall hell find his way back here sooner or later but the burial of peter brant was the first consideration no undertaker was called for in that small settlement one would not have been supported the ceremonies of death were few and simple a rude wooden box was put together and peter was placed in it dressed as he was at the time of his death there was an itinerant minister who preached in the village once in four weeks but he was away now and so there could be no religious ceremony beyond reading a chapter from the new testament joe marks who had received a decent education officiated as reader then the interment took place in the forenoon of the second day peters body was laid away and ernest was left practically alone in the world meanwhile some account must be given of tom burns the tramp when he found it impossible to obtain whisky with the gold he had stolen he felt very despondent his throat was parched and his craving became intolerable he felt that he had been decidedly illused what was the use of money unless it could be converted into what his soul desired but there was no way of changing the coin except at the store of joe marks to ask any of the villagers would only have excited surprise and suspicion besides the tramp felt sure that ernest would soon discover that he had been robbed he would naturally be suspected especially as joe marks had knowledge of a gold piece being in his possession there was a small settlement about five miles off called daneboro it was probably the nearest place where he could get a glass of whisky he must walk there it was not a pleasant prospect for the tramp was lazy and not fond of walking though he had been compelled to do a good deal of it still it seemed to be a necessity and when he left the store of joe marks he set out for daneboro thirst was not the only trouble with tom burns he had not eaten anything for about twentyfour hours and his neglected stomach rebelled he tightened a girdle about his waist and walked on in great discomfort he had perhaps gone two miles when he came to a cabin similar in appearance to that of old peter brant a woman stood in the doorway my good lady said tom putting on a pitiful expression i am a very unfortunate man are you said the woman scanning him critically you look like a tramp i do madam yet i was once a thriving merchant you dont look like it i dont i acknowledge it how did you lose your property if you ever had any by signin notes for my brother it swept off all my possessions then i pity you thats the way my man lost five hundred dollars nearly all he had what can i do for you madam i am hungry very hungry set right down on the settle and ill give you whats left of our breakfast tom burns obeyed with alacrity a plate of cold bacon a cold potato and some corn bread were placed before him and he ate them almost voraciously there had been times in his life when he would have turned up his nose at such fare but not now my good lady he said you have saved my life well you must a been hungry said the woman a man thatll eat cold vittles especially cold potato aint shammin i wish i had money to offer you oh never mind that youre welcome can i do anything more for you i feel sick and sometimes though i am a temperance man i take whisky for my health if you had just a sup well we havent and if we had i wouldnt give you any you misjudge me madam you must not think i am a drinker its no matter what i think you cant get any whisky here at daneboro tom fared better he changed his gold piece drank a pint of whisky and the next day retraced his steps to old peters cabin he felt satisfied that somewhere near the cabin there were treasures concealed and he meant to secure them chapter v the tramp turns up again when peter brant was laid away under a tree not far from the cabin where he had ended his days ernest felt that he was at liberty to begin the new life that lay before him despite the natural sadness which he felt at parting with his old friend he looked forward not without pleasant anticipations to the future and what it might have in store for him oak forks had few attractions for him time had often dragged wearily with him he had a literary taste but could not get hold of books peter brant had about a dozen volumes none of which he had read himself but ernest had read them over and over again none of the neighbors owned any books occasionally a newspaper found its way into the settlement and this when it came into ernests hands was devoured advertisements and all how then was his time passed partly in hunting partly in fishing for there was a small river two miles away but one could not fish or hunt all the time he had often felt a vague yearning to go to chicago or new york or anywhere where there would be a broader field and large opportunities and he had broached the subject to peter i cant afford to go ernest the old man would reply i must live on the little i have for i am too old to work but i am young i can work the boy would answer a boy like you couldnt earn much wait till i am dead and then you can go where you like this would always close the discussion for ernest did not like to consider such a contingency peter represented his world for he had no one to cling to except the man whom he supposed to be his uncle now however the time had come when he could go forth and enter upon a career accordingly he declined joe marks offer to take him into the store he understood very well that it was only meant in kindness and that he was not really needed you dont need me joe he said you are very kind but there must be real work for me somewhere well my lad i wont stand in your way but ive known you a long time and i shall hate to lose sight of you ill come back some day joe that is if i am prosperous and can if you are not prosperous if you fall sick and need a home and a friend come back then dont forget your old friend joe marks i wont joe said ernest heartily youve got another friend here ernest added luke robbins im a poor man and my friendship isnt worth much but you have it all the same ernest grasped the hands of both he felt that each was a friend worth having you may be sure that i wont forget either of you he said when do you expect to go ernest and where asked joe marks i shall get away tomorrow i think but where i shall go i cant tell yet do you need any money no my uncle left me some ernest had not yet secured the gold but he knew exactly where it was and now that all his business was ended he felt that it was time to possess himself of it accordingly he took a spade from the house and bent his steps in the direction of the old oak tree he went alone for he thought it best not to take anyone into his confidence indeed the only persons whom he would have thought of trusting were joe marks and luke robbins and they were both employed joe in his store and luke on a hunting expedition arrived at the tree ernest measured off five feet in the direction mentioned by peter and began to dig it did not take him long to reach the box for it was only a foot beneath the surface of the ground it proved to be a cigarbox for peter was fond of smoking though he usually smoked a pipe as being more economical ernest lifted the lid and saw a small roll enclosed in brown wrappingpaper which on being removed revealed twenty fivedollar gold pieces he regarded them with satisfaction for they afforded him the means of leaving oak forks and going out into the great world which he had such a curiosity to enter but ernest was not the only one who regarded the gold pieces with satisfaction hidden behind a tree only a few feet away was a person with whom we are already acquainted it was tom burns the tramp and vagabond he too was out in search of gold he had come from daneboro and was prowling round the neighborhood searching for old peters hidden treasure he had deliberated as to whether the cabin or the fields was the more likely place to have been selected he had nothing in particular to guide him he did not however venture to approach the house just yet as it would probably be occupied by ernest i wish i knowed where the old man hid his boodle soliloquized tom i cant dig all over in fact digging was not in toms line it was too much like work and if there was anything to which tom was bitterly opposed it was work of any kind the boy must know likely the old man told him he finally concluded ill watch the boy he feared he might be too late had it been his own case he would have searched for the gold immediately after the funeral he naturally supposed that ernest would do the same he therefore lost no time in prowling around the cabin with the especial object of watching ernests movements he was especially favored as he thought when from a distance he saw ernest leaving the cabin with the spade in his hand the tramps heart was filled with joy he is going to dig for the treasure he said ill keep him in sight tom burns had no difficulty in doing this for ernest bent his steps in his direction i hope he wont discover me thought burns at any rate not till i find out where hes going to dig all things seemed to favor the tramp ernest stopped when he came to the oak tree and it was evident this was the spot of which he was in search why thats where i was lying the other night thought burns if i had only knowed why the gold was right under me all the time if id found it then i should have gone off with it before this time how ever it isnt too late now he watched with subdued eagerness while ernest was digging he no longer doubted that this was the place where the gold was hidden ernest could have no other object in digging in this place i wonder how much there is thought burns there ought to be as much as a thousand dollars perhaps theres two or three but even if there is only a thousand it will set me on my feet ill soon get out of this neighborhood ill go to chicago or new york and ill live in clover ill make up for lost time ive been a vagabond long enough ill buy some new clothes and set up as a respectable man when ernest found the roll of coins and taking them out put them in his pocket he was not disappointed for he knew what to expect but tom burns was in dismay only a hundred dollars he soliloquized whats a hundred dollars the old man ought to be ashamed of himself why it isnt respectable however one thing was certain a hundred dollars was better than nothing it would take him to chicago and enable him to live in comfort for a while besides he might multiply it many times at the gaming table for tom burns had been a gambler in his day he certainly did not propose to disdain the sum which fortune had placed in his way simply because it was so small oh no tom burns was not that sort of a man ernest put the gold pieces in his pocket and turned to go back to the cabin when a voice reached him look here boy ill trouble you to hand over that money chapter vi a critical situation ernest turned and regarded the tramp in amazement what do you mean he demanded i want that money you just dug up replied tom burns boldly instantly ernest comprehended his danger he was a stout boy but the tramp was a large man weighing probably fifty pounds more than himself moreover he looked desperate and reckless the boy felt that in strength he was no match for the thief who confronted him yet he could not bear the thought of allowing himself to be robbed left penniless how could he carry out the plans which he had in view he tried to gain time do you want to rob me he asked i have just as much right to that money as you said the tramp how do you make that out the man who put it there owed me money do you think i am a fool to believe that ridiculous story youd better be careful how you talk said burns menacingly what i say i mean then all i can say is that you have told a falsehood you are the man i suppose who entered our cabin at night and stole money out of a trunk i dont know anything about your trunk said burns mendaciously but i have no time to talk i want that money ernest looked about him hoping to see some one to whom he could appeal for help but no one appeared in sight next he looked at the tramp to note if he were armed to his relief burns did not appear to have any weapon with him rapidly he determined not to give up the money without a struggle i wont give up the money to a thief he said boldly as he spoke he turned and ran as fast as he was able tom burns uttered an execration and prepared to pursue him winged with fear of losing his gold ernest flew rather than ran not heeding the direction he was taking the tramp accepted the challenge and put forth his utmost speed in the hope of overtaking him youll pay for this boy he growled just let me catch you but ernest did not mean to be caught being a fast runner for a boy of his size he bade fair to outdistance his pursuer but directly in his path was an excavation of considerable size and depth ernest paused on the brink to consider whether to descend the sloping sides or to go round it the delay was fatal the tramp saw his advantage and pushing forward seized him by the collar ive caught you he cried triumphantly now give me the money there was a brief struggle but a boy even a strong boy was no match for a man taller and heavier than himself the gold pieces were snatched from him and the tramp releasing his hold was about to make off in triumph when he found himself seized in turn why you contemptible thief exclaimed luke robbins for it was he whose opportune coming had saved ernest from being plundered are you trying to rob the boy he seized the tramp by the collar forced him to give up the gold he had just snatched from ernest and flung him on his back the tramps surprise deepened to dismay when looking up he saw the stalwart hunter with stern face looking down upon him it was my money he whined your money you owdacious liar dont tell me that or ill treat you worse but it was i had hidden it under a tree i came along just as the boy dug it up i told him to give it to me for it was mine but he wouldnt and then i chased him whats the truth of the matter ernest asked luke it was money that peter brant had hidden away he told me on his deathbed where to look for it i thought it was peters i had just dug it up and put it in my pocket when this man came along he ordered me to give it him did he say he hid it there no he said that peter owed him money and he wanted it you appear to be a very ingenious liar remarked luke turning to the tramp which of these stories do you want me to believe i hid it there said the tramp doggedly then why did you tell the boy that peter owed you money because i didnt think he would believe that i hid it you are right there he dont believe it nor do i one thing more were you the man that broke into his cabin and stole two gold pieces from his trunk no i dont know anything about it of course you would deny it all the same i have no doubt that you were the man if i had done it he would have seen me that wont go down he was asleep ernest what shall i do with this fellow shall i shoot him and luke robbins pulled out a revolver which he handled in a significant way dont shoot spare my life mr robbins cried the tramp in great alarm humph i dont see the good your life is of no value to the world let him go luke said ernest but tell him to clear out of this neighborhood it is treating him too well still i will do as you say hark you fellow what is your name tom burns you are a disgrace to the name of burns if i spare your life will you leave this neighborhood and never come back yes yes answered the tramp earnestly youd better keep that promise if i ever catch sight of you again ill shoot with out asking you any questions now get tom burns got up and started away with celerity he thought it wise to put as great a distance as possible between himself and the tall and stalwart hunter fearing that he would repent his leniency and end his life by a stray bullet ill scare him a little said luke he fired after the fugitive taking care not to hit him however tom burns heard the bullet whistling by his head and with a cry of terror increased his speed till he reached a place where he felt secure then sinking down on the ground he uttered an ejaculation of relief that is a terrible man he panted hed as soon take my life as not i wont get in his way again if i can help it luke robbins laughed that is my parting message he said well ernest where do you want to go what are your plans i dont know answered ernest gravely i am not sure that i have any plans i feel upset completely sit down here and ill talk to you he pointed to a little ridge which would serve as a seat the two sat down together now how much money have you got a hundred dollars it isnt much is that all your uncle left i think so he said nothing about having more it isnt much to begin the world with i wish for your sake boy that i had some to give you but i never knew how to get together money i guess it will do luke i have health and strength i think i can make my way but you have no trade have you no ernest youve got me there i am only a hunter but i dont make much of a living i dont recommend you to follow in my steps id like to keep you with me but it wouldnt pay you one thing is certain luke i must get away from here there is nothing i can do in oak forks where do you want to go lad i dont know i might go eastward to chicago or new york or i might go west to california have you ever been to either place luke no lad but if i had my choice id go westward ive heard fine stories of california i think i should like to see that land and push on to the pacific ocean why dont you go stop a minute let me think the hunter assumed a thoughtful look he remained silent for five minutes then he said as if to himself why not ernest still kept silence but his eyes were fixed upon the face of the hunter finally luke looked up how do you want to go lad he asked do you want to go by the railroad or are you in for a tramp over the mountains and plains that depends on whether i am to go alone or not if i go alone i shall prefer to go by rail are you in for a long tramp with me asked luke his face glowing with newborn enthusiasm i will go anywhere with you luke then it is agreed we will start tomorrow chapter vii on the road nothing could have pleased ernest better than to travel with the companionship of luke robbins he felt that he should be safe with the sturdy hunter who was strong resolute and reliable true he was not a man who had succeeded as men reckon success he had lived comfortably but it had never occurred to him to lay up money nor indeed had he had any opportunity to do so he mentioned this as an objection to the trip which he had himself proposed my lad he said i am afraid i cant go with you after all why not luke because youre rich compared with me i have but a hundred dollars and i well lad im ashamed to say so but i have only fifteen well share and share alike luke no lad luke robbins is too proud to live upon a boy i reckon id better stay at home but i want you to go and take care of me luke how can i travel alone luke brightened up that puts a different face on it ernest if you think you need me ill go i do need you then go i will but one thing is understood i wont take any of your money there wont be any trouble on that score luke so the two prepared for their trip ernest with lukes help purchased an outfit and on the morning of the third day the two started out together neither having a very definite idea where they were going except that their course was westward luke knew very little of the states and territories that lay between oak forks and the pacific coast ernest whose education was decidedly superior to his companions was able to give him some information so they plodded on making slow progress but enjoying the unconventional life and the scenery on the way they were in no hurry they stopped to hunt and fish and when the weather was unfavorable they stayed overnight at some wayside cabin when the nights were fine they camped out and enjoyed a sound rest under the open canopy of heaven part of their way led through woods and over prairies but here and there they came to a thriving village there was little occasion to spend money but still they were compelled to use some one day it was some weeks from the time when they started luke turned to ernest with a sober face ernest he said i think youll have to leave me at the next poorhouse why luke because my money is nearly all gone i started with fifteen dollars now i have but one but i have plenty left that doesnt help me i want to share it with you luke dont you remember what i said when we set out lad what was it that i would not touch a dollar of your money then do you mean to leave me alone luke pleaded ernest reproachfully you are a boy and i am a man im forty years old ernest is it right that i should live on a boy less than half my age ernest looked at him in perplexity is there no way of getting more money he asked if we were in california now and at the mines i might make shift to fill my purse but there are no mines hereabouts let us keep on and something may turn up when this conversation took place they were approaching emmonsville a thriving town in nebraska as they walked through the principal street it was clear that something had happened which had created general excitement groups of people were talking earnestly and their faces wore a perturbed and anxious look whats the matter asked luke addressing a welltodo appearing man havent you heard of the bank robbery over at lees falls no two men fully armed rode up to the door and dismounting entered the bank one stepped up to the window of the paying teller and covering him with his revolver demanded five thousand dollars at the same time the other stood in the doorway also with a loaded revolver why didnt the teller shoot him down asked luke my friend bank officers are not provided with loaded revolvers when on duty besides the ruffian had the drop on him well asked luke what could the teller do life is more than money and he had no alternative the fellow got the money did he get away with it yes they both mounted their horses and rode off no one daring to interfere each held his revolver in readiness to shoot the first man that barred his way where did you say this happened at lees falls is it near at hand it is fifteen miles away but why should that robbery create excitement here because we have a bank here and we are expecting a visit from the same parties who are they they are supposed to be the fox brothers two of the most notorious criminals in the west numberless stories are told of their bold robberies both from individuals and from banks how long have these fellows been preying upon the community we have heard of them hereabouts for three years it is said they came from missouri is there no one brave enough or bold enough to interfere with them more than one has tried it but no one has succeeded twice they were captured by a posse of men but in each case they broke jail before it was time for the trial it seems to me you havent many men of spirit in nebraska perhaps you think you would be a match for them said the citizen in a sarcastic tone luke robbins smiled and handled his revolver in a significant way if you think you can kill or capture them stranger theres a chance to make a good sum of money how is that a thousand dollars is offered for either dead or alive a thousand dollars repeated luke his face glowing with excitement is that straight it will be paid cheerfully you can bet on that who offers it the governor of the state luke robbins became thoughtful and remained silent did you hear that lad he asked when he and ernest were alone yes luke a thousand dollars would do us a great deal of good that is true luke but it would be as much as your life is worth to hunt the rascals dont try to make a coward of me ernest i couldnt do that luke i only want you to be prudent listen lad i want that thousand dollars and im going to make a try for it come along with me where are you going to the bank im going to have a talk with the officers and then ill decide what to do chapter viii the quaker detective at the emmonsville bank they were on their guard the expectation of a visit from the fox brothers caused anxiety and apprehension the evil reputation of these men and their desperate character made them formidable when luke robbins entered the place he was regarded with suspicion his huntingcostume was not unlike that of a bandit but the fact that he had a young companion tended to disarm suspicion no one could suspect ernest of complicity with outlaws and the fox brothers had never been known to carry a boy with them luke was unused to banks so far as he knew he had never entered one before he looked around him in uncertainty and finally approached the window of the receiving teller are you the boss of this institution he asked the teller smiled no he said perhaps you want to see the president i guess hes the man if you will give me a hint of the nature of your business i will speak to him i hear youre expectin a visit from the fox brothers have you anything to do with them asked the teller with some suspicion i want to have something to do with them returned luke i dont understand you then ill tell you what i mean i hear theres a big reward out for their capture a thousand dollars i want that thousand dollars and i want it bad i shall be very glad if you become entitled to it any one who will rid the state of either of these notorious outlaws will richly deserve it thats the business i came about now can i see the president if thats what you call him wait a minute and i will find out the teller went to an inner room and returned with a stout grayheaded man of about fifty he looked curiously at luke through the window then as if reassured he smiled i understand you want to see me he said yes about the fox brothers youre right there squire go to the last door and i will admit you luke robbins did as directed and soon found himself in the office of the president of the bank you are anxious to secure the reward offered for the capture of these outlaws i believe thats straight why do you come to me then because a man told me you expected a visit from them that is not quite exact i dont expect a visit but i am afraid they may take it into their heads to call here suppose they do a shade of anxiety appeared upon the face of the president we should try to foil their plans he answered wouldnt you like to have me on hand when they come the president looked over luke robbins carefully he was impressed by his bold resolute air and muscular figure evidently he would be a dangerous man to meet you are a strong resolute fellow i judge he said thoughtfully try me and see you would not be afraid to meet these villains singlehanded i never saw the man yet that i was afraid to meet so far so good but it is not so much strength that is needed as quickness a weak man is more than a match for a strong one if he gets the drop on him thats so but i reckon itll take a smart man to get the drop on me what have you to propose i suppose you have formed some plan i would like to stay around the bank and be on the watch for these fellows remain here and i will consult with the cashier five minutes later the president rejoined his visitor i have no objection to securing your services he said if it can be done without exciting suspicion in your present dress your mission would at once be guessed and the outlaws would be on their guard have you any objection to changing your appearance not a particle all i want is to get a lick at them outlaws then i think we shall have to make you a little less formidable have you any objections to becoming a quaker luke robbins laughed what one of those broadbrimmed fellows he said yes will i look the character dress will accomplish a good deal i will tell you what put the idea into my head we used to employ as janitor an old quaker a good honest reliable man he was about your build a year since he died but we have hanging up in my office the suit he was accustomed to wear put it on and it will make a complete change in your appearance your face will hardly correspond to your dress but those who see the garb wont look any further thats all right boss i dont care how you dress me up but what will i do i think it will be well for you to keep near the bank watching carefully all who approach you never saw the fox brothers i presume i never had that pleasure most people dont regard it as a pleasure i will give you some description of them which may help you to identify them one is a tall man very nearly as tall as yourself the other is at least three inches shorter both have dark hair which they wear long they have a swaggering walk and look their real characters i dont think itll be hard to spot them they generally ride on horseback dont they generally but not always they rode into lees falls and up to the bank entrance on horseback perhaps for that reason they may appear in different guise here you havent any pictures of them have you the president laughed no one was ever bold enough to invite them into a photographers to have their pictures taken he said i see well i think i shall know them perhaps not they often adopt disguises they wont come as quakers that is hardly likely i can give you one help however they may be dressed their eyes will betray them they have flashing black ones and sharp aquiline noses ill know them said luke confidently i observe that you have a boy with you yes is it your son no i wish he were id be proud to have such a son as that perhaps we can use him the bank messenger a young man is sick and he can take his place temporarily is there any pay for such work yes but it is small we will give him ten dollars a week of course he must be honest and trustworthy ill stake my life on that boy boss said luke warmly his appearance is in his favor will you call him ernest was waiting in the doorway he was anxious to learn the result of lukes interview with the president of the bank he had thought it very doubtful whether his proposal would be looked upon favorably but hoped some good might come of it the boss wants to see you announced luke all right i will follow you what luck are you meeting with luke good ive hired out to the bank as a quaker detective ernest stared at his companion in astonishment he thought it was a joke when he came into the presence of the president the latter said i understand from your friend here that you would like employment i should answered ernest promptly the post of bank messenger is temporarily vacant would you like it yes sir if you think i can fill it you are rather young for the place but i think you will fill it satisfactorily we will instruct you in the duties very well sir i accept it with thanks of course it is necessary that you should be honest and reliable but upon those points i have no doubt your face speaks for you thank you sir when do you wish me to begin my duties tomorrow i suppose you are not as yet provided with a boardingplace you can get settled today and report at the bank tomorrow morning at nine wait here a minute ernest said luke i will join you at once when luke emerged from the presidents room he was attired in the quaker costume of his predecessor ernest stared at him for a moment then burst into a loud laugh why does thee laugh asked luke mildly this sent ernest into a second convulsion do i look like a man of peace asked luke yes shall you live up to the character until i see the fox brothers then the lamb will become a lion chapter ix an armed escort luke robbins entered at once upon his duties as janitor of the emmonsville bank it was rather difficult however to supply him with employment enough to account for his being in constant attendance he was provided with a broom and in the morning swept the bank sometimes he washed the windows at other times he sat on a bench in the rear of the bank ready for any call upon his services so far as garb went he resembled a quaker but his brown face and sharp eyes hardly harmonized with his assumed character still less did the revolver which he carried in an inside pocket several days passed and though luke kept a sharp lookout for the fox brothers he did not catch a glimpse of anyone who suggested or resembled them then one morning luke went to the bank as usual and put on his quaker garb about eleven oclock an elderly man appeared and presented a check for five hundred dollars the money was paid him and then he lingered a moment ill at ease i dont like to have so much money about me he said in a tone that betrayed anxiety no doubt you will find plenty who would be willing to relieve you of it rejoined the paying teller with a smile thats what i am afraid of they do say that the fox brothers have been seen not far away is it absolutely necessary that you should have the money in your possession you could leave it in the bank or most of it i shall want to use some of it tomorrow and i live ten miles away in claremont how are you going back i have a buggy outside the road to claremont is rather lonely i believe yes why dont you get some one to go with you i dont know any one i could get i can find you a companion but he would want to be paid ill pay him if hell see me through all right i have the very man for you here luke luke robbins heard the call and approached the farmer looked at him doubtfully a quaker he said in a disappointed tone he is no more a quaker than you are he is a detective and very anxious to meet either of the fox brothers the farmer brightened up hes the man im after then a bargain was struck between luke and ezekiel mason whereby the farmer promised to pay him five dollars to accompany him home and remain over night at the farmhouse until he had disposed of the money the way he intended luke was glad to accept the proposal it promised variety and possibly adventure the farmer climbed into the buggy and the quaker detective following took a seat by his side after they had driven some time they reached a part of the road where for a clear mile in advance there was not a house or building of any kind to be seen this is the place i was most afraid of said the farmer yes it seems to be lonely i wish one of the fox brothers would happen along why asked the farmer in a tone of alarm because i would like to tackle him why are you so anxious to tackle him i cannot understand then ill tell you my honest friend there is a reward of a thousand dollars offered for the capture of one of these famous outlaws dead or alive ezekiel mason shrugged his shoulders id rather earn the money some other way he said you are only a peaceful farmer while i am a fighting quaker responded luke as he spoke he looked up the road and his glance fell upon a short compactly built man in a gray suit who was walking towards them he seemed a quiet commonplace person but there was something about him that attracted lukes attention do you know that man he asked abruptly no answered mason after a rapid glance are the fox brothers tall men asked luke one only the other is about the size of the man who is approaching luke did not reply but examined still more critically the advancing pedestrian if this should be one of the foxes he began do you think it is asked the farmer in a terrified tone i cant tell if it proves to be do exactly as i tell you yes replied the farmer now thoroughly alarmed by this time the newcomer was but twenty feet distant though his appearance and dress were commonplace his eyes as they could see were dark and glittering he made a halt friends he said can you oblige me with the time the farmer was about to produce his big oldfashioned silver watch when luke nudged him sharply leave him to me he whispered in a tone audible only to the farmer thee has asked the wrong party he said aloud we dont carry watches the pedestrian regarded him with contempt whoever he might be he looked upon a quaker as a mild inoffensive person hardly deserving the name of man i didnt speak to you he said scornfully chapter x the astonished outlaw the pedestrians next move was a bold one i am tired he said give me a ride will thee excuse us said the quaker meekly oh shut up cried the assumed pedestrian quakers should be seen and not heard then to the farmer i am tired let me into your carriage there is no room said the farmer nervously then tell the quaker to get out and i will take his place ezekiel mason was by no means a brave man and he did not know what to say to this impudent proposal he looked appealingly at luke i will accommodate the gentleman said the latter meekly with the words he rose from his seat and jumped to the ground shall i assist thee he asked the stranger in a mild voice no i am quite capable of getting into the carriage without help from a meddlesome quaker indeed thee does me injustice the stranger did not immediately get into the buggy i dont care to ride after all he said coolly just hand me your money you old clodhopper the worst had come the new arrival was evidently one of the fox brothers after all indeed i have no money said the terrified farmer this was true for he had put the wallet containing the five hundred dollars into the hands of luke you lie you have just come from the emmonsville bank where you drew a large amount at this proof of knowledge on the part of the outlaw the farmer was almost paralyzed it appeared to him that the robber must be supernaturally gifted i havent got it now he said you lie cried the outlaw sternly come down here and give up the money or ill shoot you you can search me said mason desperately come down then thee is very unkind observed luke shut up you meddlesome quaker it none of your business thee had better come down and let the man search thee said luke to the farmer ezekiel mason had been waiting for a hint from luke in whom he recognized a master spirit his only hope was in his companion art thee mr fox asked luke in a tone of mild inquiry ill let you know who i am was the swaggering reply though he was but one man opposed to two he had no fears the farmer was evidently cowed and terrified while the quaker seemed though large to be peaceable and harmless but in his judgment of luke the outlaw was very much at fault when threatening the farmer he had covered him with his revolver but as he was preparing to leave the buggy he carelessly lowered it luke who was aching to attack him noticed this while fox for it was one of the notorious brothers was standing in careless security the quaker sprang upon him like a panther upon his prey he knocked the revolver from his hand with one powerful blow felled him to the ground and placed his foot upon his prostrate form never perhaps in a career crowded with exciting adventures had the outlaw been so thoroughly surprised what the mischief does this mean he ejaculated struggling to rise it means that thee has mistaken thy man answered luke coolly let me go or ill kill you shrieked the outlaw fiercely if you try to get up ill put a bullet through your head replied luke pointing at him with his own revolver in his excitement he had dropped his quaker speech and this the outlaw noted are you a quaker he asked abruptly no more than you are answered luke farmer bring out the rope ezekiel mason from the bottom of the buggy produced a long and stout piece of clothesline what do you mean to do inquired the outlaw uneasily you will see soon enough no dont try to get up as you value your life now tie him mason while i keep him covered with the revolver illustration now tie him mason while i keep him covered with the revolver weve had enough of this said the outlaw sullenly let me go and ill do you no harm i dont mean that you shall my honest friend but if you persist in this outrage i swear that you will be a dead man within thirty days be careful how you talk or you may be a dead man within thirty minutes answered luke while the outlaw was covered by lukes revolver farmer mason though his tremulous hands showed that he was nervous managed to tie him securely fox began to under stand the sort of man with whom he was dealing and remained silent but his brain was busy trying to devise some method of escape at length the dangerous prisoner was securely tied what shall we do with him asked ezekiel wheres the nearest prison at crampton how far away twelve miles in what direction it is four miles beyond claremont answered the farmer where you live yes then we will go there first but how shall we carry this gentleman asked the farmer who could not get over a feeling of deference for the celebrated outlaw illustration now tie him mason while i keep him covered with the revolver well put him into the back part of the buggy by the united efforts of both the outlaw like a trussed fowl was deposited bodily in the rear of the carriage where he lay in a most uncomfortable position jolted and shaken whenever the road was rough or uneven it was a humiliating position and he felt it youll repent this outrage he said fiercely doesnt thee like it asked luke relapsing into his quaker dialect curse you and your quaker lingo retorted fox his black eyes sparkling vindictively it wouldnt do thee any harm to turn quaker thyself suggested luke ill be bruised to death before the ride is over growled the outlaw there is one way of saving you the discomfort of the ride what is that i might shoot you through the head as the reward is the same whether i deliver you alive or dead i have almost determined to do it the outlaw was made still more uncomfortable by these words he had wholly misunderstood luke at first and the revelation of his real character had impressed him not only with respect but with fear he did not know of what this pseudo quaker might be capable he longed in some way to get out of his power force was impracticable and he resolved to resort to finesse look here my friend he began so you regard me as a friend thank you brother fox i wont forget it oh bother your nonsense i suppose you are after the thousand dollars offered for my apprehension you have guessed right the first time i am not a rich man and i dont mind telling you that a thousand dollars will be particularly acceptable just about now so i supposed you dont feel particularly unfriendly to me oh no i might under different circumstances come to love you like a brother or join my band well no i draw the line there as a quaker i could not consistently join a band of robbers who are you asked fox abruptly you werent raised around here no where then i come from iowa what is your name my friend i havent any visiting cards with me you can think of me as the quaker detective then i will come to business you want a thousand dollars you are correct there then i will show you a way to get it i know one way already you mean by delivering me up yes that would not suit me let me go and i will give you a thousand dollars have you got it with you no but i can arrange to give it to you within a week you see added the outlaw dryly i have been prosperous in my business and can snare that sum in return for the favor you are going to do me in giving me my liberty i am afraid friend fox that my chance of securing the money in that way would be very slender i am a man of my word what i promise that i will do if you have so much money why did you want to take the five hundred dollars of my friend here it was all in the way of business well what do you say that i wont trust you if i should take your thousand dollars for releasing you i should be as bad as you are very well drive on then said the outlaw sullenly in less than an hour ezekiel masons home was reached when they drove into the yard it made quite a sensation mrs mason and the hired man stood staring at them with mouths agape who have you got there ezekiel asked his wife one of the fox brothers answered the farmer in an important tone me and my friend here took him luke smiled and so did the prisoner uncomfortable though he was it would have taken a dozen like that fool to have captured me he said in a low voice but only luke heard him chapter xi under watch and ward the farmhouse was built after the model of many similar houses in new england it was of two stories with the front door in the centre and a room on each side over the two stories was an unfurnished attic have you a secure place to keep our friend here asked luke the farmer paused before he answered i might put him in the attic he said but here his wife interfered i couldnt sleep if he were in the house she said why not asked luke you see he is securely bound and will be as helpless as a child will you show me the attic follow me said the farmer they went up two flights of stairs and found themselves in a long room the whole width of the house through the centre rose the chimney the sloping roof was not plastered the only furniture consisted of a cotbedstead and a chair is the attic occupied by any of the family asked luke not generally when i hire an extra hand at harvesttime he sleeps there but at present there is no one occupying it no then i suggest that the bed will prove a good restingplace for our friend below i have no doubt he has often found himself in lodgings less comfortable but said mrs mason nervously if he should get free during the night he might murder us all in our beds there is little chance of that when your husband bound him he did a good job i wouldnt undertake to get free myself if i were bound as securely thats so said the farmer pleased with the compliment he cant get away nohow over in the corner there were a couple of horseblankets which seemed to offer a comfortable restingplace luke robbins eyed them thoughtfully i have an idea he said let the outlaw lie there and one of us can occupy the bed then he wont be able to try any of his tricks i would rather not sleep there observed the farmer nervously i couldnt sleep in the same room with one of the fox brothers then if you couldnt sleep there you are just the man we want you will always be on the watch and can frustrate any attempt to escape no no said ezekiel mason hurriedly kate could not close her eyes if she thought i were alone with john fox no answered mrs mason with a shudder i wont let ezekiel sleep in the same room with that bold bad man i wouldnt be afraid myself said the farmer trying to keep up his reputation for courage but i dont want my wife to be anxious luke robbins smiled for he understood very well the timidity of his host then he said as i have no wife to be anxious about me perhaps i had better sleep here yes that will be much better rejoined the relieved farmer you are a brave man mr fox wont get the better of you not if i can help it said luke will that suit you mrs mason why dont you take him on to the jail at once asked the woman i shall feel worried if he spends the night in this house i hear that he has escaped from jail no less than three times if he should do so tonight he would at once come here and perhaps bring some of his band with him he knows there is a good sum of money in the house i shall be glad when it is paid out said the farmers wife dont worry mrs mason i have promised your husband that no harm should come to him and that the money should be secure and i will keep my word so you did said ezekiel brightening up and i will pay you what i agreed if you keep your promise friend mason responded luke i am playing for higher stakes than five dollars all depends on my keeping this outlaw secure i mean to do it having settled matters they went down stairs again where they found their prisoner waiting impatiently for their reappearance well he said have you decided to let me go i am sorry to disappoint you my friend answered luke but i dont see my way clear to do so i promised you a thousand dollars if you would release me yes but i havent any confidence in that promise you need not fear in three days i would bring or send the money to you here couldnt you oblige me with a check on the bank where you keep your money asked luke smiling i keep my money in several banks returned the outlaw where for instance i had some in the bank at lees falls but i drew it out the other day so i heard have you any money in the emmonsville bank yes but i am not quite ready to take it yet i can give you an order on the bank if that will suit thank you i doubt if the order would be honored all this talk amounts to nothing said fox impatiently i tell you that if you release me i will bring or send you the money and how soon would you want it back again whenever i saw my way clear to taking it said the outlaw boldly i like that talk it looks square ill think over your offer friend fox and let you know in the morning what i decide to do the outlaw frowned he evidently did not like the prospect of remaining in captivity over night what are you going to do with me tonight he asked we have a comfortable place provided answered luke mr mason if you will give your assistance we will show our guest where we propose to put him unbind me and i will save you the trouble no doubt but there are some objections to that the outlaw was lifted from the wagon and carried up stairs to the attic his ankles as well as his wrists were securely tied so that he was unable to walk friend fox said luke politely there is a bed and there is a shakedown pointing to the blankets on the floor you can take your choice i hope you will like your hotel i shall like it better if it provides refreshments replied fox i am simply famished i am sure mrs mason will furnish you with a meal i will speak to her the outlaw seated himself on the bed and the cord about his wrists was loosened so that he might be able to eat this might have been regarded as dangerous as affording him an opportunity to escape but for two reasons in a chair opposite sat luke robbins with a revolver in his hand watching his prisoner sharply if you make any attempt to escape he said quietly i shall shoot now you understand and will be guided accordingly in spite of his unpleasant situation the outlaw could not help admiring the coolness and resolution of his guard you would make a capital accession to my band he remarked if that is meant for a compliment said luke dryly i thank you you had better think it over join my band and i will make it worth your while he fixed his eyes earnestly upon his captor to see whether he had made any impression upon him when i start on any road he said i like to know where it is coming out well this road will lead to wealth i dont read it that way how then it will more likely lead to a violent death or the gallows i have been on that path for ten years and i am alive and a prisoner yes at present but i can tell you this my quaker friend that the tree has not yet grown that will furnish a gallows for john fox perhaps so but i dont feel sure of it the outlaws predicament did not appear to interfere with his appetite he ate his dinner with evident relish and left nothing on the plate when he had completed his meal luke called the farmer and requested him to tie his wrists again you can do it better than i he said besides i shall need to stand guard i was well that he did so for john fox if there had been the least chance of success would have overpowered the farmer and effected his escape but with the eye of luke robbins upon him and the pistol in his hand ready to go off at an instants notice there was nothing to do but to submit to being rebound chapter xii the outlaws escape the outlaw was left for several hours alone in the attic of the farmers house he felt far from comfortable and he experienced great mortification at the thought that he had been captured by a quaker i might as well have been captured by a woman he said to himself i shall never hold up my head again that is he added after a pause unless i circumvent him and get away fox dragged himself to the window and looked out if only my brother knew where i was he reflected he would soon turn the tables on those clodhoppers but as he knew his brother was twenty miles away on a different expedition john fox was a man of expedients in his long career as an outlaw he had more than once been in a hole but he had never failed by some means or other to extricate himself this was what he decided to do at present if it were possible it was not for some time that he bethought himself of a knife that he had in his pocket if he could get it out so as to use it he would be able to cut the ropes that bound him and escape that is if he were not interfered with he looked out of the window again and saw luke robbins and the farmer walking up the road they think i am safe soliloquized fox but perhaps they may find themselves mistaken he reflected with satisfaction that there was no one in the house but mrs mason and himself she was a timid nervous woman who would wilt at a look from him yet as matters stood he was helpless even against her as it was uncertain how long his two jailers would be absent it behooved him to escape as soon as possible there was of course a difficulty in the way as his hands were securely tied together at the wrists and he could not therefore thrust them into his pocket and obtain the knife but possibly by rolling over he might manage to make it slip out it seemed the only possible way to accomplish his object so he at once set to work rolling over and over he at length found himself in such a position that the knife a large jackknife slipped from the gaping mouth of the pocket ha that is the first step towards success he cried triumphantly next he must pick up the knife and open it this was easier than the first step his hands were tied at the wrists but his fingers were free to work it seemed a simple thing to open the knife but it took him some time at last however he succeeded that is the second step towards liberty he said in a jubilant tone the next thing was to cut the cord that bound his wrists that was difficult in fact it took him longer than both the first steps together it chanced unfortunately for him that the knife had not been sharpened for a long time then the cord was stout and thick and even had his hands been free it would have taken him some time to cut it as matters stood he was placed at great disadvantage if they should come back it would be maddening he reflected and as the thought came to him he looked out of the window but nowhere were the two men visible they had evidently no fear of his escape they are fools they dont know me said the outlaw to himself he resumed his efforts to cut the cord it was slow work but perseverance even in a bad cause is apt to be crowned with success and this was the case here after twenty minutes the last strand parted and with a feeling of relief john fox stretched out his hands free once more his feet were still tied but with his hands at liberty there was very little difficulty in cutting the rope that tied them in less that five minutes the outlaw rose to his feet a free man he smiled a smile of exultation and triumph my quaker friend will be surprised to find me gone he will understand john fox a little better he will have to wait a little longer for his thousand dollars john fox was himself again but for the first time in ten years except when he was the temporary tenant of a jail he was unarmed what has that fellow done with my revolver he asked himself if it is any where in the house i wont go off without it half an hour earlier and he would have been content with his liberty now he wanted his revolver and his thoughts recurred to the money which the farmer had drawn that morning from the bank it was five hundred dollars as luke had rather incautiously let out john fox was not without hopes of securing both the coast was clear and only mrs mason was left in the house he might terrify her and so secure the articles he had set his heart upon but clearly there was no time to be lost as luke and the farmer might return at any minute the outlaw went down stairs stepping as lightly as he could on the lower floor mrs mason was in the kitchen preparing the evening meal she had at first been reluctant to remain alone in the house with the outlaw but luke had reassured her by the statement that he was securely bound and could not possibly get away so upon the whole she was calm and had no fear of being molested she turned from the stove at the sound of a footfall there was the notorious outlaw standing in the doorway with an ironical smile upon his face the terrified woman sank back into a chair and regarded john fox with a scared look you here she exclaimed yes mrs mason it is i how did you get free my husband told me that you were bound so i was and i will do your husband the justice to say that he understands his business i had trouble to break loose how ever could you have done it asked the amazed woman i wont go into details for there isnt time now listen to me and obey my commands your quaker friend took my revolver away i want you to get it and give it to me i cant do it sir for i dont know where it is mrs masons tone was a terrified one that wont do said john fox sternly it is somewhere in the house look for it indeed sir you are mistaken i am sure that mr the quaker gentleman has taken it with him i dont believe anything of the kind he had no doubt a revolver of his own and would not care to carry two you may be right sir but i dont know where it is the outlaw felt that time was precious and that it would not do to indulge in prolonged discussion with the woman is there any revolver in the house he demanded impatiently i should prefer my own but i will take any i will look sir if you wish me to wait a moment there is something else i must have where is that five hundred dollars your husband drew from the bank this morning i dont know tell the truth or it will be the worse for you i am ready to tell the truth but i dont know where does your husband usually keep any money he may have in the house in the desk in the next room probably he has put the money there is the desk locked yes have you the key here it is sir and mrs mason meekly passed him a smallsized key good i see you are growing sensible now come with me together they entered the room and mrs mason pointed to the desk it was an ordinary upright desk john fox opened it with the key he was at first afraid the woman had given him the wrong one but she would not have dared to deceive him the desk opened the outlaw began at once to search eagerly for the money there was a multiplicity of small drawers which he opened eagerly but he found no cash except four silver halfdollars and some smaller silver it isnt here he said in a tone of sullen disappointment turning a baffled look upon the farmers wife no sir i didnt think it was there where do you think it is do you think your husband has it with him no sir where then can it be surely you must have some suspicion dont dare to trifle with me indeed i wouldnt sir i think the quaker gentleman has it curse him exclaimed the outlaw angrily hes forever standing in my way have you any other money in the house no sir i have a great mind to kill you said fox with a look of ferocity the terrified woman uttered a scream of dismay that excited the fierce outlaw still more he sprang toward her and seized her by the throat chapter xiii the outlaws mistake john fox had been so occupied with his terrified victim that he quite forgot the possibility of his two captors returning it so happened that both were approaching the house when they heard mrs masons cry of terror whats that exclaimed the farmer in alarm i believe that scoundrel has got loose answered luke he quickened his pace and entered the house just in time to become a witness of the outlaws brutality it was no time to hesitate or parley he sprang upon the robber dashed him to the ground and put his foot upon his breast what deviltry are you up to you miserable man he demanded then turning to mrs mason he asked why did he attack you he wanted my husbands money and a revolver answered the trembling woman i have a great mind to give him the contents of the revolver said luke sternly john fox was not a coward on the contrary he was a man of boldness and courage but as he looked up at the stern face of the quaker detective he quailed almost for the first time in his life he tried to rise but the heavy foot of luke robbins was on his breast let me up he growled you dont deserve to get up you should lie there forever for your cowardice in attacking a woman i would rather it had been you said john fox bitterly you are safe in attacking a woman said the detective in scornful sarcasm the outlaw was stung by his assailants scorn i have attacked many better men than you he replied and some have not lived to tell the tale so you own up to being a murderer i am ready to believe you i have a great mind to shoot you where you lie and luke pointed his revolver at the prostrate outlaw that would be the act of a coward said john fox hastily his cheek turning pale for he felt that death might be close at hand not exactly that for i have mastered you in a fair fight but there is one thing that holds back my hand do you know what it is well i should cheat the gallows of its due here farmer ezekiel mason pale and trembling was standing on the threshold what is it he asked go and get another rope the farmer left the house and going to an outhouse returned with a stout clothes line tie him again while i hold him was lukes command tie him as securely as before more so if possible how did you get loose find out for yourself said the outlaw sullenly i mean to and i dont intend that you shall escape the second time meanwhile john fox was execrating his folly in not escaping when he had the chance if he had not waited for the revolver and money he might by this time have been out of danger yet he was not without hope what he had done once he might do again he still had the knife in his pocket it was ready for use and he meant to use it no doubt he would be taken back to the attic and probably pass the night there if luke robbins should be his companion all the better after cutting his bonds the knife could be put to another use and might end the life of the man who had inflicted such humiliation upon him he did not speak but his eyes betrayed him there was such a revengeful gleam in them that luke read their meaning without trouble if i am ever at the mercy of that ruffian he thought i wouldnt give much for my chance of keeping a whole skin when the outlaw lay securely bound luke summoned the farmer watch him for five minutes mr mason he said i am going to the attic to learn if i can how he got loose ezekiel mason looked uncomfortable but did not object he was half afraid of john fox even in his helpless condition have you a revolver yes then take it out and if he makes an effort to escape shoot him without a moments hesitation it gratified the outlaw to see how much afraid of him the farmer was even in his helpless condition but he could not flatter himself that he had inspired any terror in luke robbins against his will he was compelled to pay tribute to the resolute courage of the quaker detective as he met the gaze of the farmer he smiled to himself sardonic ally youve got the advantage of me he said i am bound and helpless while you are free and are armed still you are afraid of me why should i be asked mason but his tone was not firm yes why should you be ill tell you if ever i have you where i am now ill give you fifteen minutes to say your prayers oh what a terrible man said mrs mason with a shudder you wouldnt kill him she ejaculated yes i would but there is one way of escape what is that loose these bonds and let me go before your quaker friend comes down stairs and your life will be safe and your wifes ezekiel mason shook his head feebly i dont dare to do it he said do as you please but the time will come when you will be sorry that you refused what are you afraid of you are armed while i have no weapon i am afraid of luke you neednt be he would find fault with you but that would be all ezekiel mason was weak but not weak enough to yield to the persuasions of his prisoner besides he knew that luke would come down from the attic directly in fact he was already close at hand he brought in his hand the cut fragments of the cord with which the outlaw had originally been bound this tells the story he said holding up the rope so that the farmer and his wife could see it this rope has been cut the man has a knife john fox darted a malignant look at him but said nothing you are smart john fox luke went on smarter than i thought it must have cost you considerable trouble to cut the rope where is your knife john fox did not reply luke robbins knelt down and thrust his hand unceremoniously into the outlaws pocket he drew out the knife which had done fox so much service this will be safer with me than with you he said would you rob me demanded the outlaw yes of anything it is not proper for you to have to john fox the disappointment was bitter he was if anything more securely tied than before and it would be quite impossible to loosen the rope or free himself without the help of the knife his hope of getting loose during the night and killing luke was at an end for the first time he felt hopeless and once more he execrated his folly in not making good his escape as soon as he came down stairs did he say anything while i was up stairs asked luke yes what was it he wanted me to set him free did he offer you money no but he threatened that he would some time take my life he is a terrible man said mrs mason shuddering i shall not feel safe tonight with him in the house i dont propose to let him stay in the house all night the prisoner the farmer and his wife looked at luke inquiringly i think farmer said luke youd better harness up and we will take our friend here to the jail in crampton what tonight yes the sooner he is safely disposed of the better at any rate we will have shifted the responsibility to the authorities yes it will be better said mrs mason the buggy was made ready and the outlaw very much against his will was packed in the back part of it towards nightfall the warden of the prison at crampton was startled by the arrival of the farmer and luke bringing with them the notorious outlaw whose name was in every mouth john fox he hardly knew whether to be sorry or glad for no prison yet had been secure enough to hold him any length of time i will leave my name said luke and i shall hereafter claim the reward for his capture chapter xiv ernest has an adventure luke robbins remained at the farmhouse over night and till the middle of the next day at that hour the sum of money which mason had withdrawn from the bank was transferred to the party for whom it was intended and lukes mission was at an end he received from the farmer the stipulated five dollars and started on his return to emmonsville ezekiel mason driving him the greater part of the way luke arrived at the bank half an hour before it closed and reported his success including the capture of john fox he was congratulated but noticed that the officers of the bank looked grave is anything the matter he asked yes answered the cashier at one oclock yesterday we sent your young friend ernest with a thousand dollars in united states bonds to the bank at lees falls he did not return last night and we have received no tidings from him what do you fear asked luke hurriedly we fear that he may have been captured by some of the fox gang and be at present in confinement or else what killed or wounded added the cashier he could not have met john fox for i held him in custody there was the other brother james who was at large james is the tall brother yes then said luke i shall have to hunt him too will you grant me leave of absence gladly we want to recover the bonds but we care still more for the safety of the boy indeed ernest had become popular with the bank officials as well as with the residents of emmonsville the cashier spoke truly when he said he cared more for the boys safety than for the recovery of the bonds can you tell me anything that will help me in my expedition asked luke have you any idea where the fox gang would be likely to carry ernest it is generally supposed that the band have a secret rendezvous somewhere within a dozen miles but no one has been able to discover where it is and you think that ernest would be carried there yes they would hardly bring themselves to kill a young boy he would of course be easily overpowered by a grown man so that there would be no excuse for murderous violence this spoils all my pleasure at capturing john fox said luke ruefully i should be willing to have him go free if only i could get the boy back how did the boy go he walked but it was a long distance yes about ten miles we at first thought of providing him with a saddlehorse but there was one objection what was that he would have been more likely to be suspected of being out on some mission but on foot he would not be apt to attract attention a boy of sixteen is not very apt to be a custodian of money true leaving luke robbins to start on his search for ernest we will go back to the time when the boy messenger left the bank on the day previous the united states bonds were inclosed in an envelope and carried in an inner pocket which had been expressly made by an emmonsville tailor on his first connecting himself with the bank the pocket was unusually deep so as to accommodate a long parcel this was the most important commission on which ernest had been employed and he was pleased with the confidence reposed in him he did not dread the long walk for he was a strong and active boy besides he was authorized to accept a ride if one should be offered him he would of course arrive at lees falls after the bank was closed but he was instructed to call at the residence of the cashier and leave the bonds ernest had walked three miles when he met with an adventure on the borders of a small pond he caught sight of a small indian boy playing he was probably not more than three years of age a stick he was playing with fell into the pond and the little fellow reached over to recover it in doing so he lost his balance and fell into the water there was a scream and a splash and ernest no sooner saw the accident than he ran up threw off his coat and vest lest he should wet the bonds and plunged into the pond the young bank messenger was an expert swimmer and in an instant had seized the child and placed him out of danger the little indian boy clung to him instinctively feeling safe with his young protector where do you live little boy asked ernest out yonder answered the child ernest had not been quite sure whether he would be able to understand or speak english but having been brought up among white people he was as familiar with english as most white boys of his age ernest looked in the direction pointed out by the boy at the distance of a hundred rods he saw a rude log house which seemed to contain but one room smoke was curling from a chimney projecting from the roof outside sat an indian about forty years of age smoking a pipe he seemed busily thinking having the grave face characteristic of the average indian he did not immediately notice the approach of his little son but when they were near the indian boy uttered a cry pronouncing some indian word which possibly meant father then the red man looked up and his grave face changed as he recognized his boy in the company of a young white stranger he rose hastily from his seat and advanced quickly to meet the two who were approaching what has happened he asked in clear and distinct english your little boy fell into the water explained ernest and you saved him yes answered ernest modestly i saw him fall and jumped in after him was the water deep about so deep said ernest placing his hand about five feet from the ground then he would have been drowned if you had not been near yes if he could not swim he is too young to swim but you are wet added the indian noticing for the first time the condition of ernests clothes yes a little come in said the indian abruptly he led the way into the log cabin there was a stove in the centre of the room and the air was so heated as to be uncomfortable as he led the child in a stout indian woman came forward with a cry and took him in her arms her husband rapidly explained what had happened she instantly stripped the clothes from the child and put on a dry change now said the indian turning to ernest take off your wet clothes though ernest knew that it was wise to do so he felt bashful about removing them in presence of the woman but his indian host brought from a nail on which they hung a pair of buckskin breeches of his own and offered them to ernest for his temporary use ernest no longer hesitated but made the substitution as the indian was four or five inches taller than himself the legs covered his feet he laughed as he saw how they looked and the indians serious face relaxed a little from the same cause now i will dry your clothes he said he took a chair and hanging the wet garments over the back placed it very near the stove ernest hardly liked to lose so much time but he knew that it would not be safe to wear the trousers in their soaked condition you speak english very well he said turning to the indian yes i have spent much time with white people was the answer do you support yourself by hunting went on ernest yes i am a hunter but i go with rich white people from the cities and with englishmen who want a guide and do they pay you well asked ernest not quite sure whether he was not showing too much curiosity yes they pay me well i have some money in the bank then ernest remembered having seen the indian one day at the bank he was told at the time that his name was john castro and that he had several hundred dollars on deposit chapter xv a new acquaintance while ernests clothes were drying the indian woman was bustling about the stove the boy did not suspect her object till she placed on the table a plate of indian cakes hot from the oven and he was invited to partake it was the first time he had ever been a guest in an indian family and he hesitated but saw that his refusal to partake might hurt the feelings of his new friends he seated himself at the table and found the cakes really very good when his clothes were dry he rose to go wont you stay all night asked castro thank you i cannot spare the time i must push on where are you going asked the indian to lees falls i will go with you a short distance so they set out together at length john castro stopped that is your way he said i wish you a pleasant journey i will not forget what you have done for my little son if ever you are in trouble send for john castro i thank you the indian shook hands with him gravely and turned back towards his cabin all this had taken time ernest had no watch with him but he estimated that the adventure had cost him two hours however he had saved a boys life again he had made a friend the friend was an indian but ernest was wise enough to consider that no friend however humble is to be despised it was clear that he would reach his destination late and he began to wish that some carriage would overtake him in which he might ask for a ride but he walked two miles farther without encountering any team at last however he heard the rumble of wheels and turning round to see whether there was room in the vehicle he saw that it was a buggy driven by a tall thin man with dark hair swarthy face and a long aquiline nose the driver eyed ernest sharply and brought the buggy to a standstill where are you going boy he asked to lees falls where have you come from from emmonsville it is a long walk yes do you think you could give me a lift perhaps so jump in ernest lost no time in availing himself of the invitation he was footsore and weary and it was with a sensation of relief that he seated himself beside the driver the latter who had been going at good speed pulled his horse down to a walk and showed indications of becoming sociable where were you going in lees falls he asked ernest felt that it would be imprudent to mention that his destination was the bank so he answered guardedly i am going to see the town i may stop over night at the hotel yes it is not much of a place to see said the driver watching his companion curiously it is larger than emmonsville isnt it yes how long have you been in emmonsville not long where do you live there at mrs larkins do you go to school no ernest began to think that his companion was decidedly inquisitive and something told him that he would do well to be on his guard why should he ask so many questions of a boy with whom he had no acquaintance meanwhile the horse was travelling very slowly and it seemed to ernest that he would go over the road quite as fast if he had continued to walk however it was easier riding and this was a consideration he began to think it was his turn to ask questions are you going all the way to lees falls he asked i may go nearly there i am very much obliged to you for giving me a lift i was quite tired the driver smiled perhaps i have an object he said ernest looked an inquiry the pleasure of your company explained his companion with a smile thank you answered ernest now i come to look at you i think i have seen you before continued the driver where in emmonsville at the bank ernest became alarmed there was a significance in his companions tone which excited his alarm but he did not dare show his feelings he remained outwardly calm though inwardly disturbed very probably he said i have been there his companion laughed he was playing with the boy as a cat plays with a captive mouse ernest began to consider whether he could not think of some pretext for getting out of the buggy suddenly the buggy stopped i will get out here said ernest quickly not quite yet i have not got through questioning you i am in a hurry said ernest you must wait till your hurry is over now tell me truly are you not bound for the lees falls bank ernest was startled you see i know more about you than you suppose you are the bank messenger it seemed useless to deny it the important question now was was his secret packet in danger i have sometimes acted as bank messenger he said warily and you are acting in that capacity now what are you taking to the lees falls bank ernest turned pale his worst fears were confirmed why do you ask he said because i want to know what business can it be of yours demanded ernest boldly dont be impudent boy hand me the package of money i have no package of money then you have bonds ernest remained silent i see that i have hit it now hand over the bonds if you value your life he spoke sternly and looked so fierce that the boy messenger became more and more alarmed he saw that he must give up the package but determined to hold out in his resistance as long as possible the package is not mine and i have no right to surrender it he said ill take the responsibility boy you cant be blamed for you cant help your self as he spoke he passed his hand over ernests vest which he saw projected more than was usual and discovered the hidingplace of the important package instantly he had torn open the vest and drawn out the envelope i thought i should find it he said in a tone of triumph ernest felt very much dejected it was a mortification to lose the first large sum with which he had been intrusted will you tell me who you are he asked abruptly first let me know who you think i am as the driver spoke he eyed ernest sharply is your name fox asked the young messenger his companion laughed i know mr fox he answered you are either fox or a member of his band you seem to be a sharp boy i wont tell you whether you are right or not i suppose i may go now where do you want to go ernest hesitated this was a question which he could not at once answer to go on to lees falls without the packet would do little good yet the bank officers there ought to know that the bonds intended for them had been stolen besides he was too far from emmonsville to return that night i will go to lees falls he said not at present i have other views for you as he spoke the robber turned his horse to the right wholly ignorant as to where he was to be carried ernest sank back in his seat and resigned himself as well as he could to the situation chapter xvi the outlaws home where he was to be carried or what was to be his fate ernest could not conjecture nor did he speculate much it was enough for him to know that he was in the power of one of the notorious outlaws there was considerable difference between his appearance and that of the man at his side he was silent and depressed while james fox for it was he seemed in excellent spirits he turned to the boy with the remark you dont say much no for it would be no good brace up boy there is no occasion to look as if you were going to a funeral give me back the bonds and i will look lively enough come now dont be foolish these bonds dont belong to you they were given into my care very well you took as good care of them as you could i shall be held responsible for them no you wont i shall send your employers a letter letting them know that you did the best you could to keep them out of my hands but perhaps they never heard of me and he laughed if your name is fox they have heard of you there is no need to beat about the bush my name is fox james fox what made you take up such a business mr fox asked ernest gravely well i like that you a kid undertake to lecture me you were once a kid yourself the outlaws face grew grave suddenly and his tone became thoughtful yes i was a kid once at sixteen is that your age yes well at sixteen i was as innocent as you i had a good mother then if she had lived perhaps i would have turned out different why it seems a great joke doesnt it i attended sundayschool till i was fifteen you havent forgotten it then no nor the lessons i learned there but it is of no use to recall those days are you afraid that you will come to harm ernest looked intently in the brigands face no he said after a pause i think you wont do me any more harm but you can do me a great favor what is that return you the bonds i would ask that if i thought you would do it but i dont expect it i should like to have you release me and let me go home i cant do that for i want you to visit me you may not think it but i always like young people it will be quite a pleasure to me to have you for a visitor thank you but i am afraid that i shall become an unwilling guest besides it will be a pleasure to my little boy to meet you he does not often meet other boys have you a son asked ernest in surprise the outlaws face softened yes he answered he is a sweet little boy as i can say even if he is my son his name is frank would you like to see his picture yes answered ernest with interest james fox drew from an inner pocket a small card photograph of a young boy with a very winning face ernest was attracted for unlike many boys of his age he liked younger children he looked at the picture long and earnestly it is a sweet face he said at last isnt it asked the proud father is his mother living no was there no difficulty in getting it taken i suppose you mean on account of my profession well there might be around here but this was taken in minneapolis about a year ago it was one of the few visits that frank has made with me are you going to bring him up to your business take care boy said the outlaw frowning dont be impertinent i dont mean to be do you think the question an improper one well perhaps i have no right to think so somehow the business though it seems all right for me i couldnt think of for my boy no i shall soon place him at school where no one will know that he is related to the celebrated outlaw i want him brought up to lead an honest life i am glad you do i respect you for that my lad you seem to be one of the right sort as you will see my son i want you to promise me that you wont say a word about the business i am engaged in i will make that promise then the boy doesnt know no he has no suspicion he is too young to think much about that perhaps if he had associated with other boys much he would have found out while this conversation was going on they had entered a wood and the road became wilder and rougher indeed it was hardly a road but rather a lane narrow and grassgrown ernest began to wonder in what sort of a home his companion lived his evident affection for his son gave ernest a different feeling towards him it was plain that he had a softer side to his nature bandit though he was ernest had never read the story of jekyll and hyde but he felt instinctively that the man beside him had a double nature on the road he was an outlaw with corresponding traits a rough and unscrupulous man but at home and in the presence of his son as ernest judged he was a warmhearted and affectionate father in truth the young bank messenger looked forward with interest to a meeting with the boy who was so dear to the heart of a man whom the world generally supposed to be a stranger to the softer emotions at length they reached a rocky hillside here the outlaw pulled up his horse and jumped from the buggy ernest looked at him in a questioning way you can get out he said we have arrived ernest alighted and looked about him he naturally expected to see a dwelling of some kind but there was none in sight if it was at a distance why should they not have driven to it james fox looked at him with a smile enjoying his perplexity from his pocket he drew a handkerchief come here my boy he said ernest did not quite understand what he proposed to do but he felt better acquainted with the outlaw now and he knew that there was no cause for apprehension he accordingly approached without question james fox bandaged his eyes so that he could see nothing then he took him by the hand and led him forward ernest could not tell what was being done but he found himself walking on a rocky path hand in hand with his guide how long he walked he could not tell it might have been two hundred feet then his guide stopped and of course he stopped too next the handkerchief was removed and he found himself in what seemed a rocky cavern at any rate it was a large room of irregular shape but the stone floor had been made smooth and was covered by a soft carpet it was furnished like a sittingroom in a private house there were comfortable chairs including a rockingchair and a capacious armchair on one side of the room was an invitinglooking couch of course there would have been perfect darkness but for artificial light on a table was a large students lamp and in a niche in the wall was another besides this there was a lantern hanging from the roof of the chamber but this was not lighted ernest looked about him with curiosity and surprise it was something new to him and recalled a story he had once read in which a cavedwelling was described well what do you think of it asked the outlaw smiling it is wonderful said ernest you did not know where i was bringing you no it is a cave is it not well it looks like it there are other rooms are there not yes but this is my private apartment my parlor you may call it this is my sleepingroom he drew aside the hangings on the further side and revealed an inner chamber of less size on a bed ernests attention was drawn to the figure of a sleeping boy evidently the original of the picture which the outlaw had shown him that is your son asked ernest yes that is frank the outlaws stern countenance softened as he regarded the sleeping boy suddenly the boy stirred he opened his eyes and when he recognized his father a glad smile lighted up his innocent face papa he said and james fox bent over and kissed him chapter xvii in the robbers cave after kissing his father the young boy looked inquisitively at ernest who is that boy papa he asked i have brought him here to stay with you shall you like to have his company yes papa you know it is very lonely while you are away what is his name the outlaw looked at ernest significantly he took the hint and answered my name is ernest ray how old are you ernest went on the boy sixteen i am only ten are you ready to get up frank asked his father yes answered the young boy briskly i got sleepy because i was alone where did papa find you ernest oh i met him outside and he took me to ride james fox looked approval of this answer i am glad you came with him you seem like a nice boy ernest so do you frank by this time frank had slid from the bed and put his hand in ernests come here he said and i will show you my books led by his small companion ernest went up to a bookcase which he had not before observed in the main room about thirty books stood on the shelves where did you get your books he asked papa bought them for me in minneapolis were you ever in minneapolis no it is a nice place sometimes i think i would like to live there instead of here you are not getting tired of home are you frank asked his father half reproach fully no papa but it is lonely here sometimes am i to live here always no frank some time i will send you to school but you wont see me every day then then i dont want to go the outlaw stooped over and kissed the boy now frank i have something to do so you may amuse yourself with ernest can you play dominos asked frank yes have you a set yes the boy opened a drawer in a bureau and drew out a box of dominos he poured them out on the table and they began to play the ordinary game when they tired of that ernest taught him a new one after they grew tired of playing ernest read aloud to the boy from one of his favorite books they were sitting together in the armchair when james fox who had left the room returned he smiled approvingly at the picture he was pleased to think that he had found a companion whom his boy liked what have you been doing frank he asked he has been reading to me papa he reads nicely and i liked it very much i am sorry to interrupt you but are not you young people hungry i think i could eat something answered ernest frank you may bring him into the diningroom the drapery was lifted and they passed into a room as large as the one they were in on a table in the centre a substantial meal consisting principally of roast beef was set forth an old colored woman intensely black and slightly deformed hovered near evidently the cook juba said the outlaw this is a new boarder his name is ernest glad to see you massa ernest rejoined the old woman nodding her turban sit down here next to massa frank it seemed very strange to ernest to reflect that he was the guest of one of the famous outlaws of whom he had heard so much he was half inclined to doubt whether it was real if he had been alone he would have pinched himself to see whether he was awake or dreaming here he was in the bowels of the earth on intimate terms with an outlaw and his family how long was he to stay in the cavern that was a question impossible to answer meanwhile he was hungry and the dinner was well cooked in spite of his being a prisoner and the loss of the packet ernest was almost ashamed of himself for the appetite which he manifested but it seemed to give pleasure to juba who regarded it as a compliment to her cookery where is uncle john papa asked frank suddenly ernest remembered that one of the fox brothers was named john and he awaited the answer with interest james fox seemed busily thinking and frank had to repeat the question your uncle john repeated the outlaw he went away on business what kind of business papa it was a natural question but it startled james fox he saw that as his son became older it might not be easy to evade embarrassing questions you seem curious frank he answered after a pause you wouldnt understand if i were to tell you will you teach me your business some day papa it was on the tip of the outlaws tongue to say heaven forbid but he only answered wait till you are older frank then we will talk about it at length they rose from the table they went back to the main room and ernest read a little more to the young boy but franks eyes grew heavy and he finally dropped off to sleep shall i lay him on the bed mr fox asked ernest no i will do so he took the boy tenderly in his arms if i had known he would fall asleep i would have undressed him he said after placing the boy on the bed he resumed his seat in the armchair and began to smoke finally he looked over at ernest do you like my little boy he asked abruptly he is a dear little fellow answered ernest so he is said the father in a soft voice you have no prejudice against him because he is my son no answered ernest whatever you are he is not responsible true but all might not take that view of it i dont know why i should speak so confidentially to you lad but if i ever regret my line of life it is when i look at him i wouldnt like to have his future marred by his association with me i wouldnt like people to turn from him because he was an outlaws son i hope you will forgive my boldness said ernest but dont you think you will ever change your mode of life it is too late i am too well known yet who knows he said after a pause nothing is impossible at nine oclock juba entered the room has john returned asked the outlaw no massa a shade of anxiety overspread the outlaws face he should have been here before this he said then looking at ernest he said i am going out a while lie down on the bed with frank and if he wakes up undress him yes sir an hour later frank and ernest were sleeping peacefully side by side when ernest awoke the next morning frank was still asleep on the bed beside him in the large room adjoining james fox lay on the lounge he had given his bed to ernest he had not himself undressed but had thrown himself on the couch in his ordinary clothes breakfast was ready by the time they were and the three sat down together where is uncle john papa asked frank he has not returned frank said james fox soberly what made him stay away all night probably it was business answered the outlaw but ernest noticed that he looked disturbed in truth he had been out till two oclock seeking for his brother who he feared had got into trouble we know that he was in the prison at crampton whither he had been conveyed by luke robbins and ezekiel mason of course it was in the mind of james fox that his brother might have been arrested since this was a risk which he daily incurred just as breakfast was over there was a new arrival it was a tall stalwart fellow whom james fox addressed as hugh do you bring any news hugh asked the outlaw eagerly yes answered hugh humphries is it about john hugh glanced significantly at the two boys ernest he saw for the first time james fox understood and followed hugh out of the room well he said inquiringly when they were out of hearing mr john is in trouble answered hugh briefly go on said james fox do you know where he is in crampton jail go on give me the particulars he was carried there by two persons who were they one i think was a farmer who lives in claremont the other seemed to be a quaker i dont remember any quaker in this neighborhood he must be a stranger hereabouts i think i have seen him before where at the emmonsville bank i was passing there one day in disguise and chancing to look in i saw this man sitting on a bench near the paying tellers desk ah said james fox thoughtfully he may be a detective that is what i thought that is bad news but the jail at crampton is not very strong i have been confined there myself and made my escape however john will need assistance from the outside i see you have a new boy said hugh curiously when did you pick him up yesterday a few miles from here he is a bank messenger from what bank the emmonsville bank then he may know something of this quaker detective well suggested i will question him chapter xviii the outlaw and his band when james fox returned to the apartment where the boys were still seated at the table he said ernest i should like to speak to you a minute ernest followed him out of the room is there any person connected with the bank at emmonsville who wears the dress of a quaker began the outlaw ernest hesitated a moment speak out boy said fox i must and will know yes sir is he a detective he may act as such is he under pay at the bank i think he is do you know where he is now no was he at the bank when you left it yesterday afternoon no sir do you know where he was i saw him ride away with a farmer john fox and hugh exchanged glances their suspicions were confirmed is he in any trouble asked ernest becoming a questioner in his turn no for aught i know he may be at the bank ernest looked relieved and for two reasons he was glad that luke was not in trouble then he knew that when his disappearance was discovered luke would leave no stone unturned to rescue him it was a comfort to think that he had a powerful friend outside that will do said the outlaw you may return to frank how long are you going to keep me here asked ernest anxiously are you already tired of remaining with us there was something in the outlaws tone that savored of kindness ernest felt that in some way he had ingratiated himself with him i would like my freedom i am not used to confinement he said very natural i cannot let you go just yet but i will not allow you to be harmed do not be alarmed i am not answered ernest why not you know my reputation yes but thus far you have been kind to me true i like you for you are kind to my boy and i see that he enjoys your company listen i shall be away all day probably do what you can to amuse frank i will i should be very lonely without him that is a good boy hugh said john fox as ernest left them i should like to keep him with us why dont you then i am afraid he would be unhappy i never knew you to take such a liking to a boy before i never have indeed i have seldom met any all my dealings have been with men but hugh we must lose no time we must try to rescue john if possible it is no more than he would do for me if our cases were reversed very well captain i am ready to follow wherever you lead i know that hugh you have always been faithful to my brother and myself i always will be captain said hugh with a look of loyal devotion i know it i am sure that we have no better friend than hugh humphries you only do me justice captain will you forgive me if i say something say what you please hugh what you have said of me is just but i dont think you can say it of all in the band is there any one whom you suspect if so it is your duty to tell me i dont take much stock in peter longman i am afraid you are suspicious hugh not without cause i have noticed some things about him that i dont like i think he is quite capable of turning against you i have never remarked anything of the sort but i know you would not speak without cause tell me what you want me to do only to be on your guard dont trust peter as you trust me i never have and now have you any suggestions to make you might visit this farmer who helped the quaker arrest your brother it may be a good plan who is the farmer his name is ezekiel mason i know where he lives he is the last man i should suppose would be capable of such mischief he could have done nothing without the quakers help very well we will take the farm on the way still i dont know that we shall learn anything beyond what we already know before leaving the cave they disguised themselves as farm workmen in this dress they approached the farmhouse but there was something that diverted them from their original purpose and led them to keep their distance sitting on the portico was a tall man dressed as a quaker thats the man said hugh quickly thats the man who drove up to the jail last evening with your brother james fox looked at him closely it is best to let sleeping dogs lie he said we will push on to the jail chapter xix a day in the cave meanwhile ernest was left in the cave with frank he had been brought in blindfolded and was therefore ignorant as to the entrance or exit he thought he might without arousing the boys suspicion seek information from him on these points are there many rooms here frank he asked oh a good many answered the boy have you been in many i have been around with papa i should like to go round said ernest suppose we take a little walk ill go with you i should be afraid to go alone does juba ever go out yes she sometimes goes out to get things do you know where she goes no then you never went with her i went once but papa does not like to have me go out let us go about a little the boy was quite ready to accept any suggestion from ernest so he took his hand and they went from the main room farther into the cavern ernest found that only the portion near the entrance had been furnished beyond there was a large amount of empty space here and there a small light revealed trunks and boxes arranged without regard to regularity these ernest conjectured contained stolen articles which had accumulated during the years in which the dreaded outlaws had been a power and a menace in the neighborhood it occurred to him that he would like to open some of these boxes but the companionship of the boy prevented he ventured to ask however what is in those boxes frank i dont know something of papas and uncle johns as they kept on they reached parts of the cavern which were quite empty the fox brothers were in the position of householders who occupied a house too large for their needs by and by the lamps ceased and the portion farther on looked dark and gloomy i am afraid to go any farther ernest said the boy why frank what are you afraid of there may be wild animals there but how could they live there i dont know but papa told me there were some ernest understood why the boy had been told this it was to prevent his going too far but it made ernest all the more eager to continue his explorations even if there were any wild animals i would protect you frank i would not let them hurt you but we may not find our way back it is so dark said the child with a shudder i wont go farther but see it seems to be lighter it was at a point fifty feet farther on through a rift in the roof a gleam of light entered the cavern ernest was anxious to trace this for as he judged it came from some outlet through which he might possibly obtain deliverance stay where you are he said i will just go forward and see what i can dont stay long entreated frank nervously no i wont ernest was just as well pleased to go forward alone for if there was really as he supposed an outlet it was as well that frank should not have his attention drawn to it lest he should speak of it to his father and so reveal the fact of their explorations this might excite the suspicion of james fox and put a stop to their further walks continuing on alone ernest then saw perhaps fifteen feet above him an opening some three feet in diameter through which he could obtain a glimpse of the clear sky far above it made his heart beat with exultation and longing there was freedom if he could only manage somehow to lift himself up to the outlet and make his way through it what is it ernest asked frank come back i am afraid oh it is nothing answered ernest with studied indifference it isnt anything you would care to see the little boy accepted this assurance for he did not feel the interest that excited ernest let us go back he said as he resumed his clasp of ernests hand yes we will go back have you ever been as far as this before no then we had better not say anything about it your papa might not like it all right ernest will you read to me when you go back yes frank ernest was glad to comply with the little boys request as he thought he might in this way put the thoughts of their exploration out of his mind they were fortunate enough to get back without exciting the attention of juba who was busy in the kitchen her work however was soon over and she brought her sewing into the room where the two boys were seated the garment on which she was engaged seemed to be a dress of rough cloth well massa frank what am you doing ernest is reading to me why dont you ever read to me juba o lor chile you know i cant read but why cant you read youre old enough yes honey im old enough but i never had no chance to learn why didnt you persisted frank didnt you go to school when you was little no chile never went to school they didnt have no schools where i was raised where was that in ole virginny were you a slave juba asked ernest getting interested yes massa i was a slave and how did you get here it was all along of the war ole massa he went to the war and got killed then young massa went and he got killed too then one day there came an officer one of abe linkums officers and he told us we were free and might go where we pleased that was a drefful time why was it dreadful werent you glad to be free asked ernest no honey we didnt know where to go nor what to do wed allus had some one to look after us and take care of us but now there wasnt anybody were you married juba yes but i dont know whether my ole man is livin or not he was sold down in georgie to a cousin of ole massa then he may be living yet yes honey how old are you juba asked frank i dont know chile is powerful old specs is a hundred ernest smiled no juba he said you are not nearly a hundred you may be sixty all right massa you know best juba did you ever hear about uncle tom yes chile i knew uncle tom was the unexpected reply he was raised on mr jacksons place next to ours ernest asked some questions about this uncle tom but learned as he expected that it was quite a different person from the negro immortalized by mrs stowe in looking over franks books ernest found an old copy of uncle toms cabin and taking it down he read some portions particularly those relating to topsy both frank and juba were very much entertained did you know topsy juba asked frank no chile never knowed topsy she must have been a no account young nigga if shed lived on our plantation shed have got flogged for her impudence how did you come here juba asked frank one of them officers took me to chicago i lived out with a lady but when she died after a good many years i went to a telligence office and there i met your papa he brought me out here i didnt at first like livin down under the ground but i dont mind it now massa fox treats me well and i aint no wish to change this was the substance of what juba had to communicate the rest of the day passed quietly at nightfall james fox came home looking very sober but he came alone his brother was not with him chapter xx ernest explores the cave james fox had very little to say during the evening he was evidently preoccupied and anxious he paid scant attention to the boys but left them to their own devices frank knew so little of his fathers business or occupation that he could conceive of no cause for worriment when his advances met with little response he asked have you got a headache papa no yes child my head troubles me some be as quiet as you can will it disturb you if i play checkers with ernest papa no i should like to have you amuse your self answered the outlaw he directed the boys to go to bed early as before they slept together and he threw him self on the lounge without taking off his clothes ernest slept well when he woke up at eight oclock he saw that frank was still sleeping but his host was already up juba came into the room get up children she said breakfast is ready where is papa asked frank he took breakfast an hour ago honey what made him get up so early portant business called him away he said wheres uncle john he hasnt been home has he got portant business too specs he has honey it doesnt seem nice to take breakfast without papa said the little boy you may consider me your papa frank observed ernest but youre not big enough to be a papa at any rate i am not old enough when breakfast was over there was the long day before them to be filled up in some way dont you ever wish to go out of the cave frank asked ernest where asked the little boy into the bright sunshine out on the green grass and under the trees yes i think i should like it answered frank thoughtfully but papa does not want me to go i dont know why do many little boys live in caves like me no i dont think so can they walk about in the sunshine and play i always did do you like it better than living here yes then what made you come here this was an embarrassing question and ernest felt that he must be careful in answering your papa wanted me to make you a visit he replied after a pause and i am glad you came it isnt so lonely for me before i had only juba wouldnt she play with you asked ernest with a smile frank laughed merrily juba is too old to play i hope you will stay with me a good while ernest could not echo this wish so he answered evasively i cant tell yet how long i shall stay but the time will come when you will leave the cave and live like other little boys in a house did papa tell you that he told me that he should send you to school before long what is a school like asked the little boy anxiously few boys of ten would have been obliged to put this question but frank had been secluded from the world ever since he was a baby there will be a good many boys some older some younger than yourself you will study lessons together and play together i think that will be nice yes i am sure you will enjoy it did you ever go to school oh yes i went to school for some years i wish i could go again perhaps you will go to school with me i cant tell answered ernest vaguely perhaps juba will go to school with you frank laughed she would look funny going to school he said whats dat you sayin bout juba massa ernest asked the old woman entering the room i told frank you might go to school with him maybe id go and take care of him honey but you wouldnt want to study i wouldnt study nohow is a poor ignorant nigger never shall know nuffin i expect dont you think you could learn to read juba no i couldnt it takes white folks to read no juba when i went to school there was a colored boy in my class and he was one of the smartest scholars we had and was he a nigger asked juba interested we didnt call him that but he was a colored boy if he could learn to read i am sure you could its no use chile im too old now much as he liked frank it was irksome to ernest to remain all day in the cave it was imprisonment under pleasant circumstances but still imprisonment they got through the forenoon somehow taking dinner at twelve oclock about two oclock frank complained of being sleepy you wont mind if i go to sleep for an hour ernest he said oh no answered ernest i can read you know since his exploration of the day before ernest had been longing to visit once more the same portion of the cave but he wanted to go alone he had a hope that through the aperture in the roof he might effect his escape it would not do to have frank with him as this would interfere with his plan now the longedfor opportunity was almost at hand he took a volume from the bookshelf and sitting down beside the bed began to read but his mind was not on the book though at another time he would have enjoyed it he watched frank and in less than fifteen minutes had the satisfaction of seeing that he was fast asleep then he left the room juba being occupied in the kitchen he secured his hat as he would need it in case he effected his escape as he passed through that apartment in the cave where there were trunks and boxes it occurred to him to open one of them he was rather surprised that it should be unlocked but so it was it was filled with a miscellaneous assortment of articles but on top to his surprise and joy he recognized the envelope containing the bonds that had been taken from him if he left the cave he would want these and therefore he had no hesitation in taking them he put them in the inside pocket of his vest and kept on his way in a short time he reached the spot lighted by the aperture in the roof the opening was quite large enough for him to get through but the difficulty was that it was fully fifteen feet above the floor of the cave ernest was something of a gymnast but it was out of his power to reach the opening through which alone he could obtain deliverance he looked about him to see if there were any articles which he could pile upon one an other so as to attain the aperture but the cave was quite empty of articles of any description nor could he find any that he could move in the portions which he had already traversed it was certainly very aggravating to be so near freedom and yet unable to obtain it there just above him he could see the blue sky and the cheerful sunshine while he was a prisoner in a dark cavern was there no way of reaching the opening he asked himself if he had to give up hope he would feel obliged to return the envelope to the box from which he had taken it were its loss discovered he would of course be searched and kept in stricter seclusion than before in the room used by the outlaw as a sittingroom the apartment he had just left he might be able to find what he needed but he could not remove anything without being detected and should he return there he would possibly find frank awake which would spoil all it looked as if he would have to give up the chance that had come to him in thoughtful mood he walked slowly back all at once an idea struck him in the room where the trunks and boxes were stored he had seen a long stout rope could he do anything with it looking up at the aperture he noticed a jagged projection on one side if i could attach the rope to that he reflected i could draw myself up hand over hand till i reached the top and then it would go hard if i didnt get out with new hope in his heart he retraced his steps rapidly till he reached the storeroom he knew just where to look for the rope he examined it carefully and found it very stout and strong he took it back with him then making a loop at one end he stood under the opening and threw it up as he would a lasso he had to try a dozen times before he contrived to circle the projection with the loop then pulling it taut he began to climb hand over hand as he had many a time done in sport now his deliverance depended upon it slowly foot by foot he approached the opening not knowing whether even if he reached it he would be able to draw himself through the hole chapter xxi out of the fryingpan into the fire arrived at the opening ernest found that there was a trapdoor which was ordinarily closed but through some misadventure had been left open it was however a serious problem to draw himself up so as to profit by what he had already done twice he failed and nearly lost his grip on the rope then he caught hold of the projection from which the rope depended and by a supreme effort he succeeded helping himself by means of the trapdoor in emerging from his subterranean prison stretching himself he took a deep breath and realized joyfully not only that he was free but that he had recovered the valuable bonds of which he had been placed in charge he began to look around him and tried to conjecture in what direction he must go to reach lees falls he was quite at a loss as he had been carried into the cave blindfolded but help seemed to be at hand he saw at a little distance rapidly approaching him a man of middle height whom he concluded to be a resident of some place in the vicinity can you tell me in what direction i must go to reach lees falls he asked the stranger paused and examined him sharply so you want to go to lees falls he said yes sir where do you come from from emmonsville direct no i saw you just now coming out of some opening in the earth this alarmed ernest he felt that he might be called upon to explain where he had been who is this man he asked himself is he one who is likely to be in the confidence of the outlaws if so i have only got out of one scrape to fall into another he studied the face of the man with whom he was speaking and to his dismay noted a resemblance to james fox who had captured him he began to suspect that this was his brother whether it was or not ernest deemed it politic to say as little as possible of his experiences and of what he knew about the cave and its occupants yes he answered quietly there seems to be a cave underneath i found the trap door open and went down but i regretted it for i found it difficult to get out again his new acquaintance eyed him scrutinizingly as if to see whether he knew more than he was willing to reveal so there is a cave underneath he said inquiringly yes have you any idea what it is used for i dont think it is used at all the room below seems empty the man regarded him fixedly when did you leave emmonsville he asked abruptly yesterday answered ernest in some confusion how does it happen that you have got no farther on your way to lees falls i stopped at the cabin of an indian answered ernest making the only explanation he could think of the man smiled young man he said didnt you pass last night in this cave ernest saw that there was no further chance for subterfuge yes he answered i thought so you were captured the other went on yes have you any suspicion by whom this cave is occupied i presume by the fox brothers correct i am one of them i began to think so how were you able to escape i was left with the little boy he fell asleep and then i began to explore where is my brother he went out quite early i presume in search of you you are john fox are you not exactly i suppose my brother heard that i was in trouble yes by the way the quaker detective through whom i got into difficulty you doubtless know i do i was put into jail at crampton but i managed to effect my escape are you connected in any way with the emmonsville bank yes in what way as bank messenger did my brother take anything from you yes money no bonds you are a sensible boy you answer my questions freely you are a smart boy too it isnt every lad of your age who would have managed to effect an escape from the cave do you remember the entrance no i was carried into it blindfolded i thought my brother would be prudent so you couldnt find it again no i dont think so still i cannot run any risk you will have to come with me where do you want to carry me asked ernest much disturbed i will carry you back to the cave let me go free i will promise not to reveal anything that i have discovered the outlaw shook his head i am sorry boy but that is a request i cannot grant you were made prisoner by my brother and i owe it to him to prevent your escape it was intolerable to ernest to think of having his captivity renewed he determined that he would at least make an effort for free dom accordingly he did not hesitate but started to run hoping that in this way he might save himself he had always the reputation among his boy companions as a sprinter and resolved to see whether this was a lost art with him so thats your game is it exclaimed the outlaw it will go hard with me if i dont catch you stop or it will be the worse for you but ernest had no intention of giving up so soon he only exerted himself the more the contest was not so unequal as might have been supposed ernest was tall of his age and the outlaw was rather below the average height so there was in reality only about an inch difference in their height on the other hand john fox had as might be supposed more strength and endurance he was not over weight and therefore not scant of breath ernest got the start and this was an advantage one ran about as fast as the other so it settled down into a contest of endurance whoever could hold out the longest would win the outlaw however was irritated at the unexpected difficulty of his undertaking he had thought that ernest would surrender at discretion i wish i had my revolver he muttered had the outlaw been aware that ernest had in his possession the packet of bonds which had impelled his brother to make him a captive his zeal would have been increased this however he did not suspect he knew of course that the bonds would be taken from him and he could conceive of no chance of the boys recovering them they flew over the ground maintaining the same relative distance but there was an unexpected contingency that worked to the disadvantage of ernest directly in his path was a projecting root which in his haste escaped his notice he tripped over it and as a natural consequence he measured his length on the ground the outlaws face lighted up with exultation now the issue was no longer doubtful at last he had the boy in his power before ernest could recover himself and rise to his feet john fox was upon him he flung himself on the prostrate boy and clutched him in a firm grasp now i have you he said you were a fool to run you might have known that you could not escape i came near it though gasped ernest quite out of breath let me up will you promise to go with me without giving me any more trouble i will make no promises said ernest stoutly then it will be the worse for you said the outlaw vindictively what he proposed to do must remain unknown for as he spoke a hand was thrust into his neckcloth and he was jerked violently to his feet chapter xxii a friend in need bewildered and angry john fox looked to see who was his assailant he found himself confronted by a tall muscular indian whom ernest also recognized as the man whose child he had saved from a watery grave what do you mean by this outrage demanded the outlaw angrily why are you hurting him said the indian pointing to ernest because i choose to what have you got to say about it me stop you said the indian calmly i have a great mind to shoot you this was an empty threat for his weapon had been taken by the quaker detective the only answer made by the indian was to produce a revolver which he pointed at the breast of the outlaw two play at that game he answered john fox shrank back for it takes a man of nerve to face a revolver he began to remonstrate what interest have you in that boy he asked he save my little boy from drowning answered the indian will you go or shall me shoot there was but one answer to make to this question john fox turned about and walked quietly away without a word ernest grasped the indians hand gratefully i cant thank you enough he said you have perhaps saved my life you saved my little boy do you know that man no it was john fox one of the fox brothers the famous outlaws humph i have heard of him how did he catch you ernest told the story he also told of the commission he had from the emmonsville bank i am going to ask you a favor he asked what is it i want you to go with me to the bank at lees falls i have a package of bonds to carry there and i dont think it safe to go alone i will see that you are paid for your time and trouble i will go under the guidance of his indian friend ernest reached lees falls the bank was closed but the cashier was still in the bank building having been detained after hours seeing him through the window ernest knocked and obtained admission the bank is closed young man said the bank officer i know it but i have a package of bonds from the bank in emmonsville i hope you will take them from me for i dont want the responsibility of them any longer oh you are the young messenger we had advice that you would be here yesterday so i should have been but for my capture by one of the fox brothers and how did you escape asked the wondering cashier please take the bonds and i will tell you i spent two nights in the outlaws cave this afternoon i managed to get away but were not the bonds taken from you yes but i recovered them ernest without waiting for further questions told the story as briefly as possible so after all he concluded i should have been taken again but for my friend here laying his hand upon the indians shoulder i told him you would pay him for his trouble in accompanying me so i will said the cashier and he took a fivedollar bill and tendered it to the indian the latter objected to taking it alleging that ernest had saved his boys life but the cashier overruled his objections and he accepted it they were going out of the bank when the familiar figure of luke robbins came up the street his face was overspread by an expression of anxiety and he seemed troubled he had searched everywhere for ernest and thus far had failed to find him when he saw the boy emerging from the bank his face changed at once so you are safe ernest i thought i had lost you he exclaimed did you see anything of the outlaws i should say that i did i was captured by james fox and confined two nights in the underground haunt of the robbers when i escaped this afternoon i fell into the clutches of the other brother what john fox yes this cannot be ernest i lodged him myself in crampton jail all i can tell you is that he is at liberty now he must have escaped then i am afraid i shant receive the reward offered for his capture you ought to get it you delivered him over to the authorities if they could not keep him that was their lookout you ought to be right lad i hope you are who is this man my indian friend who proved to be a friend in need it was he who saved me from john fox i am proud to know you said luke grasping the hand of the red warrior if you have helped ernest you are my friend he save my little boy i will always be his friend you have saved my boy my indian friend and you will always be my friend returned luke well luke what shall we do i have done my errand and delivered the bonds i suppose i ought to go back to emmonsville we will go back i have found you and have no more to do here shall we walk no it is too far there is a stable a little way from here i will hire a conveyance and our indian friend will perhaps be willing to drive us over the indian expressed his willingness and the three were soon on their way through the woods they met with no adventure nor did they fear any for it would have required a brave man to attack two such stalwart persons as the indian and the quaker detective leaving them for the present we will go back to the cave from which ernest had made so unceremonious a departure frank slept for two hours but at length opened his eyes expecting to see ernest sitting at his bedside he looked in vain there was no one in the room this did not surprise him much however he thought ernest might have gone into the next apartment ernest he cried but his call received no response the little boy got out of bed and looked about but his search was vain so he went into the kitchen where he found juba engaged in some domestic work juba he said where is ernest i dont know chile isnt he in the big room no juba i went to sleep and when i woke up he was gone lor chile he round somewhere you look round and maybe you find him but frank was doomed to disappointment he sat down ready to cry he felt very lonely he had not realized how much he enjoyed ernests company i dont know where he can have gone juba do you think hes gone and left me i cant tell chile wait till your papa comes home he will find him frank had to wait an hour and a half before his fathers return all this time he was buoyed up by the hope that ernest would come back he was continually watching the portal to see if the runaway would not come but in vain james fox entered the room with grave face and heavy step he had not heard of his brothers escape and thought him still an inmate of crampton jail he looked about for his young captive where is ernest frank he asked i dont know papa i miss him ever so much said the little boy tearfully but he must be somewhere about when did you miss him he went away when i was asleep the outlaws suspicions were aroused i will look for him he said but ernest was in none of the rooms nor could juba give any account of him did you walk with him into the interior of the cave frank he asked yes papa ha that explains it go with me and tell me just where you went the little boy led the way through the vacant apartments till he reached the one through which the light came from above the rope was still hanging from the projection and this explained ernests escape james fox went up and examined it he must have got out this way said the outlaw wont he come back papa said frank sadly yes said his father resolutely i will bring him back chapter xxiii given in trust well lad have you had enough of emmonsville the speaker was luke robbins and the time was two days after the series of exciting incidents recorded in the last few chapters why do you ask luke replied ernest are you tired of it yes lad i want to move on there is nothing more for us here but what about the reward you are entitled to for the capture of john fox the cashier thinks i will only receive a part of it as fox has escaped and is now at large that is unlucky you will have to wait until the matter is decided wont you no he has offered me an advance of a hundred dollars and is authorized to collect whatever prizemoney may be awarded to me you have some money left yes about seventyfive dollars then we both have enough to start on i propose to go to california by cars getting there as soon as possible when we reach there we will see what we can do to increase our pile i like that plan when shall we go it is now thursday we will start on monday before they departed there was some sensational news peter longman one of the fox band taking offence at some slight put upon him by james fox went to the authorities and revealed the existence and location of the cave with other information of a like nature the result was that a strong police force was sent to surprise and capture the notorious outlaws the visit was made at night and under guidance of peter himself wholly unsuspicious of treachery the outlaws were captured in their beds and the valuable articles contained in trunks and boxes in the storeroom were confiscated james fox was reclining on the sofa when the officers entered is your name fox asked the leader of the invading party yes answered the outlaw proudly then you are my prisoner who has betrayed me demanded fox quickly there was no answer but just behind the invading party the outlaw caught sight of peter longman apparently trying to screen himself from observation i need not ask he said there is the treacherous hound he shall not live to profit by his baseness before any one could interfere james fox leveled his revolver at longman and a sharp scream showed that his aim was true his treacherous follower fell to the ground mortally wounded james fox looked at him disdainfully then threw the revolver upon the floor of the cave and held out his hands now bind me if you will he said i am your captive little frank was a terrified witness of this scene what are they doing to you papa he asked they are bad men in spite of his fortitude the outlaw showed traces of emotion that is my little son he said to the lieutenant commanding dont let him suffer for the sins of his father he shall be taken care of do not be anxious about him there is an old colored woman here juba went on the outlaw the boy is used to her if possible let them be together under a strong guard the famous robbers were carried to jail and the cave which had been for years their meetingplace was dismantled and was never again used for a criminal resort when ernest read the story his feelings were mixed he rejoiced that the outlaws were taken but he felt a sympathy for little frank and understood what a shock it must be to the father and son to be separated and to have their home so suddenly and violently broken up he learned where frank was and called upon him he had been taken to his own home by the police commander and it was there that ernest found him when he entered the room where frank sat disconsolately at the window the little fellow uttered a cry of joy is it you ernest he said running forward i thought i should never see you again ernest stooped over and kissed the little boy you see i am here he said what made you go away why didnt you tell me you were going i will tell you some time frank i hope you are feeling well why did those bad men take papa away i do not think you would understand where is juba she is now in the kitchen i will call her juba came in and seemed pleased to see ernest i have got a letter for you honey she said fumbling in her pocket she brought out a yellow envelope it was directed to ernest the contents ran thus now that misfortune has come upon me my chief thought is for my boy whatever befalls me i want him cared for you are scarcely more than a stranger to me but when you were in the cave you seemed to love frank poor boy he will stand in need of some friend who loves him so far as you can will you be his friend and guardian he has some property a few thousand dollars which you will hold in trust for him it is not stolen property it was left him by his mother call upon mr samuel hardy a lawyer in lees falls and he will make over to you the custody of the money and look upon you as the authorized guardian of frank you know my wish that he should be sent to a good school and properly educated will you carry out my wishes in that respect i do not wish to tie you down but wherever you may go keep up an active interest in my boy and from time to time write to him i do not know what my fate may be i am not a coward and shall not complain or beg for mercy when you speak of me to frank in after years always paint me at my best and let him understand that at least i loved him james fox ps should frank die before maturity i desire that his property should go to you ernest read the foregoing with mingled feelings he knew that the writer was an outlaw deeply stained with crime but this letter showed him at his best paternal love softened the harsh outlines of his character and spoke of a nature that might have made him a blessing instead of a curse to his kind ernest lost no time in communicating with mr hardy the lawyer read the letter in some surprise mr fox seems to have appointed a young guardian for his son he remarked yes sir but he appeared to have no choice it would have been better had he appointed you no i do not care to assume that responsibility i am ready to assist you however i will depend upon you then for i shall start for california as soon as possible can you recommend a satisfactory boardingschool i have a son at school in lincoln the school is under the charge of a clergyman who is an efficient teacher yet is popular with his pupils can you arrange to enter frank at his school i will do so if you authorize me i dont think we can do any better were you aware that mr fox was the notorious outlaw asked ernest after a pause i did not know but latterly i have suspected it you may be surprised that under the circumstances i should have consented to serve him but i felt that i might be of assistance to the boy and that my refusal would occasion him embarrassment your letter is satisfactory as showing that the fortune of your ward is not made up of illgotten gains were it otherwise he would hardly be allowed to keep it does frank know his fathers character and reputation i dont think so it had best be kept from him i will see that it does not become known at school it would wound the boy to be twitted with it by his schoolmates thanks to mr hardy ernest found that the new charge imposed upon him would not materially interfere with his plans a week later than he had originally intended he and luke robbins left emmonsville by a westernbound train as they rushed rapidly over the prairies luke robbins turned to his young companion and said our journey thus far has been adventurous i wonder what lies before us we wont trouble ourselves on that score luke i feel hopeful so do i and yet we have less than two hundred dollars between us thats true still i have captured an outlaw and you at the age of sixteen are the guardian of an outlaws son i dont think we shall meet with anything stranger than that two days later in a newspaper bought at an important station there was an article that deeply interested both travellers it related to the fox brothers recounting their daring attempt to escape from the jail where they were confined john fox got away but james was shot dead by one of the prison guards so frank was an orphan and ernest felt that his responsibility was increased chapter xxiv stephen ray and his son leaving ernest and luke robbins on their way to california our attention is called to other characters who must play a part in the drama of the boy from oak forks a few miles from elmira upon an eminence from which there was a fine view of the surrounding country stood the handsome country mansion of stephen ray already referred to as the cousin of ernests father it passed into his possession by inheritance from poor ernests grandfather the will under which the bequest was made cutting off his son for no worse a crime than marrying a girl thoroughly respectable but of humble birth stephen ray since he came into possession of his uncles estate had improved it considerably he had torn down the old stable and built an imposing new one the plain carriage which had satisfied his uncle had been succeeded by an elegant coach and the sober but rather slow horse by a pair of spirited steeds mr ray had become pompous and by his manner made it clear that he considered him self a man of great consequence he was a local magistrate and had for years endeavored to obtain a nomination for congress had he been of popular manners he would probably have succeeded but he was not a favorite among the poorer classes and their vote must be considered there is an old saying like father like son and clarence now turned sixteen the only child of the country magnate was like his father in all objectionable qualities he was quite as much impressed with ideas of his own consequence it was about three oclock in the afternoon mr ray sat on the piazza the day being unusually warm reading a newspaper in the street near by his son clarence was moving swiftly on a new bicycle which his father had just purchased for him out of the way there he called out as a shabbilydressed stranger with a weary step plodded along the pathway whether because he was hard of hearing or because his mind was preoccupied the stranger did not heed the warning and clarence who might easily have avoided the collision ran into him recklessly had the bicycle been moving at a greater rate of speed he might have been seriously hurt as it was he was nearly thrown down but he rallied and seizing the offending rider with no gentle grasp dragged him from the wheel and shook him vigorously let me alone you tramp exclaimed clarence furiously but the stranger did not release his hold not till you apologize for running into me he answered sternly apologize to a man like you ejaculated clarence struggling furiously for his freedom what do you take me for for an impudent young rascal was the reply let me alone i tell you will you apologize there is no need of an apology you got in my way you have no business on the sidewalk with your bicycle it is meant for footpassengers do you know who i am demanded clarence haughtily no i dont nor do i care i am clarence ray son of squire stephen ray he is a magistrate and he can send you to jail these words of clarence had the effect he desired the stranger released him and eyed him with close scrutiny so you are the son of stephen ray he said yes what have you to say now that you had no right to run into me whoever your father may be i shall report your insolence to my father i shall charge you with violently assaulting me i might have known you were stephen rays son said the stranger thoughtfully do you know my father asked clarence in considerable surprise i am on my way to call upon him i dont think it will do any good he never gives money to tramps i have a great mind to give you another shaking up said the man and in some fear clarence edged away from him it was evident that this shabbylooking stranger had not a proper respect for those who were in a higher station i will tell him not to give you anything continued clarence like father like son said the stranger thoughtfully apparently not disturbed by the boys threats evidently he was no common tramp or he would have been more respectful to the son of the man from whom he was probably about to ask a favor you just wait till you see my father hell give you a lecture that you wont soon forget youd better get on your wheel boy and go right along said the stranger calmly do you know where my father lives yes at yonder fine house i see him sitting out on the piazza shall we go along together no i dont keep such company as you tramps are not my style and yet some day you may be as poor and friendless as myself that isnt very likely my father is a very rich man i knew him when he was poor more and more puzzled by the independent manner of this shabby stranger clarence made a spurt and soon found himself in the grounds of his fathers house with whom were you talking clarence asked stephen ray as his son joined him on the piazza one of the most impudent tramps i ever came across answered clarence he made an attack upon me and pulled me from my bicycle stephen rays cheek flamed with anger an insult to his son was an insult to him why did he do this how dared he he demanded angrily because i happened to touch him as i passed answered clarence he actually pulled you from your bicycle asked stephen ray almost incredulous yes i should like to meet him i should feel justified in ordering his arrest you will have a chance to meet him he told me he was going to call upon you there he is now entering the gate stephen was glad to hear it he wanted to empty the vials of his wrath on the audacious offender he prided himself on his grand manner he was accustomed to seeing men of the stamp of this stranger quail before him and show nervous alarm at his rebukes he had no doubt that his majestic wrath would overwhelm the shabby outcast who had audaciously assaulted his son and heir he rose to his feet and stood the personification of haughty displeasure as the poor man who dared his anger walked composedly up the path he now stood by the piazza steps it is well you have come here began the squire in a dignified tone my son tells me that you have committed an unprovoked outrage upon him in dragging him from his wheel i can only conclude that you are under the influence of liquor stephen ray waited curiously to hear what the man would say he was prepared for humble apologies i am no more drunk than yourself if that is what you mean stephen ray was the unexpected reply squire ray was outraged and scandalized you must be drunk or you would not dare to talk in this way who authorized you to address me in this familiar way you are only a man i believe stephen ray i have addressed you as respectfully as you have spoken to me respect to you repeated mr ray disdainfully has the time come when we must be respectful to tramps a poor tramp is quite as deserving of respect as a rich rascal what do you mean by that demanded the squire suspiciously it was a general remark it is well that it was but it has no application in the present instance if you are poor i will give you a quarter but only on condition that you apologize to my son the stranger laughed why should i apologize to your son he asked you pulled him off his bicycle do you deny it no i do not do you know what he did he brushed against you with his wheel he tells me accidentally so that is his version of it he deliberately ran into me i gave you warning i said out of the way there interrupted clarence yes but you had no right on the side walk that is meant for footpassengers it seems to me sir that you are remarkably independent for a man of your rank even if it had been as you say you had no right to assault my son i might have you arrested on your own confession but i will forbear doing so on condition that you leave town at once i have a little business with you first stephen ray if you expect alms you have come to the wrong man i dont believe in encouraging beggars i know very well that you are not charitable you see i used to be acquainted with you who are you my name is benjamin bolton stephen ray looked startled benjamin bolton he repeated half incredulous i cant believe it chapter xxv a startling disclosure look at me closely stephen ray said the strange visitor i think you will see some traces of the bolton you used to know stephen ray somewhat discomposed did examine his visitor closely against his will he was obliged to acknowledge the resemblance of the man before him to one who in past times had had an intimate acquaintance with his affairs you may be benjamin bolton he said after a pause but if so you have fallen off greatly in your appearance when i first knew you you were well dressed and respectable i suppose you mean to say well respectable if you will have it so now you look more like a tramp than a lawyer true as gospel every word of it but it isnt too late to mend thats an old proverb and a true one it is quite in the line of possibility that i should get back to the position from which i fell perhaps so but im not sanguine of it with your powerful help nothing is impossible not even that you must not count upon that said stephen ray stiffly it is a good while since we parted company i dont myself care to renew the acquaintance but i do rejoined bolton with emphasis i told you that i had business with you i have very little time at my disposal said ray pulling out an elegant gold watch a jurgensen and consulting it i think it may be well for you to spare me a little time went on bolton quietly there was something in his tone that sounded like a threat and stephen ray could not wholly conceal his uneasiness well he said i will give you ten minutes get through your business whatever it is as soon as possible hadnt you better send your son away suggested bolton significantly why should i but on second thoughts mr ray concluded to act on the hint and turning to clarence he said clarence you might take another spin on your wheel this did not suit clarence at all his curiosity had been excited by his fathers change of front towards the objectionable stranger and he counted on finding out the reason for it why cant i stay he grumbled i am tired of riding then go up stairs this man and i have a little private business together he spoke firmly and clarence knew by his tone that further remonstrance would be un availing so with a dissatisfied look he left the room now sir said stephen ray sharply when his son had taken his departure i gave you ten minutes you will need to be expeditious it will take more than ten minutes what i have to say returned bolton coolly i am rather tired of standing so you will excuse me if i sit down as he spoke he dropped into a comfortable chair three feet from his host confound his impudence thought ray much annoyed i think we had better go indoors he said he did not care to be seen in an apparently friendly conversation with a man like bolton very well i think myself it may be better he followed ray into a room which the latter used as a library and office and took care to select a comfortable seat really stephen ray he remarked glancing around him at the wellfilled bookcases the handsome pictures and the luxurious furniture you are very nicely fixed here i suppose you didnt come to tell me that responded stephen ray with a sneer well not altogether but it is as well to refer to it i have known you a good many years i remember when you first came here to visit your uncle in the character of a poor relation i dont believe you had a hundred dollars to your name such references grated upon the purseproud aristocrat who tried to persuade himself that he had always been as prosperous as at present there is no occasion for your reminiscences he said stiffly no i suppose you dont care to think of those days now your cousin dudley a fine young man was a year or two older who would have thought that the time would come when you the poor cousin would be reigning in his place if that is all you have to say our interview may as well close it isnt all i have to say i must indulge in a few more reminiscences though you dislike them a few years passed dudley married against his fathers wishes that is his father did not approve of his selection and he fell out of favor as he lost favor you gained it that is true enough but it is an old story why recall it does it seem just that an own son should be disinherited and a stranger a near relative corrected stephen ray well a near relative but less near than an only son does it seem right that dudley should have been disinherited and you put in his place certainly my cousin disobeyed his father while i was always dutiful and obedient so he was left in poverty i dont see how that concerns you benjamin bolton my uncle had the right to dispose of his property as he pleased it was not for me to question his right nor you probably dudley ray is living in poverty now you are mistaken he is dead indeed poor fellow he was a generous and highminded man whatever he may have been he offended his father and suffered the consequences too true but i fail to understand why you should have come to discuss this matter with me when did dudley die i cant be sure as to the year i think it was about a year after his fathers death i presume that his fathers injustice helped to hasten his end i wont permit any reflections upon my dear uncle and benefactor he did what he liked with his own he felt that the estate would be better in my hands than in dudleys admitting for a moment that this was so did your heart prompt you to bestow a part of the estate on your unfortunate cousin no for i am sure my uncle would have disapproved of such action on my part do you know if he suffered much from poverty no i did not concern myself with that nor need you i would like to comment on one of your statements you say that your uncle had a right to dispose of his estate as he pleased do you dispute it no i agree with you stephen ray was his estate disposed of according to his wishes mr ray started and his face became flushed what do you mean he asked i mean that he bequeathed the estate to his son and you took possession of it bolton spoke slowly and eyed stephen ray keenly are you mad gasped stephen how could i do that his will devising the estate to me was duly probated and i entered upon my inheritance by due process of law i know such a will was probated then what have you to say demanded stephen ray defiantly do you mean to deny that the will was genuine no because if you do you can go to the probate office and submit the will to any judge of my uncles handwriting there will be no occasion i admit that the will was written by him what do you mean then asked stephen ray showing relief i mean this that it was not his last will and testament where is the later one produce it if you can said stephen ray triumphantly you say this fearlessly because you found a later will and destroyed it it is a vile slander no i will swear that such a will was made if it was destroyed he destroyed it himself no he did not i am willing to swear that when he died that will was in existence i dont think your swearing will do much good sneered stephen ray perhaps so but one thing has not occurred to you what is that a duplicate of the last will was placed in my hands that will exists today stephen ray started violently i dont believe it he said seeing is believing then bring it here and let me see it however there is one material circumstance that would make it of no value what is it my cousin dudley is dead and so is his son ernest there would be no one to profit by the production of the alleged will bolton was quite taken aback by this statement as stephen ray perceived and he plumed himself on the success of his falsehood when did the boy die asked bolton about five years ago and where at savannah answered ray glibly what should have taken him down there i am not positive but i believe after his fathers death a southern gentleman became interested in him and took him to georgia where the poor boy died bolton looked keenly at the face of his companion and detected an expression of triumph about the eyes which led him to doubt the truth of his story but he decided not to intimate his disbelief that was sad he said yes and as you will see even had your story about the will been true it would have made no difference in the disposal of the property still the revelation of your complicity in the suppression of the last will would injure your reputation mr ray i can stand it answered ray with assumed indifference you see my dear fellow you have brought your wares to the wrong market of course you are disappointed yes especially as i am dead broke no doubt and it prompts me to take my chances with the will in spite of the death of the rightful heirs what do you propose to do lay the matter before a shrewd lawyer of my acquaintance and be guided by his advice stephen ray looked uneasy the lawyer might suggest doubts as to the truth of his story concerning ernests decease that would be very foolish he said would it then perhaps you can suggest a better course you are a man of education and have been a lawyer yourself get a place in the office of some attorney and earn an honest living you see how i am dressed who would employ me in this garb there is something in what you say i feel for you bolton changed as you are you were once a friend i certainly havent any reason to feel friendly to you especially as you came here with the intention of extorting money from me but i can make allowance for you in your unfortunate plight and am willing to do something for you bring me the document you say you possess and i will give you fifty no a hundred dollars bolton eyed his prosperous companion with a cunning smile no stephen ray i prefer to keep the will he replied though i can do nothing with it give me the money unconditionally and if i get on my feet you will have nothing to fear from me chapter xxvi bought off boltons reply did not quite suit mr ray but he felt that if he said too much about the will it would give it an exaggerated importance in the eyes of the man before him so he answered carelessly oh very well the document is of no value and though i should prefer to have it i wont insist i will give you the hundred dollars but i wish it understood that it is all i can give you at any time dont apply to me again for it will be of no use i understand said bolton noncommittally shall i give you a check i could do better with the money my name is not known now at any bank well i think i can accommodate you i believe i have that sum in my desk he opened a drawer in his secretary and produced a hundred dollars in crisp new bills they had been taken from the bank the day before for a different purpose bolton took them joyfully it was long since he had had so much money in his possession he had been his own worst enemy once a prosperous lawyer he had succumbed to the love of drink and gradually lost his clients and his position but he had decided to turn over a new leaf and he saw in this money the chance to reinstate himself and in time recover his lost position thank you he said but while there was relief there was no gratitude in his tone and now said stephen ray i must ask you to leave me i have important business to attend to you will excuse me if i suggest it would be better to go away to a distance and try to build yourself up somewhere where you are not known i might go to savannah yes to savannah if you think it will be to your advantage said ray with equanimity the other noticed his manner and he said to himself he is willing to have me visit savannah it is clear that ernest did not die there benjamin bolton left the house in a pleasant frame of mind it was not the sum which he had received that exhilarated him he looked upon it only as the first instalment it was clear that stephen ray feared him for he was not an openhanded man and would not have parted with his money unnecessarily bolton had not arranged his campaign but he was determined to raise himself in the world by playing on the fears of the man he had just visited i wonder he said to himself whether dudley rays son is really dead he was a strong and healthy boy and he may still be living this was a point not easy to ascertain he went to a restaurant and obtained a substantial meal of which he stood very much in need then he went out for a stroll he did not propose to leave the place yet as he was walking along he met clarence ray again but not now on his bicycle the boy recognized him are you going to stay in town asked clarence curiously not long did you get through your business with pa yes for the present by the way i suppose you know that you have a cousin about your own age i used to know him and his father did you his father is dead so i have understood do you happen to know where the son is somewhere out west i think bolton pricked up his ears so it seemed that stephen ray had deceived him i would give five dollars to know where he is he said slowly have you got five dollars clarence asked doubtfully by way of answer bolton took a roll of bills from his pocket they were those which stephen ray had given him do you mean it asked clarence in a more respectful tone since bolton had money he regarded him differently yes i mean it why didnt you ask pa he never liked the boy nor his father and i dont think he would tell me that is true he didnt like either of them i suppose you couldnt find out for me said bolton tentatively i dont know but i could answered clarence briskly he had a special use for five dollars and it struck him that he might just as well earn the money offered by the stranger if you could i would cheerfully pay you the five dollars you see i used to know ernest ray and his father and i would be pleased to meet ernest again just so said clarence complaisantly how long are you going to remain in town i did think of going to elmira tonight but i think on the whole i will stay at the hotel here till tomorrow morning that will give me time to find out said clarence all right you had better not ask your father for he is so prejudiced i dont think he would tell you thats so he will be going out this evening and then i will search in his desk i saw a letter there once in which the boys name was mentioned but i say if youve got money why dont you buy some new clothes you look awfully shabby your suggestion is a good one said bolton smiling come to look at myself i do appear shabby but then im no dude i dare say when you rode into me this morning you took me for a tramp well you did look like one thats so i cant blame you shall i find you at the hotel this evening yes then ill see what i can do about seven oclock squire ray went out to attend to a business meeting and clarence was left in possession of the study he locked the door and began to ransack his fathers desk at length he succeeded in his quest benjamin bolton was sitting in the public room of the hotel an hour later smoking a cigar and from time to time looking towards the door presently clarence entered and went up to him have you got it asked bolton eagerly yes nodded clarence he took a piece of paper from his vest pocket and handed it to bolton it read thus ernest ray oak forks iowa how did you get it asked bolton i found a letter in pas desk from an old man named peter brant asking pa for some money for the boy who was living with him when was that letter written about two years ago thank you this gives me a clue come out of doors and i will give you what i promised it isnt best that any one should think we had dealings together five minutes later clarence started for home happy in the possession of a fivedollar bill i never paid any money more cheerfully in my life mused bolton now i must find the boy chapter xxvii the town of oreville when ernest and luke robbins started for california they had no very definite plans as to the future but they found among their fellowpassengers a man who was just returning from the east where he had been to visit his family he was a practical and successful miner and was by no means reluctant to speak of his success when i landed in frisco he said two years ago i had just forty dollars left after paying the expenses of my trip i couldnt find anything to do in the city so i set out for the mines where did you go asked luke becoming interested to oreville at least thats what they call it now then it didnt have a name i hope you prospered said ernest well not just at first but luck came after a while when i reached the mines i was dead broke and went to work for somebody else after a while i staked out a claim for myself well i wont go into particulars but ive got six thousand dollars salted down with a trust company in frisco and ive got a few hundred dollars about my clothes besides thats the place for us ernest said luke so i think answered ernest do you want to go to the mines asked the miner yes we have our fortunes to make and are willing to work then go out to oreville with me have you got any money we have enough to get there and perhaps a little over that will do ill set you to work on one of my claims we will share and share alike how will that suit you it seems fair do you think we can make enough to live upon that depends partly on yourselves and partly upon luck luck has something to do with it at any rate we are willing to work said ernest then im your friend and will help you said the miner heartily tom ashton never goes back on his friends this was very encouraging luke and ernest were not dead broke but were near it they had less than forty dollars between them and they had already found out that living was high in california they remained but a day in san francisco and then started for oreville with mr ashton the two friends knew nothing of mining but as practised in those early days it took very little time to learn they found that their new friend was a man of consideration at oreville he owned several claims and had no difficulty in finding them employment they set to work at once for they were almost penniless it may be easily supposed that the miners were not fastidious about living the cabins or huts which they occupied were primitive to the last degree generally they did their own cooking such as it was three of these cabins tom ashton owned and one was assigned to the use of ernest and his friend for years ernest with his old friend and supposed uncle peter brant had lived in a cabin at oak forks but it was superior to their new residence yet his former experience enabled him the better to accommodate himself to the way of living at oreville for a month the two friends worked steadily at their claim which ashton had finally given them they made something but not much in fact it was with difficulty that they made expenses it will be a long time before we make our pile ernest said luke one evening as he sat in front of his cabin smoking yes luke things dont look very promising replied ernest gravely if it werent for my pipe i should feel blue smoking cheers me up that is where you have the advantage of me luke you have the same chance that i have i have an extra pipe wont you take a smoke ernest shook his head i think im better off without it perhaps youre right lad i remember my poor father warned me against smoking the question is how long wed better keep at it is there anything else luke well no not here and we havent money enough to get away just then a tall man with reddish hair strode across the field to their cabin good evening neighbors he said how are you making out not overwell answered luke theres a difference in claims youve got a poor one probably you are right theres been considerable gold dust gathered in oreville within six months i have been one of the lucky ones indeed i am glad of it yes i found a nugget two months since that i sold for two thousand dollars i have made five thousand within a year youve been in luck i wish the boy and i could be as successful the claim is not good enough to support two why not let the boy find something else you wouldnt have me freeze him out said luke in a tone of displeasure no but suppose i find something for him to do what then thats a different matter have you an extra claim yes but that isnt what i offer him i have a plan in which he can help me what is it all our supplies come from sacramento what we need is a retail store in oreville a general store for the sale of almost everything that miners need it would be a good plan to open one said luke approvingly now you must know that i am an old storekeeper i had for years a store about twenty miles from boston i succeeded fairly with it but my health gave out the doctor told me i must not be so confined that i needed outofdoor exercise so i came out here and got it well the advice proved good i am strong and robust and i feel enterprising now what i propose is this i will open a store and put the boy in charge under me i should like it said ernest eagerly you know what we pay for supplies theres at least a hundred per cent made and no one objects to the prices why shouldnt we make it as well as the sacramento storekeepers true said luke i dont ask you to work for me my friend for i dont think it would suit you it wouldnt at home thats in oak forks iowa i was a hunter i was always in the open air the sort of life we live here suits me though i havent made much money as yet the boy i think would do he looks like a hustler i need only look at his face to know that hed be honest and faithful what is your name boy ernest ray thats a good name youll only have to live up to it to the first part of it i mean then you accept my offer you havent made any said ernest smiling oh you mean about wages well i dont offer any stated wages i will give you onethird profits and then your pay will depend on your success the fact is you are to keep the store ernest looked an inquiry one person can attend to it by day i will come in the evening and take a general look after things just at first ill stay with you till youve got the hang of things but during the day i shall be looking after my claims do you know how to keep books i understand single entry bookkeeping that will be all you will require how soon shall you start asked ernest who began to feel very much interested i will go to sacramento tomorrow now that we have come to terms you know that frame building near ashtons cabin yes i dont know what it was originally used for but it is empty and i can secure it for our store it isnt large but it will hold all we need i can get new supplies as we need them yes that will do you havent said how you like my offer of onethird profits i like it better than if you paid me wages i will make it amount to a good deal that will suit me i dont care how much you make out of it for i shall make twice as much how did you happen to think of me ive watched you ever since you came i can judge of any one boy or man if i have time enough to take stock of him i saw that you were just the man for me boy suggested ernest smiling oh well ill make a man of you by the way an idea has just occurred to me youd better go to sacramento with me tomorrow i should like to do it said ernest brightening up then you can notice where i buy my supplies you may need to go alone sometimes at what time will we start the stage leaves at seven oclock i will be ready chapter xxviii an old acquaintance turns up the journey to sacramento was made the goods selected and in less than a week the new store was stocked in the arrangement of goods ernest took a zealous part he had never served in a store yet it seemed to come natural to him and he felt more interest in it than in the work of mining after the store was in full working order horace ames left ernest as sole manager coming in only in the evening to look at the books for ernest as far as possible kept a record of every sale storekeeping in those days and in that country was unusually profitable ernest made a little comparison between the cost of goods and the selling price and arrived at the conclusion that the average profits were a hundred per cent and still the miners were able to buy goods cheaper than when they sent to sacramento for them at the end of the first week ernest figured up the sales and found they aggregated two hundred dollars his share of the profits amounted to a little over thirty dollars this was encouraging being three times as much as he had ever realized in the same length of time from mining there was one embarrassment there was no bank in the place where money could be deposited and of course the chance of loss by robbery was much increased however his partner purchased a small safe and this afforded some security one day a man entered the store and purchased a pipe and tobacco he was a stranger to ernest but there was something familiar in his look yet he could not place him the newcomer looked about with considerable curiosity you have quite a snug store here he remarked yes does it belong to you i have an interest in it but it belongs to mr ames is he here much he usually comes in evenings but he is interested in mining you seem to have a good trade what makes you think so you have a good stock you would not keep so many goods unless you had a call for them have i ever seen you before asked ernest abruptly for the idea grew upon him that he and his new customer had met somewhere under peculiar circumstances i dont know i dont remember you answered the customer shrugging his shoulders i havent been in california long i suppose you were born here no very few of those now living in california were born here i once lived in iowa were you ever there never answered the customer ive been in missouri but never in iowa i have never been in that state are you going to stay here i dont know it depends on whether i can make any money i suppose you dont want to hire a clerk no ernest said to himself that this man with his shifty looks and suspicious appearance would be about the last man he would think of engaging perhaps mr ames would give you a chance to work some of his claims he suggested i will look about me a little before i apply to him replied the customer did you come here alone he asked after a pause no a friend came with me luke robbins the stranger started a little when ernest pronounced this name so that young ray was led to inquire do you know luke how should i know him is he a young man no he is probably about your age i suppose he came with you from nebraska iowa oh yes iowa he isnt in the store is he he is working for mr ashton on one of his claims at this point a new customer came in and the visitor after a brief delay left the store when ernest had waited upon the new customer he look for the first visitor but missed him i wonder who he was he reflected puzzled i am sure that i have seen him before but think as he might he could not trace him yet with this man he had had a very exciting experience in oak forks for it was no other than tom burns the tramp who had entered his cabin during the night and robbed him and later had attacked him when digging for peters hidden treasure it had been only a few months since they had met but tom burns during that time had grown a thick beard which had help to disguise him it is hardly necessary to explain how burns had found his way out to oreville it was his business to tramp about the country and it had struck him that in the land of gold he would have a chance to line his pockets with treasure which did not belong to him so fortune had directed his steps to oreville when he entered the store in which ernest was employed he immediately and in some surprise recognized the boy of oak forks he was glad to find that ernest did not recognize him and he immediately began to consider in what way he could turn the circumstance to his own advantage i wonder if the boy sleeps there he said to himself if so i will make him a visit to night probably the money he has taken in during the day will be in some drawer where i can get hold of it as he was leaving the store in the stealthy way habitual to him he met a man walking towards the place with a long and careless stride he started nervously for this man was one whom he dreaded and had reason to fear it was luke robbins who tired with working the claim was going to the store to replenish his stock of tobacco tom burns pulled his soft hat down over his eyes and pushed swiftly on luke robbins halted a moment and looked at him as in ernests case he seemed to see something familiar in the appearance of the tramp he realized at all events that he was a stranger in oreville for he knew every one in the mining settlement who are you stranger have i seen you before asked luke hailing him tom burns did not dare to reply for he feared that luke might prove to have a better memory than ernest so he was passing on without a response when luke who considered his conduct suspicious demanded in a peremptory tone who are you do you live here tom burns shrugged his shoulders and said disguising his voice me no understand english boss what countryman are you asked luke suspiciously italian answered tom humph you are the first italian i have seen in oreville si signor answered tom and this comprised all the italian he knew well i dont think you will find any inducement to stay si signor replied burns meekly without another word luke entered the store ernest he said i am out of tobacco and must have a smoke give me half a pound all right luke i ran across an italian just outside he seemed to be leaving the store an italian queried ernest his tone betraying surprise yes wasnt he in here there was a man in here a stranger but i dont think he was an italian this man answered me in some italian gibberish he said he couldnt understand english what was his appearance luke described him its the same man that was in here just now but he could speak english as well as you or i did you have some conversation with him yes he looked familiar to me and i asked him who he was he said he had come from missouri he was in search of work you say he understood and spoke english yes then i wonder what could be his game dont he look familiar to you yes there was something familiar about his appearance but i couldnt place him he asked me if i couldnt employ him in the store i told him mr ames might give him a chance at mining well he said he would look round a little before deciding did he buy anything yes tobacco did you mention my name yes and he looked uneasy ernest said luke robbins with a sudden inspiration i know the man who is it dont you recall any man at oak forks with whom you had trouble tom burns yes thats the man why didnt we recognize him then because he has grown a full beard thats so luke i understand now why he looked so familiar i am sorry to see him here hed better not undertake any of his rascalities or he will find himself in hot water chapter xxix tom burns makes a call when burns left the store he walked to the outskirts of the mining settlement not wishing to attract attention he wished especially to avoid encountering luke robbins with the strength of whose arm he was disagreeably familiar he proposed to keep out of sight until night and then make a visit to the store it would go hard with him if he did not make a raise there either in the shape of money or articles of value he came to a cabin standing by itself at a considerable distance from the homes of the other miners sitting in front of it was a man with grizzled beard whose appearance indicated advanced age there were lines upon his face that betrayed ill health i wonder if anything can be got out of him thought tom burns ill see good day sir he said affably the old man looked up good day he replied who are you im an unfortunate man in search of employment when people are unfortunate there is generally a reason for it are you intemperate no sir answered burns as if horrorstricken i hate the taste of liquor im glad to hear it i belong to three temperance societies continued tom by way of deepening the favorable impression he thought he had made and still you are poor yes answered burns once i was prosperous but i was ruined by signing notes for an unprincipled man who took advantage of my friendship do you think i can find work here i dont know probably you can get a chance to work on one of mr ames claims is it mr ames who owns the store yes i called there to buy some tobacco is the boy there his son no he is a recent arrival in oreville he is a very smart boy is he mr ames trusts him i suppose yes why shouldnt he i i would rather not answer that question have you ever met the boy before do you know him yes i met him at the east answered burns since you have said so much you must say more i am a cousin of mr ames and if you know anything unfavorable of the boy it is your duty to tell me i have nothing against the boy and would prefer not to speak i insist upon your doing it it is only this when i knew him he was employed in a store he was trusted as he appears to be here one night the store was robbed that is some money disappeared and the boy claimed it was broken into by thieves who took the money whereas he took it himself that seems bad was it proved that he took the money yes thats why he was compelled to leave the place that is why he is now in oreville did you come here to expose him no i didnt know he was here i was very much taken by surprise when i saw him in the store this is important if true mr ames ought to be informed dont tell him while i am here the boy is very revengeful and he might try to do me an injury are you afraid of a boy i am a man of peace i dont want to get into any difficulty i suppose you wonder that i am sitting here while others are at work well it did cross my mind my spine is affected i look well but i cannot walk i hope to be better after a while but at present i am comparatively helpless cant i help you you may go into the cabin and bring me a bottle of medicine which you will find in the cupboard burns entered the cabin gladly he thought that he might find something worth taking on the wall hanging from a nail was a gold watch it was too good a chance to be lost it might or it might not be valuable but at any rate it was worth something so while securing the bottle burns slyly possessed himself of the watch which he slipped into his inside breast pocket here is the bottle sir he said meekly thank you now bring a spoon which you will find on the table burns did so now pour out a teaspoonful which i will take i am glad to be of service to you dont you want a kind attendant while you are sick to take care of you there would not be enough for you to do i have a son at work in the mines who is here morning and night and he gives me all the care i require i am sorry to hear that thought burns the son may be dangerous then sir i will bid you goodby i will pray for your recovery thank you the prayers of the righteous avail much are you righteous it isnt for me to say sir i dont want to boast that is creditable to you by the way are you hungry i havent broken my fast since morning you will find some cold meat and a loaf of bread in the cupboard it is plain but if you are hungry you will enjoy it thank you sir i will accept your kind invitation tom burns was really hungry and he did justice to the food offered him when his lunch was over he came outside thank you he said for your kindness i am sure you will be rewarded i dont want any reward out here we are always glad to give a meal of victuals to a stranger who needs it are you going to stay long in oreville if i can get anything to do i may you see i am a poor man and stand in pressing need of employment keep up your courage something will turn up for you i will ask my son if he cannot find something for you to do thank you sir i will bid you goodby with thanks for your kindness if you are not pressed for time i will send you on an errand all right sir i shall be glad to be of service to you here is a mexican dollar you may go to the store and bring me a dozen eggs if there is any change you may keep it thank you sir a dollar in thought burns as he turned away from the cabin i think i can turn it to a better use than spending it in eggs that was a profitable call i made a gold watch and a dollar by it the old man cant pursue me thats one comfort thanks to his spinal complaint that is a very clever fellow reflected the old man when burns had started on his errand a bit too religious to suit my taste still he seemed grateful for the little i did for him if he had a little more push and getupandget about him he would succeed better why he isnt more than forty and he confesses himself a failure why at forty i considered myself a young man and was full of dash and enterprise now i am sixty and tied to my seat by this spinal trouble however ive got something laid by and old as i am i feel independent as far as money goes half an hour an hour passed and still the old man found himself alone his messenger had not come back but there came up the path a tall muscular figure who greeted the old man in a bluff off hand way how are you luke said the old man i was feeling lonely i am glad to see you have you been alone since morning not quite all the time i had quite a long call from a stranger a stranger repeated luke suspiciously what was his appearance the old man described burns and luke knew him at once what did he say to you that reminds me he said he knew the boy whom horace has put in the store young ray did he yes and he doesnt speak well of him what does he say about him i dont like to tell you luke for i believe he is a protege of yours dont mind that if there is anything to be said unfavorable of ernest i ought to know it he says the boy robbed a store in which he was employed and then pretended it was entered by thieves it was on that account he says that the boy was compelled to leave the town where he lived and come to california really that is very interesting to my own personal knowledge the boy was never before employed in a store and he came out to california with me then what could the man mean i cant say i can only tell you that he is a professional thief look quick luke and see if my gold watch is hanging on a nail near the cupboard no it is not there then the rascal must have stolen it i gave him besides a mexican dollar to buy some eggs at the store i dont think you will ever see it again unless i catch the thief as i may tonight chapter xxx a burglars failure if tom burns had been more prudent he would have made good his escape with the money and gold watch he had already secured but he was too greedy for gain he pictured to himself the store with its goodly stock of money taken in during the day and he felt an irresistible craving for it there might be one or two hundred dollars and no one in charge but a boy whom he could easily overpower apart from the pecuniary gain he felt that he should enjoy getting the best of ernest who had already foiled him at oak forks this time he will come out second best chuckled burns to himself then he laughed when he remembered how his appearance had puzzled ernest it was a good idea growin a beard he said to himself seems to have disguised me pretty well the boy thought he had seen me before but he couldnt make out where the next time hell know me i reckon i must keep out of the way till night he said to himself it wont do for me to be seen prowlin round the settlement he retired a mile or two among the hills and waited impatiently for night to come it is lucky that the old man gave me a meal he reflected otherwise i should be about starved i wonder if that watch is worth much he examined the watch and decided that its value was probably not far from a hundred dollars in fact the old man had bought it in st louis and had selected a highpriced article it did occur to burns that perhaps he had better remain satisfied with what he had got for the watch would probably bring him fifty dollars at a sacrifice sale but the temptation to stay was too strong it would be a sin to give up such a fine chance he reflected theres next to no risk and i may get two hundred dollars then he began to consider what he would do in that case he decided that he would go to san francisco and see what pickings he could find there he had already found out that mining men and others in the far west were more careless about their money than those in the east probably because money came easier i did well when i came out here he said to himself in a tone of congratulation ill make hay while the sun shines meanwhile though he did not know it his visit was expected and preparations were being made to receive him after supper luke robbins came to the store and held a conference with ernest i am going to pass the night with you lad he said i wish you would luke i want to help you do the honors to my old friend burns perhaps he wont call if he knows whats best for himself he wont but he will be like the foolish moth and wont be contented till he has singed his wings i will look about me and see where to bestow myself for the night ernest occupied a bed in the rear of the store just behind one of the counters it was near a window in the rear of the building ill take that bed ernest and you can find another place shall i fasten the window no i am going to make it easy for my friend burns to get in whether he will find it as easy to get out will be another matter nothing was said to the miners about the presence of a thief in the settlement at that time there was no toleration for thieves the punishment visited upon them was short sharp and decisive the judge most in favor was judge lynch and woe be to the offender who ventured to interfere with the rights of property had luke breathed a word about burns half a dozen miners would have volunteered to stand guard and would thus have interfered with tom burns visit i want to keep all the fun to myself ernest said luke well give him a lesson he wont soon forget if i told the boys theyd hang him up in short order i dont want to take the fellows life but ill give him a firstclass scare it was about ten minutes of twelve when tom burns leaving his place of concealment walked with eager steps towards the mining settlement the one street was not illuminated for oreville had not got along as far as that the moon gave an indistinct light relieving the night of a part of its gloom burns looked from one cabin to another with a wistful glance i suppose some of these miners have got a lot of gold dust hidden away in their shanties he said to himself i wish i knew where i could light on some of their treasure if i only knew which cabin to choose but then it occurred to him that every miner was probably armed and would make it dangerous to any intruder so tom burns kept on his way he was troubled by no conscientious scruples he had got beyond that long ago sometimes it did occur to him to wonder how it would seem to settle down as a man of respectability and influence taking a prominent part in the affairs of town and church it might have been he muttered my father was a man of that sort why not i if i hadnt gone wrong in my early days if i had not been tempted of the devil to rob the storekeeper for whom i worked and so made myself an outcast and a pariah who knows but i might have been at this moment thomas burns esq of some municipality instead of tom burns the tramp however it is foolish to speculate about this i am what i am and there is little chance of my being anything else so he dismissed the past and recalled the work he had set for himself everything was still in the mining village probably there was not a person awake it was like a dead town everything seemed favorable to his designs there was the store he could see it already and now there was nothing to do but to get in and take the money which he had no doubt was waiting ready to his hand perhaps he might be fortunate enough to secure it without waking the boy he hoped so at any rate for he was not a desperate or cruel man he did not wish to injure ernest unless it should be absolutely necessary if he could get along without it so much the better arriving at his destination he paused to reconsider he did not expect to enter by the front door he did not as yet know whether there was any other but at any rate there must be a window somewhere and he preferred to get in that way he walked around to the rear of the store and there he discovered the window he had been afraid it might be blockaded with shelves which would make entrance difficult but fortunately this did not appear to be the case he stood at the window and looked in illustration he stood at the window and looked in the faint moonlight did not enable him to penetrate the interior very far but he could make out something there were goods of various kinds scattered about and he could just see a recumbent figure on a bed near the counter thats the boy he said to himself i wonder if he is asleep there did not seem to be any doubt on this point but for the indistinct light tom burns might have thought the outstretched figure rather large for a boy but he only glanced at it furtively the next thing to consider was whether the window was fastened in that case he would have some difficulty though for this he was prepared having an instrument with which he could cut a pane of glass and thrusting in his hand unfasten the catch but through some strange inadvertence apparently the window was not locked and much to his relief he had no difficulty in lifting it in this way he made his entrance into the store he was as careful as possible fearing lest he might stumble over some article and by the noise betray his presence what if there was a dog inside this thought brought alarm to the burglar in that case his visit would probably be a failure he remembered however with a feeling of relief that he had seen no dog about during his visit to the store now that he had passed through the window and was fairly in the store he looked round for the moneydrawer he had not seen the safe or probably he might not have entered the store at all for he was not expert in breaking open safes and at any rate it would be a matter of time and difficulty so he was looking about when as he passed by the bed he felt himself seized by the leg evidently the sleeper had awakened and discovered his presence burns got down on his knees and grasped the recumbent by the throat lie still or ill choke you he said fiercely but as he spoke he felt the rough beard of a man and with dismay he realized that he had tackled a more formidable foe than the boy for whom he was prepared he then felt himself seized with an iron grasp illustration he stood at the window and looked in ive got you you rascally burglar were the words he heard and gave himself up for lost who are you he asked faintly i am luke robbins and i know you of old you are tom burns chapter xxxi the advertisement if there was any one of whom tom burns stood in fear it was luke robbins when he found himself in the grasp of his dreaded enemy he grew weak with terror it was no longer a question of successful robbery it was a matter of personal safety well what have you to say for yourself demanded luke tightening his grasp have mercy on me mr robbins dont kill me ejaculated burns half choked what did you come here for i i had no money and you thought you could get some here that is the explanation yees faltered burns you thought you would be more than a match for the boy well you have no boy to deal with i know that very well confessed burns how long have you been in oreville i only came this morning you have improved your time said luke dryly you have stolen a gold watch besides making this attempt at robbery tom burns could not deny it though he was surprised at lukes knowledge he did not reply hand over that watch said luke in a tone of authority will you let me go if i do i will make no conditions with you hand over that watch burns drew it from his inside pocket and handed it over humph so far so good now how about that dollar you took to buy eggs it is the only money i have except a few pennies please let me keep it if i tell the miners what you have done you wont need any more money said luke grimly why not asked burns trembling why not repeated luke because they will hang you to the nearest tree you wont need to trouble about money matters after that you wont give me up mr robbins pleaded burns in an agony of terror i i am not fit to die besides i am a young man i am not yet forty i will turn over a new leaf i will truly its high time you did it is a long time since you earned an honest living i know it mr robbins i have been a bad man but it is not too late to reform if youll let me go i will leave oreville tonight and i will never trouble you again it isnt me you have troubled it is the boy you robbed him or tried to do it at oak forks and now you have turned up here i didnt know he was here truly i didnt you didnt know i was here or i think you would have given the place a wide berth i am very sorry for what i did and if youll only spare my life ill promise to reform i havent much faith in your promises but ill leave it to the boy ernest what shall i do with this man ernest had come forward and was standing but a few feet from luke and his captive if he promises to reform said ernest youd better give him another chance luke i am not sure that i ought to but it is you to whom he has done the most harm if you give him over to the miners we shall never be troubled by him again tom burns turned pale for he knew that life and death were in the balance and that those two luke and the boy were to decide his fate ernest could not help pitying the trembling wretch he was naturally kind hearted and at that moment he felt that he could forgive burns all that he had done since you have left it to me luke he said let him go it shall be as you say ernest as he spoke he released his hold and tom burns stood erect he breathed a deep sigh of relief may i go he asked submissively yes before leaving he turned to ernest you are a goodhearted boy he said and i shall not forget that you have saved my life if i am ever able to do anything for you i will do it you will find that tom burns bad as he has been knows how to be grateful i think you mean what you say returned ernest i hope you will keep your promise and will turn over a new leaf is it true that you are penniless not quite this is all i have burns drew from his pocket a handful of small change less than a dollar in all and held it out for inspection then i will help you along ernest took from his pocket a fivedollar gold piece and offered it to the tramp that is more than i would do for him said luke it is more than i deserve replied burns but you wont be sorry for your kindness if ever you see me again i shall be a different man he passed out of the window and they saw him no more luke and ernest said very little of their nights adventure but the gold watch and the mexican dollar were returned to the man from whom they had been taken six months passed oreville had doubled its population the mines had yielded a large sum in gold dust and the store presided over by ernest was considerably enlarged his services had been so satisfactory that horace ames whose time was taken up elsewhere had raised his share of the profits to one half at the end of six months besides defraying his expenses ernest found himself possessed of a thousand dollars luke i feel rich said he when his faithful friend came round for a chat youve done better than i have rejoined luke the most i have been able to scrape together is four hundred dollars i will give you a part of my money so that we may be even no you won t ernest what do you take me for i should be ashamed to touch any of your hard earnings they are not hard earnings luke mr ames has been very liberal and that is why i have got so much i dont feel that i ought to have so much more than you dont bother about me lad i feel rich with four hundred dollars i never was worth so much before though im almost three times your age and i wouldnt have that but for you how do you make that out luke because i never had any ambition till i met you i never thought of saving money as long as i got enough to eat i cared for nothing else i should have died without enough to bury me if you had not set me the example of putting something by for a rainy day i am glad if i have done you any good luke for you have been a kind friend to me a week later luke came into the store holding a letter in his hand here is a letter for you ernest he said i was passing the postoffice just now when i was hailed by the postmaster who asked me if i would take the letter to you i didnt know that you had any correspondents nor i luke i think it is the first letter i ever received whom can it be from from some one who knows you are here it is postmarked st louis well i can easily discover who wrote it said ernest as he cut open the envelope with his penknife he turned at once to the signature and exclaimed in great surprise why its from tom burns the man who tried to rob the store yes he has probably written to ask you for some money no luke you are mistaken i will read it to you the letter started thus ernest ray you will probably be surprised to hear from me let me begin by saying that i have kept the promise i made to you and mr robbins when you let me off six months ago i have turned over a new leaf and have been strictly honest ever since as i promised you i would be i wont trouble you with an account of my struggles to get along i will only say that i am employed at present as a waiter at the planters hotel and though i cant save up much money i am able to live comfortable but you will wonder why i am writing to you it is because i have seen your name mentioned in an advertisement in one of the st louis daily papers i inclose the advertisement and hope it is something to your advantage i have taken the liberty to write to mr bolton telling him where you were six months since and now i write to you so that you may communicate with him also yours respectfully tom burns the advertisement appended ran thus information wanted should this meet the eye of ernest ray some time residing at oak forks iowa he is requested to communicate with benjamin bolton attorneyatlaw nassau street new york city chapter xxxii mr bolton as a hustler when benjamin bolton left the house of stephen ray with a hundred dollars in his pocket it was with the clearlydefined purpose in his mind to find the boy who had been so grossly wronged and force the present holder of the ray estate to make restitution but he was not yet in a position to move in the matter only a few hours previous he had been nearly penniless even now though he was provided with a sum of money that made him feel comparatively rich he knew that it would not last very long clearly he must obtain employment he provided himself with a respectable suit of clothing and took the next train for new york he had been in the metropolis two or three times in the course of his life but he knew no one there he must push his own way without help while other paths might be open to him for he was a man of education and worldly experience he felt that he should like to get back into his own profession he flattered himself that if properly started he could make himself valuable to an established attorney in the way of hunting up cases and taking part in any description of legal work that might be intrusted to him but how could he a man altogether unknown recommend himself to any lawyer whose standing and business would make a connection with him desirable perhaps in any other business there would be less difficulty in making a start but mr bolton was resolute and determined and fortune favored him within thirty miles of the city a stout gentleman of perhaps fifty entered the car and sat down beside him he looked like a welltodo business man prosperous and free from care but for the anxious expression on his face he appeared like a man in trouble who stood in need of advice the train had gone several miles before he made up his mind to confide in the quietlooking man who sat beside him he had already taken stock of bolton in several furtive glances before he decided to speak of the matter that troubled him there is something on his mind thought bolton he looks as if he wished to speak to some one he addressed a casual remark to his companion who instantly responded i dont like to trouble you he said but i am somewhat perplexed my dear sir if in any way i can help you i shall be glad to do so answered bolton i am a lawyer are you said the other eagerly i want to meet a good honest and smart lawyer who will undertake a case for me bolton pricked up his ears this seemed to be a providential opportunity of which he resolved to avail himself i should not like to praise myself he said modestly but i think you would find me faithful to your interests no doubt of it sir are you a new york lawyer i am about to connect myself with a law firm in the city answered bolton heartily hoping that this statement might prove accurate then you will be able to help me state your case if you dont mind bolton took out a small memorandum book and pencil in hand sat ready to take down the important points you must know sir that twenty years ago my father died leaving an estate of fifty thousand dollars it was divided equally between my sister martha and myself i married and martha for the last twenty years has been a member of my family being a spinster with only herself to provide for her property has doubled while i having several children have barely held my own of course i expected that my children and my self would inherit marthas money when she died very natural sir and very just well martha died last august imagine my dismay when her will was opened and proved to bequeath her entire estate to various charities in which she never took any particular interest when living do you suspect any one of influencing her to this disposition of her property yes she had had various conversations with a collector for these societies who resided in the town during the summer and who sought an introduction when he learned that she was a lady of independent fortune he called frequently and flattered up my poor sister who between ourselves had lately shown signs of mental weakness did she cut off your family entirely in her will yes she didnt leave even a dollar to any one of my children though one of my daughters was named for her was the collector entitled to a commission on sums secured for the societies which he rep resented yes that is the cause of his zeal he would make a very handsome percentage on an estate as large as my sisters but for him would she have been likely to cut off her relatives no we should probably have received every dollar do you think the collector cherished any matrimonial designs with reference to your sister i did think so at one time but marthas condition as an invalid led her to discourage his attentions though she was evidently flattered by them of course you wish to break the will yes do you think it can be done upon the basis of what you have told me i should think the chances were greatly in your favor his companion brightened up very perceptibly at this assurance have you ever been employed in any similar cases he asked my dear sir i have an important case of the kind on my hands at this moment the amount involved is a quarter of a million dollars mr bolton rose greatly in the estimation of his new client after he had made this statement is the case at all similar hardly it is the case of a will concealed or rather suppressed and acting upon a will previously made i cannot go into details for obvious reasons as i wish to keep our enemy in the dark i understand have you your card with you so that i can call at your office this was a puzzling question for bolton but he was equal to the occasion tell me what hotel you propose to stop at and i will call upon you at eleven oclock tomorrow morning i dont know much about the new york hotels then let me recommend a house naming a comfortable but not expensive hostelry on upper broadway i will go there i think you have not yet mentioned your name my name is ephraim paulding bolton noted it down in his memorandumbook and soon after the train ran into the station at fortysecond street there was no time to be lost bolton made inquiries and obtained the name of a successful goahead lawyer having an office at nassau street he did not wait till the next day but made a call that same evening at his house on lexington avenue mr norcross the lawyer entered the parlor with boltons card in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face have i ever met you before mr bolton he asked no sir please state your business i should like to enter your office i am a lawyer with fifteen years experience i should hardly think so considering the strange and i may say unprecedented proposal you are making i am quite aware that it seems so but i can make it worth your while how by bringing you business i can put in your hands now a will case involving an estate of fifty thousand dollars and further on probably a much more important case you seem to be a hustler i am where has your professional life been spent asked norcross at elmira now i wish to remove to this city it will give me a larger and more profitable field give me some idea of the case you say you can put in my hands bolton did so his terse and crisp statement for he was really a man of ability interested the lawyer and disposed him favorably toward the matter the result of the interview was that he engaged bolton at a small salary and a commission on business brought to the office for a period of three months thank you said bolton as he rose to go you will not regret this step the next morning bolton brought his rail road acquaintance to the office and mr norcross formally undertook his case i think we shall win he said it is an aggravated case of undue influence mr bolton will from time to time communicate to you the steps we have taken it is unnecessary to go into details it is enough to say that the will was broken and a goodly sum found its way to the coffers of lawyer norcross by this time benjamin bolton had established himself in the favor of his employer who at the end of three months made a new and much more advantageous arrangement bolton had not as yet taken any steps in ernests case but he now felt that the time had come to do so he wrote to the postmaster at oak forks inquiring if he knew a boy named ernest ray but learned in reply that ernest had left the place some months before and had not since been heard from chapter xxxiii the result of an advertisement the advertisement for ernest in a st louis daily paper came about in this way bolton was in the habit of inquiring from time to time of western clients if they were acquainted with any persons bearing the name of ray one gentleman who frequently visited st louis answered yes i know a boy named ray tell me all you know about him said bolton eagerly i was staying at the southern hotel last winter answered mr windham when my attention was called to a brightlooking newsboy who sold the evening newspapers outside i was so attracted by him that i inquired his name he said it was ray and that he was alone in the world what was his first name i cant recall i am not sure that i heard it was it ernest very possibly but as i said before i cannot speak with any certainty how old did the boy appear to be about sixteen that would have been the age of dudley rays son said bolton to himself i suppose you didnt learn where the boy lived no this was all the information mr windham was able to impart but bolton felt that it was possibly of importance it was in fact the first clue he had been able to obtain that dudley rays son should be forced by dire necessity to sell newspapers was not in the least improbable he went to an advertising agency and inserted the advertisement already mentioned a few days later he received two letters postmarked st louis he opened them with a thrill of excitement he felt that he was on the verge of making an important discovery one letter was addressed in a schoolboy hand and ran thus dear sir i saw your advertisement in one of the morning papers i hope it means me my name is not ernest but it may have been changed by some people with whom i lived in nebraska i am sixteen years old and am a poor boy obliged to earn my living by selling papers my father died when i was a baby and my mother three years later so i am alone in the world and i am having a hard time i suppose you wouldnt advertise for me unless you had some good news for me you may send your answer to this letter to the southern hotel the clerk is a friend of mine and he says he will save it for me yours respectfully arthur ray that isnt the boy said bolton laying down the letter in disappointment the name is different and besides the writer says that his father died when he was a baby of course that settles the question he is a different boy he opened the second letter hoping that it might be more satisfactory it was the letter of tom burns setting forth his meeting ernest at oak forks and afterwards running across him at oreville in california eureka exclaimed bolton his face beaming with exultation this is the boy and no mistake i will at once answer this letter and also write to ernest ray in california this was the letter received by burns dear sir i am very much indebted to you for the information contained in your letter of two days since i have reason to think that the boy you mention is the one of whom i am in search if it proves to be so i am free to tell you that he will be much benefited by your communication there is a considerable estate now wrongfully held by another to which he is entitled should things turn out as i hope and expect i will see that you lose nothing by the service you have rendered him and myself i will write to him by this mail should you change your address please notify me yours truly benjamin bolton nassau street new york the letter written to ernest ran thus ernest ray oreville california i have for some time been seeking to find you finally in response to an advertisement inserted in a st louis daily paper i learn that you are at present living in oreville california this information was given me by one thomas burns who is employed at the planters hotel the name is i hope familiar to you it is very desirable that i should have an interview with you if you are the son of dudley ray formerly residing at or near elmira what i have to say will be greatly to your advantage will you write me at once letting me know whether this is the case also state your present circumstances and whether you need pecuniary help it is unfortunate that we are so far apart i am connected with a new york legal firm and can not very well go to california but i might assist you to come to new york if as i suppose your means are limited will you write to me at once whether this is the case i shall anxiously await your reply benjamin bolton attorneyatlaw nassau street new york city ernest read this letter with eager interest and showed it to luke robbins what do you think of it luke he asked what do i think of it it looks very much as if you were entitled to some money what shall i do write this mr bolton that you will go at once to new york and call upon him but how about the store i should not like to leave mr ames in the lurch i will take your place here and in order to qualify myself for it i will come in to morrow and begin to serve an apprenticeship ernest wrote to bolton that he would start for new york in a week he added that he had the money necessary for the journey he said also that he was the son of dudley ray and that he remembered visiting elmira with his father when bolton received this letter he exclaimed triumphantly now stephen ray i have you on the hip you looked down upon me when i called upon you in your pride and your unjust possession of wealth you thought me beneath your notice unless i am greatly mistaken i shall be the instrument under providence of taking from you your illgotten gains and carrying out the wishes expressed in the last will of your deceased uncle chapter xxxiv a strange meeting ernest left oreville with four hundred dollars in his pocket the balance of his money he left in the hands of his friend horace ames upon whom he was authorized to draw if he should have need i dont intend to carry all my money with me he said to luke robbins i might lose it even if you did ernest you could draw on me if you need it do so without any hesitation you are a good friend luke said ernest warmly what should i do without you i am beginning to wonder what i shall do without you ernest suppose now this lawyer puts a fortune in your hands if he does luke i am sure to need your help in some way i will see that we are not separated thank you ernest i know you mean what you say you may find a better friend but you wont find one that is more ready to serve you than luke robbins i am sure of that luke said ernest with a bright smile as he pressed the rough hand of his faithful friend ernest did not loiter on his way though he was tempted to stop in chicago but he reflected that he would have plenty of chances to visit that bustling city after his business had been attended to as he approached buffalo on the train his attention was attracted to two persons sitting in front of him they were a father and son as he gathered from the conversation the son was about his own age and size apparently but rather more slender in figure he had a peevish expression and ernest doubted whether he would like him father ernest heard him say wont you give me a little money i am dead broke the father frowned i gave you five dollars when we set out on this journey he said well five dollars wont last forever was the pert rejoinder it ought to last more than four days clarence ernest started he knew that his cousins name was clarence could this be stephen ray and his son even if it were so he felt that it would not be advisable to make himself known this business which was carrying him to new york might bring him into conflict with stephen ray if so he would not care to let his presence be known on arriving at buffalo ernest left the train he had never visited niagara and being now so near he felt that he could not forego the opportunity he registered at the tefft house and decided to remain twentyfour hours this would give him time to see the falls ernest had a room assigned him and went up to it at once in order to have the luxury of a good wash five minutes afterwards stephen ray and his son clarence entered the hotel mr ray in a pompous manner went up to the desk and said to the clerk can you give me a good room yes sir i want a front room if you have it i cant give you a front room but i can give you a good side room stephen ray grumbled a little but finally decided to take the room offered him he saw that his haughty manner did not impress the clerk who was accustomed to men of his class clarence looked over his fathers shoulder as he registered why pa he exclaimed in surprise theres another guest of our name where asked his father there three names above your signature stephen ray looked at the register and started violently as he read the entry ernest ray oreville california whats the matter pa asked clarence noticing his fathers agitation oh nothing nothing answered his father with an effort havent we a cousin named ernest ray we had but he is dead it is strange that there should be another person of the name not at all the world is large and there are probably a good many persons of one name this one is from california so i see by the way here mr ray addressed the clerk did you observe the person who registered under the name of ray yes it is a boy about the size of this young gentleman it is strange said clarence it may be our cousin didnt i tell you that the person you refer to is dead said his father testily i dont believe it thought clarence but he did not express his unbelief he determined however to have an interview with the boy and find out for himself all about him he saw ernest at the table soon after and so did stephen ray the latter noted with alarm the resemblance of the boy to his cousin dudley ray whose estate he had usurped i hope bolton wont get hold of him he said to himself it would be bad for me after supper mr ray went out leaving clarence to himself he improved the opportunity seeing ernest sitting alone he went up to him is your name ray he asked yes ernest ray my name is clarence ray so i thought we are cousins thats what i told pa but he said it was not so that ernest ray was dead your fathers name is stephen ray yes i have known of him and you since i was old enough to remember anything then you are really my cousin ernest yes i wonder why pa said you were dead i will tell pa he is mistaken no clarence i would rather you wouldnt there are reasons why it is better not to say anything about it all right are you well off ernest smiled i am not rich he said but i am comfortably fixed do you live in california i have lived there for the last few months why did you come east on a little business i am glad you are well off i think pa was afraid you were a poor relation your father is rich yes ever so rich weve got a fine place near elmira if pa wasnt so cranky i would invite you there to visit me thank you all the same said ernest smiling later in the evening when stephen ray came in ernest noticed that he looked at him critically he too examined the man who he had reason to believe was enjoying the estates that should be his and was not attracted towards him what will he say thought ernest when i make a formal demand for the property what in the name of all thats unlucky can have brought that boy here at this time stephen ray was saying to himself he never for an instant doubted ernests identity in fact he could not well have done so for he bore a strong resemblance to dudley ray who had been a strikingly handsome man very much the superior of stephen in personal attractions stephen rays curiosity was excited ernest did not appear like the average poor relation he was quite as well dressed as clarence besides he had registered at a highpriced hotel and this alone showed that he was not cramped for means this gave him some satisfaction as it made it less likely that he would appeal to him for assistance stephen ray was rather surprised that clarence made no further reference to ernest had he known that the two had had a conversation he would have been seriously disturbed he only hoped that bolton would not get hold of the boy chapter xxxv mr bolton and his client benjamin bolton sat at his desk in the law office of albert norcross on nassau street he was well even handsomely dressed and looked very unlike the shabby tramp who had called months before at the house of stephen ray he was really a man of ability and this his employer had found out he had raised boltons salary to a liberal figure and felt that in securing his services he had made a real acquisition bolton was absorbed in preparation for a case which had been assigned to him when a boy came to his desk with a card bolton no sooner read the name ernest ray than he became eager and excited tell him to come in he said ernest quiet and selfpossessed entered the office and approached the lawyers desk are you mr bolton he asked yes and you i am ernest ray benjamin bolton looked keenly at the boy admiring his handsome face and manly bearing i see your fathers looks in you he said then you knew my father said ernest eagerly yes we were young men together i am glad to meet you then you come from california yes i judge from your appearance that you have not suffered from poverty i have been fortunate at oreville at oak forks i lived very humbly with peter brant an old servant of my father yes i remember peter is he alive still no he died a little less than a year since till his death i thought him my uncle and knew no other relatives before he died he told me who i was how did he live on a small sum left by my father when he died it was all exhausted except a hundred dollars i took that and went to california with a man named luke robbins who has proved my faithful friend what were you doing in california were you working at the mines no i was keeping a store where i sold miners supplies did it pay you well i was very well paid for a boy when i left oreville i was worth a thousand dollars that is well but it is only a drop in the bucket compared with the fortune you are entitled to now held by mr stephen ray yes he will be surprised to see you here in the east he has seen me said ernest quickly what exclaimed the lawyer you have not called upon him no i met him on the train and afterwards at a buffalo hotel my cousin clarence was with him did you have any conference with them i talked with clarence not with his father did you think the father knew you yes but he did not speak to me he told me when i called upon him some time ago that you were dead that you had died in georgia what could have been his object he did not wish me to find you for i had the proof that the estate was rightfully yours what led you to think i was alive i crossexamined clarence who did not know his fathers desire to keep us apart is the estate a large one quarter of a million at least ernests eyes opened wide with amazement but i will introduce you to mr norcross my principal and we will talk over our plan of operations you must assert your rights and demand that your grandfathers will be carried out are you content to place yourself in our hands entirely so but i am sorry for cousin stephen it will be a great blow to him dont waste any pity upon him he defrauded your father and meant to defraud you chapter xxxvi an important interview a gentleman to see you sir this was the message brought to stephen ray by the servant one morning did he give his name no sir very well bring him up mr ray was sitting at the desk in his library he was looking over some plans for the improvement of his already handsome residence he proposed to enlarge a lower room by a baywindow and to carry the piazza round on each side it would cost something but his income was ample at least four times his expenditure he looked up as a handsomely dressed gentleman entered the room what is your business sir asked stephen ray formally the visitor smiled you dont recognize me stephen ray he said benjamin bolton exclaimed the other his countenance changing the same i judge from your appearance that your circumstances have improved said mr ray coldly fortunately yes you have probably come to receive my congratulations well i congratulate you thank you the money you kindly loaned me when i was last here did me a great deal of good i presume you have come to repay it said ray with a sneer you are right and bolton drew from his pocket two fiftydollar bills which he tendered to his host stephen ray was fond of money and he received the notes with satisfaction you have acted honorably he said more graciously are you located in the neighborhood mr bolton no in new york city i am in a law office there i am pleased with your success i would ask you to remain but i am busy this morning excuse me mr ray but the repayment of the loan was not my only errand i am here on more important business stephen rays countenance changed he began to fear that bolton had found ernest well he said stiffly when i was here last year you told me that dudley rays son ernest was dead yes he died in alabama when i was here before you told me he died in georgia i believe it was in georgia said stephen ray disconcerted you will be glad to hear that it is a mistake about his death i mean he is as much alive as you are mr bolton said ray angrily you are trying to impose upon me the boy is dead i tell you and i tell you he is not dead i saw him only yesterday you may have seen some one who pretended to be ernest ray i should not be easily deceived he is the image of his father i dont believe the boy is alive shall i bring him here you need not trouble yourself i can have nothing to say to him whether he is really ernest ray or an impostor i beg your pardon if he is ernest ray under the will which i have in my possession he is the owner of this property bolton spoke firmly and looked ray resolutely in the eye stephen ray flushed and then paled there was a great fear in his heart but he resolved to brave it out this is a base conspiracy he ejaculated your share in it ought to land you in states prison i am willing to take my chance of it said the lawyer calmly didnt you recognize the boy when you saw him what do you mean you saw him in the hotel at buffalo he recognized you and had a conversation with your son had a conversation with clarence that is a lie clarence never spoke to me about it you had better question him but there is no need of sparring i tell you confidently that ernest ray is alive and demands the estate which you hold under his grandfathers will this is simply ridiculous of course there is but one answer to such a proposal and what is that i refuse absolutely to make any concession to an impostor that is your final answer it is then i give you notice that the boy will at once bring suit for the restoration of the estate and the vindication of his rights i suppose you are his lawyer sneered ray the firm with which i am connected has undertaken the case what is the firm asked stephen ray with an anxiety which he could not conceal norcross co answered bolton great drops of perspiration appeared on the brow of stephen ray he knew very well the high reputation and uniform success of the firm in question he did not immediately answer but began to pace the room in agitation finally he spoke i dont know what to say this has come upon me as a surprise i thought the boy dead i may be willing to make some arrangement bring him here some day next week say tuesday and we will talk the matter over you must do something more than talk the matter over stephen ray a great injustice has been done and the wrong must be righted come here next tuesday was the only answer made the lawyer bowed and withdrew chapter xxxvii conclusion on tuesday bolton returned with ernest two hours were spent in conference with stephen ray the latter fought hard but had to yield in the end he understood perfectly well the strength of his opponents case ernest consented to receive the estate as it was bequeathed to his father without any demand for back revenues whatever stephen ray had accumulated besides he was allowed to retain as this amounted to a hundred thousand dollars ray felt that it might have been worse had he not been dissuaded by bolton ernest would have consented to share the estate with the usurper but the lawyer represented that this would be condoning the wrong done to his father in a month the whole matter was settled and stephen ray departed removing to chicago in which city he had some business interests but what shall i do with this large house asked ernest i dont want to live here i know of a gentleman who would like to hire it for term of years responded bolton he will pay a rental of five thousand dollars a year the bonds which you inherit will yield an income equally large so that my income will be ten thousand dollars a year said ernest dazzled yes what shall i do with it all bolton smiled you are but seventeen he said a few years hence you will probably marry then you can occupy the house yourself meanwhile i will go back to california luke will expect me while i am away i appoint you my man of business i wish you to have charge of my property at a proper commission i will undertake the charge with pleasure bolton knew how much this would increase his importance in the eyes of the firm by which he was employed still ernest could not have made a better choice bolton was no longer intemperate he was shrewd and keen and loyal to his young employer ernest returned to california but he had lost his old zest for business now that his fortune was secure he soon came east again and entered upon a plan of systematic study ending with a collegiate course he brought with him frank fox the son of the dead outlaw who regarded him with devoted affection they lived together and he placed frank at a wellknown school justly noted for the success of its pupils of the many boys with whom frank was associated not one suspected that the attractive lad who was a favorite with all was a son of the noted desperado whose deeds had been commemorated in dime novels and were a matter of common knowledge in the west ernest had cautioned the boy to say as little as possible of his past history years have gone by and what bolton predicted has come to pass ernest is a young man a college graduate and he will soon be married to a young lady of high position in the city of new york he will go abroad for a year and on his return will take up his home on his ancestral estate last week he received a letter from a patient in a new york city hospital it was signed john franklin a name with which he was not familiar in some wonder he answered the call and was led to a bed on which lay a gaunt spectral man evidently in the last stage of existence is this john franklin asked ernest doubtfully that is the name i go by now answered the dying man do i know you have i ever met you yes i dont remember you if i tell you my real name will you keep it secret yes then i am john fox what the noted outlaw i am all that is left of him you will not betray me no certainly not can i do anything for you yes you were left the guardian of my brothers child yes is he alive is he well yes will you bring him here will you let me see him before i die i will i cannot refuse the request of a dying man so ernest brought frank to the bedside of his dying uncle it was a sad interview frank was moved but john fox seeing him strong handsome robust felt comforted he at least has profited by the fate that overtook his father and myself i shall die content for i leave him in good hands dont let him think too hardly of us i will not and so far as i can compass it his future life shall be happy the dying outlaw reached out his hand and pressed ernests gratefully a day later and he was dead the john c

open in these books in a most successful manner apart from the qualities that render the series so attractive to all young readers they have great value on account of their portraitures of american

class it was our custom to go on the recitation seat every day with clean slates and we were allowed ten minutes to write seventy words on any subject the teacher thought suited to our capacity one day he gave out what a man would see if he went to greenland my heart was in the matter and before the ten minutes were up i had one side of my slate filled the teacher listened to the reading of our compositions and when they were all over he simply said some of you will make your living by writing one of these days that gave me something to ponder upon i did not say so out loud but i knew that my composition was as good as the best of them by the way there was another thing that came in my way just then i was reading at that time one of mayne reids works which i had drawn from the library and i pondered upon it as much as i did upon what the teacher said to me in introducing swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression no visible change was observable in swartboys countenance now it occurred to me that if a man of his education could make such a blunder as that and still write a book i ought to be able to do it too i went home that very day and began a story the old guides narrative which was sent to the new york weekly and came back respectfully declined it was written on both sides of the sheets but i didnt know that this was against the rules nothing abashed i began another and receiving some instruction from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store i wrote it on only one side of the paper but mind you he didnt know what i was doing nobody knew it but one day after a hard saturdays work the other boys had been out skating on the brickpond i shyly broached the subject to my mother i felt the need of some sympathy she listened in amazement and then said why do you think you could write a book like that that settled the matter and from that day no one knew what i was up to until i sent the first four volumes of gunboat series to my father was it work
