 the telegraph boy chapter i a young carpetbagger twentyfive cents to begin the world with reflected frank kavanagh drawing from his vestpocket two tencent pieces of currency and a nickel that isnt much but it will have to do the speaker a boy of fifteen was sitting on a bench in cityhall park he was apparently about fifteen years old with a face not handsome but frank and goodhumored and an expression indicating an energetic and hopeful temperament a small bundle rolled up in a handkerchief contained his surplus wardrobe he had that day arrived in new york by a boat from hartford and meant to stay in the city if he could make a living next to him sat a man of thirtyfive shabbily dressed who clearly was not a member of any temperance society if an inflamed countenance and red nose may be trusted frank kavanaghs display of money attracted his attention for small as was the boys capital it was greater than his own been long in the city johnny he inquired i only arrived today answered frank my name isnt johnny though its immaterial johnny is a generic term said the stranger i suppose you have come here to make your fortune i shall be satisfied with a living to begin with said frank where did you come from a few miles from hartford got any relations there yes an uncle and aunt i suppose you were sorry to leave them not much uncle is a pretty good man but hes fond of money and aunt is about as mean as they make em they got tired of supporting me and gave me money enough to get to new york i suppose you have some left said the stranger persuasively twentyfive cents answered frank laughing that isnt a very big capital to start on is it is that all youve got asked the shabbily dressed stranger in a tone of disappointment every cent i wish i had ten dollars to give you said the stranger thoughtfully thank you sir i wish you had said frank his eyes resting on the dilapidated attire of his benevolent companion judging from that he was not surprised that ten dollars exceeded the charitable fund of the philanthropist my operations in wall street have not been fortunate of late resumed the stranger and i am in consequence hard up do you do business in wall street asked frank rather surprised sometimes was the reply i have lost heavily of late in erie and pacific mail but it is only temporary i shall soon be on my feet again i hope so sir said frank politely my career has been a chequered one continued the stranger i too as a mere boy came up from the country to make my fortune i embarked in trade and was for a time successful i resigned to get time to write a play a comedy in five acts frank regarded his companion with heightened respect he was a boy of good education and the author of a play in his eyes was a man of genius was it played he inquired no wallack said it had too many difficult characters for his company and the rest of the managers kept putting me off while they were producing inferior plays the american public will never know what they have lost but enough of this sometime i will read you the motherinlaw if you like have you had dinner no answered frank do you know where i can dine cheap he inquired yes answered the stranger once i boarded at the astor house but now i am forced by dire necessity to frequent cheap restaurants follow me what is your name sir asked frank as he rose from the bench montagu percy was the reply sorry i havent my cardcase with me or i would hand you my address i think you said your name was not johnny my name is frank kavanagh a very good name whats in a name as shakespeare says as the oddly assorted pair crossed the street and walked down nassau street they attracted the attention of some of the arabs who were lounging about printinghouse square i say country is that your longlost uncle asked a bootblack no it isnt answered frank shortly though he was willing to avail himself of mr percys guidance he was not ambitious of being regarded as his nephew heed not their ribald scoffs said montagu percy loftily their words pass by me like the idle wind which i regard not who painted your nose mister asked another boy of course addressing franks companion i will hand you over to the next policeman exclaimed percy angrily look out he dont haul you in instead retorted the boy montagu percy made a motion to pursue his tormentors but desisted they are beneath contempt he said it is ever the lot of genius to be railed at by the ignorant and ignoble they referred to my nose being red but mistook the cause it is a cutaneous eruption the result of erysipelas is it asked frank rather mystified i am not a drinking man that is i indulge myself but rarely but here we are so saying he plunged down some steps into a basement frank following him our hero found himself in a dirty apartment provided with a bar over which was a placard inscribed free lunch how much money have you got frank inquired montagu percy twentyfive cents lunch at this establishment is free said montagu but you are expected to order some drink what will you have i dont care for any drink except a glass of water all right i will order for you as the rules of the establishment require it but i will drink your glass myself eat whatever you like frank took a sandwich from a plate on the counter and ate it with relish for he was hungry meanwhile his companion emptied the two glasses and ordered another can you pay for these drinks asked the bartender suspiciously sir i never order what i cannot pay for i dont know about that youve been in here and taken lunch more than once without drinking anything it may be so i will make up for it now another glass please first pay for what you have already drunk frank hand me your money said montagu frank incautiously handed him his small stock of money which he saw instantly transferred to the bartender that is right i believe said montagu percy the barkeeper nodded and percy transferring his attention to the free lunch stowed away a large amount frank observed with some uneasiness the transfer of his entire cash capital to the bartender but concluded that mr percy would refund a part after they went out as they reached the street he broached the subject i didnt agree to pay for both dinners he said uneasily of course not it will be my treat next time that will be fair wont it but i would rather you would give me back a part of my money i may not see you again i will be in the park tomorrow at one oclock give me back ten cents then said frank uneasily that was all the money i had i am really sorry but i havent a penny about me ill make it right tomorrow goodday my young friend be virtuous and you will be happy frank looked after the shabby figure ruefully he felt that he had been taken in and done for his small capital had vanished and he was adrift in the streets of a strange city without a penny chapter ii dick rafferty ive been a fool said frank to himself in genuine mortification as he realized how easily he had permitted himself to be duped i ought to have stayed in the country even a small sum of money imparts to its possessor a feeling of independence but one who is quite penniless feels helpless and apprehensive frank was unable even to purchase an apple from the snuffy old applewoman who presided over the stand near by what am i going to do he asked himself soberly what has become of your uncle asked a bootblack looking up frank recognized one of those who had saluted percy and himself on their way to the restaurant he isnt my uncle he replied rather resentfully you never saw him before did you continued the boy no i didnt thats what i thought there was something significant in the young arabs tone which led frank to inquire do you know him yes hes a deadbeat a what a deadbeat dont you understand english he told me that he did business on wall street the bootblack shrieked with laughter he do business on wall street he repeated youre jolly green you are frank was inclined to be angry but he had the good sense to see that his new friend was right so he said goodhumoredly i suppose i am you see i am not used to the city its just such fellows as you he gets hold of continued the bootblack didnt he make you treat i may as well confess it thought frank this boy may help me with advice yes he said aloud i hadnt but twentyfive cents and he made me spend it all i havent a cent left whew ejaculated the other boy youre beginnin business on a small capital thats so said frank do you know any way i can earn money dick rafferty was a goodnatured boy although rough and now that frank had appealed to him for advice he felt willing to help him if he could what can you do he asked in a businesslike tone have you ever worked yes answered frank what can you do i can milk cows hoe corn and potatoes ride horse to plough and hold up said dick all them things aint goin to do you no good in new york people dont keep cows as a reglar thing here of course i know that and there aint much room for plantin corn and potatoes maybe you could get a job over in jersey id rather stay in new york i can do something here can you black boots or sell papers i can learn you need money to set up in either of them lines said dick rafferty would twentyfive cents have been enough asked frank you could have bought some evening papers with that i wish somebody would lend me some money said frank id pay it back as soon as id sold my papers i was a fool to let that fellow swindle me thats so assented dick but its no good thinkin of that now id lend you the money myself if i had it but ive run out my account at the park bank and cant spare the money just at present how long have you been in business asked frank ever since i was eight years old and im goin on fifteen now you went to work early yes i had to father and mother both died and i was left to take care of myself you took care of yourself when you were only eight years old asked frank in surprise yes then i ought to make a living for i am fifteen a year older than you are now oh youll get along when you get started said dick encouragingly theres lots of things to do is there anything to do that doesnt require any capital inquired frank anxiously yes you can smash baggage will people pay for that asked frank with a smile of course they will you jest hang round the ferries and steamboat landins and when a chap comes by with a valise or carpetbag you jest offer to carry it thats all is that what you call smashing baggage of course what did you think it was frank evaded answering not caring to display his country ignorance do you think i can get a chance to do that he asked you can try it and see i came in by the hartford boat myself today said frank if id thought of it i would have begun at once only you wouldnt have knowed the way anywhere and if a gentleman asked you to carry his valise to any hotel youd have had to ask where it was so i should frank admitted ill show you round a little if you want me to said dick i shant have anything to do for an hour or two i wish you would so the two boys walked about in the lower part of the city dick pointing out hotels public buildings and prominent streets frank had a retentive memory and stored away the information carefully penniless as he was he was excited and exhilarated by the scene of activity in which he was moving and was glad he was going to live in it or to attempt doing so when i am used to it i shall like it much better than the country he said to dick dont you i dont know about that was the reply sometimes i think ill go west a lot of boys that i know have gone there wont it take a good deal of money to go asked frank oh theres a society that pays boys expenses and finds em nice homes with the farmers tom harrison one of my friends went out six weeks ago and he writes me that its bully hes gone to some town in kansas thats a good way off i wouldnt mind that id like ridin in the cars it would be something new to you but ive lived in the country all my life id rather stay here awhile its just the way a feller feels said dick philosophically ive bummed around so much id like a good stiddy home with three square meals a day and a good bed to sleep on cant you get that here asked frank not stiddy sometimes i dont get but one square meal a day frank became thoughtful life in the city seemed more precarious and less desirable than he anticipated well i must go to work again said dick after a while where are you going to sleep tonight asked frank i dont know whether id better sleep at the astor house or fifth avenue said dick frank looked perplexed you dont mean that do you he asked of course i dont youre too fresh dont get mad he continued goodnaturedly seeing the flush on franks cheek youll know as much about the city as i do before long i shall go to the newsboys lodgin house where i can sleep for six cents i wish i had six cents said frank if i could only get work id soon earn it you cant think of anything for me to do can you dicks face lighted up yes he said i can get you a job though it aint a very good one i wonder i didnt think of it before what is it asked frank anxiously its to go round with a blind man solicitin contributions you mean begging yes you lead him into stores and countin rooms and he asks for money i dont like it much said frank slowly but i must do something after all itll be he thats begging not i ill take you right round where he lives said dick maybe hell go out this evenin his other boy give him the slip and he hasn got a new one yet chapter iii frank finds an employer a stones throw from centre street stands a tall tenementhouse sheltering anywhere from forty to fifty families in squalid wretchedness the rent which each family pays would procure a neat house in a country town with perhaps a little land beside but the city has a mysterious fascination for the poorer classes and year after year many who might make the change herd together in contracted and noisome quarters when they might have their share of light and space in country neighborhoods it was in front of this tenementhouse that dick halted and plunged into a dark entrance admonishing frank to follow up creaking and dilapidated staircases to the fourth floor the boys went here we are said dick panting a little from the rapidity of his ascent and began a vigorous tattoo on a door to the left is this where the blind gentleman lives asked frank looking around him dubiously he isnt much of a gentleman to look at said dick laughing do you hear him frank heard a hoarse growl from the inside which might have been come in at any rate dick chose so to interpret it and opened the door the boys found themselves in a scantily furnished room with a close disagreeable smell pervading the atmosphere in the corner was a low bedstead on which lay a tall man with a long gray beard and a disagreeable almost repulsive countenance he turned his eyes which contrary to franks expectations were wide open full upon his visitors what do you want he asked querulously i was asleep and you have waked me up sorry to disturb you mr mills said dick but i come on business what business can you have with me demanded the blind man who are you i am dick rafferty i black boots in the park replied dick well i havent got any money to pay for blacking boots i didnt expect you had i hear your boy has left you yes the young rascal hes given me the slip i expect hes robbed me too but i cant tell for im blind do you want a new boy yes but i cant pay much im very poor i dont think the place will suit you nor i either said dick frankly id rather make a living outside but ive got a boy with me who has just come to the city and is out of business i guess hell engage with you whats his name let him speak for himself my name is frank kavanagh said our hero in a clear distinct voice how old are you fifteen do you know what your duties will be yes dick has told me i told him youd want him to go round on a collecting tour with you every day said dick that isnt all youll have to buy my groceries and all i need i can do that said frank cheerfully reflecting that this would be much more agreeable than accompanying the old man round the streets are you honest queried the blind man sharply frank answered with an indignant flush i never stole a cent in my life i supposed youd say that retorted the blind man with a sneer they all do but a good many will steal for all that if youre afraid i will you neednt hire me said frank independently of course i neednt said mills sharply but i am not afraid if you take any of my money i shall be sure to find it out if i am blind dont mind him frank said dick in a low voice whats that asked the blind man suspiciously what are you two whispering about i told frank not to mind the way you spoke said dick your friend will lend you some then not much answered dick laughing im deadbroke havent you got any money mr mills i have a little grumbled the blind man but this boy may take it and never come back if you think so said frank proudly youd better engage some other boy no use youre all alike wait a minute and ill give you some money he drew from his pocket a roll of scrip and handed one to frank i dont think that will be enough said frank its only five cents are you sure it isnt a quarter grumbled mills yes sir what do you say you dick its only five cents sir is that twentyfive yes sir then take it and mind you dont loiter yes sir and be sure to bring back the change of course i will said frank indignantly resenting his employers suspicion what do you think of him frank asked dick as they descended the stairs i dont like him at all dick said frank decidedly i wish i could get something else to do you can after a while as you have no capital you must take what you can get now so i suppose but i didnt come to the city for this if you dont like it you can leave in a few days this frank fully resolved to do at the first favorable opportunity dick showed him where he could buy the articles he was commissioned to purchase and frank after obtaining them went back to the tenementhouse mills scrupulously demanded the change and put it back into his pocket then he made frank pour out the ale into a glass this he drank with apparent zest but offered none to frank ale isnt good for boys he said you can cut the bread and eat two slices dont cut them too thick the blind man ate some of the bread himself and then requested frank to help him on with his coat and vest i havent taken any money today he said i must try to collect some or i shall starve its a sad thing to be blind he continued his voice changing to a whine you dont look blind said frank thoughtfully your eyes are open what if they are said mills testily i cannot see when i go out i close them because the light hurts them led by frank the blind man descended the stairs and emerged into the street chapter iv pity the blind where shall i lead you asked frank to broadway first do you know broadway yes sir be careful when we cross the street or you will have me run over all right sir if any one asks you about me say i am your uncle but you are not what difference does that make you little fool said the blind man roughly are you ashamed to own me as your uncle frank felt obliged out of politeness to say no but in his own mind he was not quite sure whether he would be willing to acknowledge any relationship to the disagreeable old man whom he was leading they reached broadway and entered a store devoted to gentlemens furnishing goods charity for a poor blind man whined mills in the tone of a professional beggar look here old fellow you come in here too often said a young salesman i gave you five cents yesterday i didnt know it said mills i am a poor blind man all places are alike to me then your boy should know better nothing for you today frank and his companion left the store in the next they were more fortunate a nickel was bestowed upon the blind mendicant how much is it asked mills when they were on the sidewalk five cents sir thats better than nothing but we ought to do better it takes a good many fivecent pieces to make a dollar when you see a welldressed lady coming along tell me frank felt almost as much ashamed as if he were himself begging but he must do what was expected of him accordingly he very soon notified the blind man that a lady was close at hand lead me up to her and say can you spare something for my poor blind uncle frank complied in part but instead of poor blind uncle he said poor blind man mills scowled as he found himself disobeyed how long has he been blind asked the lady sympathetically for many years whined mills is this your boy yes maam he is my young nephew from the country you are fortunate in having him to go about with you yes maam i dont know what i should do without him here is something for you my good man said the lady and passed on thank you maam may heaven bless you how much is it he asked quickly when the lady was out of hearing two cents answered frank suppressing with difficulty an inclination to laugh the mean jade i should like to wring her neck muttered mills i thought it was a quarter at least in the next store they did not meet a cordial reception clear out you old humbug shouted the proprietor who was in illhumor you ought to be put in the penitentiary for begging about the streets i pray to god that you may become blind yourself said mills passionately out of my store or ill have you arrested both of you said the angry tradesman here you boy dont you bring that old fraud in this store again if you know whats best for yourself there was nothing to do but to comply with this peremptory order hes a beast snarled mills id like to put his eyes out myself you havent got a very amiable temper thought frank i wouldnt like to be blind but even if i were i would try to be pleasanter two young girls passing by noticed the blind man they were softhearted and stopped to inquire how long he had been blind before you were born my pretty maid said mills sighing i have an aunt who is blind said one of the girls but she is not poor like you i am very poor whined mills i have not money enough to pay my rent and i may be turned out into the street how sad said the young girl in a tone of deep sympathy i have not much money but i will give you all i have may god bless you and spare your eyes said mills as he closed his hand upon the money how much is it he asked as before when they had passed on twentyfive cents said frank that is better said mills in a tone of satisfaction for some time afterwards all applications were refused in some cases roughly why dont you work asked one man bluntly what can i do asked mills thats your lookout some blind men work i suppose you would rather get your living by begging i would work my fingers to the bone if i could only see whined mills so you say but i dont believe it at any rate that boy of yours can see why dont you set him to work he has to take care of me i would work if i could get anything to do said frank as he spoke he felt his hand pressed forcibly by his companion who did not relish his answer i cannot spare him he whined he has to do everything for me when they were again in the street mills demanded roughly what did you mean by saying that what sir that you wanted to go to work because it is true you are at work you are working for me said mills i would rather work in a store or an office or sell papers that wouldnt do me any good dont speak in that way again the two were out about a couple of hours and very tiresome frank found it then mills indicated a desire to go home and they went back to the room in the old tenementhouse mills threw himself down on the bed in the corner and heaved a sigh of relief now boy count the money we have collected he said theres ninetythree cents frank announced if i had known it was so near a dollar we would have stayed a little longer now get me my pipe where is it sir in the cupboard fill it with tobacco and light it are you not afraid of setting the bedding on fire sir mind your own business if i choose to set it on fire i will snarled mills very well sir i thought id mention it you have mentioned it and you neednt do it again what a sweet temper youve got thought frank he sat down on a broken chair and having nothing else to do watched his employer he looks very much as if he could see thought frank for mills now had his eyes wide open what are you staring at me for boy demanded his employer rather unexpectedly what makes you think i am staring at you sir was franks natural question i thought you couldnt see no more i can but i can tell when one is staring at me it makes me creep all over then ill look somewhere else would you like to do some work as you said yes sir then take twentyfive cents and buy some evening papers and sell them but mind you bring the money to me yes sir said frank with alacrity anything he thought would be better than sitting in that dull room with so disagreeable a companion mind you dont run off with the money said the blind man sharply if you do ill have you put in the tombs i dont mean to run away with the money retorted frank indignantly and when youve sold the papers come home yes sir with a feeling of relief frank descended the stairs and directed his steps to the park meaning to ask dick raffertys advice about the proper way to start in business as a newsboy chapter v frank throws up his situation frank found his friend on park row and made known his errand so old mills wants you to sell papers for his benefit does he yes but id rather do it than to stay with him how much has he agreed to pay you that isnt settled yet youd better bring him to the point or he wont pay you anything except board and lodging and mighty mean both of them will be i wont say anything about it the first day said frank what papers shall i buy its rather late youd better try for telegrams frank did so and succeeded in selling half a dozen yielding a profit of six cents it was not a brilliant beginning but he was late in the field and most had purchased their evening papers his papers sold frank went home and announced the result umph muttered the blind man give me the money here it is sir have you given me all sharply demanded mills of course i have said frank indignantly dont you be impudent or i will give you a flogging said the blind man roughly i am not used to be talked to in that way said frank independently youve always had your own way i suppose snarled mills no i havent but i have been treated kindly you are only a boy and i wont allow you to talk back to me do you hear yes then take care to remember youve got a sweet disposition thought frank i wont stay with you any longer than i am obliged to several days passed without bringing any incidents worth recording frank took a daily walk with the blind man sometimes in the morning sometimes in the afternoon these walks were very distasteful to him the companion of a beggar he felt as if he himself were begging he liked better the time he spent in selling papers though he reaped no benefit himself in fact his wages were poor enough thus far his fare had consisted of dry bread with an occasional bun he was a healthy vigorous boy and he felt the need of meat or some other hearty food and ventured to intimate as much to his employer so you want meat do you snarled mills yes sir i havent tasted any for a week perhaps youd like to take your meals at delmonicos sneered the blind man frank was so new to the city that this wellknown name did not convey any special idea to him and he answered yes thats what i thought exclaimed mills angrily you want to eat me out of house and home no i dont i only want enough food to keep up my strength well you are getting it i give you all i can afford frank was inclined to doubt this he estimated that what he ate did not cost his employer over six or eight cents a day and he generally earned for him twenty to thirty cents on the sale of papers besides helping him to collect about a dollar daily from those who pitied his blindness he mentioned his grievance to his friend dick rafferty ill tell you what to do said dick i wish you would keep some of the money you make by selling papers and buy a square meal at an eatin house i dont like to do that it wouldnt be honest why wouldnt it i am carrying on the business for mr mills he supplies the capital then youd better carry it on for yourself i wish i could why dont you i havent any money has he paid you any wages no then make him frank thought this a good suggestion he had been with mills a week and it seemed fair enough that he should receive some pay besides a wretched bed and a little dry bread accordingly returning to the room he broached the subject what do you want wages for demanded mills displeased i think i earn them said frank boldly you get board and lodging you are better off than a good many boys i shall want some clothes some time said frank perhaps youd like to have me pay you a dollar a day said mills i know you cant afford to pay me that i will be satisfied if you will pay me ten cents a day replied frank frank reflected that though this was a very small sum in ten days it would give him a dollar and then he would feel justified in setting up a business on his own account as a newsboy he anxiously awaited an answer i will think of it said the blind man evasively and frank did not venture to say more the next day when mills led by frank was on his round the two entered a cigarstore frank was much surprised when the cigarvender handed him a fiftycent currency note he thought there was some mistake thank you sir he said but did you mean to give me fifty cents yes said the cigarvender laughing but i wouldnt have done it if it had been good isnt it good no its a counterfeit and a pretty bad one i might pass it but it would cost me too much time and trouble frank was confounded he mechanically handed the money to mills but did not again thank the giver when they returned to the tenementhouse mills requested frank to go to the bakers for a loaf of bread yes sir here is the money but that is the counterfeit note said frank scrutinizing the bill given him what if it is demanded mills sharply it wont pass yes it will if you are sharp do you want me to pass counterfeit money mr mills yes i do i took it and i mean to get rid of it but you didnt give anything for it thats neither here nor there take it and offer it to the baker if he wont take it go to another baker with it i would rather not do it said frank firmly rather not exclaimed mills angrily do you pretend to dictate to me no i dont but i dont mean to pass any counterfeit money for you or any other man said frank with spirit mills half rose with a threatening gesture but thought better of it youre a fool said he i suppose you are afraid of being arrested but you have only to say that i gave it to you and that i am blind and couldnt tell it from good money but you know that it is bad money mr mills what if i do no one can prove it take the money and come back as quick as you can you must excuse me said frank quietly but firmly do you refuse to do as i bid you demanded mills furiously i refuse to pass counterfeit money then by heaven ill flog you mills rose and advanced directly towards frank with his eyes wide open fortunately our hero was near the door and quickly opening it darted from the room pursued by mills his face flaming with wrath it flashed upon frank that no blind man could have done this he decided that the man was a humbug and could see a little at all events his blindness was no doubt assumed to enable him to appeal more effectively to the sympathizing public this revelation disgusted frank he could not respect a man who lived by fraud counterfeit or no counterfeit he decided to withdraw at once and forever from the service of mr mills his employer gave up the pursuit before he reached the street frank found himself on the sidewalk free and emancipated no richer than when he entered the service of the blind man except in experience i havent got a cent he said to himself but ill get along somehow chapter vi frank gets a job though frank was penniless he was not cast down he was tolerably familiar with the lower part of the city and had greater reliance on himself than he had a week ago if he had only had capital to the extent of fifty cents he would have felt quite at ease for this would have set him up as a newsboy i wonder if i could borrow fifty cents of dick rafferty considered frank ill try at any rate he ran across dick in cityhall park that young gentleman was engaged in pitching pennies with a brother professional i say dick i want to speak to you a minute said frank all right go ahead ive lost my place dick whistled got sacked have you he asked yes but i might have stayed why didnt you mills wanted me to pass a counterfeit note and i wouldnt was it a badlooking one yes then youre right you might have got nabbed that wasnt the reason i refused if i had been sure thered have been no trouble i wouldnt have done it why not asked dick who did not understand our heros scruples because its wrong dick shrugged his shoulders i guess you belong to the church he said no i dont what makes you think so oh cause youre so mighty particular i wouldnt mind passing it if i was sure i wouldnt be cotched i think its almost as bad as stealing to buy bread or anything else and give what isnt worth anything for it you might as well give a piece of newspaper though frank was unquestionably right he did not succeed in making a convert of dick rafferty dick was a pretty good boy considering the sort of training he had had but passing bad money did not seem to him objectionable unless a fellow was cotched as he expressed it well what are you going to do now asked dick after a pause i guess i can get a living by selling papers you can get as good a livin as old mills gave you youll get a better bed at the lodginhouse than that heap of rags you laid on up there but theres one trouble continued frank i havent any money to start on can you lend me fifty cents fifty cents repeated dick what do you take me for if i was connected with vanderbuilt or astor i might set you up in business but now i cant twentyfive cents will do said frank look here frank said dick plunging his hands into his pocket and drawing therefrom three pennies and a nickel do you see them yes well its all the money ive got i am afraid you have been extravagant dick said frank in disappointment last night i went to tony pastors and when i got through i went into a saloon and got an icecream and a cigar you couldnt expect a feller to be very rich after that i say ill lend you five cents if you want it no thank you dick ill wait till you are richer i tell you what frank ill save up my money and by day after tomorrow i guess i can set you up thank you dick if i dont have the money by that time myself ill accept your offer there was no other boy with whom frank felt sufficiently well acquainted to request a loan and he walked away feeling rather disappointed it was certainly provoking to think that nothing but the lack of a small sum stood between him and remunerative employment once started he determined not to spend quite all his earnings but to improve upon his friend dicks practice and if possible get a little ahead when guiding the blind man he often walked up broadway and mechanically he took the same direction walking slowly along occasionally stopping to look in at a shopwindow as he was sauntering along he found himself behind two gentlemen one an old man who wore gold spectacles the other a stout pleasantlooking man of middle age frank would not have noticed them particularly but for a sudden start and exclamation from the elder of the two gentlemen i declare thompson he said ive left my umbrella downtown where do you think you left it in peckhams office that is i think i left it there oh well hell save it for you i dont know about that some visitor may carry it away never mind mr bowen you are rich enough to afford a new one it isnt the value of the article thompson said his friend in some emotion that umbrella was brought me from paris by my son john who died it is as a souvenir of him that i regard and value it i would not lose it for a hundred dollars nay five hundred if you value it so much sir suppose we turn round and go back for it frank had listened to this conversation and an idea struck him pressing forward he said respectfully let me go for it sir i will get it and bring it to your house the two gentlemen fixed their eyes upon the bright eager face of the petitioner who are you my boy asked mr thompson i am a poor boy in want of work answered our hero promptly what is your name frank kavanagh where do you live i am trying to live in the city sir what have you been doing leading a blind man sir not a very pleasant employment i should judge said thompson shrugging his shoulders well have you lost that job yes sir so the blind man turned you off did he yes sir your services were unsatisfactory i suppose he wanted me to pass counterfeit money for him and i refused if that is true it is to your credit it is true sir said frank quietly come mr bowen what do you say shall we accept this boys services it will save you time and trouble if i were sure he could be trusted said bowen hesitating he might pawn the umbrella it is a valuable one i hope sir you wont think so badly of me as that said frank with feeling if i were willing to steal anything it would not be a gift from your dead son ill trust you my boy said the old gentleman quickly your tone convinces me that you may be relied upon thank you sir the old gentleman drew a card from his pocket containing his name and address and on the reverse side wrote the name of the friend at whose office he felt sure the umbrella had been left with a brief note directing that it be handed to the bearer all right sir stop a moment my boy have you got money to ride no sir here take this and go down at once in the next stage the sooner you get there the better frank followed directions he stopped the next stage and got on board as he passed the cityhall park dick rafferty espied him frank nodded to him how did he get money enough to ride in a bus dick asked himself in much wonderment a few minutes ago he wanted to borrow some money of me and now hes spending ten cents for a ride maybe hes found a pocketbook frank kept on his way and got out at wall street he found mr peckhams office and on presenting the card much to his delight the umbrella was handed him mr bowen was afraid to trust me with it over night said mr peckham with a smile he thought some visitor might carry it off said frank not unlikely umbrellas are considered common property frank hailed another stage and started on his way uptown there was no elevated railway then and this was the readiest conveyance as mr bowen lived on madison avenue chapter vii an invitation to dinner mr bowen must be a rich man thought frank as he paused on the steps of a fine brownstone mansion corresponding to the number on his card he rang the bell and asked is mr bowen at home yes but he is in his chamber i dont think he will see you i think he will said frank who thought the servant was taking too much upon herself as i come by his appointment i suppose you can come into the hall said the servant reluctantly is your business important you may tell him that the boy he sent for his umbrella has brought it he was afraid he had lost it he sets great store by that umbrella said the girl in a different tone ill go and tell him mr bowen came downstairs almost immediately there was a look of extreme gratification upon his face bless my soul how quick you were he exclaimed why ive only been home a few minutes did you find the umbrella at mr peckhams office yes sir it had been found and taken care of did peckham say anything he said you were probably afraid to trust it with him over night but he smiled when he said it peckham will have his joke but he is an excellent man my boy i am much indebted to you i was very glad to do the errand sir said frank i think you said you were poor said the old man thoughtfully yes sir when i met you i hadnt a cent in the world havent you any way to make a living yes sir i could sell papers if i had enough money to set me up in business does it require a large capital oh no sir said frank smiling unless you consider fifty cents a large sum fifty cents repeated the old gentleman in surprise you dont mean to say that this small sum would set you up in business yes sir i could buy a small stock of papers and buy more with what i received for them to be sure i didnt think of that mr bowen was not a man of business he had an ample income and his tastes were literary and artistic he knew more of books than of men and more of his study than of the world well my boy he said after a pause how much do i owe you for doing this errand i leave that to you sir whatever you think right will satisfy me let me see you want fifty cents to buy papers and you will require something to pay for your bed fifty cents in all will be enough sir i think i had better give you a dollar said the old gentleman opening his pocketbook franks eyes sparkled a dollar would do him a great deal of good with a dollar he would feel quite independent thank you sir he said it is more than i earned but it will be very acceptable he put on his hat and was about to leave the house when mr bowen suddenly said oh i think youd better stay to dinner it will be on the table directly my niece is away and if you dont stay i shall be alone frank did not know what to say he was rather abashed by the invitation but as the old gentleman was to be alone it did not seem so formidable i am afraid i dont look fit he said you can go upstairs and wash your face and hands youll find a clothesbrush there also ill ring for susan to show you the way he rang the bell and the girl who had admitted frank made her appearance susan said her master you may show this young gentlemen into the back chamber on the third floor and see that he is supplied with towels and all he needs and you may lay an extra plate he will dine with me susan stared first at mr bowen and then at frank but did not venture to make any remark this way young man she said and ascended the front stairs frank following her closely she led the way into a handsomely furnished chamber ejaculating well i never i hope youll find things to your satisfaction sir she said dryly if wed known you were coming wed have made particular preparations for you oh i think this will do said frank smiling for he thought it a good joke i am glad you think itll do continued susan things maynt be as nice as youre accustomed to at home not quite said frank goodhumoredly but i shant complain thats very kind and considerate of you im sure said susan tossing her head well i never did nor i either susan said frank laughing i am a poor boy and i am not used to this way of living so if youll be kind enough to give me any hints so i may behave properly at the table ill be very much obliged to you this frank acknowledgment quite appeased susan and she readily complied with our heros request but i must be going downstairs or dinner will be late she said hurriedly you can come down when you hear the bell ring frank had been well brought up though not in the city and he was aware that perfect neatness was one of the first characteristics of a gentleman he therefore scrubbed his face and hands till they fairly shone and brushed his clothes with great care even then they certainly did look rather shabby and there was a small hole in the elbow of his coat but on the whole he looked quite passable when he entered the diningroom take that seat my boy said his host frank sat down and tried to look as if he was used to it take this soup to mr kavanagh said mr bowen in a dignified tone frank started and smiled slightly feeling more and more that it was an excellent joke i wonder what dick rafferty would say if he could see me now passed through his mind he acquitted himself very creditably however and certainly displayed an excellent appetite much to the satisfaction of his hospitable host after dinner was over mr bowen detained him and began to talk of his dead son telling anecdotes of his boyhood to which frank listened with respectful attention for the fathers devotion was touching i think my boy looked a little like you said the old gentleman what do you think susan not a mite sir answered susan promptly when he was a boy i mean i didnt know him when he was a boy mr bowen no to be sure not but mr john was darkcomplected and this boy is light and mr johns hair was black and his is brown i suppose i am mistaken sighed the old man but there was something in the boys face that reminded me of john a little more and hell want to adopt him thought susan that wouldnt do nohow though he does really seem like a decent sort of a boy at eight oclock frank rose and wished mr bowen goodnight come and see me again my boy said the old gentleman kindly you have been a good deal of company for me tonight i am glad of it sir i think you might find something better to do than selling papers i wish i could sir come and dine with me again this day week and i may have something to tell you thank you sir feeling in his pocket to see that his dollar was safe frank set out to walk downtown repairing to the lodginghouse where he met dick and astonished that young man by the recital of his adventures it takes you to get round frank he said i wonder i dont get invited to dine on madison avenue i give it up said frank chapter viii a newsboys experiences frank slept that night at the lodginghouse and found a much better bed than he had been provided with by his late employer he was up bright and early the next morning and purchased a stock of morning papers these he succeeded in selling during the forenoon netting a profit of thirty cents it was not much but he was satisfied at any rate he was a good deal better off than when in the employ of mr mills of course he had to economize strictly but the excellent arrangements of the lodginghouse helped him to do this twelve cents provided him with lodging and breakfast at noon in company with his friend dick he went to a cheap restaurant then to be found in ann street near park row and for fifteen cents enjoyed a dinner of two courses the first consisted of a plate of beef with a potato and a wedge of bread costing ten cents and the second a piece of applepie thats a good square meal said dick in a tone of satisfaction i oughter get one every day but sometimes i dont have the money i should think you could raise fifteen cents a day for that purpose dick well so i could but then you see i save my money sometimes to go to the old bowery or tony pastors in the evenin i would like to go too but i wouldnt give up my dinner a boy thats growing needs enough to eat i guess youre right said dick well go to dinner together every day if you say so all right dick i should like your company about two oclock in the afternoon as frank was resting on a bench in the cityhall park a girl of ten approached him frank recognized her as an inmate of the tenementhouse where mills his late employer lived do you want to see me asked frank observing that she was looking towards him youre the boy that went round with the blind man aint you she asked yes he wants you to come back frank was rather surprised but concluded that mills had difficulty in obtaining a boy to succeed him this was not very remarkable considering the niggardly pay attached to the office did he send you to find me asked our hero yes he says you neednt pass that money if youll come back tell him that i dont want to come back said frank promptly i can do better working for myself he wants to know what you are doing continued the girl does he you can tell him that i am a newsboy he says if you dont come back hell have you arrested for stealing money from him you mustnt be mad with me thats what he told me to say i dont blame you said frank hotly but you can tell him that he is a liar oh i wouldnt dare to tell him that he would beat me how can he do that when he cant see where you are i dont know how it is but he can go right up to where you are just as well as if he could see so he can hes a humbug and a fraud his eyes may not be very good but he can see for all that he pretends to be blind so as to make money thats what mother and i think said the girl so you wont come back not much he can hire some other boy and starve him he wont get me aint you afraid hell have you arrested for stealing asked the girl if he tries that ill expose him for wanting me to pass a counterfeit note i never took a cent from him hell be awful mad said the little girl let him if he had treated me decently i would have stayed with him now im glad i left him mills was indeed furious when by degrees he had drawn from his young messenger what frank had said he was sorry to lose him for he was the most truthful and satisfactory guide he had ever employed and he now regretted that he had driven him away by his unreasonable exactions he considered whether it would be worth while to have frank arrested on a false charge of theft but was restrained by the fear that he would himself be implicated in passing counterfeit money that is in intention he succeeded in engaging another boy who really stole from him and finally secured a girl for whose services however he was obliged to pay her mother twenty cents every time she went out with him mean and miserly as he was he agreed to this with reluctance and only as a measure of necessity as he became more accustomed to his new occupation frank succeeded better he was a boy of considerable energy and was on the alert for customers it was not long before his earnings exceeded those of dick rafferty who was inclined to take things easily one evening dick was lamenting that he could not go to the old bowery theres a bully play frank he said theres a lot of fightin in it what is it called dick the scalpers of the plains theres five men murdered in the first act oh its elegant why dont you go then dick cause im deadbroke busted thats why i aint had much luck this week and it took all my money to pay for my lodgins and grub do you want very much to go to the theatre dick of course i do but it aint no use my credit aint good and i haint no money in the bank how much does it cost fifteen cents in the top gallery can you see there yes its rather high up but a feller with good eyes can see all he wants to there ill tell you what ill do dick you have been a good friend to me and ill take you at my expense you will tonight yes youre a reglar trump well have a stavin time sometime when im flush ill return the compliment so the two boys went they were at the doors early and secured a front seat in the gallery the performance was well adapted to please the taste of a boy and they enjoyed it exceedingly dick was uproarious in his applause whenever a man was killed seems to me you like to see men killed dick said his friend yes its kinder excitin i dont like that part so well as some others said frank its a stavin play aint it asked dick greatly delighted frank assented ill tell you what frank said dick id like to be a hunter and roam round the plains killin bears and injuns suppose they should kill you that wouldnt suit you so well would it no i guess not but id like to be a hunter wouldnt you no i would rather live in new york i would like to make a journey to the west if i had money enough but i would leave the hunting to other men dick however did not agree with his more sensible companion many boys like him are charmed with the idea of a wild life in the forest and some have been foolish enough to leave good homes and providing themselves with what they considered necessary have set out on a journey in quest of the romantic adventures which in stories had fired their imaginations if their wishes could be realized it would not be long before the romance would fade out and they would long for the good homes which they had never before fully appreciated when the week was over frank found that he had lived within his means as he had resolved to do but he had not done much more he began with a dollar which he had received from mr bowen and now he had a dollar and a quarter there was a gain of twentyfive cents there would have been a little more if he had not gone to the theatre with dick but this he did not regret he felt that he needed some amusement and he wished to show his gratitude to his friend for various kind services the time had come to accept mr bowens second dinner invitation as frank looked at his shabby clothes he wished there were a good pretext for declining but he reflected that this would not be polite and that the old gentleman would make allowances for his wardrobe he brushed up his clothes as well as he could and obtained a boss shine from dick then he started for the house on madison avenue ill lend you my cloes if you want em said dick there are too many spots of blacking on them dick as im a newsboy it wouldnt look appropriate i shall have to make mine answer ill shine up the blackin spots if you want me to never mind dick ill wait till next time for your suit chapter ix victor dupont as frank was walking on madison avenue a little before reaching the house of mr bowen he met a boy of his own age whom he recognized victor dupont had spent the previous summer at the hotel in the country village where frank had lived until he came to the city victor was proud of his social position but time hung so heavily upon his hands in the country that he was glad to keep company with the village boys frank and he had frequently gone fishing together and had been associated in other amusements so that they were for the time quite intimate the memories of home and past pleasures thronged upon our hero as he met victor and his face flushed with pleasure why victor he said eagerly extending his hand how glad i am to see you frank forgot that intimacy in the country does not necessarily lead to intimacy in the city and he was considerably surprised when victor not appearing to notice his offered hand said coldly i dont think i remember you dont remember me exclaimed frank amazed why i am frank kavanagh dont you remember how much we were together last summer and what good times we had fishing and swimming together yes i believe i do remember you now drawled victor still not offering his hand or expressing any pleasure at the meeting when did you come to the city i have been here two or three weeks replied frank oh indeed are you going to remain yes if i can earn a living victor scanned franks clothes with a critical and evidently rather contemptuous glance what are you doing he asked are you in a store no i am selling papers a newsboy said victor with a curve of the lip yes answered frank his pleasure quite chilled by victors manner are you doing well asked victor more from curiosity than interest i am making my expenses how do you happen to be in this neighborhood i suppose you sell papers downtown yes but i am invited to dinner not here on the avenue ejaculated victor yes answered frank enjoying the others surprise where frank mentioned the number why that is next to my house mr bowen lives there yes perhaps you know some of the servants suggested victor i know one said frank smiling for he read victors thoughts but my invitation comes from mr bowen did you ever dine there before asked victor puzzled yes last week you must excuse my mentioning it but i should hardly think you would like to sit down at a gentlemans table in that shabby suit i dont answered frank but i have no better then you ought to decline the invitation i would but for appearing impolite it seems very strange that mr bowen should invite a newsboy to dinner perhaps if youd mention what you think of it said frank somewhat nettled he would recall the invitation oh its nothing to me said victor but i thought id mention it as i know more of etiquette than you do you are very considerate said frank with a slight tinge of sarcasm in his tone by this time he had reached the house of mr bowen and the two boys parted frank could not help thinking a little about what victor had said his suit as he looked down at it seemed shabbier than ever again it occurred to him that perhaps mr bowen had forgotten the invitation and this would make it very awkward for him as he waited for the door to open he decided that if it should appear that he was not expected he would give some excuse and go away susan opened the door mr bowen invited me to come here to dinner tonight began frank rather nervously yes you are expected said susan very much to his relief wipe your feet and come right in frank obeyed you are to go upstairs and get ready for dinner said susan and she led the way to the same chamber into which our hero had been ushered the week before there wont be much getting ready thought frank however i can stay there till i hear the bell ring as he entered the room he saw a suit of clothes and some underclothing lying on the bed they are for you said susan laconically for me exclaimed frank in surprise yes put them on and when you come down to dinner mr bowen will see how they fit is it a present from him asked frank overwhelmed with surprise and gratitude for he could see that the clothes were very handsome well they aint from me said susan so its likely they come from him dont be too long for mr bowen doesnt like to have any one late to dinner susan had been in the service of her present mistress fifteen years and was a privileged character she liked to have her own way but had sterling qualities being neat faithful and industrious i wonder whether i am awake or dreaming thought frank when he was left alone i shouldnt like to wake up and find it was all a dream he began at once to change his shabby clothes for the new ones he found that the articles provided were a complete outfit including shirt collar cuffs stockings in fact everything that was needful the coat pants and vest were a neat gray and proved to be an excellent fit in the bosom of the shirt were neat studs and the cuffs were supplied with sleevebuttons to correspond when frank stood before the glass completely attired he hardly knew himself he was as well dressed as his aristocratic acquaintance victor dupont and looked more like a city boy than a boy bred in the country i never looked so well in my life thought our young hero complacently how kind mr bowen is frank did not know it but he was indebted for this gift to susans suggestion when her master told her in the morning that frank was coming to dinner she said its a pity the boy hadnt some better clothes i didnt notice his clothes said mr bowen are they shabby yes and they are almost worn out they dont look fit for one who is going to sit at your table bless my soul i never thought of that you think he needs some new clothes he needs them badly i will call at baldwins and order some readymade but i dont know his size hes about two inches shorter than you mr bowen tell em that and they will know he ought to have shirts and stockings too so he shall said the old man quite interested he shall have a full rigout from top to toe where shall i go for the shirts and things susan had a nephew about franks age and she was prepared to give the necessary information the old gentleman who had no business to attend to was delighted to have something to fill up his time he went out directly after breakfast or as soon as he had read the morning paper and made choice of the articles already described giving strict injunctions that they should be sent home immediately this was the way frank got his new outfit when our hero came downstairs mr bowen was waiting eagerly to see the transformation the result delighted him why i shouldnt have known you he exclaimed lifting both hands i had no idea new clothes would change you so much i dont know how to thank you sir said frank gratefully i never should have thought of it if it hadnt been for susan then i thank you susan said frank offering his hand to the girl as she entered the room susan was pleased she liked to be appreciated and she noted with satisfaction the great improvement in franks appearance you are quite welcome she said but it was masters money that paid for the clothes it was your kindness that made him think of it said frank from that moment susan became franks fast friend we generally like those whom we have benefited if our services are suitably acknowledged chapter x a new prospect well frank and how is your business asked the old gentleman when they were sitting at the dinnertable pretty good sir are you making your expenses yes sir just about that is well mind you never run into debt that is a bad plan i shant have to now sir if i had had to buy clothes for myself i might have had to do you find the shirts and stockings fit you yes sir they are just right i bought half a dozen of each susan will give you the bundle when you are ready to go if they had not been right they could have been exchanged thank you sir i shall feel rich with so many clothes where do you sleep frank at the newsboys lodginghouse is there any place there where you can keep your clothes yes sir each boy has a locker to himself that is a good plan it would be better if you had a room to yourself i cant afford it yet sir the lodginghouse costs me only fortytwo cents a week for a bed and i could not get a room for that bless my soul that is very cheap really i think i could save money by giving up my house and going there to sleep i dont think you would like it sir said frank smiling probably not now frank i am going to mention a plan i have for you you dont want to be a newsboy all your life no sir i think i should get tired of it by the time i was fifty my friend thompson the gentleman who was walking with me when we first saw you is an officer of the american district telegraph company they employ a large number of boys at their various offices to run errands and in fact to do anything that is required of them probably you have seen some of the boys going about the city yes sir they have a blue uniform precisely how would you like to get a situation of that kind very much sir said frank promptly would you like it better than being a newsboy yes sir my friend thompson to whom i spoke on the subject says he will take you on in a few weeks provided you will qualify yourself for the post i will do that sir if you will tell me how you must be well acquainted with the city in all its parts know the locations of different hotels prominent buildings have a fair education and be willing to make yourself generally useful you will have to satisfy the superintendent that you are fitted for the position i think my education will be sufficient said frank for i always went to school till just before i came to the city i know something about the lower part of the city but i will go about every day during the hours when i am not selling papers till i am familiar with all parts of it do so and when there is a vacancy i will let you know how much pay shall i get sir if they accept me about three dollars a week at first and more when you get familiar with your duties no doubt money will also be given you by some who employ you though you will not be allowed to ask for any fees very likely you will get nearly as much in this way as from your salary franks face expressed satisfaction that will be bully he said i beg pardon said the old gentleman politely what did you remark that will be excellent said frank blushing i thought you spoke of a bully it was a word i learned from dick rafferty said frank feeling rather embarrassed and who is dick rafferty one of my friends at the lodginghouse unless his education is better than yours i would not advise you to learn any of his words i beg your pardon sir you must excuse my offering you advice it is the privilege of the old to advise the young i shall always be glad to follow your advice mr bowen said frank good boy good boy said the old gentleman approvingly i wish all boys were like you some think they know more than their grandfathers theres one of that kind who lives next door his name is victor dupont isnt it sir mr bowen looked surprised how is it that you know his name he asked we were together a good deal last summer his family boarded at the hotel in the country village where i used to live he and i went bathing and fishing together indeed have you seen him since you came to the city i met him as i was on my way here this afternoon did he speak to you yes sir though at first he pretended he didnt remember me just like him he is a very proud and conceited boy did you tell him you were coming to dine with me yes sir he seemed very much surprised as i had just told him i was a newsboy he said he was surprised that you should invite a newsboy to dine with you i would much rather have you dine with me than him what more did he say he said he shouldnt think i would like to go out to dinner with such a shabby suit we have removed that objection said mr bowen smiling yes sir said frank i think victor will treat me more respectfully now when he meets me the respect of such a boy is of very little importance he judges only by the outside at an early hour frank took his leave promising to call again before long where can i send to you if you are wanted for a telegraph boy asked mr bowen a letter to me addressed to the care of mr oconnor at the lodginghouse will reach me said frank write it down for me said the old gentleman you will find writing materials on yonder desk when frank made his appearance at the lodginghouse in his new suit with two bundles one containing his old clothes and the other his extra supply of underclothing his arrival made quite a sensation have you come into a fortun asked one boy did you draw a prize in the havana lottery asked another have you been playing policy asked a third youre all wrong said dick rafferty franks been adopted by a rich man upon madison avenue aint that so frank something like it said frank theres a gentleman up there who has been very kind to me if he wants to adopt another chap spake a good word for me said patsy reagan whisht patsy he dont want no irish bogtrotter said phil donovan youre irish yourself phil now and you cant deny it what if i am i aint no bogtrotter im the son of an irish count you can see by my looks that i belong to the gintry then the gintry must have red hair and freckles phil there aint no chance for you tell us all about it frank said dick shure im your best friend and you might mention my name to the ould gintleman if hes got any more good clothes to give away i will with pleasure dick if i think it will do any good you wont put on no airs because youre better dressed than the likes of us i shall wear my old clothes tomorrow dick i cant afford to wear my best clothes every day i can said dick dryly which was quite true as his best clothes were the only ones he had bright and early the next morning frank was about his work without betraying in any way the proud consciousness of being the owner of two suits he followed mr bowens advice and spent his leisure hours in exploring the city in its various parts so that in the course of a month he knew more about it than boys who had lived in it all their lives he told dick his object in taking these long walks and urged him to join him in the hope of winning a similar position but dick decided that it was too hard work he preferred to spend his leisure time in playing marbles or pitching pennies chapter xi the telegraph boy six weeks later frank kavanagh through the influence of his patron found himself in the uniform of a district telegraph messenger the blue suit and badge upon the cap are familiar to every city resident the uniform is provided by the company but must be paid for by weekly instalments which are deducted from the wages of the wearers this would have seriously embarrassed frank but for an opportune gift of ten dollars from mr bowen which nearly paid the expense of his suit illustration frank the telegraph boy frank was employed in one of the uptown offices of the company for the information of such of my young readers as live in the country it may be explained that large numbers of houses and offices in the city are connected with the offices of the district telegraph by machines through which at any time in the day or night a messenger may be summoned for any purpose it is only necessary to raise a knob in the box provided and a bell is rung in the office of the company of course there is more or less transient business besides that of the regular subscribers boys on arriving at the office seat themselves and are called upon in order a boy just returned from an errand hangs up his hat and takes his place at the foot of the line he will not be called upon again till all who are ahead of him have been despatched in one direction or another frank was curious to know what would be his first duty and waited eagerly for his turn to come at length it came go to no madison avenue said the superintendent a few minutes later frank was ascending the steps of a handsome brownstone residence oh youre the telegraph boy said a colored servant youre to go upstairs into missuss sittingroom upon entering frank found himself in the presence of a rather stout lady who was reclining on a sofa he bowed politely and waited for his instructions i hope you are a trustworthy boy said the stout lady i hope so maam come here fido said the lady a little mass of hair with two red eyes peeping out rose from the carpet and waddled towards the lady for fido was about as stout as his mistress do you like dogs asked mrs leroy for this was the ladys name yes maam answered frank wondering what that had to do with his errand i sent for you to take my sweet darling out for an airing his health requires that he should go out every day i generally take him myself but this morning i have a severe headache and do not feel equal to the task my dear little pet will you go out with this nice boy fido looked gravely at frank and sneezed i hope the darling hasnt got cold said mrs leroy with solicitude my lad what is your name frank kavanagh maam will you take great care of my little pet frank i will try to madam where do you want him to go to madison park he always likes the park because it is so gay when you get there you may sit down on one of the benches and give him time to rest yes maam how long would you like me to stay out with him about an hour and a half have you a watch no but i can tell the time by the clock in front of the fifthavenue hotel to be sure i was going to lend you my watch shall i start now yes here is the string dont make fido go too fast he is stout and cannot walk fast you will be sure to take great care of him yes madam and you keep watch that no bad man carries off my fido i used to send him out by one of the girls till i found that she illtreated the poor thing of course i couldnt stand that so i sent her packing i can tell you i will try to follow your directions said frank who wanted to laugh at the ladys ridiculous devotion to her ugly little favorite that is right you look like a good boy i will give you something for yourself when you come back thank you maam said frank who was better pleased with this remark than any the lady had previously made mrs leroy kissed fido tenderly and consigned him to the care of our hero i suppose said frank to himself that i am the dogs nurse it is rather a queer office but as long as i am well paid for it i dont mind when fido found himself on the sidewalk he seemed disinclined to move but after a while by dint of coaxing he condescended to waddle along at franks heels after a while they reached madison park and frank according to his instructions took a seat allowing fido to curl up at his side this isnt very hard work thought frank i wish i had a book or paper to read to while away the time while he was sitting there victor dupont came sauntering along halloa he exclaimed in surprise as he recognized frank is that you i believe it is answered frank with a smile are you a telegraph boy yes i thought you were a newsboy so i was but i have changed my business what are you doing here taking care of a dog said frank laughing is that the dog yes its a beastly little brute whats its name fido who does it belong to frank answered i know said victor its a fat lady living on the avenue i have seen her out often with little pug how do you feel fido and victor began to pull the hair of the ladys favorite dont do that victor remonstrated frank why not mrs leroy wouldnt like it mrs leroy isnt here i am said frank emphatically and that is the same thing victor by way of reply pinched fidos ear and the little animal squeaked his disapproval look here victor said frank decidedly you must stop that must i sneered victor contemptuously suppose i dont then i shall punch you said frank quietly you are impertinent said victor haughtily you neednt put on such airs because you are nurse to a puppy that is better than being a puppy myself retorted frank do you mean to insult me demanded victor quickly no unless you choose to think the remark fits you i have a great mind to give you a thrashing said victor furiously of course i should sit still and let you do it said frank calmly fido is under my care and i cant have him teased that is right isnt it i did wrong to notice you said victor you are only a dogs nurse frank laughed you are right he said it is new business for me and though it is easy enough i cant say i like it however i am in the service of the telegraph company and must do whatever is required victor walked away rather annoyed because he could not tease frank the boy has no pride he said to himself or he wouldnt live out to take care of dogs but then it is suitable enough for him is that dawg yours asked a roughlooking man taking his seat on the bench near frank no sir how old is it i dont know looks like a dawg i used to own let me take him i would rather not said frank coldly it belongs to a lady who is very particular oh you wont wont you said the man roughly danged if i dont think it is my dawg after all and the man seized fido and was about to carry him away but frank seized him by the arm and called for help whats the matter asked a park policeman who unobserved by either had come up behind this man is trying to steal my dog said frank the dog is mine said the thief boldly drop him said the officer authoritatively i have seen that dog before he belongs to neither of you that is true said frank it belongs to mrs leroy of madison avenue and i am employed to take it out for an airing its a lie said the man sullenly if you are seen again in this neighborhood said the policeman i shall arrest you now clear out the wouldbe thief slunk away and frank thanked the officer that man is a dogstealer said the policeman his business is to steal dogs and wait till a reward is offered look out for him chapter xii a wayward son when frank carried fido back to his mistress he thought it his duty to tell mrs leroy of the attempt to abduct the favorite mrs leroy turned pale did the man actually take my little pet she asked yes maam he said it was his dog the horrid brute how could i have lived without my darling and the lady caressed her favorite tenderly how did you prevent him i seized him by the arm and held him till a policeman came up you are a brave boy said mrs leroy admiringly but for you fido would have been stolen the policeman said the man was a professional dogstealer he steals dogs for the reward which is offered i was sure i could trust you with my pet said mrs leroy you deserve a reward yourself i was only doing my duty maam said frank modestly it isnt everybody that does that mrs leroy rose and going to her bureau drew an ivory portemonnaie from a small upper drawer from this she extracted a twodollar bill and gave it to frank this is too much said frank surprised at the size of the gift too much for rescuing my little pet no no i am the best judge of that i wouldnt have lost him for fifty times two dollars you are very liberal and i am very much obliged to you said frank if i send again for a boy to take out fido i want you to come i will if i can maam for several days though frank was employed on errands daily there was nothing of an unusual character about eleven oclock one evening for frank had to take his turn at night work he was sent to a house on west thirtyeighth street on arriving he was ushered into the presence of a lady of middle age whose anxious face betrayed the anxiety that she felt i have a son rather larger and older than you she said who to my great sorrow has been led away by evil companions who have induced him to drink and play cards for money i will not admit them into my house but i cannot keep him from seeking them out he is no doubt with them tonight frank listened with respectful sympathy and waited to hear what he was desired to do in the matter the boys father is dead continued mrs vivian with emotion and i cannot fill his place fred is unwilling to obey his mother his companions have persuaded him that it is unmanly i would gladly obey my mother if i could have her back said frank is your mother dead then inquired mrs vivian with quick sympathy i have neither father nor mother frank answered gravely poor boy and yet you do not fall into temptation i have no time for that maam i have to earn my living if i could get fred to take a position it might be a benefit to him said mrs vivian thoughtfully but the question now is how i may be able to find him when did you see him last asked frank about three oclock this afternoon i gave him seventyfive dollars and sent him to pay a bill i was perhaps imprudent to trust him with such a sum of money but for a few days past he has been more steady than usual and i thought it would show my confidence in him if i employed him in such a matter i should think it would maam but i am afraid fred fell in with some of his evil companions and let them know that he was well provided with money that would be enough to excite their cupidity who are the companions you speak of asked frank boys or rather young men for they are all older than fred of lower social rank than himself i dont attach any special importance to that nor do i object to them on that ground but they are i have reason to think illbred and disreputable they know fred to be richer than themselves and induce him to drink and play in the hope of getting some of his money i have sent for you to go in search of my son if you find him you must do your best to bring him home i will said frank can you give me any idea where he may be found mrs vivian wrote on a card two places one a billiard saloon which she had reason to suspect that her son frequented now said frank will you be kind enough to describe your son to me so that i may know him when i see him i will show you his photograph said mrs vivian she opened an album and showed the picture of a boy of seventeen with a pleasant face fair complexion and hair somewhat curly his forehead was high and he looked gentlemanly and refined is he not goodlooking said the mother he looks like a gentleman said frank he would be one if he could throw off his evil associates do you think you will know him from the picture yes i think so is he tall two or three inches taller than you are you had better take the picture with you i have an extra one which you can put in your pocket to help you identify him by the way it will be as well that you should be supplied with money in case it is necessary to bring him home in a cab frank understood what the mother found it difficult to explain she feared that her boy might be the worse for drink she handed our hero a fivedollar bill i will use it prudently madam said he and account to you for all i do not use i trust you wholly said the lady now go as quickly as possible frank looked at the two addresses he had on the card the billiardsaloon was on the east side of the city in an unfashionable locality ill go there first he decided crossing to third avenue he hailed a car and rode downtown his knowledge of the city gained from the walks he took when a newsboy made it easy for him to find the place of which he was in search though it was nearly midnight the saloon was lighted up and two tables were in use on the lefthand side as he entered was a bar behind which stood a man in his shirtsleeves who answered the frequent calls for drinks he looked rather suspiciously at franks uniform when he entered what do you want he asked have you any message for me no said frank carelessly let me have a glass of lemonade the barkeepers face cleared instantly and he set about preparing the beverage required wont you have something in it he asked no sir said frank you boys are kept out pretty late said the barkeeper socially not every night said frank we take turns frank paid ten cents for his lemonade and passing into the billiardsaloon sat down and watched a game he looked around him but could not see anything of fred in fact all the players were men sitting next to him was a young fellow who was watching the game suppose we try a game he said to frank not tonight i came in here to look for a friend but i guess he isnt here ive been here two hours what does your friend look like thats his picture said frank displaying the photograph oh yes said his new acquaintance he is here now his name is fred isnt it yes answered frank eagerly i dont see him where is he hes playing cards upstairs but i dont believe he can tell one card from the other been drinking i suppose said frank betraying no surprise i should say so do you know the fellows hes with i am not sure about that how long has fred been upstairs about an hour he was playing billiards till he couldnt stand straight and then they went upstairs would you mind telling him that there is a friend downstairs who wishes to see him that is if you know the way oh yes i live here wont you come up with me perhaps i had better said frank and followed his companion through a door in the rear and up a dark and narrow staircase to the street floor itll be a hard job to get him away thought frank but for his mothers sake i will do my best chapter xiii a timely rescue as frank entered the room he hastily took in the scene before him round a table sat three young men of not far from twenty the fourth side being occupied by fred vivian they were playing cards and sipping drinks as they played fred vivians handsome face was flushed and he was nervously excited his hands trembled as he lifted the glass and his wandering uncertain glances showed that he was not himself its your play fred said his partner fred picked up a card without looking at it and threw it down on the table that settles it said another fred old boy youve lost the game youre another five dollars out fred fumbled in his pocket for a bill and it was quickly taken from his hand before he could well see of what value it was frank however quickly as it was put away saw that it was a ten it was clear that fred was being cheated in the most barefaced manner franks entrance was evidently unwelcome to most of the company what are you bringing in that boy for john demanded a lowbrowed fellow with a face like a bulldog he is a friend of fred answered john hes a telegraph boy he comes here a spy fred dont know him clear out boy frank took no notice of this hostile remark but walked up to fred vivian fred said he thinking it best to speak as if he knew him it is getting late and your mother is anxious about you wont you come home with me who are you asked fred with drunken gravity you aint my mother i come from your mother dont you know me i am frank kavanagh how do frank glad to see you ol feller take a drink here you boy bring a drink for my frien frank kavanagh the three others looked on disconcerted they were not ready to part with fred yet having secured only a part of his money you dont know him fred said the one who had appropriated the tendollar bill hes only a telegraph boy i tell you hes my frien frank kavnagh persisted fred with an obstinacy not unusual in one in his condition well if he is let him sit down and have a glass of something hot no i thank you said frank coldly fred and i are going home no youre not exclaimed the other bringing his fist heavily down upon the table we wont allow our friend fred to be kidnapped by a boy of your size not much we wont will we boys no no chimed in the other two fred vivian looked at them undecided i guess id better go he stammered theres something the matter with my head you need another drink to brace you up here john bring up another punch for fred frank saw that unless he got fred away before drinking any more he would not be in a condition to go at all it was a critical position but he saw that he must be bold and resolute you neednt bring fred anything more he said he has had enough already i have had enough already muttered fred mechanically boys are we going to stand this said the lowbrowed young man are we going to let this telegraph boy interfere with a social party of young gentlemen i move that we throw him downstairs he half rose as he spoke but frank stood his ground youd better not try it he said quietly unless you want to pass the night in the stationhouse what do you mean you young jackanapes said the other angrily what charge can you trump up against us you have been cheating fred out of his money said frank firmly its a lie weve been having a friendly game and he lost if wed lost we would have paid how much did he lose five dollars and you took ten from him its a lie repeated the other but he looked disconcerted it is true for i noticed the bill as you took it from him but its not much worse than playing for money with him when he is in no condition to understand the game youd better give him back that tendollar bill ive a great mind to fling you downstairs you young scamp you are strong enough to do it said frank exhibiting no trace of fear but i think you would be sorry for it afterwards come fred though frank was so much younger and smaller there was something in his calm selfpossessed manner that gave him an ascendency over the weak vacillating fred the latter rose and taking our heros arm turned to leave the room let him go said the leader who had been made uneasy by franks threat and saw that it was politic to postpone his further designs upon his intended victim if he chooses to obey a small telegraph boy he can dont mind him fred said frank you know im your friend my friend frank kavanagh repeated fred drowsily im awful sleepy frank i want to go to bed you shall go to bed as soon as you get home fred i say boy said the leader uneasily that was all a lie about the tendollar bill you didnt see straight did he bates of course he didnt one lies and the other swears to it thought frank nothing will be done about it he said if you will let fred alone hereafter the money you have won from him belongs to his mother and unless you keep away from him she will order your arrest youre altogether too smart for a boy of your size sneered the other take your friend away we dont care to associate with a milksop who allows himself to be ordered around by women and children fortunately fred was too drowsy to pay heed to what was being said in fact he was very sleepy and was anxious to go to bed frank got him into a cab and in twenty minutes they safely reached his mothers house in thirtyeighth street mrs vivian was anxiously awaiting the return of the prodigal o fred she said how could you stay away so when you know how worried i get you have been drinking too this is my friend frank kavanagh hiccoughed fred shall i go up and help put him to bed asked frank does he require help asked mrs vivian sorrowfully he has been drinking a good deal yes you may go up i will lead the way to his chamber afterwards i want to speak to you all right where did you find him asked mrs vivian when frank with some difficulty had prepared his charge for bed in the billiardsaloon to which you directed me he was upstairs playing cards for money they were cheating him in the most outrageous manner i suppose they got all his money not all but they would soon have done so here is his pocketbook which i just took from his pocket there are twenty dollars left said mrs vivian after an examination they must have secured the rest o my poor boy would that i could shield you from these dangerous companions i dont think they will trouble him again mrs vivian why not you do not know them i told them that if they came near him hereafter you would have them arrested for swindling your son out of money belonging to you will that have any effect upon them yes because they know that i am ready to appear as a witness against them did fred show any unwillingness to come with you no i made him think i was an old acquaintance of his besides he was feeling sleepy you have acted with great judgment for so young a lad said mrs vivian i wish fred had a companion like you to influence him for good where do you live at the newsboys lodginghouse i cannot afford to hire a room mrs vivian looked thoughtful give me your name and address she said these she noted down i wont keep you any longer tonight she said for you must be tired you will hear from me again oh said frank i nearly forgot here is the balance of the money you handed me for expenses keep it for yourself said mrs vivian and accept my thanks besides though frank had paid for the cab there was a balance of nearly two dollars in his hands which he was very glad to keep chapter xiv frank makes an evening call the next day frank chanced to meet mrs vivian in the street she recognized him at once i see you are kept busy she said pleasantly yes answered frank our business is pretty good just now how is your son he slept well and woke much refreshed this morning he is a good boy naturally but unable to withstand temptation i have decided to send him to the country for a few weeks to visit a cousin of about his own age there he will be secure from temptation and will have a chance to ride i would have sent him away before but that it would leave me alone in the house you told me last evening that you had no boardingplace my only home is at the lodginghouse said frank how would you like to occupy a room at my house while my son is away very much said frank promptly i shall find it convenient to have you in the house and shall feel safer i am afraid i shouldnt be a match for an ablebodied burglar said frank smiling perhaps not but you could summon a policeman when can you come and see me about this arrangement i am off duty tonight very well i will expect you fred will not go away till tomorrow and you will have a chance to see him under more favorable circumstances than last evening thank you very much for your kind invitation said frank politely mrs vivian bade him goodmorning very favorably impressed with his manners and deportment frank looked upon the proposal made him by mrs vivian as a piece of great goodfortune in his new position excellent as were the beds at the lodginghouse he found it inconvenient to go there to sleep once or twice on account of the late hour at which he was released from duty he was unable to secure admittance and had to pay fifty cents for a bed at a hotel on the european system he had for some time been thinking seriously of hiring a room but the probable expense deterred him at mrs vivians he would have nothing to pay in the evening he changed his uniform for the neat suit given him by mr bowen and about eight oclock rang the bell of the house in thirtyeighth street he was at once ushered into the presence of mrs vivian and her son i am glad to see you my young friend said mrs vivian glancing with approval at the neat appearance of her young visitor fred this is the young man who brought you home last night i am much obliged to you said fred vivian offering his hand to frank i am ashamed of having been found in such a place i dont think the young men with you were very much your friends said frank i detected one in cheating you you mean at cards i dont mean that though i presume they did but you handed a tendollar bill to one of them and he took it as a five are you sure of that asked fred his face flushing with indignation yes i saw the number of the bill though he put it away very quickly and i had been treating that fellow all the afternoon i gave him a good dinner too are you surprised at such treatment from such a person asked his mother i should have expected it i will never notice the fellow again as long as i live said fred who seemed a good deal impressed by his companions treachery why its nothing better than robbery you have given it the right name fred said his mother quietly he ought to give the money back said fred let it go my son i am willing to lose it if it severs all acquaintance between you and your unworthy companions have i ever met you before asked fred turning to frank not before last evening i thought you spoke of yourself as an old acquaintance that was to induce you to come with me explained frank i hope you will excuse the deception certainly i will i had been drinking so much that it was quite necessary to treat me as a child but i dont mean to be caught in such a scrape again may you keep that resolution fred said his mother earnestly i will try to mother my mother tells me that you are going to take my place while i am in the country said fred turning to frank i shall be very glad to do so said our hero i never had such a good home before you are a telegraph boy are you not asked fred yes answered frank tell me about it is it hard work not hard but sometimes when i have been kept pretty busy i get tired towards night i should think it would be rather good fun said fred do you think you would like it asked his mother with a smile i might like it for about half a day but all day would be too much for me however i am too old for such a position fred had no false pride and though he knew that frank was in a social position considerably below his own he treated him as an equal those who are secure of their own position are much more likely to avoid putting on airs than those who have recently been elevated in the social scale frank was destined that same evening to see the contrast between true and false gentility it so happened that victor dupont already mentioned was an acquaintance and former schoolfellow of fred vivian it also chanced that he selected this evening for a call as the vivians stood very high socially being an old family victor was rather proud of his acquaintance with them and took occasion to call frequently as he was ushered into the room he did not at first recognize frank in his new clothes victor this is a friend of mine frank kavanagh said fred introducing his two visitors frank let me introduce my old schoolfellow victor dupont we are already acquainted said frank goodevening victor victor stared in amusing astonishment at frank how do you happen to be here asked victor brusquely by mrs vivians kind invitation said frank quite at ease how do you two happen to know each other asked fred we met in the country last summer said frank finding victor did not answer i suppose you had a very good time together said mrs vivian our acquaintance was very slight said victor superciliously we must have gone fishing together at least a dozen times said frank quietly how in the world did the fellow thrust himself in here said victor to himself they cant know his low position in the amiable desire of enlightening the vivians victor took an early opportunity to draw fred aside have you known frank kavanagh long he asked not very long do you know that he is a telegraph boy oh yes answered fred smiling he used to be a newsboy and sell papers in the lower part of the city i didnt know that said fred indifferently i must say that i am rather surprised to see him here why asked fred with provoking calmness oh you know he is much below us in a social point of view i know that he is a poor boy but some of our most prominent men were once poor boys i dont believe in mixing up different ranks you didnt think so in the country last summer oh well a fellow must have some company and there was no better to be had you will probably be surprised to hear that your old acquaintance is to live here while i am in the country i am going away tomorrow to spend a few weeks with my cousin is it possible exclaimed victor in surprise and annoyance perhaps he is to be here as an errand boy he suggested evidently relieved by the idea oh no he will be treated in all respects as one of the family hadnt you better tell your mother that he was once a newsboy she might recall the invitation it would make no difference with her it seems to me victor you are prejudiced against frank no i am not but i like to see newsboys and telegraph messengers keep their place so do i i hope frank will keep his place till he can find a better one that isnt what i meant how can you associate with such a boy on an equality because he seems wellbred and gentlemanly i dont believe he gets more than three or four dollars a week said victor contemptuously then i really hope his wages will soon be increased victor saw that he could do frank no harm and was forced out of policy to treat our hero with more politeness than he wished when frank rose to go mrs vivian desired him to send round his trunk and take possession of his room the next day she doesnt suspect that i never owned a trunk thought frank i will buy one tomorrow though i havent got much to put in it chapter xv at wallacks theatre the next day frank devoted what small leisure he had to the purchase of a trunk in which he stored his small supply of clothing leaving out however the clothes in which he made his first appearance in the city these he gave to his friend dick rafferty to whom they were a welcome gift being considerably better than those he usually wore dick might out of his earnings have dressed better but when he had any extra money it went for some kind of amusement he was one of the steadiest patrons of the old bowery and was often to be seen in the gallery of other places of amusement he was surprised to hear of franks intended removal from the lodginghouse i say frank he said youre gettin on fast here you are goin to live in a tiptop house uptown youll be a reglar swell i hope not dick i dont like swells very much you wont notice your old friends bimeby that shows you dont know me dick i shall be glad to notice you whenever we meet i dont see why i cant be in luck too said dick i wish i could find some rich lady to give me a room in her house youll have to get some new clothes first dick i know i aint got a genteel look said dick surveying his wellworn clothes soiled and ragged but it wouldnt be no use if i was to dress in velvet unless you kept your face clean suggested frank a feller cant be washin his face all the time said dick its the fashion to have a clean face in good society said frank smiling it must be a good deal of trouble said dick is my face very dirty not very theres a black spot on each cheek and one on the side of your nose and your chin looks a little shady a feller cant keep very clean in my business i suppose it is rather hard frank admitted but you wont be a bootblack always i hope id just as lieves give it up for bankin or cashier of a savingsbank said dick thems light genteel kinds of business and dont dirty the hands well dick if i hear of an opening in either line ill let you know now i must go and buy a trunk i never expect to get as far as a trunk said dick i shall feel like a gentleman when i can set up one it wouldnt be no use to me now id have to stuff it with rocks to make a show poor dick thought frank as he left his friend he takes the world too easy he hasnt any ambition or he wouldnt be content to keep on blacking boots when there are so many better ways of making a living if i ever get a chance to give him a lift i will he aint much to look at but hes a goodhearted boy and would put himself to a good deal of trouble to do me a favor it was not much trouble to pack his trunk indeed he had scarcely enough clothing to fill it onethird full i may have to adopt dicks plan and fill it with rocks said frank to himself some day i shall be better supplied i cant expect to get on too fast the room assigned to frank was a small one but it was neatly furnished and provided with a closet the bed with its clean white spread looked very tempting and frank enjoyed the prospect of the privacy he would have in a room devoted to his sole use at the lodginghouse though his bed was comfortable there were sixty to eighty boys who slept in the same room and of course he had no more rights than any other i hope you like your room frank said mrs vivian it is the best i ever had he replied how early are you obliged to be on duty she asked at eight oclock i do not breakfast till that hour but i will direct the cook to have a cup of coffee and some breakfast ready for you at seven am i to take my meals here asked frank in surprise certainly did you think i was going to send you out to a restaurant inquired mrs vivian smiling i am very much obliged to you but i am afraid it will inconvenience the cook to get me an early breakfast i am glad to see you so considerate of others i can answer for mary however who is very obliging you can get lunch outside as i suppose it will be inconvenient for you to leave your duties to come so far as thirtyeighth street you are very kind to me mrs vivian said frank gratefully i shall claim an occasional service of you in return said mrs vivian i hope you will said frank promptly two days after he had taken up his residence in his new quarters frank was called upon to render a very agreeable service i have two tickets for wallacks theatre for this evening said mrs vivian will it be agreeable for you to accompany me i should like it very much then you shall be my escort when fred is at home he goes with me but now i must depend on you have you a pair of kid gloves frank was obliged to confess that he had not in fact he had never owned a pair in his life i will give you a pair of mine probably there is little difference in the size of our hands this proved to be true somehow frank in his new life seemed always running across victor dupont that young gentleman and his sister sat in the row behind mrs vivian and her youthful escort but did not immediately become aware of it why victor said his sister who had been looking about her there is mrs vivian in the next row who is that nicelooking boy with her it cant be fred for he is larger victor turned his glance in the direction of mrs vivian his surprise and disgust were about equal when he saw the countryboy he had looked down upon faultlessly attired with neatfitting gloves and a rose in his buttonhole and looking like a gentleman i never saw such cheek he exclaimed in disgust what do you mean victor asked his sister looking puzzled do you want to know who that boy is with mrs vivian yes he is very nicelooking then you can marry him if you like that boy is a telegraph messenger i used to know him in the country a few weeks ago he was selling papers in front of the astor house you dont say so ejaculated flora dupont arent you mistaken i guess not i know him as well as i know you he is a goodlooking boy at any rate said flora who was less snobbish than her brother i cant see it said victor annoyed he looks to me very common and vulgar i dont see how mrs vivian can be willing to appear with him at a fashionable theatre like this its a pity he is a telegraph boy he is so nicelooking just then frank turning recognized victor and bowed victor could not afford not to recognize mrs vivians escort and bowed in return but victor was not the only one of franks acquaintances who recognized him that evening in the upper gallery sat dick rafferty and micky shea late fellowboarders at the lodginghouse it was not often that these young gentlemen patronized wallacks for even a gallery ticket there was highpriced but both wanted to see the popular play of ours and had managed to scrape together fifty cents each dick said micky suddenly theres frank kavanagh down near the stage in an orchestra seat so he is said dick aint he dressed splendid though wid kid gloves on and a flower in his buttonhole and an elegant lady beside him see shes whisperin to him now whod think he used to kape company wid the likes of us franks up in the world hes a reglar swell now and its i that am glad of it hes a good fellow frank is and he wont turn his back on us this was proved later in the evening for as frank left the theatre with mrs vivian he espied his two old friends standing outside and bowed with a pleasant smile much to the gratification of the two street boys who were disposed to look upon their old friend as one of the aristocracy chapter xvi frank as a detective of course franks daily duties were far the most part of a commonplace character they were more varied to be sure than those of an errandboy or shopboy but even a telegraph messenger does not have an adventure every day twice in the next three weeks our hero was summoned by mrs leroy to give her pet dog an airing it was not hard work but frank did not fancy it though he never failed to receive a handsome fee from the mistress of fido one day frank was summoned to a fashionable boardinghouse in a side street above the fifthavenue hotel on presenting himself the servant said its one of the boarders wants you stay here and ill let him know youve come all right said frank come right up said the girl directly after speaking from the upper landing frank ascended the stairs and entered a room on the second floor a gentleman partially bald with a rim of red hair around the bare central spot sat in a chair by the window reading a morning paper so youre the telegraph boy are you he said yes sir you are honest eh i hope so sir because i am going to trust you with a considerable sum of money it will be safe sir i want you to do some shopping for me are you ever employed in that way i was once sir let me see i want some linen handkerchiefs and some collars are you a judge of those articles not particularly however i suppose you know a collar from a pair of cuffs and a handkerchief from a towel said the stranger petulantly i rather think i can tell them apart said frank now let me see how many i want said the stranger reflectively i think halfadozen handkerchiefs will do how high shall i go asked frank you ought to get them for fifty cents apiece i should think yes sir i can get them for that and the collars well halfadozen will do get them of good quality size and pay whatever is asked yes sir do you want anything more i think not this morning i have a headache or i would go out myself explained the stranger i live up the hudson and i must go home this afternoon by the boat do you want me to buy the articles at any particular store inquired frank no i leave that to your judgment a large store is likely to have a better assortment i suppose very well sir come back as soon as you can thats all you havent given me the money yet sir said frank oh i beg pardon that is an important omission the stranger drew out a pocketbook which appeared to be well filled and extracted two bills of twenty dollars each which he passed to frank this is too much sir said the telegraph boy one of these bills will be much more than sufficient never mind i should like to have them both changed you can buy the articles at different places as this will give you a chance to get change for both i can get them changed at a bank sir no said the stranger hastily i would rather you would pay them for goods shopkeepers are bound to change bills for a customer i dont see what difference it makes to you as long as they are changed thought frank however it was not his business to question his employers decision sixth avenue was not far distant and as frank was left to his own choice he betook himself hither on his shopping tour entering a large retail store he inquired for gentlemans linen handkerchiefs large or small asked the girl in attendance large i should think he was shown some of good quality at fifty cents i think they will do said frank after examination i will take halfadozen so saying he drew out one of the twentydollar bills cash called the saleswoman tapping on the counter with her pencil several small boys were flitting about the store in the service of customers one of them made his appearance have you nothing smaller asked the girl noticing the denomination of the bill no answered frank she put the bill between the leaves of a small blank book and handed both that and the goods to the boy frank sat down on a stool by the counter to wait presently the cashboy came back and the proprietor of the store with him he was a portly man with a loud voice and an air of authority to him the cashboy pointed out frank are you the purchaser of these handkerchiefs he asked yes sir answered frank rather surprised at the question and did you offer this twentydollar bill in payment yes sir where did you get it think well said the trader sternly what is the matter isnt the bill a good one asked frank you have not answered my question however i will answer yours the bill is a counterfeit frank looked surprised and he understood at a flash why he had been trusted with two of these bills when one would answer i have nothing to do with that said the telegraph boy i was sent out to buy some articles and this money was given me to pay for them have you got any other money of this description asked the trader suspiciously yes answered frank readily i have another twenty let me see it certainly i should like to know whether that is bad too the other twenty proved to be a facsimile of the first i must know where you got this money said the merchant you may be in the service of counterfeiters you might know from my uniform that i am not said frank indignantly i once lost a place because i would not pass counterfeit money i have a detective here you must lead him to the man who supplied you with the money i am quite willing to do it said our hero he wanted to make a tool of me if i can put him into the hands of the law i will that boy is all right said a gentleman standing by the rogue was quite ingenious in trying to work off his bad money through a telegraph messenger what is the appearance of this man asked the detective as they walked along rather a reddish face and partly bald what is the color of the hair he has red very good it ought to be easy to know him by that description i should know him at once said frank promptly if he has not changed his appearance it is easy to do that and these fellows understand it well reaching the house frank rang the bell the detective sauntering along on the opposite side of the street is mr stanley at home asked frank i will see the girl came down directly with the information that mr stanley had gone out that is queer said frank he told me to come right back he said he had a headache too and did not want to go out as he spoke his glance rested on a man who was lounging at the corner this man had black hair and a full black beard by chance franks eye fell upon his right hand and with a start he recognized a large ring with a sparkling diamond real or imitation this ring he had last seen on mr stanleys hand he crossed the street in a quiet indifferent manner and imparted his suspicions to the detective good said the latter you are a smart boy he approached the man alluded to who confident in his disguise did not budge and placing his hand on his shoulder said mr stanley i believe you are mistaken said the man shrugging his shoulders in a nonchalant way with a foreign accent i am m lavalette i do not know your m stanley i am afraid you are forgetful monsieur i beg pardon but do you wear a wig and with a quick movement he removed the strangers hat and dislodging his black wig displayed the rim of red hair this is an outrage said the rogue angrily i will have you arrested monsieur i will give you a chance for here is an officer said the detective i give this man in charge for passing counterfeit money said the detective the next time mr stanley dont select so smart a telegraph boy he recognized you in spite of your disguise by the ring upon your finger the rogue angrily drew the ring from his finger and threw it on the sidewalk curse the ring he said it has betrayed me it only remains to add that stanley was convicted through franks testimony he proved to be an old offender and the chief of a gang of counterfeiters chapter xvii frank meets an old acquaintance frank was more fortunate than the generality of the telegraph boys in obtaining fees from those who employed him he was not allowed to solicit gifts but was at liberty to accept them when offered in one way or another he found his weekly receipts came to about seven dollars out of this sum he would have been able to save money even if he had been obliged to pay all his expenses that is by the exercise of strict economy but as we know he was at no expense for room or board with the exception of a light lunch in the middle of the day making a little calculation he found that he could save about four dollars a week as it had only been proposed to him to stay at mrs vivians while fred was in the country it seemed prudent to frank to make hay while the sun shone and save up a little fund from which he could hereafter draw in case it were necessary so when he had saved ten dollars he presented himself at the counter of the dime savingsbank then located in canal street and deposited it receiving a bankbook which he regarded with great pride i begin to feel like a capitalist he said to himself i am rather better off now than i was when i led round old mills the blind man i wonder how he is getting along as frank entered broadway from canal street by a strange coincidence he caught sight of the man of whom he had been thinking mills with the same querulous irritable expression he knew well was making his way up broadway led by a boy younger than frank pity a poor blind man he muttered from time to time in a whining voice look out you young rascal or you will have me off the sidewalk frank heard the blind man say ill have a reckoning with you when i get home the boy who was pale and slight looked frightened i couldnt help it mr mills he said it was the crowd you are getting careless thats whats the matter said mills harshly you are looking in at the shop windows and neglect me no i am not said the boy in meek remonstrance dont you contradict me exclaimed the blind man grasping his stick significantly pity a poor blind man what an old brute he is thought frank i will speak to him how do you do mr mills he said halting before the blind man who are you demanded mills quickly you ought to know me i am frank kavanagh who used to go round with you i have had so many boys most of them good for nothing that i dont remember you i am the boy who wouldnt pass counterfeit money for you hush said the blind man apprehensively lest some one should hear frank there was some mistake about that i remember you now do you want to come back this boy doesnt attend to his business frank laughed situated as he was now the proposal seemed to him an excellent joke and he was disposed to treat it as such why the fact is mr mills you fed me on such rich food that i shouldnt dare to go back for fear of dyspepsia or starvation he added to himself i live better now said mills i havent had any boy since that suited me as well as you thank you but i am afraid it would be a long time before i got rich on the wages you would give me ill give you fifty cents a week said mills and more if i do well you can come today if you like you are very kind but i am doing better than that said frank what are you doing selling papers no i have given that up i am a telegraph boy how much do you make seven dollars last week why you will be rich said the blind man enviously i dont think i get as much as that myself and i have to pay a boy out of it his poor guide did not have the appearance of being very liberally paid then you wont come back said mills querulously no i guess not come along boy said mills roughly to his little guide are you going to keep me here all day i thought you wanted to speak to this boy well i have got through he has deserted me it is the way of the world theres nobody to pity the poor blind man heres five cents for old acquaintance sake mr mills said frank dropping a nickel into the hand of the boy who was guiding him thank you may you never know what it is to be blind said mills in his professional tone if i am i hope i can see as well as you thought frank what a precious old humbug he is and how i pity that poor boy if i had a chance i would give him something to save him from starvation frank walked on quite elated at the change in his circumstances which allowed him to give money in charity to the person who had once been his employer he would have given it more cheerfully if in his estimation the man had been more worthy franks errand took him up broadway he had two or three stops to make which made it inconvenient for him to ride a little way in front of him he saw a boy of fourteen whom he recognized as an errandboy and a former fellowlodger at the newsboys lodginghouse he was about to hurry forward and join john riley for this was the boys name when his attention was attracted and his suspicions aroused by a man who accosted john he was a man of about thirty rather showily dressed with a gold chain dangling from his vest johnny he said addressing the errandboy do you want to earn ten cents i should like to answered the boy but i am going on an errand and cant spare the time it wont take five minutes said the young man it is only to take this note up to mr conants room on the fourth floor of this building they were standing in front of a high building occupied as offices the boy hesitated is there an answer he asked no you can come right down as soon as the letter is delivered i suppose i could spare the time for that said john riley of course you can it wont take you two minutes here is the ten cents ill hold your bundle for you while you run up all right said the errandboy and suspecting nothing he surrendered his parcel and taking the note and the dime ran upstairs no sooner was he out of sight than the young man began to walk off rapidly with the bundle it was an old trick that has been many times played upon unsuspecting boys and will continue to be played as long as there are knavish adventurers who prefer dishonest methods of getting a living to honest industry in this case however the rogue was destined to disappointment it may be stated that he had been present in the drygoods store from which the parcel came and knowing that the contents were valuable had followed the boy no sooner did frank understand the fellows purpose than he pursued him and seized him by the arm what do you want of me demanded the rogue roughly i am in a hurry and cant be detained i want you to give me that bundle which you are trying to steal from my friend john riley the rogues countenance changed what do you mean he demanded to gain time i mean that i heard your conversation with him and i know your game come back or i will call a policeman the young man was sharp enough to see that he must give up his purpose there take the bundle he said tossing it into franks arms i was only going for a cigar i should have brought it back when john riley came downstairs with the letter in his hand for he had been unable to find any man named conant in the building he found frank waiting with the parcel holloa frank wheres that man that sent me upstairs i cant find mr conant of course you cant theres no such man in the building that man was a thief but for me he would have carried off your bundle what a fool i was said the errandboy i wont let myself be fooled again dont give up a bundle to a stranger again said frank im only a country boy but i dont allow myself to be swindled as easily as you i wish that chap would come here again said johnny indignantly but ive come out best after all he added brightening up ive made ten cents out of him chapter xviii a rich womans sorrow one day frank was summoned to a handsome residence on madison avenue sit down in the parlor said the servant and i will call mrs graham as frank looked around him and noted the evidences of wealth in the elegant furniture and rich ornaments profusely scattered about he thought how rich mrs graham must be i suppose she is very happy i should be if i could buy everything i wanted it was a boys thought and betrayed our heros inexperience even unlimited means are not sure to produce happiness nor do handsome surroundings prove wealth five minutes later an elderly lady entered the room she was richly dressed but her face wore a look of care and sorrow as she entered frank rose with instinctive politeness and bowed you are the telegraph boy said the lady inquiringly yes maam mrs graham looked at him earnestly as if to read his character i have sent for you she said at length to help me in a matter of some delicacy and shall expect you not to speak of it even to your employers they never question me said frank promptly you may rely upon my secrecy franks statement was correct the business entrusted to telegraph messengers is understood to be of a confidential nature and they are instructed to guard the secrets of those who make use of their services i find it necessary to raise some money continued the lady apparently satisfied and am not at liberty for special reasons to call upon my husband for it i have a diamond ring of considerable value which i should like to have you carry either to a jeweller or a pawnbroker and secure what advance you can upon it and i believed she had plenty of money thought frank wondering i will do the best i can for you madam said our hero mrs graham drew from her pocket a small box containing a diamond ring which sparkled brilliantly in the sunshine it is beautiful said frank admiringly yes it cost originally eight hundred dollars said the lady eight hundred dollars echoed frank in wonder he had heard of diamond rings and knew they were valuable but had no idea they were so valuable as that how much do you expect to get on it he asked nothing near its value of course nor is that necessary two hundred dollars will be as much as i care to use and at that rate i shall be able the sooner to redeem it i believe i will tell you why i want the money not unless you think it best said frank it is best for i shall again require your services in disposing of the money the lady sat down on the sofa beside frank and told him the story which follows i have two children she said a daughter and a son the son has recently graduated from college and is now travelling in europe my daughter is now twentysix years of age she was beautiful and our social position was such that my husband who is a proud man confidently anticipated that she would make a brilliant match but at the age of nineteen ellen fell in love with a clerk in my husbands employ he was a young man of good appearance and character and nothing could be said against him except that he was poor this however was more than enough in mr grahams eyes when lawrence brent asked for the hand of our daughter my husband drove him from the house with insult and immediately discharged him from his employ ellen was highspirited and resented this treatment of the man she loved he soon obtained a place quite as good as the one he had lost and one day ellen left the house and married him she wrote to us excusing her action and i would gladly have forgiven her but her father was obdurate he forbade my mentioning her name to him and from that day to this he has never referred to her i am now coming to the business in which you are to help me for years my soninlaw was able to support his wife comfortably and also the two children which in time came to them but a year since he became sick and his sickness lasted till he had spent all his savings now he and his poor family are living in wretched lodgings and are in need of the common necessaries of life it is for them i intend the money which i can secure upon this ring frank could not listen without having his sympathies aroused i shall be still more glad to help you he said now that i know how the money is to be used thank you said the lady you are a good boy and i see that i can trust you implicitly she handed frank the box enjoining upon him to be careful not to lose it it is so small that it might easily slip from your pocket she said i shall take the best care of it said frank where would you advise me to go first i hardly know if i wished to sell it i would carry it to tiffany but it was purchased there and it might in that case come to my husbands ears there is a pawnbroker named simpson who i hear is one of the best of his class you may go there first how much shall i say you want on it asked frank dont mention my name at all said the lady hastily i suppose i shall have to give some name said frank in order that the ticket may be made out what is your own name frank kavanagh have you a mother living no said frank gravely then let the ticket be made out in your name if you wish it shall i bring the money to you mrs graham no my husband might be at home and it would arouse his suspicions at twelve oclock i will meet you at madison park at the corner opposite the union league club house you can then report to me your success very well said frank he went at once to the pawnbroker mentioned by mrs graham but for his uniform he would have been questioned closely as to how he came by the ring but telegraph boys are so often employed on similar errands that the pawnbroker showed no surprise after a careful examination he agreed to advance two hundred dollars and gave frank the money and the ticket when frank gave his own name he said that is your name is it not yes sir but the ring does not belong to you no it belongs to a lady who does not wish her name known it is all the same to us that was easily done thought frank now i must go and meet mrs graham have you got the money asked mrs graham anxiously as frank made his appearance yes replied frank how much the amount you asked for that is well now i shall be able to relieve my poor daughter i cannot bear to think of her and her poor children suffering for the lack of bread while i am living in luxury i wish mr graham was not so unforgiving will you take the money now asked frank i wish you to take fifty dollars to my daughter i will do so with pleasure what is her address mrs graham drew out a card on which she had pencilled her daughters address it proved to be a tenementhouse on the east side of the city not far from fourteenth street i wish i could go myself said mrs graham sadly but i do not dare to do so at present give ellen this money with my best love and say to her that a month hence i will again send her the same sum tell her to keep up good courage brighter days may be in store i will be sure to remember said frank in a tone of sympathy the errand was to his taste for he was about to carry help and comfort to those who needed both chapter xix a messenger of good tidings there stands a large tenementhouse on east fourteenth street five stories in height and with several entrances scores of barefooted and scantily attired children play in the halls or on the sidewalk in front and the great building is a human hive holding scores of families some of them unaccustomed to live better are tolerably content with their squalid and contracted accommodations but a few reduced by gradual steps from respectability and comfort find their positions very hard to bear on the third floor three small rooms were occupied by mr and mrs robert morgan and their two children she was the daughter of mrs graham and had been reared in affluence how she had incurred her fathers displeasure has already been told he had been taken sick some months before his little stock of money had melted away and now he was unable even to pay the small expenses of life in a tenementhouse just before frank made his appearance there was sadness in the little household how much money is there left ellen asked robert morgan seventyfive cents she answered in a tone which she tried to make cheerful and our weeks rent will become due tomorrow i may hear from mother suggested mrs morgan if you dont i dont know what will become of us all we shall be thrust into the street even this squalid home will be taken from us dont get discouraged robert isnt there enough to make me despondent ellen i can see now that i did very wrong to marry you do you regret our marriage then robert asked his wife only because it has brought you poverty and discomfort i have not yet regretted it how different a position you would have occupied if i had not dragged you down you would still be living in luxury i should not have you and these dear children and will they compensate you for what has come upon you yes she answered emphatically you have more philosophy than i have ellen more trust perhaps do you know robert i think we are on the eve of good fortune i hope so but i see no prospects of it just then there was a knock at the door thinking that it might be some humble neighbor on a borrowing expedition mrs morgan opened the door before her stood our hero in his uniform is this mrs robert morgan asked frank yes she answered i come from your mother from my mother robert do you hear that said the poor woman in a voice of gladness here is a messenger from my mother didnt i tell you there was good luck in store for us mr morgan did not answer he waited anxiously to hear what frank had to communicate your mother sends you her love and fifty dollars continued frank she hopes to call soon herself fifty dollars exclaimed ellen morgan in delight it is a fortune thank heaven ejaculated her husband in great relief a month hence you may expect a similar sum said frank i suppose i shall bring it shall i find you here ellen morgan looked at her husband no said he let us get out of this neighborhood as soon as possible cant you find a respectable place today yes said his wife i shall be glad to move i saw some neat rooms on west twentieth street on monday they will cost us but little more and will suit us better i will send my mother my new address she said to frank then you may send it under cover to me and i will see that she gets it privately said frank who had received instructions to that effect from mrs graham when frank had left the room the little household seemed quite transformed hope had entered and all looked more cheerful we are provided for for two months robert said his wife is not that a piece of good luck yes indeed it is he answered heartily before that time i can get to work again and with health and employment i shall not need to ask favors of any one i wish father were as forgiving as mother said ellen morgan your father is a hard man he will never forgive you for marrying a poor man he would punish you by starvation he is very proud said mrs morgan i was an only daughter you know and he had set his heart upon my making a brilliant marriage as you might have done as i did not care to do i preferred to make a happy marriage with the man of my choice you are a good wife ellen i hope you will always find me so robert i should have sunk utterly if you had been like some women in the afternoon mrs morgan went out taking one of her children with her she went to the rooms on west twentieth street and finding them still vacant secured them paying a months rent in advance as her mothers timely gift enabled her to do before the next evening they were installed in their new home and mrs morgan sent a note to her mother under cover to frank apprising her of the removal two days later frank received a summons to the house on madison avenue he obeyed thinking he should probably be sent with some message to mrs morgan he found mrs graham in a state of nervous excitement my husband has been stricken with paralysis she said it is terribly sudden he went out yesterday apparently in vigorous health he was brought home pale and helpless can i do anything for him or you asked frank yes you can go at once to my daughter and summon her to her fathers bedside frank was surprised remembering how obdurate mrs graham had described her husband to be you look surprised she said but sickness often produces a great change in us my husbands pride has given way his affection has returned and it is at his request that i send for ellen frank had come to feel a personal interest in the family and he gladly set out for the modest home in west twentieth street he felt that it was pleasant to be a messenger of reconciliation mrs morgan recognized him at once and received him cordially do you come from my mother she asked yes she wishes you to come home at once but my father your father is very sick and he joins in the request it has come at last the time i have looked forward to for so long said ellen morgan clasping her hands robert do you feel equal to looking after the children while i am gone yes ellen go at once god grant that your fathers heart may be softened for your sake for myself i am content to live in poverty but i dont like to see you suffer what is the matter with father did my mother tell you frank explained and thus gave her fresh cause for anxiety on reaching her fathers chamber she was shocked by his changed appearance but her heart was gladdened by the wan smile that lighted up his face assuring her that she was welcome from the doctor she received the assurance that her father was in no immediate danger indeed he expressed a confident hope that mr graham would rally from his present attack and be able to go about his business again though caution would be required against undue excitement or fatigue the doctors prediction was verified mr graham recovered but his old pride and obduracy did not come back he became reconciled to his soninlaw and provided him a wellpaid position in his own mercantile establishment and provided rooms in the madisonavenue mansion for the little family whom frank had first visited in the squalid tenementhouse in fourteenth street and the glad voices of children made the house no longer lonely you must call and see us often said ellen morgan to our hero i shall always remember you as the messenger who brought us good tidings at the darkest hour in our fortunes we shall always welcome you as a friend chapter xx a new job and a letter from home one morning an elderly gentleman entered the office in which frank was employed and sought an interview with the superintendent i want a smart boy for detective work he said have you one you can recommend the superintendent cast his eyes over the line of boys and called frank our heros recognition of the disguised counterfeiter by his ring had given him a reputation for shrewdness i think this boy will suit you he said do you wish him to go with you now yes i may want him a week very well frank accompanied the gentleman into the street have you no other clothes except this uniform asked mr hartley yes sir then go and put them on then report to me at no broadway all right sir it is fortunate i have a good suit thought frank he was not long in exchanging his uniform for the neat suit given him by mr bowen thus attired he presented himself in mr hartleys countingroom the merchant surveyed him with approval illustration the merchant surveyed with approval you will enter my service as errandboy he said you will be sent to the postoffice the bank and on similar errands in order not to excite suspicion of the real object of your presence keep your eyes open and i will take an opportunity of explaining to you later what i wish you to do frank bowed mr haynes said the merchant calling a thin sallow young man i have engaged this boy as an errandboy has any one been to the postoffice this morning no sir then he will go haynes regarded frank with disfavor i have a nephew who would have liked the position he said too late now said the merchant curtly what is your name boy asked haynes coldly frank kavanagh how did mr hartley happen to engage you asked the subordinate a gentleman recommended me frank answered i had already mentioned my nephew to him i am surprised he said nothing to me about engaging a boy frank said nothing feeling no particular interest in the matter as he was only filling temporarily the position of errand boy it made little difference to him whether he was acceptable to mr haynes or not in the course of the day mr hartley handed frank a card containing the street and number of his residence with a pencilled invitation to call that evening of course frank did so seated alone with the merchant in his back parlor the latter said i have invited you here because i could not speak with you freely at the store how do you like mr haynes frank was surprised at the abruptness of the question i dont like him he answered candidly why not there is no good reason that i know of said frank but i think his manner is disagreeable our instincts are often to be trusted said the merchant thoughtfully i confess that i myself dont like haynes nor do i feel implicit confidence in him though he has been eight years in the service of our house he is outwardly very circumspect and apparently very faithful but there is something in his eye which i dont like frank had noticed this but mr hartleys remark called fresh attention to its furtive crafty expression franks curiosity was aroused naturally enough he wondered what mr haynes had to do with his mission he did not have long to wait for information i will come to the point said mr hartley after a pause i am an importing merchant and deal among other articles in silks during the last year i have discovered that some one is systematically robbing me and that parts of my stock have been spirited away the loss i have sustained is already considerable and unless the leakage is put a stop to i may as well give up business you can now guess why i have engaged you no one will suspect an errand boy of being a detective while a man would very probably excite distrust and put the rogue on his guard frank listened attentively to his employer do you suspect any one in particular mr hartley he asked it must be some one in my employ he said the man who more than any other has facilities for robbing me is the man of whom i have spoken to you mr haynes yes mr haynes he holds an important position and enjoys special privileges on the other hand so far as i can learn he lives in a sober inexpensive way quite within his salary which is liberal he is prominently connected with an uptown church and it seems very improbable that he would be guilty of robbery or breach of trust yet there have been such cases before at any rate i cannot wholly divest myself of suspicion what do you wish me to do asked frank to watch mr haynes carefully both in and out of the store to ascertain whether he has any unexplained expenses or any questionable companions i want to know how he spends his time out of the office it may be that the result of my investigation will be to his credit it may be that he is all that he seems a reputable member of the church and of society with nothing against him but an unpleasant manner should this be the case i shall be glad to correct my suspicions and give him back my confidence in that case we must look elsewhere for the rogue who is robbing me have you any particular instructions to give me asked frank no only to follow haynes and find out all you can about him use great care in doing it not to arouse his or any one elses suspicion i will find an opportunity for you to make your reports very well sir when frank got home he found a letter awaiting him from his country home it was in answer to one which he had written to his uncle deacon pelatiah kavanagh in reference to a trunk which had belonged to his father this is the letter my dear nephew i am glad to learn that you are making a living in the city it is much better that you should earn your own living than to be a burden upon me though of course i would not see you suffer but a mans duty is to his own household and my income from the farm is very small and hannah and i agreed that we had little to spare for others there is an old trunk belonging to your deceased father in the attic it contains some old clothes which may be made over for you and so save you expense i would use them myself and allow you for them but your father was a much smaller man than i and his clothes would not fit me i will send the trunk by express to the address which you gave me of course i shall expect you to pay the express as i have no interest in it or its contents your cousin jonathan has left school and is working on the farm i feel so glad that he has no extravagant tastes but inherits the careful and economical habits of his mother and myself i am sure he will never waste or squander the little property which i hope to leave him i dont believe he will thought frank for he is about as mean as his mother and that is saying a good deal your aunt and i hope that you will steer clear of the temptations of the city do not seek after vain amusements but live a sober life never spending a cent unnecessarily and you will in time become a prosperous man i would invite you to come and stop with us over sunday but for the railroad fare which is high it will be better to save your money and put off the visit till you can afford it your uncle pelatiah kavanagh reading this letter it would hardly be supposed that the writer owned ten thousand dollars in stocks bonds and mortgages over and above an excellent farm such however was the worldly position of the man who sent frank to the city in quest of a living because he could not afford to provide for him with some men prudence is a virtue with deacon pelatiah kavanagh it was carried so far as to be a positive defect chapter xxi franks first discovery so far as frank could observe mr haynes was an active energetic salesman he appeared to understand his duties thoroughly and to go about them in a straightforward manner so far as his personal habits were concerned they seemed irreproachable he was neatly but plainly dressed wore no jewelry and carried a plain silver watch which when new probably did not cost over twenty dollars frank had no difficulty in ascertaining where he lived it was in a brick house on waverley place very unpretentious and certainly not fashionable in order to find out how much he paid for his accommodations frank visited the house on pretence of being in search of board we have a hall bedroom on the third floor at five dollars a week including board said the landlady how would that suit you i may have a friend board with me said frank in that case we should need a large room have you any vacant there is the front room on the third floor we would let it to two gentlemen at eleven dollars for the two isnt the back room cheaper inquired our hero yes but it is occupied by a business gentleman can you tell me his name i may be acquainted with him his name is haynes how much does he pay he pays eight dollars a week and has the room alone i suppose his room is not likely to become vacant soon oh dear no he has been with us for several years we should be sorry to lose him last christmas he gave my daughter a present of a nice silkdress pattern frank was struck by this information i dont believe he paid anything for the silk thought he i wish i could find out he had learned all he cared for and left saying he might call again his expenses seem very moderate for a man in his position thought frank i wonder if he makes any investments fortune favored our hero in the prosecution of his inquiry keeping haynes in sight as was his custom he observed that the latter in pulling out a handkerchief from the breastpocket of his coat had brought with it a letter also frank quickly and unobserved picked it up and when he was alone looked at the address it was directed to james haynes at his residence in waverley place on the envelope was the printed address of a realestate broker in brooklyn frank knew that there was at that time considerable speculation in brooklyn real estate and he examined the letter it ran thus we have found a corner lot with several lots adjoining near prospect park which may be obtained for five thousand dollars half cash we have no hesitation in recommending the purchase being convinced from the tendencies of the market that the buyer will double his money in a comparatively short time if you are engaged at other times come over on sunday afternoon and we will show you the property the house you purchased of us last year is worth fully a thousand dollars more than the price you gave i wonder how much he gave said frank to himself the letter was signed henderson co no fulton street our hero was elated by the discovery he had made and he sought an interview with mr hartley have you discovered anything asked the merchant noticing the eager look of his young detective without attaching especial importance to the fact frank answered i have found out that mr haynes owns a house in brooklyn indeed said hartley quickly but he continued more slowly he might buy one with the money saved from his salary he is also thinking of buying some lots near prospect park how did you learn this asked the merchant surprised i would rather not tell you said frank who was not quite sure whether mr hartley would sanction his examination of a private letter you may be sure that it is true very well i will rest contented with that assurance i will leave you to work in your own way your information is important for it seems to show that mr haynes has made investments beyond his ability if he were dependent upon his savings alone that is what i thought said frank i must try to find out where he gets this extra money if you do that and prove my suspicions correct i will make you a handsome present besides paying the company regular rates for your services thank you sir i will try to earn your gifts chapter xxii following up a clue this is not a detective story and i shall not therefore detail the steps by which our young hero succeeded in tracing out the agency of haynes in defrauding the firm by which he was employed it required not one week but three to follow out his clues and qualify himself to make a clear and intelligible report to mr hartley he had expressly requested the merchant not to require any partial report as it might interfere with his working unobserved towards the end of the third week he asked an interview with mr hartley well frank said the merchant familiarly who is the rogue mr haynes answered our hero you speak confidently said his employer but surmise will not do i want proof or i cannot act i will tell you what i have discovered said frank and i leave you to judge for yourself have you a customer in hartford named davis he asked yes and a very good customer he is frequent in his orders and makes prompt payments i wish i had more like him if you had more like him you would soon be bankrupt said frank quietly what do you mean asked mr hartley in genuine surprise how can a customer who buys largely and pays promptly be undesirable did you know that mr davis is a brotherinlaw of mr haynes no but even if he is i have to thank mr haynes for securing me so excellent a customer hartley spoke confidently evidently believing that frank was on the wrong tack i have noticed said frank that when goods are packed to go to mr davis mr haynes personally superintends the packing and employs one particular man to pack what then i think he has something to conceal i dont understand what he can have to conceal if davis is his brotherinlaw it is natural that he should feel a special interest in filling his orders i shouldnt wonder if mr haynes were a partner as well as a brotherinlaw of mr davis mr hartley looked surprised that may be true though i dont know why you should conjecture it admitting that you are right i dont know that i have any right to object i should like it better however if i were frankly told by mr haynes of this circumstance i will tell you what i think i have discovered continued frank the cases that are shipped to mr davis not only contain the goods he has ordered but valuable silks that he has not ordered and does not propose to pay for i see i see exclaimed mr hartley a light dawning upon him for the first time i was stupid not to comprehend your meaning earlier what warrant have you for suspecting this first your steady losses of goods next the ease with which mr haynes in his position of trust could carry out this plan why should he superintend the packing of mr daviss goods alone of all your customers there is weight in what you say frank you are certainly an extraordinary boy you have shown so much shrewdness that i now ask your advice what steps shall i take to ascertain whether mr haynes is really guilty of what we suspect him there is an order now being filled for mr davis answered frank when the order is filled cant you open the case and find out whether the contents correspond exactly to the bill the very thing to facilitate matters i will send mr haynes to brooklyn on a confidential errand fortunately there is a matter that will give me a good excuse for doing so go back to your post and when mr haynes appears to be at liberty send him to me half an hour later mr haynes entered the counting room of his employer you sent for me sir he said a little uneasily for when conscience accuses the mind is always apprehensive yes mr haynes said the merchant in his usual tone have you any objection to go to brooklyn for me on a confidential errand none in the world sir said haynes relieved i shall be glad to take the trip this fine morning it is almost too pleasant to remain indoors thank you i will give you your instructions and shall be glad to have you go at once it is not necessary to our story that we should know the nature of the errand on which haynes was sent it served the purpose of getting him out of the way when the suspected clerk was fairly on his way mr hartley went to the packingroom and looked about him till he discovered the case addressed to h l davis co hartford conn open this case said he to one of the workmen there was a mistake recently in sending some goods to davis and i wish to compare these with the bill i think they are all right sir said the man addressed mr haynes saw them packed mr haynes will not be responsible for any mistake said mr hartley i would rather see for myself the case was opened and the merchant discovered about two hundred dollars worth of silk which was not included in the bill go and call mr hunting said mr hartley quietly mr hunting filled one of the most important positions in the establishment to him his employer explained the nature of his discovery mr hunting he said i wish you to see and attest the fraud that has been attempted upon me this case was packed under the special charge of mr haynes is it possible that mr haynes knew of this exclaimed his fellowclerk davis is his brotherinlaw said mr hartley significantly has this been going on long do you think sir for several years i suspect mr haynes has no doubt found it very profitable shall i close up the case again sir asked the workman yes but it is not to go you may await my further orders the silk was taken out and replaced in the silk department so much has been saved at least said the merchant when mr haynes comes back he said to the usher send him to me chapter xxiii brought to bay mr haynes had a private reason for accepting readily the commission to visit brooklyn it occurred to him at once that it would give him an excellent chance to call on his realestate agent and confer with him upon future investments for james haynes had the comfortable consciousness that he was a prosperous man month by month and year by year he was adding largely to his gains and while he was still a young man he would be rich if all went well of course this meant if his peculations remained undiscovered why should they not be he plumed himself on the skill with which he managed to rob his employer he was no vulgar bungler to break into the store or enter into an alliance with burglars not he the property he took was carried off openly before mr hartleys very eyes and he knew nothing of it he did not even suspect that he was being robbed this is what mr haynes thought but as we know he was mistaken even now he was in a net but did not know it after attending to mr hartleys commission haynes went to see his broker the conversation he had with the broker was of a very encouraging character he was congratulated upon his investments and assured that they would pay him handsomely james haynes returned from brooklyn in a very pleasant mood a year or two more of life as a clerk and i will throw off the yoke he said to himself i must be worth at least fifteen thousand dollars now apart from any rise in the value of my investments when i reach twentyfive thousand i will resign my position and go to europe i shall than possess an income adequate to my simple wants is mr hartley in the countingroom he asked as he reлntered the store yes sir and he wishes to see you of course he wants to see me to hear my report the merchant looked up as haynes entered the countingroom so you are back he said gravely yes sir i was detained a little but i fulfilled my commission that is well here haynes made his report mr hartley listened with an abstracted air for his thoughts were upon the defalcation of the man before him finishing his statement james haynes turned to leave the office but his employer called him back wait a minute mr haynes he said gravely i wish to ask you one or two questions certainly sir i believe we have transactions with a party in hartford with the firmname of h l davis co yes sir said haynes starting and flushing a little is mr davis a relative of yours yes sir i wonder where he heard that haynes asked himself is there any trouble is he behind in his payments inquired the clerk no he has always settled his bills with commendable promptness i insisted on that said haynes in a satisfied tone i didnt want you to lose by any connection of mine and you are quite sure that i have lost nothing by mr davis demanded the merchant regarding haynes intently the latter changed color how is that possible he inquired since he has met his payments promptly you have personally seen to the packing of mr daviss goods i believe mr haynes well generally stammered the rather disconcerted clerk at all events you did so this morning yees after you started for brooklyn i had the case opened and found some patterns of silk not included in the bill i suppose there was a mistake said haynes turning pale you think this has not happened before i am sure of it mr haynes said his employer sternly you may as well drop the mask of innocence i have been robbed systematically for the last three years and i now understand how it was done you and davis between you have plundered me in an exceedingly ingenious manner it will go hard with you before a jury you wont have me arrested exclaimed haynes his pallor indicating his dismay why should i not you could prove nothing i will take my chance of that have you nothing more to say i though i do not admit that your charge is correct i am willing to make over to you the greater part of my property to avoid the scandal of a trial that will not do mr haynes were i to accept this upon such a ground you could rightfully bring against me a charge of blackmail what then are your terms asked haynes sullenly you must write out a confession of your guilt which i shall put among my private papers and not make public unless necessary and in addition you must make over to me property to the amount of ten thousand dollars it will not make up my losses but i will accept it as restitution in full against this james haynes most strongly protested alleging that the sum demanded was far beyond the amount of his purloinings but finally he yielded being privately resolved to make his brotherinlaw pay onehalf of the forfeiture you will leave my service at the end of the week mr haynes said his employer and during next week you must attend to the transfer how did he find out said haynes to himself as with grave face he went about the duties of the place he was so soon to leave if i could find out i would have my revenge chapter xxiv an open enemy frank remained with mr hartley till the guilty clerk left the establishment this was at the special request of the merchant who did not care to let mr haynes suspect who had been instrumental in bringing his guilt to light i suppose you have no further use for me now mr hartley said the telegraph boy not at present frank said his employer kindly then i will report for duty at the telegraph office wait a moment you have done me a great service i am glad of that sir answered frank modestly you have shown uncommon shrewdness and intelligence frank looked gratified and expressed his thanks for the compliment i want to make you a present in addition to the wages which you receive from the office said mr hartley thank you sir mr hartley drew from his desk a fivetwenty government bond of one hundred dollars and handed it to our hero do you mean all this for me asked frank quite overwhelmed by the magnitude of the gift it is not more than you deserve i might have given you the money value of the bond but i give it to you in this shape because i hope you will keep it as an investment it will yield you six dollars interest annually in gold i hope the time will come when you will have more interest in the same way i hope i shall sir i shall feel quite rich now you are richer in the qualities which have won you this acknowledgment how do you like the telegraph service very well sir for the present it is much better than being a newsboy exactly but there are positions you would prefer yes sir i would like to be in some mercantile business where i might work my way up in a few years i shall be too old for a telegraph boy and then i shall be out of place i will relieve your fears on that score in six months i shall make some changes in the list of employees when that time comes i will find a place for you there is nothing i should like better sir said frank his face flushing with pleasure i am satisfied that you will make a useful and intelligent clerk until i want you remain where you are the discipline of your present office will do you no harm but will help qualify you for usefulness and success in the mercantile career thank you sir now i have something to look forward to i shall work much more cheerfully frank went back to the office and resumed his ordinary duties one day he was riding down broadway in a stage when he became sensible that he had attracted the attention of a gentleman sitting opposite this led him to scan the face of the man who was observing him he at once recognized mr haynes the stage was not full and the latter came over and took a seat next to the telegraph boy isnt your name frank kavanagh he asked abruptly yes sir were you not for a short time in the employ of mr hartley yes answered frank feeling embarrassed for he knew that he was suspected i infer from your uniform that you have left mr hartley yes why did you leave him asked haynes sharply because he had no further occasion for my services why did you leave him asked frank in turn james haynes colored and looked angry however he answered the question i have other business views he said briefly so have i the next question was also of an embarrassing character were you a telegraph boy before you entered mr hartleys employ i was answered frank were you detailed for duty there our hero thought that he had answered questions enough by this time and signified as much to his questioner if i had been he said i shouldnt be permitted to inform a stranger i have particular reasons for asking the question said haynes then you can ask mr hartley or the superintendent of my office goodmorning sir i get out here frank pulled the strap and got out but he was not rid of his questioner haynes got out too and walked beside our hero i believe he said sternly that you were sent for to act as a spy on me what makes you think so asked the telegraph boy looking him in the eye there was a difficulty between mr hartley and myself occasioned by a base and groundless charge concocted by some enemy i believe that you had something to do with this i have brought no groundless charge against any one said frank did you make any report to mr hartley in regard to me i must refer you to mr hartley for information said frank i have an errand in here and he entered a store in the lower part of broadway there is no doubt about it thought haynes that boy was a spy upon me i have learned all i cared to i owe you a debt of gratitude for this frank kavanagh and mean to pay the debt when frank came out he thought it possible that haynes might be waiting for him but the disgraced clerk was gone i suppose he would injure me if he had a chance thought the telegraph boy i wont give him the chance if i can help it chapter xxv what the old trunk contained mention has been made of an old trunk belonging to franks father which had been forwarded to him from the country by his uncle pelatiah it may be mentioned here that our heros father had been agent of a woollen mill in a large manufacturing town for a considerable number of years he had been in receipt of a handsome salary and had lived in good style but still within his income he was naturally supposed to possess a comfortable property his death was sudden he was thrown from a carriage and striking his head upon the curbstone was picked up senseless and died unconscious upon examining into his affairs his administrator was unable to find any property beyond what was needed to pay the few debts he left behind him so it came about that frank was left a penniless orphan his uncle pelatiah was his nearest relative and to him he was sent pelatiah kavanagh was not a bad man nor was he intentionally unkind but he was very close all his life he had denied himself to save money and in this he had been ably assisted by his wife who was even closer and meaner than her husband it may readily be supposed that it was very disagreeable to both husband and wife to have a penniless nephew thrown upon their care and protection how could your brother be so thoughtless and inconsiderate as to use up all his money and leave his son destitute didnt he have a handsome income yes said pelatiah he got two thousand dollars a year and maybe more you dont say so ejaculated his wife hed ought to have saved twothirds of it i declare its scandalous for a man to waste his substance in that way my brother was allus free with his money he wasnt so keerful as you and i be i should think not indeed we dont begin to spend half as much as he did and now he comes upon us to support his child it dont seem right said pelatiah right its outrageous exclaimed mrs kavanagh energetically i declare i have no patience with such a man it would only be right to send this boy frank to the poorhouse the neighbors would talk protested pelatiah who was half inclined to accept his wifes view but was more sensitive to the criticism of the community in which he lived let em talk said his more independent helpmate it isnt right that this boy should use up the property that we have scraped together for his cousin jonathan we must keep him for a while hannah but ill get rid of him as soon i can consistently with this mrs kavanagh had to be satisfied but during her nephews stay of two months in the farmhouse she contrived to make him uncomfortable by harsh criticisms of his dead father whom he had tenderly loved you must have lived very extravagant she said or your father would have left a handsome property i dont think we did aunt hannah you father kept a carriage didnt he yes he had considerable riding to do how much help did he keep only one servant in the kitchen and a stableboy there was no need of a boy you could have done the work in the stable i was kept at school oh of course sneered his aunt you must be brought up as a young gentleman our jonathan never had any such chances and now youre livin on him or about the same i suppose you kept an extravagant table too what did you generally have for breakfast so aunt hannah continued her catechising much to franks discomfort she commented severely upon the wastefulness of always having pastry for dinner we cant afford it she said emphatically but then again we dont mean to have our jonathan beholden to anybody in case your uncle and i are cast off sudden what did you have for dinner on sunday meat and pudding and icecream that is in warm weather icecream ejaculated aunt hannah holding up both hands no wonder your father didnt leave nothin why we dont have icecream moren once a year and now we cant afford to have it at all since weve got another mouth to feed i am sorry that you have to stint yourself on my account replied frank feeling rather uncomfortable i suppose its our cross said mrs kavanagh gloomily but it does seem hard that we cant profit by our prudence because of your fathers wasteful extravagance such remarks were very disagreeable to our young hero and it was hard for him to hear his father so criticised he supposed they must have lived extravagantly since it was so constantly charged by those about him and he felt puzzled to account for his fathers leaving nothing when after two months his uncle and aunt who had deliberated upon what was best to be done proposed to him to go to new york and try to earn his own living he caught at the idea he knew that he might suffer hardships in the new life that awaited him but if he could support himself in any way he would escape from the cruel taunts to which he was now forced to listen every day how he reached the city and how he succeeded my readers know we now come to the trunk which some time after its reception frank set about examining he found it was filled with clothing belonging to his father though a part were in good condition it seemed doubtful whether they would be of much service to him it occurred to him to examine the pockets of the coats in one he found a common yellow envelope bearing his fathers name opening it he found to his great astonishment that it was a certificate of railroad stock setting forth his fathers ownership of one hundred shares of the capital stock of the said railway our hero was greatly excited by his discovery this then was the form in which his father had invested his savings what the shares were worth he had no idea but he rejoiced chiefly because now he could defend his father from the charge of recklessly spending his entire income and saving nothing he resolved as soon as he could find time to visit a wallstreet broker by whom he had occasionally been employed and inquire the value of the stock two days afterwards the opportunity came and he availed himself of it at once can you tell me the value of these shares mr glynn he asked they are quoted today at one hundred and ten answered the broker referring to a list of the days stock quotations do you mean that each share is worth a hundred and ten dollars asked frank in excitement certainly then the whole are worth five thousand five hundred dollars rather more for the last semiannual dividend has not been collected to whom do they belong they did belong to my father now i suppose they are mine has your fathers estate been administered upon yes but these shares had not then been found then some legal steps will be necessary before you can take possession and dispose of them i will give you the address of a good lawyer and advise you to consult him at once frank did so and the lawyer wrote to uncle pelatiah to acquaint him with the discovery the news created great excitement at the farm why franks a rich boy ejaculated aunt hannah and my brother wasnt so foolishly extravagant as we supposed that may be but with his salary we could have saved more perhaps we might but these shares are worth almost six thousand dollars thats a good deal of money hannah so it is pelatiah ill tell you what wed better do what invite frank to come back and board with us he can afford to pay handsome board and it seems better that the money should go to us than a stranger just so hannah he could board with us and go to school youd better write and invite him to come i allus liked the boy and if we could have afforded it id have been in favor of keepin him for nothing so would i said his uncle and he probably believed it though after what had happened it will be rather difficult for the reader to credit it the letter was written but frank had no desire to return to the old farm and the society of his uncles family i have got used to the city he wrote and have made a good many friends here i dont know yet whether i shall take a business position or go to school but if the latter the schools here are better than in the country i hope to come and see you before long but i would prefer to live in new york hes gettin uppish said aunt hannah who was considerably disappointed for she had made up her mind just how much they could venture to charge for board and how this would increase their annual savings i suppose its natural for a boy to prefer the city said his uncle if the boy has a chance to handle his money there wont be much of it left by the time hes twentyone said aunt hannah you ought to be his guardian he has the right to choose his own guardian said uncle pelatiah hell take some city man likely frank did in fact select the lawyer having learned that he was a man of high reputation for integrity he offered it to mr bowen but that gentleman while congratulating his young friend upon his greatly improved prospects said that he was a man of books rather than of business and would prefer that some other person be selected the next thing was to resign his place as telegraph boy we are sorry to lose you said the superintendent your are one of our best boys do you wish to go at once no sir i will stay till the end of the month very well we shall be glad to have you three weeks yet remained till the close of the month it was not long but before the time had passed frank found himself in a very unpleasant predicament from no fault of his own but in consequence of the enmity of the clerk whom he had been instrumental in displacing chapter xxvi a trap and who fell into it no one rejoiced more sincerely at franks good luck than mrs vivian her interest in our hero had increased and while at first she regarded herself as his patroness she had come now to look upon him as a member of the family fred had already returned and frank bearing in mind that he had only been invited to remain during his absence proposed to find another home but mrs vivian would not hear of it no she said fred needs a young companion and i prefer you to any one i know of as fred was of his mothers opinion frank readily agreed to stay he occupied a room adjoining the one assigned to fred and during his hours of leisure the two were constantly together i shall be glad when you leave the telegraph office said fred then we can be together more you may get tired of me if i do i will let you know two days afterwards frank was riding down town in a sixthavenue car until he had taken his seat he was not aware that james haynes was a passenger when a lady who sat between them got out haynes moved up so as to sit next to our hero i see you are still in the telegraph service he said yes sir answered frank briefly i wonder mr hartley didnt offer you a permanent position in his employ said haynes with a sneer spies are useful sometimes he may give me a position sometime said frank not regarding the sneer you earned it said haynes unpleasantly thank you said frank knowing that haynes would be provoked by his appearing to accept the compliment in good faith haynes scowled but said no more he drew a morning paper from his pocket and appeared to be absorbed in reading it at canal street frank rose to leave the car he had not yet reached the door when haynes sprang to his feet followed him quickly and grasping him by the arm said not so fast young man give me back my pocketbook frank was struck with amazement what do you mean he asked indignantly i mean that you have relieved me of my pocketbook gentlemen turning to his fellowpassengers i demand that this boy be searched you can search me if you like said frank you know very well that your accusation is false i shall be satisfied if you produce what is in your pockets thats fair said a passenger our hero thrust his hand into his pocket to his dismay he drew out a russialeather pocketbook of which he knew nothing that is my pocketbook gentlemen said haynes triumphantly i can tell you exactly what is in it you will find two fivedollar bills a two and a one be kind enough to examine it sir the pocketbook was examined and of course haynes was correct suspicious glances were directed at poor frank innocent as he was he was so overwhelmed by the suddenness of the charge and the apparent proof of it that he looked confused and embarrassed you are beginning early my boy said a tall gentleman in a white cravat a clergyman it is well that you are checked in the beginning of a guilty career sir said frank i am as innocent as you are this man is my enemy and he must have put the pocketbook in my pocket he threatened some time since to get me into a scrape that story is rather too thin said haynes looking around him with a sneer you wont find any one here quite verdant enough to believe it there you are mistaken said a gentleman who was seated directly opposite to haynes and frank i believe it haynes scowled at him malignantly i really dont think it very important what you believe sir the boy is evidently a professional thief and you may belong to the same gang for aught i know i propose to give him in charge to the next policeman we meet do so said the stranger coolly i shall be present at his trial and offer some important testimony indeed said haynes uneasily may i ask what it is certainly i saw you thrust the wallet into the boys pocket of that i am willing to make oath james haynes turned pale there was a sudden change in public opinion it was he who now had become an object of suspicion young man said the clergyman solemnly what could have induced you to enter into such a wicked conspiracy against the poor boy mind your own business said haynes rudely it is a lie it is the truth said the volunteer witness calmly here a policeman became visible from the carwindow leisurely walking his beat on the western sidewalk theres a policeman said franks new friend call him and have the boy arrested he would be cleared by false testimony said haynes sullenly i have my money back and will let him go then said the stranger rising and displaying the badge of a detective i shall arrest you on a charge of conspiracy haynes was fairly caught in his own trap this is a putup job gentlemen he said am i to be robbed first and arrested afterwards for exposing the thief he looked about him appealingly but in vain public sentiment was wholly against him now o you ould villain said a stout irish woman to try to ruin the poor bye hangins too good for you this was rather an extreme sentiment but haynes saw that he was in peril he gave an unexpected spring and reaching the platform sprang out running up a side street do you know him asked the detective of frank yes sir how do you account for his hostility to you frank briefly recounted the story already known to the reader he can easily be found then i hope you will not arrest him sir said frank he has been pretty well punished already and i dont think he will trouble me again if he does send for me and the detective handed frank his card and address it is fortunate for me said the telegraph boy that you saw him put the money in my pocket you would have experienced some inconvenience but the story you have told me would have cleared you with the jury my young friend said the clergyman i owe you an apology i too hastily assumed that you were guilty it looked like it sir you were quite justified in what you said mr haynes did not appear to relish your remarks to him added frank laughing his crime was greater and meaner than the one charged upon you to steal is certainly a grave offence yet sometimes it is prompted by necessity but a deliberate attempt to fasten a false charge upon a fellowcreature is vastly more atrocious so it is sir said the old irish woman nodding assent vigorously i quite agree wid your honor it is owtracious the passengers smiled at the old womans mistake but it was clear that they agreed with her in sentiment meanwhile the car had been speeding along and was near its terminus frank bethought himself that he had been carried considerably beyond his destination he pulled the bell and as he got out he said thank you all for taking my part we dont quite deserve that said one of the passengers after frank had left the car i was at first of opinion that the boy was guilty we have been saved from doing a great injustice said the clergyman it should be a lesson to all of us not to be too hasty in our judgments james haynes in his hurried exit from the car fully believed that he would be pursued and arrested he was relieved to find his fears groundless but he was disappointed at the failure of his scheme he had carefully prepared it and for several days he had been in readiness to carry it into execution whenever he should meet frank this morning had brought the opportunity but it had miscarried but for that cursed detective i would have carried the thing through he muttered he spoiled all i hate that boy but though revengeful haynes was prudent he gave up the thought of injuring frank because he saw that it would be dangerous to himself he did not remain long in new york but soon joined his confederate in hartford chapter xxvii frank becomes a good samaritan the close of the month came and frank laid aside his uniform he was a telegraph boy no more the superintendent shook hands with him cordially and bade him goodby come and see us sometimes he said i wish you all success your services have been very satisfactory and you have gained an excellent reputation thank you sir said frank i have tried to do my duty goodby boys he shook hands with all his young comrades with whom he was very popular they knew of his good fortune and were disposed to regard him as very rich six thousand dollars in a boys eyes is a fortune now youre rich frank i suppose you wont notice the likes of us said johnny oconnor i hope you dont think as badly of me as that johnny said frank earnestly i am not rich but even if i were i should always be glad to meet any of you if i am ever able to do a favor to any of you i will i believe you frank said johnny you was always a good feller wheres tom brady asked frank looking about him is he out on an errand toms sick said the superintendent hes got a fever its bad for him said johnny for his mother and sister depended on toms wages poor tom felt bad because he had to give up work where does he live asked frank with quick sympathy no east fourteenth street answered johnny i know because i live in the same block ill go and see him franks heart was not hardened by his own prosperity he knew what it was to be poor and could enter into the feelings of the unfortunate telegraph boy half an hour found him in front of a large tenementhouse in front of which were playing children of all ages most of them showing in their faces that unhealthy pallor which so generally marks a tenementhouse population do you know where mrs brady lives asked frank of a girl of twelve which brady is it asked the girl theres three lives here its tom bradys mother answered our hero is it tom the telegraph boy yes ill show you then toms been sick for some time i know it i have come to see him do you know tom asked the girl in some surprise for frank having laid aside his uniform was handsomely dressed and looked like the son of a rich man yes tom is a friend of mine i am sorry hes sick up two flights of rickety stairs frank followed the girl who halted before a door thats the place said his young guide and disappeared down the stairs sliding down the banisters young ladies in the best society do not often indulge in this amusement but mary murphy knew little of etiquette or conventionality in answer to franks knock the door was opened by mrs brady a poorly clad and careworn woman what is your wish young gentleman she said ive come to see tom how is he do you know my tom asked mrs brady in surprise yes is he very sick the poor boy has got a fever can i see him if youll come into such a poor place sir were very poor and now that toms wages is stopped i dont know how well get along at all better than you think perhaps mrs brady said frank cheerfully why tom what made you get sick he had entered the room and reached the bed on which the sick boy was lying tom looked up in surprise and pleasure is it you frank he said im glad youve come to see me but how did you find me out johnny oconnor told me where you lived how long have you been sick three days its rough on a poor boy like me i ought to be earning money for my mother well miss toms wages badly said mrs brady i cant earn much myself and theres three of us to feed let alone the rint how did you get off frank asked tom ive left the office was this young gentleman a telegraph boy asked mrs brady in surprise yes said tom but hes come into a fortune and now he wont have to work im sure im glad of his good luck and its a great condescension for a rich young gentleman to come and see my tom i have come into some money but not a fortune mrs brady said frank but it does not make me any better than when i was a poor telegraph boy evidently mrs brady was not of this opinion for she carefully dusted with her apron the best chair in the room and insisted on franks seating himself in it have you had a doctor mrs brady asked frank yes what does he say he says that tom will be sick for three or four weeks and i dont know what well do without his wages all that time thats what troubles me said tom i wouldnt mind it so much if id get my pay reglar while im sick then you neednt be troubled tom said frank promptly for you shall get it regularly they wont give it to me said tom incredulously they wont but i will do you mean it frank certainly i do i will give you a weeks pay this morning and i will call every week and pay you the same do you hear that mother said tom joyfully god bless you young gentleman for your kindness to us said mrs brady gratefully oh it isnt much said frank i can spare it well enough i have had such good luck myself that i ought to do something for those who need it youre a good feller frank said tom warmly ill get well quick now if you ever want anybody to fight for you just call on tom brady i generally do my own fighting tom said frank laughing but ill remember your offer when you are well you must come and spend an evening with me im sure hell be proud to do the same said mrs brady i must bid you goodby now tom keep a stiff upper lip and dont be downhearted we must all be sick sometimes you know and youll soon be well i wont be downhearted now said tom with my wages comin in reglar remember me to the boys frank i will tom when frank reached home he found a large overgrown boy with big red hands and clothes of rural cut who apparently did not know what to do with his legs and arms waiting to see him it was his cousin jonathan chapter xxviii a country cousin jonathan was a loosejointed heavily built and awkward boy of seventeen bearing not the slightest resemblance to his cousin frank still he was a relation and our hero was glad to see him how are you jonathan said frank cordially i wasnt expecting to see you are all well at home theyre pooty smart answered jonathan i thought id come down and look round a little i shall be glad to show you round where would you like to go to central park i dont care much about it said the country cousin its only a big pasture dad says id rather go round the streets is there any place where i can buy a few doughnuts i feel kinder empty do you prefer doughnuts to anything else asked frank with a smile i hear theyre cheap only a cent apiece answered jonathan and i calclate five or six will be enough to fill me up you neednt mind the expense cousin i shall pay for your dinner jonathans heavy face lighted up with satisfaction i dont care if you do he said i hear youve got a lot of money now frank i shall have enough to make me comfortable and start me in business i wish i had as much money as you said jonathan longingly you are all right some time you will have more than i i dont know about that dad keeps me awful close you have all you want dont you ive got some money in the bank said jonathan but id like to put in more i never thought youd have more money than i you used to tell me i ought to go to the poorhouse said frank smiling thats because you was livin on dad you know explained jonathan it wasnt fair to me because he wouldnt have so much to leave me in the country frank had not found much satisfaction in the company of his cousin who inherited the combined meanness of both parents and appeared to grudge poor frank every mouthful he ate but in the sunshine of his present prosperity he was disposed to forgive and forget frank led the way to a restaurant not far away where he allowed his cousin to order an ample dinner which he did without scruple since he was not to pay for it it costs a sight to live in the city he said as he looked over the bill of fare it costs something in the country too jonathan i wish youd come and board with dad hed take you for five dollars a week and it will cost you more in new york yes it will cost me more here then youll come wont you youll be company for me frank doubted whether jonathan would be much company for him you didnt use to think so jonathan you couldnt pay your board then now that i can i prefer to remain in the city i mean to go to school and get a good education how much do you have to pay for board here i cant tell what i shall have to pay at present i am staying with friends and pay nothing do you think theyd take me for a week the same way asked jonathan eagerly id like to stay a week firstrate if it didnt cost nothing i shouldnt like to ask them but some time i will invite you to come and pay me a visit of a week it shall not cost you anything youre a real good feller frank said jonathan highly pleased by the invitation ill come any time you send for me its pretty high payin on the railroad but i guess i can come frank understood the hint but did not feel called upon to pay his cousins railway fare in addition to his weeks board what do you think of that asked jonathan presently displaying a huge ring on one of his red fingers is that something you have bought in the city asked frank yes answered his cousin complacently i got it at a bargain did you buy it in a jewelry store no ill tell you how it was i was goin along the street when i saw a welldressed feller who looked kinder anxious he come up to me and he said do you know any one who wants to buy a splendid gold ring cheap then he told me he needed some money right off to buy vittles for his family bein out of work for a month he said the ring cost him fifteen dollars and hed sell it for three i wasnt goin to pay no such price and i finally beat him down to a dollar said jonathan chuckling i guess thats doing pretty well for one day he said any jeweller would pay me six or seven dollars for it then why didnt he sell it to a jeweller him self instead of giving it to you for a dollar i never thought of that said jonathan looking puzzled i am afraid it is not so good a bargain as you supposed said frank great drops of perspiration came out on jonathans brow you dont think its brass do you he gasped here is a jewelry store we can go in and inquire they entered the store and frank calling attention to the ring inquired its probable value it might be worth about three cents said the jeweller laughing i hope you didnt give much more for it i gave a dollar said jonathan in a voice which betrayed his anguish of whom did you buy it of a man in the street served you right then you should have gone to a regular jewelry store the man said it cost him fifteen dollars said jonathan sadly i dare say he was a professional swindler no doubt id like to give him a lickin said jonathan wrathfully as they left the store what would you do if you was me he asked of his cousin throw it away i wouldnt do that maybe i can sell it up in the country he said his face brightening up for how much for what i gave but that would be swindling no it wouldnt i have a right to ask as much as i gave its real handsome if it is brass i dont think that would be quite honest jonathan you wouldnt have me lose the dollar would you that would be smart i would rather be honest than be smart jonathan dropped the subject but eventually he sold the ring at home for a dollar and a quarter chapter xxix conclusion after he had accompanied his cousin to the depot where he took the cars for home frank met victor dupont on madison avenue wheres your uniform he asked i have taken it off aint you a telegraph boy any longer no i have left the office they turned you off i suppose said victor with a sneer they would like to have had me stay longer said frank with a smile victor shrugged his shoulders incredulously are you going back to your old business of selling papers he asked i think not what are you going to do for a living i am much obliged to you for your interest in my affairs victor i dont mean to go to work at all at present i am going to school how are you going to pay your expenses then asked victor in surprise i have had some money left me is that so how much some thousands of dollars enough to support me while i am getting an education who left it to you my father left it but i have only just received it you are awfully lucky said victor evidently annoyed are you going to live with the vivians i dont know i shouldnt think you would it would be imposing upon them thank you for your kind advice wont you take me to board at your house we dont take boarders said victor haughtily it so happened that frank entered himself as a scholar at the school where victor was a student and was put in the same class frank at once took a higher place and in time graduated with the highest honors while victor came out nearly at the foot frank did remain with the vivians they would not hear of his leaving them nor would they permit him to pay any board you are a companion for fred said mrs vivian and you exert a good influence over him having your company he does not wish to seek society outside you must let me look upon you as one of my boys and accept a home with us against this frank could urge no objection he was offered a home far more attractive than a boardinghouse which his presence made more social and attractive having no board to provide for the income of his little property was abundant to supply his other wants and when he left school it was unimpaired it was a serious question with our hero whether he would continue his studies through a collegiate course he finally decided in the negative and accepted a good position in the mercantile establishment of mr hartley here he displayed such intelligence and aptitude for business that he rose rapidly and in time acquired an interest in the firm and will in time obtain a junior partnership it must not be supposed that all this came without hard work it had always been franks custom to discharge to the utmost of his ability the duties of any position in which he was placed to this special trait of our hero most of his success was owing our hero had the satisfaction of giving a place to his companion in the telegraph office tom brady who was in time able to earn such a salary as raised his mother and sister above want frank did not forget his old street comrade dick rafferty but gave him a position as porter dicks education not being sufficient to qualify him for a clerkship he even sought out old mills the blind man to whom he had small reason to feel grateful but found that the old man had suddenly died leaving behind him to the surprise of every one who knew him several hundred dollars in gold and silver which were claimed by a sister of the deceased to whom they were most acceptable here end the experiences of the telegraph boy he has been favored above most of his class but the qualities which helped him achieve success are within the reach of all among the busy little messengers who flit about the city in all directions there are some no doubt who will in years to come command a success and prosperity as great as our hero has attained in a republic like our own the boy who begins at the bottom of the ladder may in time reach the highest round the end horatio alger jr the enormous sales of the books of horatio alger jr show the greatness of his popularity among the boys and prove that he is one of their most favored writers i am told that more than half a million copies altogether have been sold and that all the large circulating libraries in the country have several complete sets of which only two or three volumes are ever on the shelves at one time if this is true what thousands and thousands of boys have read and are reading mr algers books his peculiar style of stories often imitated but never equaled have taken a hold upon the young people and despite their similarity are eagerly read as soon as they appear mr alger became famous with the publication of that undying book ragged dick or street life in new york it was his first book for young people and its success was so great that he immediately devoted himself to that kind of writing it was a new and fertile field for a writer then and mr algers treatment of it at once caught the fancy of the boys ragged dick first appeared in and ever since then it has been selling steadily until now it is estimated that about copies of the series have been sold pleasant hours for boys and

a composition class it was our custom to go on the recitation seat every day with clean slates and we were allowed ten minutes to write seventy words on any subject the teacher thought suited to our capacity one day he gave out what a man would see if he went to greenland my heart was in the matter and before the ten minutes were up i had one side of my slate filled the teacher listened to the reading of our compositions and when they were all over he simply said some of you will make your living by writing one of these days that gave me something to ponder upon i did not say so out loud but i knew that my composition was as good as the best of them by the way there was another thing that came in my way just then i was reading at that time one of mayne reids works which i had drawn from the library and i pondered upon it as much as i did upon what the teacher said to me in introducing swartboy to his readers he made use of this expression no visible change was observable in swartboys countenance now it occurred to me that if a man of his education could make such a blunder as that and still write a book i ought to be able to do it too i went home that very day and began a story the old guides narrative which was sent to the new york weekly and came back respectfully declined it was written on both sides of the sheets but i didnt know that this was against the rules nothing abashed i began another and receiving some instruction from a friend of mine who was a clerk in a book store i wrote it on only one side of the paper but mind you he didnt know what i was doing nobody knew it but one day after a hard saturdays work the other boys had been out skating on the brickpond i shyly broached the subject to my mother i felt the need of some sympathy she listened in amazement and then said why do you think you could write a book like that that settled the matter and from that day no one knew what i was up to until i sent the first four volumes of gunboat series to my father was it work well yes it was hard work but each week i had the satisfaction of seeing the manuscript grow until the young naturalist was all complete harry castlemon in the

cos popular juveniles j t trowbridge neither as a writer does he stand apart from the great currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd combination of circumstances he stands on the common level and appeals to the universal heart and all that he suggests or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of the great body of humanity the jack hazard series of stories published in the late our young folks and continued in the first volume of st nicholas under the title of fast friends is no doubt destined to hold a high place in this class of literature the delight of the boys in them and of their seniors too is well founded they go to the right spot every time trowbridge knows the heart of a boy like a book and the heart of a man too and he has laid them both open in these books in a most successful manner apart from the qualities that render the series so attractive to all young readers they have great value on account of their portraitures of american country life and character the drawing is wonderfully accurate and as spirited as it is true the constable sellick is an original character and as minor figures where will we find anything better than miss
