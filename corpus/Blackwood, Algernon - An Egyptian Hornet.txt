an egyptian hornet by algernon blackwood the word has an angry malignant sound that brings the idea of attack vividly into the mind there is a vicious sting about it somewhere even a foreigner ignorant of the meaning must feel it a hornet is wicked it darts and stabs it pierces aiming without provocation for the face and eyes the name suggests a metallic droning of evil wings fierce flight and poisonous assault though black and yellow it sounds scarlet there is blood in it a striped tiger of the air in concentrated form there is no escape if it attacks in egypt an ordinary bee is the size of an english hornet but the egyptian hornet is enormous it is truly monstrous an ominous dying terror it shares that universal quality of the land of the sphinx and pyramids great size it is a formidable insect worse than scorpion or tarantula the rev james milligan meeting one for the first time realized the meaning of another word as well a word he used prolifically in his eloquent sermons devil one morning in april when the heat began to bring the insects out he rose as usual betimes and went across the wide stone corridor to his bath the desert already glared in through the open windows the heat would be afflicting later in the day but at this early hour the cool north wind blew pleasantly down the hotel passages it was sunday and at halfpast eight oclock he would appear to conduct the morning service for the english visitors the floor of the passageway was cold beneath his feet in their thin native slippers of bright yellow he was neither young nor old his salary was comfortable he had a competency of his own without wife or children to absorb it the dry climate had been recommended to him and the big hotel took him in for next to nothing and he was thoroughly pleased with himself for he was a sleek vain pompous welladvertised personality but mean as a rat no worries of any kind were on his mind as carrying sponge and towel scented soap and a bottle of scrubbs ammonia he travelled amiably across the deserted shining corridor to the bathroom and nothing went wrong with the rev james milligan until he opened the door and his eye fell upon a dark suspiciouslooking object clinging to the windowpane in front of him and even then at first he felt no anxiety or alarm but merely a natural curiosity to know exactly what it was this little clot of an oddshaped elongated thing that stuck there on the wooden framework six feet before his aquiline nose he went straight up to it to see then stopped dead his heart gave a distinct unclerical leap his lips formed themselves into unregenerate shape he gasped good god what is it for something unholy something wicked as a secret sin stuck there before his eyes in the patch of blazing sunshine he caught his breath for a moment he was unable to move as though the sight half fascinated him then cautiously and very slowly stealthily in fact he withdrew towards the door he had just entered fearful of making the smallest sound he retraced his steps on tiptoe his yellow slippers shuffled his dry sponge fell and bounded till it settled rolling close beneath the horribly attractive object facing him from the safety of the open door with ample space for retreat behind him he paused and stared his entire being focussed itself in his eyes it was a hornet that he saw it hung there motionless and threatening between him and the bathroom door and at first he merely exclaimed below his breath good god its an egyptian hornet being a man with a reputation for decided action however he soon recovered himself he was well schooled in selfcontrol when people left his church at the beginning of the sermon no muscle of his face betrayed the wounded vanity and annoyance that burned deep in his heart but a hornet sitting directly in his path was a very different matter he realized in a flash that he was poorly clothed in a word that he was practically half naked from a distance he examined this intrusion of the devil it was calm and very still it was wonderfully made both before and behind its wings were folded upon its terrible body long sinuous things pointed like temptation barbed as well stuck out of it there was poison and yet grace in its exquisite presentment its shiny black was beautiful and the yellow stripes upon its sleek curved abdomen were like the gleaming ornaments upon some feminine body of the seductive world he preached against almost he saw an abandoned dancer on the stage and then swiftly in his impressionable soul the simile changed and he saw instead more blunt and aggressive forms of destruction the wellfilled body tapering to a horrid point reminded him of those perfect engines of death that reduce hundreds to annihilation unawares torpedoes shells projectiles crammed with secret desolating powers its wings its awful quiet head its delicate slim waist its stripes of brilliant saffron all these seemed the concentrated prototype of abominations made cleverly by the brain of man and beautifully painted to disguise their invisible freight of cruel death bah he exclaimed ashamed of his prolific imagination its only a hornet after all an insect and he contrived a hurried careful plan he aimed a towel at it rolled up into a ball but did not throw it he might miss he remembered that his ankles were unprotected instead he paused again examining the black and yellow object in safe retirement near the door as one day he hoped to watch the world in leisurely retirement in the country it did not move it was fixed and terrible it made no sound its wings were folded not even the black antennae blunt at the tips like clubs showed the least stir or tremble it breathed however he watched the rise and fall of the evil body it breathed air in and out as he himself did the creature he realized had lungs and heart and organs it had a brain its mind was active all this time it knew it was being watched it merely waited any second with a whiz of fury and with perfect accuracy of aim it might dart at him and strike if he threw the towel and missed it certainly would there were other occupants of the corridor however and a sound of steps approaching gave him the decision to act he would lose his bath if he hesitated much longer he felt ashamed of his timidity though pusillanimity was the word thought selected owing to the pulpit vocabulary it was his habit to prefer he went with extreme caution towards the bathroom door passing the point of danger so close that his skin turned hot and cold with one foot gingerly extended he recovered his sponge the hornet did not move a muscle but it had seen him pass it merely waited all dangerous insects had that trick it knew quite well he was inside it knew quite well he must come out a few minutes later it also knew quite well that he was naked once inside the little room he closed the door with exceeding gentleness lest the vibration might stir the fearful insect to attack the bath was already filled and he plunged to his neck with a feeling of comparative security a window into the outside passage he also closed so that nothing could possibly come in and steam soon charged the air and left its blurred deposit on the glass for ten minutes he could enjoy himself and pretend that he was safe for ten minutes he did so he behaved carelessly as though nothing mattered and as though all the courage in the world were his he splashed and soaped and sponged making a lot of reckless noise he got out and dried himself slowly the steam subsided the air grew clearer he put on dressinggown and slippers it was time to go out unable to devise any further reason for delay he opened the door softly half an inch peeped out and instantly closed it again with a resounding bang he had heard a drone of wings the insect had left its perch and now buzzed upon the floor directly in his path the air seemed full of stings he felt stabs all over him his unprotected portions winced with the expectancy of pain the beast knew he was coming out and was waiting for him in that brief instant he had felt its sting all over him on his unprotected ankles on his back his neck his cheeks in his eyes and on the bald clearing that adorned his anglican head through the closed door he heard the ominous dull murmur of his striped adversary as it beat its angry wings its oiled and wicked sting shot in and out with fury its deft legs worked he saw its tiny waist already writhing with the lust of battle ugh that tiny waist a moments steady nerve and he could have severed that cunning body from the directing brain with one swift welldirected thrust but his nerve had utterly deserted him human motives even in the professedly holy are an involved affair at any time just now in the rev james milligan they were inextricably mixed he claims this explanation at any rate in excuse of his abominable subsequent behaviour for exactly at this moment when he had decided to admit cowardice by ringing for the arab servant a step was audible in the corridor outside and courage came with it into his disreputable heart it was the step of the man he cordially disapproved of using the pulpit version of hated and despised he had overstayed his time and the bath was in demand by mr mullins mr mullins invariably followed him at seventhirty it was now a quarter to eight and mr mullins was a wretched drinking man a sot in a flash the plan was conceived and put into execution the temptation of course was of the devil mr milligan hid the motive from himself pretending he hardly recognized it the plan was what men call a dirty trick it was also irresistibly seductive he opened the door stepped boldly nose in the air right over the hideous insect on the floor and fairly pranced into the outer passage the brief transit brought a hundred horrible sensations that the hornet would rise and sting his leg that it would cling to his dressinggown and stab his spine that he would step upon it and die like achilles of a heel exposed but with these and conquering them was one other stronger emotion that robbed the lesser terrors of their potency that mr mullins would run precisely the same risks five seconds later unprepared he heard the gloating insect buzz and scratch the oilcloth but it was behind him he was safe good morning to you mr mullins he observed with a gracious smile i trust i have not kept you waiting mornin grunted mullins sourly in reply as he passed him with a distinctly hostile and contemptuous air for mullins though depraved perhaps was an honest man abhorring parsons and making no secret of his opinions whence the bitter feeling all men except those very big ones who are supermen have something astonishingly despicable in them the despicable thing in milligan came uppermost now he fairly chuckled he met the snub with a calm forgiving smile and continued his shambling gait with what dignity he could towards his bedroom opposite then he turned his head to see his enemy would meet an infuriated hornet an egyptian hornet and might not notice it he might step on it he might not but he was bound to disturb it and rouse it to attack the chances were enormously on the clerical side and its sting meant death may god forgive me ran subconsciously through his mind and side by side with the repentant prayer ran also a recognition of the tempters eternal skill i hope the devil it will sting him it happened very quickly the rev james milligan lingered a moment by his door to watch he saw mullins the disgusting mullins step blithely into the bathroom passage he saw him pause shrink back and raise his arm to protect his face he heard him swear aloud whats the dd thing doing here have i really got em again and then he heard him laugh a hearty guffawing laugh of genuine relief its real the moment of revulsion was overwhelming it filled the churchly heart with anguish and bitter disappointment for a space he hated the whole race of men for the instant mr mullins realized that the insect was not a fiery illusion of his disordered nerves he went forward without the smallest hesitation with his towel he knocked down the flying terror then he stooped he gathered up the venomous thing his wellaimed blow had stricken so easily to the floor he advanced with it held at arms length to the window he tossed it out carelessly the egyptian hornet flew away uninjured and mr mullins the mr mullins who drank gave nothing to the church attended no services hated parsons and proclaimed the fact with enthusiasm this same mr mullins went to his unearned bath without a scratch but first he saw his enemy standing in the doorway across the passage watching him and understood that was the awful part of it mullins would make a story of it and the story would go the round of the hotel the rev james milligan however proved that his reputation for selfcontrol was not undeserved he conducted morning service half an hour later with an expression of peace upon his handsome face he conquered all outward sign of inward spiritual vexation the wicked he consoled himself ever flourished like green bay trees it was notorious that the righteous never have any luck at all that was bad enough but what was worse and the rev james milligan remembered for very long was the superior ease with which mullins had relegated both himself and hornet to the same level of comparative insignificance mullins ignored them both which proved that he thought himself superior infinitely worse than the sting of any hornet in the world he really was superior
