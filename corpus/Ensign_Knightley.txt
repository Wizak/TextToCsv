ensign knightley and other stories ensign knightley it was eleven oclock at night when surgeon wyley of his majestys ship bonetta washed his hands drew on his coat and walked from the hospital up the narrow cobbled street of tangier to the mainguard by the catherine port in the upper room of the mainguard he found major shackleton of the tangier foot taking a hand at bassette with lieutenant scrope of trelawneys regiment and young captain tessin of the kings battalion there were three other officers in the room and to them surgeon wyley began to talk in a prosy medical strain two of his audience listened in an uninterested stolidity for just so long as the remnant of manners which still survived in tangier commanded and then strolling through the open window on to the balcony lit their pipes overhead the stars blazed in the rich sky of morocco the ridinglights of admiral herberts fleet sprinkled the bay and below them rose the hum of an unquiet town it was the night of may th and the life of every christian in tangier hung in the balance the moors had burst through the outposts to the west and were now entrenched beneath the walls the henrietta redoubt had fallen that day tomorrow the little fort at devils drop built on the edge of the sand where the sea rippled up to the palisades must fall and charles fort to the southwest was hardly in a better case however a sortie had been commanded at daybreak as a last effort to relieve charles fort and the two officers on the balcony speculated over their pipes on the chances of success meanwhile inside the room surgeon wyley lectured to his remaining auditor who too tired to remonstrate tilted his chair against the wall and dozed a concussion of the brain wyley went on has this curious effect that after recovery the patient will have lost from his consciousness a period of time which immediately preceded the injury thus a man may walk down a street here in tangier four five six hours afterwards he mounts his horse is thrown on to his head when he wakes again to his senses the last thing he remembers is what a sign perhaps over a shop in the street he walked down or a leper pestering him for alms the intervening hours are lost to him and forever it is no question of an abeyance of memory there is a gap in the continuity of his experience and that gap he will never fill up except by hearsay the correction came from lieutenant scrope at the bassette table it was quite carelessly uttered while the lieutenant was picking up his cards surgeon wyley shifted his chair towards the table and accepted the correction except of course by hearsay wyley was a newcomer to tangier having sailed into the bay less than a week back but he had been long enough in the town to find in scrope a subject at once of interest and perplexity scrope was in years nearer forty than thirty dark of complexion aquiline of feature and though a trifle below the middle height he redeemed his stature by the litheness of his figure what interested wyley was that he seemed a man in whom strong passions were always desperately at war with a strong will he wore habitually a mask of reserve behind it wyley was aware of sleeping fires he spoke habitually in a quiet decided voice like one that has the soundings of his nature beneath it wyley detected continually recurring continually subdued a note of turbulence here in a word was a man whose hand was against the world but who would not strike at random what perplexed wyley on the other hand was scropes subordinate rank of lieutenant in a garrison where from the frequency of death promotion was of the quickest he sat there at the table a lieutenant a boy of twentyfour faced him and the boy was a captain and his superior it was to the lieutenant however that wyley resumed his discourse the length of time lost is proportionate to the severity of the concussion it may be only an hour i have known it to be a day he leaned back in his chair and smiled a strange question that for a man to ask himself what did he do during those hours a question to appal him scrope chose a card from his hand and played it without looking up from the table he asked to appal him why because the question would be not so much what did he do as what may he not have done a man rides through life insecurely seated on his passions within a few hours the most honest man may commit a damnable crime a damnable dishonour scrope looked quietly at the surgeon to read the intention of his words then i suppose so he said carelessly but do you think that question would press why not asked wyley scrope shrugged his shoulders i should need an example before i believed you the example was at the door the corporal of the guard at the catherine port knocked and was admitted he told his story to major shackleton and as he told it the two officers lounged back into the room from the balcony and the other who was dozing against the wall brought the legs of his chair with a bang to the floor and woke up it appeared that a sentry at the stockade outside the catherine port had suddenly noticed a flutter of white on the ground a few yards from the stockade he watched this white object and it moved he challenged it and was answered by a whispered prayer for admission in the english tongue and in an english voice the sentry demanded the password and received as a reply inchiquin it is the last password i have knowledge of let me in let me in the sentry called the corporal the corporal admitted the fugitive and brought him to the mainguard he was now in the guardroom below you did well said the major the man has come from the moorish lines and may have news which will profit us in the morning let him up and as the corporal retired inchiquin he repeated thoughtfully i cannot call to mind that password now wyley had noticed that when the corporal first mentioned the word scrope who was looking over his cards had dropped one on the table as though his hand shook had raised his head sharply and with his head his eyebrows and had stared for a second fixedly at the wall in front of him so he said to scrope you can remember yes i remember the password scrope replied simply i have cause to inchiquin and teviot those were password and countersign on the night which ruined me the night of january th two years ago there was an awkward pause an interchange of glances then major shackleton broke the silence though to no great effect hm ah yes he said well well he added and laying an arm upon scropes sleeve a good fellow scrope scrope made no response whatever but of a sudden captain tessin banged his fist upon the table january th two years ago why and he leaned forward across the table towards scrope knightley fell in the sortie that morning and his body was never recovered the corporal said this fugitive was an englishman what if major shackleton shook his head and interrupted knightley fell by my side i saw the blow it must have broken his skull there was a sound of footsteps in the passage the door was opened and the fugitive appeared in the doorway all eyes turned to him instantly and turned from him again with looks of disappointment wyley remarked however that scrope who had barely glanced at the man rose from his chair he did not move from the table only he stood where before he had sat the newcomer was tall a beard plastered with mud as if to disguise its colour straggled over his burned and wasted cheeks but here and there a wisp of yellow hair flecked with grey curled from his hood a pair of blue eyes shone with excitement from hollow sockets and he wore the violetandwhite robes of a moorish soldier it was his dress at which major shackleton looked one of our renegade deserters tired of his new friends he said with some contempt renegades do not wear chains replied the man in the doorway lifting from beneath his long sleeves his manacled hands he spoke in a weak hoarse voice and with a rusty accent he rested a hand against the jamb of the door as though he needed support tessin sprang up from his chair and half crossed the room the stranger took an uncertain step forward his legs rattled as he moved and wyley saw that the links of broken fetters were twisted about his ankles have two years made so vast a difference he asked well they were years of the bastinado and i do not wonder tessin peered into his face by god it is he exclaimed knightley thanks said knightley with a smile tessin reached out to take knightleys hands then instantly stopped glanced from knightley to scrope and drew back knightley cried the major in a voice of welcome rising in his seat then he too glanced expectantly at scrope and sat down again scrope made no movement but stood with his eyes cast down on the table like a man lost in thought it was evident to wyley that both shackleton and tessin had obeyed the sporting instinct and had left the floor clear for the two men it was no less evident that knightley remarked their action and did not understand it for his eyes travelled from face to face and searched each with a wistful anxiety for the reason of their reserve yes i am knightley he said timidly then he drew himself to his full height ensign knightley of the tangier foot he cried no one answered the company waited upon scrope in a suspense so keen that even the ringing challenge of the words passed unheeded knightley spoke again but now in a stiff formal voice and slowly gentlemen i fear very much that two years make a world of difference it seems they change one who had your goodwill into a most unwelcome stranger his voice broke in a sob he turned to the door but staggered as he turned and caught at a chair in a moment major shackleton was beside him what lad have we been backward blame our surprise not us meanwhile said wyley ensign knightleys starving the major pressed knightley into a chair called for an orderly and bade him bring food wyley filled a glass with wine from the bottle on the table and handed it to the ensign it is vinegar he said but but tangier is still tangier said knightley with a laugh the majors cordiality had strengthened him like a tonic he raised the glass to his lips and drank but as he tilted his head back his eyes over the brim of the glass rested on scrope who still stood without movement without expression a figure of stone but that his chest rose and fell with his deep breathing knightley set down his glass halffull there is something amiss he said since even captain scrope retains no memory of his old comrade captain exclaimed wyley so scrope had been more than a lieutenant here was an answer to the question which had perplexed him but it only led to another question had scrope been degraded and why he did not however speculate on the question for his attention was seized the next moment scrope made no sort of answer to knightleys appeal but began to drum very softly with his fingers on the table and the drumming at first vague and of no significance gradually took on of itself as it seemed a definite rhythm there was a variation too in the strength of the taps now they fell light now they struck hard scrope was quite unconsciously beating out upon the table a particular tune although since there was but the one note sounded wyley could get no more than an elusive hint of its character knightley watched scrope for a little as earnestly as the rest then harry he said harry scrope the name leaped from his lips in a pleading cry he stretched out his hands towards scrope and the chain which bound them reached down to the table and rattled on the wood there was a simultaneous movement almost a simultaneous ejaculation of bewilderment amongst those who stood about knightley where they had expected a deadly anger they found in its place a beseeching humility and scrope ceased from drumming on the table and turned on knightley dont shake your chains at me he burst out harshly i am deaf to any reproach that they can make are you the only man that has worn chains i can show as good and better he thrust the palm of his left hand under knightleys nose branded dye see branded theres more besides he set his foot on the chair and stripped the silk stocking down his leg just above the ankle there was a broad indent where a fetter had bitten into the flesh i have dragged a chain you see not like you among the moors but here in tangier on that damned mole in sight of these my brother officers by the lord knightley i tell you you have had the better part of it you cried knightley you dragged a chain on tangier mole for what offence and he added with a genuine tenderness there was no disgrace int ill warrant major shackleton half checked an exclamation and turned it into a cough scrope leaned right across the table and stared straight into knightleys eyes the offence was a duel he answered steadily fought on the night of january th two years ago knightleys face clouded for an instant the night when i was captured he said timidly yes the officers drew closer about the table and seemed to hold their breath as the strange catechism proceeded with whom did you fight asked knightley with a very good friend of mine replied scrope in a hard even voice on what account a woman knightley laughed with a mans amused leniency for such escapades when he himself is in no way hurt by them i said there would be no disgrace int harry he said with a smile of triumph the heads of the listeners which had bunched together were suddenly drawn back a dark flush of anger overspread scropes face and the veins ridged up upon his forehead some impatient speech was on the tip of his tongue when the major interposed whats this talk of penalties wheres the sense of it scrope paid the price of his fault he was admitted to the ranks afterwards he won a lieutenancy by sheer bravery in the field for all we know he may be again a captain tomorrow anyhow he wears the kings uniform it is a badge of service which levels us all from ensign to major in an equality of esteem scrope bowed to the major and drew back from the table the other officers shuffled and moved in a welcome relief from the strain of their expectancy and knightleys thoughts were diverted by shackletons words to a quite different subject for he picked with his fingers at the moorish robe he wore and i too wore the kings uniform he pleaded wistfully and shall do so again thank god responded the major heartily knightley started up from his chair his face lightened unaccountably you mean that he asked eagerly yes yes you mean it then let it be tonight now even before i sup as long as i wear these chains as long as i wear this dress i can feel the drivers whip curl about my shoulders he parted the robe as he spoke and showed that underneath he wore only a coarse sack which reached to his knees with a hole cut in it for his head true you have worn the chains too long said the major i should have had them knocked off before but he paused for a second but your coming so surprised me that of a truth i forgot he continued lamely then he turned to tessin see to it tessin ensign barbour of the tangier foot was killed today he was quartered in the mainguard take knightley to his quarters and see what you can do by the way knightley theres a question i should have put to you before by what road did you come in down teviot hill past the henrietta fort the moors brought me down from mequinez to interpret between them and their prisoners i escaped last night past the henrietta fort replied the major then you can help us for that way we make our sortie to relieve the charles fort said knightley i guessed the charles fort was surrounded for i heard one man on the tangier wall shouting through a speaking trumpet to the charles fort garrison but it will not be easy to relieve them the moors are entrenched between there are three trenches i should never have crawled through them but that i stripped a dead moor of his robe three trenches said tessin with a shrug of the shoulders yes three the two nearest to tangier may be carried but the third it is deep twelve feet at the least and wide at the least eight yards the sides are steep and slippery with the rain a grave then said scrope carelessly a grave that will hold many before the evening falls it is well they made it wide and deep enough the sombre words knocked upon every heart like a blow on a door behind which conspirators are plotting the major was the first to recover his speech curse your tongue scrope he said angrily let who will lie in your grave when the evening falls before that time comes well show these moors so fine a powderplay as shall glut some of them to all eternity bon chat bon rat we are not made of jelly tessin see to knightley the two men withdrew major shackleton scribbled a note and despatched it to sir palmes fairborne the lieutenantgovernor scrope took a turn or two across the room while the major was writing the news which knightley had brought then what game is this hes playing he said with a jerk of his head to the door by which knightley had gone out i have no mind to be played with but is he playing a game at all asked wyley scrope faced him quickly looked him over for a second and replied you are a newcomer to tangier or you would not have asked that question i should rejoined wyley with complete confidence i know quite enough to be sure of one thing i know there lies some deep matter of dispute between ensign knightley and lieutenant scrope and i am sure that there is one other person more in the dark than myself and that person is ensign knightley for whereas i know there is a dispute he is unaware of even that unaware cried scrope why man the very good friend i fought with was ensign knightley the woman on whose account we fought was knightleys wife he flung the words at the surgeon with almost a gesture of contempt make the most of that and once again he began to pace the room i am not in the least surprised returned wyley with an easy smile though i admit that i am interested a wife is sauce to any story he looked placidly round the company he alone held the key to the puzzle and since he was now become the centre of attraction he was inclined to play with his less acute brethren with a wave of the hand he stilled the requests for an explanation and turned to scrope will you answer me a question i think it most unlikely the curt reply in no way diminished the surgeons suavity i chose my words ill i should have asked will you confirm an assertion the assertion is this ensign knightley had no suspicion before he actually discovered the well the lamentable truth scrope stopped his walk and came back to the table why that is so he agreed sullenly knightley had no suspicions it angered me that he had not wyley leaned back in his chair really really he said and laughed a little to himself on the night of january th ensign knightley discovers the lamentable truth at what hour he asked suddenly scrope looked to the major about midnight he suggested a little later i should think corrected major shackleton a little after midnight repeated wyley ensign knightley and lieutenant scrope i understand immediately fight a duel which seems to have been interrupted before any hurt was done the major and scrope agreed with a nod of their heads in the morning continued wyley ensign knightley takes part in a skirmish and is clubbed on the head so fiercely that major shackleton thought his skull must be broken in at what hour was he struck again he put the question quickly twixt seven and eight of the morning replied the major quite so said wyley the incidents fit to a nicety two years afterwards ensign knightley comes home he knows nothing of the duel or any cause for a duel lieutenant scrope is still harry to him and his best of friends it is all very clear he gazed about him perplexity sat on each face except one that face was scropes i spoke to you all some half an hour since concerning the effects of a concussion i could not have hoped for so complete an example said wyley captain tessin whistled major shackleton bounced on to his feet then knightley knows nothing cried tessin in a gust of excitement and never will know cried the major except by hearsay sharply interposed scrope gentlemen you go too fast except by hearsay that mr wyley was the phrase i think by what spells major he asked with irony will you bind tangier to silence when theres scandal to be talked let knightley walk down to the watergate tomorrow ill warrant hell have heard the story a hundred times with a hundred new embellishments before he gets there major shackleton resumed his seat moodily and since thats the truth why he had best hear the story nakedly from me from you exclaimed tessin another duel then have you counted the cost why yes replied scrope quietly two years of the bastinado said the major that was what he said he comes back to tangier to find who knows a worse torture here knightley knightley a good officer marked for promotion until that infernal night scrope i could turn moralist and curse you scrope dropped his head as though the words touched him but it was not long before he raised it again you waste your pity i think major he said coldly i disagree with mr wyleys conclusions knightley knows the truth of the matter very well for observe he has made no mention of his wife he has been two years in slavery he escapes and he asks for no news of his wife that is unlike any man but most of all unlike knightley he has his own ends to serve no doubt but he knows the argument appeared cogent to major shackleton to be sure to be sure he said i had not thought of that tessin looked across to wyley what do you say i am not convinced replied wyley indeed i was surprised that knightleys omission had not been remarked before when you first showed reserve in welcoming knightley i noticed that he became all at once timid hesitating he seemed to be afraid major shackleton admitted the surgeons accuracy well what then well i go back to what i said before knightley appeared a man has lost so many hours the question what he did during those hours is one that may well appal any one lieutenant scrope doubted whether that question would trouble a man and needed an instance i believe here is the instance i believe knightley is afraid to ask any questions and i believe his reason to be fear of how he lived during those lost hours there was a pause no one was prepared to deny however much he might doubt what wyley said wyley continued at some point of time before this duel knightleys recollections break off at what precise point we are not aware nor is it of any great importance the sure thing is he does not know of the dispute between lieutenant scrope and himself and it is of more importance for us to consider whether he cannot after all be kept from knowing could he not be sent home to england mrs knightley i take it is no longer in tangier major shackleton stood up took wyley by the arm and led him out on to the balcony the town beneath them had gone to sleep the streets were quiet the white roofs of the houses in the starshine descended to the waters edge like flights of marble steps only here and there did a light burn to one of the lights close by the city wall the major directed wyleys attention the house in which it burned lay so nearly beneath them that they could command a corner of the square open patio in the middle of it and the light shone in a window set in that corner and giving on to the patio you see that house said the major yes said wyley it is scropes i have seen him enter and come out no doubt said the major but it is knightleys house knightleys then the light burning in the window is the major nodded she is still in tangier and never a care for him has troubled her for two years not so much as would bring a pucker to her pretty forehead all my arrears of pay to a guineapiece wyley leaned across the rail of the balcony watching the light and as he watched he was aware that his feelings and his thoughts changed the interest which he had felt in scrope died clean away or rather was transferred to knightley and with this new interest there sprang up a new sympathy a new pity the change was entirely due to that one yellow light burning in the window and the homely suggestions which it provoked it brought before him very clearly the bitter contrast so that light had burned any night these last two years and scrope had gone in and out at his will while up in the barbarous inlands of morocco the husband had had his daily portion of the bastinado and the whip it was her fault too and she made her profit of it wyley became sensible of an overwhelming irony in the disposition of the world you spoke a true word tonight major he said bitterly that light down there might turn any man to a moralist and send him preaching in the marketplaces well returned the major as though he must make what defence he could for scrope the story is not the politest in the world but then you know tangier it is only a tiny outpost on the edges of the world where we starve behind broken walls forgotten of our friends we have the moors ever swarming at our gates and the wolf ever snarling at our heels and so the niceties of conduct are lost we have so little time wherein to live and that little time is filled with the noise of battle passion has its way with us in the end and honour comes to mean no more than bravery and a gallant death he remained a few moments silent and then disconnectedly he told wyley the rest of the story it was only three years ago that knightley came to tangier he should never have brought his wife with him scrope and knightley became friends all tangier knew the truth pretty soon and laughed at knightleys ignorance i remember the night of january th very well i was captain of the guard that night too a spy brought in news that we might expect a night attack i sent knightley with the news to lord inchiquin on the way back he stepped into his own house it was late at night mrs knightley was singing some foolish song to scrope the two men came down into the street and fought then and there the quarter was aroused the combatants arrested and brought to me there are two faults which our necessities here compel us to punish beyond their proper gravity duelling for we cannot afford to lose officers that way and brawling in the streets at night because the moors lie perdus under our walls ready to take occasion as it comes of scropes punishment you have heard knightley i released for that night he was on guard i could not spare him we were attacked in the morning and repulsed the attack we followed up our success by a sortie in which knightley fell wyley began again to wonder at what particular point in this story knightleys recollection broke off and further what particular fear it was that kept him from all questions even concerning his wife knightleys voice was heard behind them and they turned back into the room the ensign had shaved his matted beard and combed out his hair which now curled and shone graciously about his head and shoulders his face too for all that it was wasted had taken almost a boyish zest and his figure revealed in the graceful dress of his regiment showed youth in every movement he was plainly by some years a younger man than scrope he saluted the major and wyley noticed that with his uniform he seemed to have drawn on something of a soldierly confidence theres your supper lad said shackleton pointing to a few poor herrings and a crust of bread which an orderly had spread upon the table it is scanty i like it the better said knightley with a laugh for so i am assured i am at home in tangier there is no beef i suppose not so much as a hoof no butter not enough to cover a sixpence there is cheese however he lifted up a scrap upon a fork there will be none tomorrow and as for pay he asked slyly two years and a half in arrears knightley laughed again moreover added shackleton out of our nothing we may presently have to feed the fleet it is indeed the pleasantest joke imaginable in a week no doubt rejoined knightley i shall be less sensible of its humour but tonight well i am home in tangier and that contents me nothing has changed at that he stopped suddenly nothing has changed this time the phrase was put as a question and with the halting timidity which he had shown before no one answered the question no nothing has changed he said a third time and again his eyes began to travel wistfully from face to face tessin abruptly turned his back shackleton blinked his eyes at the ceiling with altogether too profound an unconcern scrope reached out for the wine and spilt it as he filled his glass wyley busily drew diagrams with a wet finger on the table all these details knightley remarked he laid down his fork he rested his elbow on the table his forehead upon his hand then absently he began to hum over to himself a tune the rhythm of it was somehow familiar to the surgeons ears where had he heard it before then with a start he remembered it was this very rhythm that very tune which scropes fingers had beaten out on the table when he first saw knightley and as he had absently drummed it then so knightley absently hummed it now surely then the tune had some part in the relations of the two men perhaps a part in this story a foolish song the words flashed into wyleys mind she was singing a foolish song what if the tune was the tune of that song but then wyleys argument came to a sudden conclusion for if the tune was the tune of that song why then knightley must know the truth since he remembered that song was scrope right after all was knightley playing with him wyley glanced at knightley in the keenest excitement he wanted words fitted to that tune and in a little the words came first one or two fitted here and there to a note and murmured unconsciously then an entire phrase which filled out a bar finally this verse in its proper sequence no no fair heretick it needs must be but an ill love in me and worse for thee for were it in my power to love thee now this hour more than i did the last twould then so fall i might not love at all love that can flow and then the song broke off and silence followed wyley looked again at knightley but the latter had not changed his position he still sat with his face shaded by his hand the surgeon was startled by a light touch on the arm he turned with almost a jump and he saw scrope bending across the table towards him his eyes ablaze with an excitement no less keen than his own he knows he knows whispered scrope it was that song she was singing at that word flow he pushed open the door of the room knightley raised his head and drew his hand across his forehead as though scropes whisper had aroused him scrope seated himself hurriedly nothing has changed eh knightley asked like a man fresh from his sleep then he stood and quietly slowly walked round the table until he stood directly behind scropes chair scropes face hardened he laid the palms of his hands upon the edge of the table ready to spring up he looked across to wyley with the expectation of death in his eyes one of the officers shuffled his feet tessin said hush knightley took a step forward and dropped a hand on scropes shoulder very lightly but none the less scrope started and turned white as though he had been stabbed harry said the ensign my my wife is still in tangier scrope drew in a breath yes ah waiting for me you have shown her what kindness you could during my slavery he spoke in a wavering voice as if he were not sure of his ground and as he spoke he felt scrope shiver beneath his hand and saw upon the faces of his companions an unmistakable shrinking he turned away and staggered rather than walked to the window where he stood leaning against the sill the day is breaking he said quietly wyley looked up outside the window the colour was fading down the sky it was purple still towards the zenith but across the straits its edges rested white upon the hills of spain love that can flow murmured knightley and of a sudden he flung back into the room let me have the truth of it he burst out confronting his brotherofficers gathered about the table the truth though it knell out my damnation if you only knew how up there at fez at mequinez i have pictured your welcome when i should get back i made of my anticipation a very anodyne the cudgelling the chains the hunger the sun hot as though a burning glass was held above my head it would all make a good story for the guardroom when i got back when i got back and yet i do get back and one and all of you draw away from me as though i were one of the tangier lepers we jostle in the streets love that can flow he broke off i ask myself he hesitated and with a great cry i ask you did i play the coward on that night i was captured two years ago the coward exclaimed shackleton in bewilderment wyley for all his sympathy could not refrain from a triumphant glance at scrope here is the instance you needed he said yes did i play the coward knightley seated himself sideways on the edge of the table and clasping his hands between his knees went on in a quick lowered voice love that can flow those are the last words i remember you sent me major to the governor with a message i delivered it i started back on my way back i passed my house i went in i stood in the patio my wife was singing that song the window of the room in which she sang opened on to the patio i stood there listening for a second then i went upstairs i turned the handle of the door i remember quite clearly the light upon the room wall as i opened the door those words love that can flow came swelling through the opening and and the next thing i am aware of i was riding chained upon a camel into slavery tessin and major shackleton looked suddenly towards wyley in recognition of the accuracy of his guess scrope simply wiped the perspiration from his forehead and waited but how does that forgetfulness shall we say persuade you to the fear that you played the coward asked wyley well replied knightley and his voice sank to a whisper i played the coward afterwards at mequinez at the first it used to amuse me to wonder what happened after i opened the door and before i was captured outside tangier later it only puzzled me and in the end it began to frighten me you see i could not tell it was all a blank to me as it is now and a man overdriven well he nurses sickly fancies no need to say what mine were until the day i played the coward in mequinez they set me to build the walls of the emperors new palace we used the stones of the old roman town and built them up in mequinez and in the walls we were bidden to build christian slaves alive to the glory of allah i refused they stripped the flesh off my feet with their bastinadoes starved me of food and drink and brought me back again to the walls again i refused knightley looked up at his audience and whether or no he mistook their breathless silence for disbelief i did he implored twice i refused and twice they tortured me the third time i was so broken the whistle of a cane in the air made me cry out with pain i was sunk to that pitch of cowardice he stopped unable to complete the sentence he clasped and unclasped his hands convulsively he moistened his dry lips with his tongue and looked about him with a weak almost despairing laugh then he began in another way the christian was a portuguee from marmora he was set in the wall with his arms outstretched on either side the attitude of a man crucified i built in his arms his right arm first and mortised the stones then his left arm in the same way i was careful not to look in his face no no i didnt look in his face knightley repeated the words with a horrible leer of cunning and hugged himself with his arms to wyleys thinking he was strung almost to madness after his arms i built in his feet and upwards from his feet i built in his legs and his body until i came to his neck all this while he had been crying out for pity babbling prayers and the rest of it when i reached his neck he ceased his clamour i suppose he was dumb with horror i did not know all i knew was that now i should have to meet his eyes as i built in his face i thought for a moment of blinding him i could have done it quite easily with a stone i picked up a stone to do it and then well i could not help looking at him he drew my eyes to his like a steel filing to a magnet and once i had looked once i had heard his eyes speaking i i tore down the stones i freed his body his legs his feet and one arm when the guards noticed what i was doing i cannot tell i could not tell you when their sticks began to beat me but they dragged me away when i had freed only one arm i remember seeing him tugging at the other what happened to me he shivered i could not describe to you but you see i had played the coward finely at mequinez and when that question recurred to me as to what had happened after i had opened the door i began to wonder whether by any chance i had played the coward at tangier i dismissed the thought as a sickly fancy but it came again and again and i came back here and you draw aloof from me with averted faces and forced welcomes on your lips did i play the coward on that night i was captured tell me tell me and so the torrent of his speech came to an end the major rose gravely from his seat walked round the table and held out his hand put your hand there lad he said gravely knightley looked at the outstretched hand then at the majors face he took the hand diffidently and the majors grasp was of the heartiest neither at mequinez nor at tangier did you play the coward said the major you fell by my side in the van of the attack and then knightley began to cry he blubbered like a child and with his blubbering he mixed apologies he was weak he was tired his relief was too great he was thoroughly ashamed you see he said there was need that i should know my wife is waiting for me i could not go back to her bearing that stigma indeed i hardly dared ask news of her now i can go back and gentlemen i wish you goodnight he stood up made his bow wiped his eyes and began to walk to the door scrope rose instantly sit down lieutenant said the major sharply and scrope obeyed with reluctance the major watched knightley cross the room should he let the ensign go should he keep him he could not decide that knightley would seek his wife at once might of course have been foreseen and yet it had not been foreseen either by the major or the others the present facts as they had succeeded one after another had engrossed their minds knightleys hand was on the door and the major had not decided he pushed the door open he set a foot in the passage and then the roar of a gun shook the room ah remarked wyley the signal for your sortie knightley stopped and listened major shackleton stood in a fixed attitude with his eyes upon the floor he had hit upon an issue it seemed to him by inspiration the noise of the gun was followed by ten clear strokes of a bell thats for the kings battalion said knightley with a smile yes said tessin and picking up his sword from a corner he slung the bandolier across his shoulder the bell rang out again this time the number of the strokes was twenty thats for my lord dunbartons regiment said knightley yes said two of the remaining officers they took their hats and followed captain tessin down the stairs a third time the bell spoke and the strokes were thirty ah said knightley thats for the tangier foot well good luck to you major and he passed through the door a moment knightley the regiment first you wear ensign barbours uniform you must do more than wear his uniform the regiment first major shackleton spoke in a husky voice and kept his eyes on the floor scrope looked at him keenly from the table knightley hardly looked at him at all he stepped back into the room with all my heart major the regiment first your station is at peterborough tower you will go there at once at once replied knightley cheerfully so she would wish and he went down the stairs into the street major shackleton picked up his hat i command this sortie he said to wyley but as he turned he found himself confronted by scrope what do you intend asked scrope major shackleton looked towards wyley wyley understood the look and also what shackleton intended he went from the room and left the two men together the grey light poured through the window the candles still burnt yellow on the table what do you intend the major looked scrope straight in the face i have heard a man speak tonight in a mans voice i mean to do that man the best service that i can these two years at mequinez cannot mate with these two years at tangier knightley knows nothing now he never shall know he believes his wife a second penelope he shall keep that belief there is a trench you called it very properly a grave in that trench knightley will not hear though all tangier scream its gossip in his ears i mean to give him his chance of death no major cried scrope or listen give me an equal chance trelawneys regiment is not called out again lieutenant i fear me you will have the harder part of it shackleton repeated scropes own words in all sincerity and hurried off to his post scrope was left alone in the guardroom a vision of the trench twelve feet deep eight yards wide yawned before his eyes he closed them but that made no difference he still saw the trench in imagination he began to measure its width and depth then he shook his head to rid himself of the picture and went out on to the balcony his eyes turned instinctively to a house by the city wall to a corner of the patio the house and the latticed shutter of a window just seen from the balcony he stepped back into the room with a feeling of nausea and blowing out the candles sat down alone in the twilight amongst the empty chairs there were dark corners in the room the broadening light searched into them and suddenly the air was tinged with warm gold somewhere the sun had risen in a little scrope heard a dropping sound of firing and a few moments afterwards the rattle of a volley the battle was joined scrope saw the trench again yawn up before his eyes the major was right this morning again lieutenant scrope had the harder part of it the man of wheels when sir charles fosbrook was told by mr pepys that tangier had been surrendered to the moors he asked at once after the fate of his gigantic mole and when he was informed that his mole had been before the evacuation so utterly blown to pieces that its scattered blocks made the harbour impossible for anchorage he forbade so much as the mention in his presence of the name of africa but if he had done with tangier tangier had not done with him and five years afterwards he became concerned in the most unexpected way with certain tragic consequences of that desperate siege he received a letter from an acquaintance of whom he had long lost sight a mr mardale of the quarry house near leamington imploring him to give his opinion upon some new inventions the value of the inventions could be easily gauged mr mardale claimed to have invented a wheel of perpetual rotation sir charles however had his impulses of kindness he knew mr mardale to be an old and gentle person a little touched in the head perhaps who with money enough to surfeit every instinct of pleasure had preferred to live a shy secluded life busily engaged either in the collection of curiosities or the invention of toylike futile machines there was a girl too whom sir charles remembered a weird elfin creature with extraordinary black eyes and hair and a clear white face her one regret in those days had been that she was not born a horse and she had lived in the stables in as horse like a fashion as was possible her ankle indeed still must bear an unnecessary scar through the application of a fierce horseliniment to a sprain no doubt however she had long since changed her ambitions sir charles calculated her age resilda mardale must be twentyfive years old and a deuced fine woman into the bargain sir charles took a glance at his figure in his chevalglass he had reached middleage to be sure but he had a leg that many a spindleshanked youngster might envy nor was there any unbecoming protuberance at his waist he wrote a letter accepting the invitation and a week later in the dusk of a june evening drove up the long avenue of trees to the terrace of the quarry house the house was a solid square mansion built upon the side of a hill and the ground in front of it fell away very quickly from the terrace to what sir charles imagined must be a pond for a light mist hung at the bottom on the other side of the pond the ground rose again in a steep hill but sir charles had no opportunity at this moment to get any accurate knowledge of the house and its surroundings for apart from the darkness it was close upon suppertime and miss resilda mardale must assuredly not be kept waiting his valet subsequently declared that sir charles had seldom been so particular in the choice of his coat and smallclothes and the supperbell certainly rang out before he was satisfied with the set of his cravat he could not however consider his pains wasted when once he was set down opposite to resilda she was taller than he had expected her to be but he did not count height a fault so long as there was grace to carry it off and grace she had in plenty her face had gained in delicacy and lost nothing of its brilliancy or of its remarkable clearness of complexion her hair too if it was less rebellious and more neatly coiled had retained its glory of profusion and her big black eyes though to be sure they were grown a trifle sedate no doubt could sparkle as of old sir charles set himself to make them sparkle old mr mardale prattled of his inventions to his hearts delight he described the wheel and also a flying machine and besides the flying machine an engine by which steam might be used to raise water to great altitudes sir charles was ready from time to time with a polite if not always an appropriate comment and for the rest he paid compliments to resilda still the eyes did not sparkle indeed a pucker appeared and deepened on her forehead sir charles accordingly redoubled his gallantries he was slyly humorous about the horseliniment and thereupon came the remark which so surprised him and was the beginning of his strange discoveries for resilda suddenly leaned towards him and said frankly i would much rather sir charles you told me something of your great mole at tangier sir charles had reason for surprise the world had long since forgotten his mole if ever it had been concerned in it yet here was a girl whose thoughts might be expected to run on youths and ribands talking of it in a little village four miles from leamington as though there were no topic more universal sir charles fosbrook answered her gravely i thought never to speak of tangier and the mole again i spent many years upon the devising and construction of that great breakwater it could have sheltered every ship of his majestys navy it was wife and children to me my heart lay very close to it i fancied indeed my heart was disrupted with the disruption of the mole and it has at all events lain ever since as heavy as king charles chest yes i can understand that said resilda sir charles had vowed never to speak of the matter again but he had kept his vow for five long years and besides here was a girl of a remarkable beauty expressing sympathy and asking for information sir charles broke his vow and talked and the girl helped him a suspicion that she might have primed herself with knowledge in view of his coming vanished before the flame of her enthusiasm she knew the history of its building almost as well as he did himself and could even set him right in his dates it was she who knew the exact day on which king charles chest that great block of mortised stones which formed as it were the keystone of the breakwater had been lowered into its place sir charles abandoned all reserve and talked freely of his hopes and fears as the pier ran farther out and out into the currents of the straits of his bitter disappointment when his labours were destroyed he forgot his gallantries he showed himself the man he was neither he nor resilda noticed a low rumble of thunder or the beating of sudden rain upon the windows so occupied were they with the theme of their talk and at last sir charles leaning back in his chair cried out with astonishment and delight but how is it that my mole is so familiar a thing to you explain it if you please never have i spent so agreeable an evening a momentary embarrassment seemed to follow upon his words resilda looked at her father who chuckled and explained sir an old soldier years ago came over the hill in front of the house and begged for alms he found my daughter on the terrace in a lucky moment for himself he had all sorts of wonderful stories of tangier and the great mole which was then a building resilda was set on fire that day and though the king and the parliament might shut their eyes to the sore straits of that town and the gallantry of its defenders no one was allowed to forget them in the quarry house to tell the truth i sometimes envied the obliviousness of parliament and he laughed gently so from the first my daughter was primed with the history of that siege and lately we have had further means of knowledge he began to speak warily and with embarrassment for two years ago resilda married an officer of the kings battalion major lashley here are two surprises cried sir charles for in the first place madam i had no thought you were wed blame a bachelors stupidity and he glanced at her left hand which lay upon the tablecloth with the band of gold gleaming upon a finger in the second place i knew major lashley very well though it is news to me that he ever troubled his head with my mole a very gallant officer who defended charles fort through many nights of great suspense and cleft his way back to tangier when his ammunition was expended i shall be very glad to shake the major once more by the hand at once sir charles was aware that he had uttered the most awkward and unsuitable remark resilda lashley as he must now term her actually flinched away from him and then sat with a vague staring look of pain as though she had been shocked clean out of her wits she recovered herself in a moment but she did not speak neither had sir charles any words he looked at her dress which was white and had not so much as a black riband dangling anywhere about it but there were other events than death which could make the utterance of his wish a gaucherie sir charles prided himself upon his tact particularly with a goodlooking woman and he was therefore much abashed and confused the only one who remained undisturbed was mr mardale his mind was never for very long off his wheels or his works of art it was the turn of his pictures now he had picked up a genuine rubens in ghent he declared it was standing somewhere in the great drawingroom on the carpet against the back of a chair and sir charles must look at it in the morning if only it could be found he had clean forgotten all about his daughter it appeared she however had a mind to clear the mystery up and interrupting her father it is right that you should know she said simply major lashley disappeared six months ago disappeared exclaimed sir charles in spite of himself and the astonishment in his voice woke the old gentleman from his prattle to be sure said he apologetically i should have told you before of the sad business yes sir major lashley disappeared utterly from this very house on the eleventh night of last december and though the countryside was scoured and every ragamuffin for miles round brought to question no trace of him has anywhere been discovered from that day to this an intuition slipped into sir charles fosbrooks mind and though he would have dismissed it as entirely unwarrantable persisted there the thought of the steep slope of ground before the house and the mist in the hollow between the two hills the mist was undoubtedly the exhalation from a pond the pond might have reeds which might catch and gather a body but the pond would have been dragged still the thought of the pond remained while he expressed a vague hope that the major might by gods will yet be restored to them he had barely ended before a louder gust of rain than ordinary smote upon the windows and immediately there followed a knocking upon the halldoor the sound was violent and it came with so opposite a rapidity upon the heels of fosbrooks words that it thrilled and startled him there was something very timely in the circumstances of night and storm and that premonitory clapping at the door sir charles looked towards the door in a glow of anticipation he had time to notice however how deeply resilda herself was stirred her left hand which had lain loose upon the tablecloth was now tightly clenched and she had a difficulty in breathing the one strange point in her conduct was that although she looked towards the door like sir charles fosbrook there was more of suspense in the look than of the eagerness of welcome the butler however had no news of major lashley to announce he merely presented the compliments of mr gibson jerkley who had been caught in the storm near the quarry house and ten miles from his home mr jerkley prayed for supper and a dry suit of clothes and a bed too said resilda with a flush of colour in her cheeks and begging sir charles permission she rose from the table sir charles was disappointed by the mention of a strange name mr mardale however to whom that loud knocking upon the door had been void of suggestion now became alert he looked with a strange anxiety after his daughter an anxiety which surprised fosbrook to whom this man of wheels and little toys had seemed lacking in the natural affections and a bed too repeated mr mardale doubtfully to be sure to be sure and though he went into the hall to welcome his visitor it was not altogether without reluctance mr gibson jerkley was a man of about thirty years he had a brown open personable countenance a pair of frank blue eyes and the steady restful air of a man who has made his account with himself and who neither speaks to win praise nor is at pains to escape dislike sir charles fosbrook was from the first taken with the man though he spoke little with him for the moment for being tired with his long journey from london he retired shortly to his room but however tired he was sir charles found that it was quite impossible for him to sleep the cracking of the rain upon his windows the groaning trees in the park and the wail of the wind among the chimneys and about the corners of the house were no doubt for something in a londoners sleeplessness but the mysterious disappearance of major lashley was at the bottom of it he thought again of the pond he imagined a violent kidnapping and his fancies went to work at devising motives some quarrel long ago in the crowded city of tangier and now brought to a tragical finish amongst the oaks and fields of england perhaps a moor had travelled over seas for his vengeance and found his way from village to village like that baracen lady of old times and when he had come to this point of his reflections he heard a light rapping upon his door he got out of bed and opened it he saw mr gibson jerkley standing on the threshold with a candle in one hand and a finger of the other at his lip i saw alight beneath your door said jerkley and sir charles made room for him to enter he closed the door cautiously and setting his candle down upon a chest of drawers said without any hesitation i have come sir to ask for your advice i do not wonder at your surprise it is indeed a strange sort of intrusion for a man to make upon whom you have never clapped your eyes before this evening but for one thing i fancy mrs lashley wishes me to ask you for the favour she has said nothing definitely in faith she could not as you will understand when you have heard the story but that i come with her approval i am very sure for another had she disapproved i should none the less have come of my own accord sir though i know you very well by reputation i have had the honour of few words with you but my life has taught me to trust boldly where my eyes bid me trust and the whole affair is so strange that one more strange act like this intrusion of mine is quite of apiece i ask you therefore to listen to me the listening pledges you to nothing and at the worst i can promise you my story will while away a sleepless hour if when you have heard you can give us your advice i shall be very glad for we are sunk in such a quandary that a new point of view cannot but help us sir charles pointed to a chair and politely turned away to hide a yawn for the young mans lengthy exordium had made him very drowsy he could very comfortably had fallen asleep at this moment but gibson jerkley began to speak and in a short space of time sir charles was as wideawake as any housebreaker eight years ago said he i came very often to the quarry house but i always rode homewards discontented in the evening resilda at that time had a great ambition to be a boy the sight of any brown barelegged lad gipsying down the hill with a song upon his lips would set her viciously kicking the toes of her satin slippers against the parapet of the terrace and clamouring at her sex now i was not of the same mind with resilda that i can well understand said sir charles drily but my young friend i can remember a time when resilda desired of all things to be a horse there was something hopeful because more human in her wish to be a boy had you only known mr jerkley nodded gravely and continued i was young enough to argue the point with her which did me no good and then to make matters worse the soldier from tangier came over the hill with his stories of major lashley captain he was then major lashley exclaimed sir charles i did not hear the soldier was one of major lashleys men but he was and thenceforward the world went very ill with me reports of battles and sorties came home at rare intervals she was the first to read of them major lashleys name was more than once mentioned we country gentlemen who stayed at home and looked after our farms and our tenants having no experience of war suffered greatly in the comparison so at the last i ordered my affairs for a long voyage and without taking leave of any but my nearest neighbours and friends i slipped off one evening to the wars you did not wish your friends at the quarry house goodbye said fosbrook no it might have seemed that i was making claims and after all one has ones pride i would never i think ask a woman to wait for me but she heard of course after i had gone and i am speaking frankly i believe the news woke the woman in her at all events there was little talk after of tangier at the quarry house mr jerkley related his subsequent history he had sailed at his own charges to africa he had enlisted as a gentleman volunteer in the kings battalion he had served under major lashley in the charles fort where he was in charge of the great speakingtrumpet by which the force received its orders from the lieutenantgovernor in tangier castle he took part in the desperate attempt to cut a way back through the moorish army into the town in that fight he was wounded and left behind for dead a year later peace was made tangier was evacuated major lashley returned to england now the major and i despite the difference in rank had been friends i had spoken to him of miss mardales admiration and as chance would have it he came to leamington to take the waters chance said sir charles drily well it may have been intention said jerkley there was no reason in the world why he should not seek her out she was not promised to me and very likely i had spoken of her with enthusiasm for a long time she would not consent to listen to him he was however no less persistent he pleaded his suit for three years i was dead you understand and what man worth a pinch of salt would wish a woman to waste her gift of life in so sterile a fidelity you follow me at the end of three years resilda yielded to his pleadings and the persuasions of her friends for major lashley quickly made himself a position in the country they were married major lashley was not a rich man it was decided that they should both live at the quarry house and what had mr mardale to say to it asked fosbrook oh sir said gibson jerkley with a laugh mr mardale is a man of wheels and little steel springs let him sit at his worktable in that crowded drawingroom on the first floor without interruption and he will be very well content i can assure you hush and he suddenly raised his hand in the silence which followed they both distinctly heard the sound of some one stirring in the house mr jerkley went to the door and opened it the door gave on to the passage which was shut off at its far end by another door from the square tulipwood landing at the head of the stairs he came back into the bedroom there is a light on the other side of the passagedoor said he but i have no doubt it is mr mardale going to his bed he sits late at his worktable sir charles brought him back to his story meanwhile you were counted for dead but actually you were taken prisoner there is one thing which i do not understand when peace was concluded the prisoners were freed and an officer was sent up into morocco to secure their release there were many oversights like mine i have no doubt the moors were reluctant enough to produce their captives we who were supposed to be dead were not particularly looked for i have no doubt there is many a poor english soldier sweating out his soul in the uplands of that country to this day i escaped two years ago just about the time in fact when miss resilda mardale became mrs lashley i crept down over the hillside behind tangier one dark evening and lay all night beneath a bush of tamarisks dreaming the moors were still about me but an inexplicable silence reigned and nowhere was the darkness spotted by the flame of any campfire in the morning i looked down to tangier the first thing which i noticed was your broken stump of mole the second that nowhere upon the ring of broken wall could be seen the flash of a red coat or the glitter of a musketbarrel i came down into tangier i had no money and no friends i got away in a felucca to spain from spain i worked my passage to england i came home nine months ago and here is the trouble three months after i returned major lashley disappeared you understand oh cried sir charles and he jumped in his chair i understand indeed suspicion settled upon you and as it ever will upon the least provocation suspicion passed for a moment into fosbrooks brain he was heartily ashamed of it when he looked into jerkleys face it would need assuredly a criminal of an uncommon astuteness to come at this hour with this story mr jerkley was not that criminal yes he answered simply i am looked at askance devil a doubt of it i would not care a snap of the fingers were i alone in the matter but there is mrs lashley she is neither wife nor widow and he took a step across the room and said quickly and were she known for a widow there is still the suspicion upon me like a great iron door between us can you help us sir charles can you see light you must tell me the details of the majors disappearance said sir charles and the following details were given on the eleventh of december and at ten oclock of the evening major lashley left the house to visit the stables which were situated in the park and at the distance of a quarter of a mile from the house a favourite mare which he had hunted the day before had gone lame and all day major lashley had shown some anxiety so that there was a natural reason why he should have gone out at the last moment before retiring to bed mrs lashley went up to her room at the same time indeed with so exact a correspondence of movement that as she reached the polished tulipwood landing at the top of the stairs she heard the front door latch as her husband drew it to behind him that was the last she heard of him she woke up suddenly said jerkley in the middle of the night and found that her husband was not at her side she waited for a little and then rose from her bed she drew the windowcurtains aside and by the glimmering light which came into the room was able to read the dial of her watch it was seven minutes past three of the morning she immediately lighted her candle and went to rouse her father her door opened upon the landing it is the first door upon the left hand side as you mount the stairs the big drawingroom opens on to the landing too but faces the stairs mrs lashley at once went to that room knowing how late mr mardale is used to sit over his inventions and as she expected found him there a search was at once arranged every servant in the house was at once impressed and in the morning every servant on the estate major lashley had left the stable at a quarter past ten he has been seen by no one since sir charles reflected upon this story there is a pond in front of the house said he it was dragged in the morning replied jerkley sir charles made various inquiries and received the most unsatisfactory answers for his purpose major lashley had been a favourite alike at tangier and in the country he had a winning trick of a smile which made friends for him even among his countrys enemies mr jerkley could not think of a man who had wished him ill well i will think the matter over said sir charles who had not an idea in his head and he held the door open for mr jerkley both men stood upon the threshold looked down the passage and then looked at one another it is strange said jerkley the light has been a long while burning on the landing said sir charles they walked on tiptoe down the passage to the door beneath which one bright bar of light stretched across the floor jerkley opened the door and looked through sir charles who was the taller man looked over jerkleys head and never were two men more surprised in the embrasure of that door to the left of the staircase the door behind which resilda lashley slept old mr mardale reclined with his back propped against the doorpost he had fallen asleep at his post and a lighted candle halfburnt flamed at his side the reason of his presence then was clear to them both a morbid fancy he said in a whisper but with a considerable anger in his voice such a fancy as comes only to a man who has lost his judgment through much loneliness see he sits like any negro outside an eastern harem sir i am shamed by him you have reason i take the liberty to say said sir charles absently and he went back to his room puzzling over what he had seen and over what he could neither see nor understand the desire for sleep was altogether gone from him he opened his window and leaned out the rain had ceased but the branches still dripped and the air was of an incomparable sweetness blackbirds and thrushes on the lawns and in the thicketdepths were singing as though their lives hung upon the full fresh utterance of each note a clear pure light was diffused across the world fosbrook went back to his old idea of some vengeful pursuit sprung from a wrong done long ago in tangier the picture of major lashley struck with terror as he got news of his pursuers and slinking off into the darkness even now somewhere or another on the uplands or the plains of england he might be rising from beneath a hedge to shake the rain from his besmeared clothes and start off afresh on another days aimless flight the notion caught his imagination and comforted him to sleep but in the morning he woke to recognise its unreality the unreality became yet more vivid to him at the breakfasttable when he sat with two pairs of young eyes turning again and again trustfully towards him the very reliance which the man and woman so clearly placed in him spurred him since they looked to him to clear up the mystery why he must do it and there was an end of the matter he was none the less glad however when mr jerkley announced his intention of returning home there would at all events be one pair of eyes the less he strolled with mr jerkley on the terrace after breakfast with a deep air of cogitation the better to avoid questions gibson jerkley however was himself in a ruminative mood he stopped and gazing across the valley to the riband of road descending the hill down that road the soldier came said he whose stories brought about all this misfortune and very likely down that road will come the bearer of news to make an end of it rejoined fosbrook sententiously mr jerkley looked at him with a sudden upspringing of hope and sir charles nodded with ineffable mystery never guessing how these lightly spoken words were to return to his mind with the strength of a fulfilled prophecy as he nodded however he turned about towards the house and a certain disfigurement struck upon his eyes two windows on the first floor were entirely bricked up and as the house was square with level tiers of windows they gave to it an unsightly look sir charles inquired of his companion if he could account for them to be sure said jerkley with the inattention of a man diverted from serious thought to an unimportant topic they are the windows of the room in which mrs mardale died a quarter of a century ago mr mardale locked the door as soon as his wife was taken from it to the church and the next day he had the windows blocked no one but he has entered the room during all these years the key has never left his person it must be the ruin of a room by now you can imagine it the dust gathering the curtains rotting in the darkness and at times the old man sitting there with his head running on days long since dead but you know mr mardale he is not as other men sir charles swung round alertly to his companion to him at all events the topic was not an indifferent one yet you say you believe that he is void of the natural affections last night we saw a proof a crazy proof if you will but none the less a proof of his devotion to his daughter today you give me as sure a one of his devotion to his dead wife and almost before he had finished mr mardale was calling to him from the steps of the house he spent all that morning in the great drawingroom on the first floor it was a room of rich furniture grown dingy with dust and inattention and crowded from end to end with tables and chairs and sofas on which were heaped in a confused medley pictures statues of marble fans and buckles from spain queer barbaric ornaments ivory carvings from the chinese sir charles could hardly make his way to the little cleared space by the window where mr mardale worked without brushing some irreplaceable treasure to the floor once there he was fettered for the morning mr mardale with all the undisciplined enthusiasm of an amateur jumping from this invention to that beaming over his spectacles sir charles listened with here and there a word of advice or of sympathy with the labour of creation but his thoughts were busy elsewhere he was pondering over his discovery of the morning over the sight which he and jerkley had seen last night he was accustoming himself to regard the old man in a strange new light as an overcareful father and a sorelystricken husband meanwhile he sat over against the window which was in the side of the house and since the house was built upon a slope of hill although the window was on the first floor a broad terrace of grass stretched away from it to a circle of gravel ornamented with statues on this terrace he saw mrs lashley and reflected uncomfortably that he must meet her at dinner and again sustain the inquiry of her eyes he avoided actual questions however and as soon as dinner was over with a meaning look at the girl to assure her that he was busy with her business he retired to the library then he sat himself down to think the matter over restfully but the room walled with books upon its three sides fronted the southwest on its fourth and as the afternoon advanced the hot june sun streamed farther and farther into the room sir charles moved his chair back and again back and again until at last it was pushed into the one cool dark corner of the room then sir charles closed his wearied eyes the better to think but he had slept little during the last night and when he opened them again it was with a guilty start he rubbed his eyes then he reached a hand down quickly at his side and lifted a book out of the lowest shelf in the corner the book was a volume of sermons sir charles replaced it and again dipped his hand into the luckybag he drew out a tome of mr hobbes philosophy sir charles was not in the mood for hobbes he tried again on this third occasion he found something very much more to his taste namely the second volume of anthony hamiltons memoirs of count grammont this he laid upon his knee and began glancing through the pages while he speculated upon the mystery of the majors disappearance his thoughts however lagged in a now wellworn circle they begot nothing new in the way of a suggestion on the other hand the book was quite new to him he became less and less interested in his thoughts more and more absorbed in the memoirs there were passages marked with a pencilline in the margin and marked thought sir charles by a discriminating judge he began to look only for the marked passages being sure that thus he would most easily come upon the raciest anecdotes he read the story of the counts pursuit by the brother of the lady he was affianced to the brother caught up the count when he was nearing dover to return to france you have forgotten something said the brother so i have replied grammont i have forgotten to marry your sister sir charles chuckled and turned over the pages there was an account of how the reprobate hero rode seventy miles into the country to keep a tryst with an inamorata and waited all night for no purpose in pouring rain by the park gate sir charles laughed aloud he turned over more pages and to his surprise came across amongst the marked passages a quite unentertaining anecdote of how grammont lost a fine new suit of clothes ordered for a masquerade at white hall sir charles read the story again wondering why on earth this passage had been marked and suddenly he was standing by the window holding the book to the light in a quiver of excitement underneath certain letters in the words of this marked passage he had noticed dents in the paper as though by the pressure of a pencil point now that he stood by the light he made sure of the dents and he saw also by the roughness of the paper about them that the pencilmarks had been carefully erased he read these underlined letters together they made a word two words a sentence and the sentence was an assignation sir charles could not remember that the critical moment in any of his great engineering undertakings had ever caused him such a flutter of excitement such a pulsing in his temples such a catching of his breath no not even the lowering of charles chest into the waters of tangier harbour everything at once became exaggerated out of its proportions the silence of the house seemed potential and expectant the shadows in the room now that the sun was low had their message he felt a queer chill run down his spine like ice he shivered then he hurried to the door locked it and sat down to a more careful study and as he read there came out before his eyes a story a story told as it were in telegrams a story of passion of secret meetings of gratitude for favours who was the discriminating judge who had marked these passages and underlined these letters the book was newly published it was in the quarry house and there were three occupants of the quarry house was it mr mardale the mere question raised a laugh resilda never major lashley then if not major lashley who else it flashed into his mind that here in this book he might hold the history of the majors long courtship of resilda but he dismissed the notion contemptuously gibson jerkley had told him of that courtship and of the girls reluctance to respond to it besides resilda was never the woman in this story perhaps the first volume might augment it and give the clue to the womans identity sir charles hunted desperately through the shelves nowhere was the first volume to be found he wasted halfanhour before he understood why of course the other volume would be in the womans keeping and how in the world to discover her things moved very quickly with sir charles that afternoon he had shut up the volume and laid it on the table the while he climbed up and down the library steps from the top of the steps he glanced about the room in a despairing way and his eyes lit upon the table for the first time he remarked the binding which was of a brown leather but all the books on the shelves were bound uniformly in marble boards with a red backing he sprang down from the steps with the vigour of a boy and seizing the book looked in the fly leaf for a name there was a name the name of a bookseller in leamington and as he closed the book again some one rapped upon the door sir charles opened it and saw mr mardale he gave the old gentleman no time to speak mr mardale said he i am a man of plethoric habits and must needs take exercise can you lend me a horse mr mardale was disappointed as his manner showed he had perhaps at that very moment hit upon a new and most revolutionary invention but his manners hindered him from showing more than a trace of the disappointment and sir charles rode out to the bookseller at leamington with the volume beneath his coat can you show me the companion to this said he dumping it down upon the counter the bookseller seized upon the volume and fondled it it is not fair he cried in any other affair but books it would be called at once sheer dishonesty here have been my subscribers clamouring for the memoirs for six months and more you hire out your books cried sir charles give would be the properer word grumbled the man sir charles humbly apologised it was the purest oversight said he and i will gladly pay double but i need the first volume the first volume sir replied the bookseller in a mollified voice is in the like case with the second there has been an oversight but who has it the bookseller was with difficulty persuaded to search his list he kept his papers in the greatest disorder so that it was no wonder people kept his volumes until they forgot them but in the end he found his list mrs ripley he read out mrs ripley of burley wood and where is burley wood asked sir charles it is a village sir six miles from leamington replied the bookseller and he gave some rough directions as to the road sir charles mounted his horse and cantered down the parade the sun was setting he would for a something miss his supper but he meant to see burley wood that day and he would have just daylight enough for his purpose as he entered the village he caught up a labourer returning from the fields sir charles drew rein beside him will you tell me if you please where mrs ripley lives the man looked up and grinned in the churchyard said he do you mean she is dead no less when did she die well it may have been a month or two ago or it may have been more show me her grave and theres a silver shilling in your pocket the labourer led fosbrook to a corner of the churchyard then upon a headstone he read that mary ripley aged twentynine had died on december th december the th thought sir charles five days before major lashley died then he turned quickly to the labourer can you tell me when mrs ripley was buried i can find out for another shilling you shall have it man the labourer hurried off discovered the sexton and came back but instead of the civil gentleman he had left he found now a man with a face of horror and eyes that had seen appalling things sir charles had remained in the churchyard by the grave he had looked about him from one to the other of the mounds of turf his imagination already stimulated had been quickened by what he had seen he stood with the face of a medusa she was buried when he asked on december the th replied the labourer sir charles showed no surprise he stood very still for a moment then he gave the man his two shillings and walked to the gate where his horse was tied then he inquired the nearest way to the quarry house and he was pointed out a bridlepath running across fields to a hill as he mounted he asked another question mr ripley is alive yes it must be mr ripley sir charles assured himself as he rode through the dusk of the evening it must be it must be until the words in his mind became a meaningless echo of his horses hoofs he rode up the hill left the bridlepath for the road and suddenly and long before he had expected he saw beneath him the red square of the quarry house and the smoke from its chimneys he was on that very road up which he and gibson jerkley had looked that morning down that road he had said would come the man who knew how major lashley had disappeared and within twelve hours down that road the man was coming but it must be mr ripley he said to himself none the less he took occasion at supper to speak of his ride i rode by leamington to burley wood i went into the churchyard then he stopped but as though the truth was meant to come to light resilda helped him out i had a dear friend buried there not so long ago she said father you remember mrs ripley i saw her grave this afternoon said fosbrook with his eyes upon mr mardale it might have been a mere accident it was in any case a trifling thing the mere shaking of a hand the spilling of a spoonful of salt upon the table but trifling things have their suggestions he remembered that resilda when she had waked up on the night of december the th to find herself alone had sought out her father who was still up and at work in the big drawingroom he remembered too that the window of that room gave on to a terrace of grass a man might go out by that window aye and return without a soul but himself being the wiser of course it was all guess work and inference and besides it must be mr ripley mr ripley might as easily have discovered the secret of the memoirs as himself or anyone else mr ripley would have justification for anger and indeed for more yes for what men who are not affected are used to call a crime sir charles abruptly stopped his reasoning seeing that it was prompted by a defence of mr mardale he made his escape from his hosts as soon as he decently could and retired to his room he sat down in his room and thought and he thought to some purpose he blew out his candle and stole down the stairs into the hall he had met no one from the hall he went to the librarydoor and opened it ever so gently the room was quite dark sir charles felt his way across it to his chair in the corner he sat down in the darkness and waited after a time inconceivably long after every board in the house had cracked a million times he heard distinctly a light shuffling step in the passage and after that the latch of the door release itself from the socket he heard nothing more for a little he could only guess that the door was being silently opened by some one who carried no candle then the shuffling footsteps began to move gently across the room towards him towards the corner where he was sitting sir charles had had no doubt but that they would not a single doubt but none the less as he sat there in the dark he felt the hair rising on his scalp and all his body thrill then a hand groped and touched him a cry rang out but it was sir charles who uttered it a voice answered quietly you had fallen asleep i regret to have waked you i was not asleep mr mardale there was a pause and mr mardale continued i cannot sleep tonight i came for a book i know for the book i took back to leamington today before i went to visit mrs ripleys grave there was a yet longer pause before mr mardale spoke again stay then he said in the same gentle voice i will fetch a light he shuffled out of the room and to sir charles it seemed again an inconceivably long time before he returned he came back with a single candle which he placed upon the table a little star of light showing the faces of the two men shadowy and dim he closed the door carefully and coming back said simply you know yes how did you find out i saw the grave i noticed the remarkable height of the mound i guessed yes said mr mardale and in a low voice he explained i found the book here one day that he left by accident on december th mrs ripley was buried and that night he left the house for the stables yes but he did not return from the stables it seemed quite clear to me where he would be that night people hereabouts take me for a man crazed and daft i know that very well but i know something of passion sir charles i have had my griefs to bear oh i knew where he would be i followed over the hill down to the churchyard of burley wood i had no thought of what i should do i carried a stick in my hand i had no thought of using it but i found him lying fulllength upon the grave with his lips pressed to the earth of it whispering to her who lay beneath him i called to him to stand up and he did i bade him if he dared repeat the words he had used to my face to me the father of the girl he had married and he did triumphantly recklessly i struck at him with the knob of my stick the knob was heavy i struck with all my might the blow fell upon his forehead the spade was lying on the ground beside the grave i buried him with her now what will you do nothing said sir charles but mr jerkley asked you to help him i shall tell a lie my friend there is no need said the old man with his gentle smile when i went out for this candle i sir charles broke in upon him in a whirl of horror no dont say it you did not i did replied mr mardale the poison is a kindly one i shall be dead before morning i shall sleep my way to death i do not mind for i fear that after all my inventions are of little worth i have left a confession on my writingdesk there is no reason is there why he and she should be kept apart it was not a question which sir charles could discuss he said nothing and was again left alone in the darkness listening to the shuffling footsteps of mr mardale as for the last time he mounted the stairs mr mitchelbournes last escapade it was in the kitchen of the inn at framlingham that mr mitchelbourne came across the man who was afraid and during the christmas week of the year lewis mitchelbourne was young in those days and esteemed as a gentleman of refinement and sensibility with a queer taste for escapades pardonable by reason of his youth it was his pride to bear his part in the graceful tactics of a minuet while a saddled horse waited for him at the door he delighted to vanish of a sudden from the lighted circle of his friends into the byways where none knew him or held him of account not that it was all vanity with mitchelbourne though no doubt the knowledge that his associates in london town were speculating upon his whereabouts tickled him pleasurably through many a solitary day but he was possessed both of courage and resource qualities for which he found too infrequent an exercise in his ordinary life and so he felt it good to be free for awhile not from the restraints but from the safeguards with which his social circumstances surrounded him he had his spice of philosophy too and discovered that these sharp contrasts luxury and hardship treading hard upon each other and the new strange people with whom he fell in kept fresh his zest of life thus it happened that at a time when families were gathering cheerily each about a single fireside mr mitchelbourne was riding alone through the muddy and desolate lanes of suffolk the winter was not seasonable men were not tempted out of doors there was neither briskness nor sunlight in the air and there was no snow upon the ground it was a december of dripping branches and mists and steady pouring rains with a raw sluggish cold which crept into ones marrow the man who was afraid a large corpulent man of a loose and heavy build with a flaccid face and bright little inexpressive eyes like a birds sat on a bench within the glow of the fire you travel far tonight he asked nervously shuffling his feet tonight exclaimed mitchelbourne as he stood with his legs apart taking the comfortable warmth into his bones no further than from this fire to my bed and he listened with enjoyment to the rain which cracked upon the window like a shower of gravel flung by some mischievous urchin he was not suffered to listen long for the corpulent man began again i am an observer sir i pride myself upon it but i have so much humility as to wish to put my observations to the test of fact now from your carriage i should judge you to serve his majesty a civilian may be straight there is no law against it returned mitchelbourne and he perceived that the ambiguity of his reply threw his questioner into a great alarm he was at once interested here it seemed was one of those encounters which were the spice of his journeyings you will pardon me continued the stranger with a great assumption of heartiness but i am curious sir curious as socrates though i thank god i am no heathen here is christmas when a sensible gentleman as upon my word i take you to be sits to his table and drinks more than is good for him in honour of the season yet here are you upon the roads to suffolk which have nothing to recommend them i wonder at it sir you may do that replied mitchelbourne though to be sure there are two of us in the like case oh as for me said his companion shrugging his shoulders i am on my way to be married my name is lance and he blurted it out with a suddenness as though to catch mitchelbourne off his guard mitchelbourne bowed politely and my name is mitchelbourne and i travel for my pleasure though my pleasure is mere gipsying and has nothing to do with marriage i take comfort from thinking that i have no friend from one rim of this country to the other and that my closest intimates have not an inkling of my whereabouts mr lance received the explanation with undisguised suspicion and at supper which the two men took together he would be forever laying traps now he slipped some outlandish name or oath unexpectedly into his talk and watched with a forward bend of his body to mark whether the word struck home or again he mentioned some person with whom mitchelbourne was quite unfamiliar at length however he seemed satisfied and drawing up his chair to the fire he showed himself at once in his true character a loud and gusty boaster an exchange of sentiments mr mitchelbourne with a chance acquaintance over a pipe and a glass upon my word i think you are in the right of it and theres no pleasanter way of passing an evening i could tell you stories sir i served the king in his wars but i scorn a braggart and all these glories are over i am now a man of peace and as i told you on my way to be married am i wise i do not know but i sometimes think it preposterous that a man who has been here and there about the world and could if he were so meanlyminded tell a tale or so of success in gallantry should hamper himself with connubial fetters but a man must settle to be sure and since the lady is young and not wanting in looks or breeding or station as i am told as you are told interrupted mitchelbourne yes for i have never seen her no not so much as her miniature nor have i seen her mother either or any of the family except the father from whom i carry letters to introduce me she lives in a house called the porch some miles from here there is another house hard by to it i understand which has long stood empty and i have a mind to buy it i bring a fortune the lady a standing in the county and what has the lady to say to it asked mitchelbourne the lady replied lance with a stare nothing but what is dutiful ill be bound the father is under obligations to me he stopped suddenly and mitchelbourne looking up saw that his mouth had fallen he sat with his eyes starting from his head and a face grey as lead an image of panic pitiful to behold mitchelbourne spoke but got no answer it seemed lance could not answer he was so arrested by a paralysis of terror he sat staring straight in front of him and it seemed at the mantelpiece which was just on a level with his eyes the mantelpiece however had nothing to distinguish it from a score of others its counterpart might be found to this day in the parlour of any inn a couple of china figures disfigured it to be sure but mitchelbourne could not bring himself to believe that even their barbaric crudity had power to produce so visible a discomposure he inclined to the notion that his companion was struck by a physical disease perhaps some recrudescence of a malady contracted in those foreign lands of which he vaguely spoke sir you are ill said mitchelbourne i will have a doctor if there is one hereabouts to be found brought to your relief he sprang up as he spoke and that action of his roused lance out of his paralysis have a care he cried almost in a shriek do not move for pity sir do not move and he in his turn rose from his chair he rose trembling and swept the dust off a corner of the mantelpiece into the palm of his hand then he held his palm to the lamp have you seen the like of this before he asked in a low shaking voice mitchelbourne looked over lances shoulder the dust was in reality a very fine grain of a greenish tinge never said mitchelbourne no nor i said lance with a sudden cunning look at his companion and opening his fingers as he let the grain run between them but he could not remove as easily from mitchelbournes memories that picture he had shown him of a shaking and a shaken man mitchelbourne went to bed divided in his feelings between pity for the lady lance was to marry and curiosity as to lances apprehensions he lay awake for a long time speculating upon that mysterious green seed which could produce so extraordinary a panic and in the morning his curiosity predominated since therefore he had no particular destination he was easily persuaded to ride to saxmundham with mr lance who for his part was most earnest for a companion on the journey lance gave further evidence of his fears he had a trick of looking backwards whenever they came to a corner of the road an habitual trick it seemed acquired by a continued condition of fear when they stopped at midday to eat at an ordinary he inspected the guests through the chink at the hinges of the door before he would enter the room and this too he did as though it had long been natural to him he kept a bridle in his mouth however that little pile of grain upon the mantelshelf had somehow warned him into reticence so that mitchelbourne had he not been addicted to his tobacco would have learnt no more of the business and would have escaped the extraordinary peril which he was subsequently called upon to face but he was addicted to his tobacco and no sooner had he finished his supper that night at saxmundham than he called for a pipe the maidservant fetched a handful from a cupboard and spread them upon the table and amongst them was one plainly of barbary manufacture it had a straight wooden stem painted with hieroglyphics in red and green and a small reddish bowl of baked earth nine men out of ten would no doubt have overlooked it but mitchelbourne was the tenth man his fancies were quick to kindle and taking up the pipe he said in a musing voice now how in the world comes a barbary pipe to travel so far over seas and herd in the end with common clays in a little suffolk village he heard behind him the grating of a chair violently pushed back the pipe seemingly made its appeal to mr lance also has it been smoked he asked in a grave low voice the inside of the bowl is stained said mitchelbourne mitchelbourne had been inclined to believe that he had seen last evening the extremity of fear expressed in a mans face he had now to admit that he had been wrong mr lances terror was a circe to him and sunk him into something grotesque and inhuman he ran once or twice in a little tripping silly run backwards and forwards like an animal trapped and out of its wits and his face had the look of a man suffering from a nausea so that mitchelbourne seeing him was ashamed and hurt for their common nature i must go said lance babbling his words i cannot stay i must go tonight exclaimed mitchelbourne six yards from the door you will be soaked then there will be the fewer men abroad i cannot sleep here no though it rained pistols and bullets i must go he went into the passage and calling his host secretly asked for his score mitchelbourne made a further effort to detain him make an inquiry of the landlord first it may be a mere shadow that frightens you not a word not a question lance implored the mere suggestion increased a panic which seemed incapable of increase and for the shadow why thats true the pipes the shadow and the shadow frightens me a shadow yes a shadow is a horrible threatning thing show me a shadow cast by nothing and i am with you but you might as easily hold that this barbary pipe floated hither across the seas of its own will no ware shadows i say and so he continued harping on the word till the landlord fetched in the bill the landlord had his dissuasions too but they availed not a jot more than mr mitchelbournes the road is as black as a paupers coffin said he and damnable with ruts so much the better said lance there is no house where you can sleep nearer than glemham and no man would sleep there could he kennel elsewhere so much the better said lance besides i am expected tomorrow evening at the porch and glemham is on the way he paid his bill slipped over to the stables and lent a hand to the saddling of his horse mitchelbourne though for once in his life he regretted the precipitancy with which he welcomed strangers was still sufficiently provoked to see the business to its end his imagination was seized by the thought of this fat and vulgar person fleeing in terror through english lanes from a barbary moor he had now a conjecture in his mind as to the nature of that greenish seed he accordingly rode out with lance toward glemham it was a night of extraordinary blackness you could not distinguish a hedge until the twigs stung across your face the road was narrow great treetrunks with bulging roots lined it at times it was very steep and besides and beyond every other discomfort there was the rain it fell pitilessly straight over the face of the country with a continuous roar as though the earth was a hollow drum both travellers were drenched to the skin before they were free of saxmundham and one of them when after midnight they stumbled into the poor tumbledown parody of a tavern at glemham was in an extreme exhaustion it was no more than an ague said lance from which he periodically suffered but the two men slept in the same bare room and towards morning mitchelbourne was awakened from a deep slumber by an unfamiliar voice talking at an incredible speed through the darkness in an uncouth tongue he started up upon his elbow the voice came from lances bed he struck a light lance was in a high fever which increased as the morning grew now whether he had the sickness latent within him when he came from barbary or whether his anxieties and corpulent habit made him an easy victim to disease neither the doctor nor any one else could determine but at twelve oclock that day lance was seized with an attack of cholera and by three in the afternoon he was dead the suddenness of the catastrophe shocked mr mitchelbourne inexpressibly he stood gazing at the still features of the man whom fear had during these last days so grievously tormented and was solemnly aware of the vanity of those fears he could not pretend to any great esteem for his companion but he made many suitable reflections upon the shears of the fates and the tenacity of life in which melancholy occupation he was interrupted by the doctor who pointed out the necessity of immediate burial seven oclock the next morning was the hour agreed upon and mitchelbourne at once searched in lances coat pockets for the letters which he carried there were only two superscribed respectively to mrs ufford at the porch near glemham and to her daughter brasilia at the porch mitchelbourne remembered lance was expected this very evening and he thought it right at once to ride thither with his gloomy news having therefore sprinkled the letters plentifully with vinegar and taken such rough precautions as were possible to remove the taint of infection from the letters he started about four oclock the evening was most melancholy for though no rain any longer fell there was a continual pattering of drops from the trees and a ghostly creaking of branches in a light and almost imperceptible wind the day too was falling the grey overhang of cloud was changing to black except for one wide space in the west where a pale spectral light shone without radiance and the last of that was fading when he pulled up at a parting of the roads and inquired of a man who chanced to be standing there his way to the porch he was directed to ride down the road upon his left hand until he came to the second house which he could not mistake for there was a dyke or moat about the garden wall he passed the first house a mile further on and perhaps half a mile beyond that he came to the dyke and the high garden wall and saw the gables of the second house loom up behind it black against the sky a wooden bridge spanned the dyke and led to a wide gate mitchelbourne stopped his horse at the bridge the gate stood open and he looked down an avenue of trees into a square of which three sides were made by the high garden wall and the fourth and innermost by the house thus the whole length of the house fronted him and it struck him as very singular that neither in the lower nor the upper windows was there anywhere a spark of light nor was there any sound but the tossing of the branches and the wail of the wind among the chimneys not even a dog barked or rattled a chain and from no chimney breathed a wisp of smoke the house in the gloom of that melancholy evening had a singular eerie and tenantless look and oppressive silence reigned there and mitchelbourne was unaccountably conscious of a growing aversion to it as to something inimical and sinister he had crossed the mouth of a lane he remembered just at the first corner of the wall the lane ran backwards from the road parallel with the side wall of the garden mitchelbourne had a strong desire to ride down that lane and inspect the back of the house before he crossed the bridge into the garden he was restrained for a moment by the thought that such a proceeding must savour of cowardice but only for a moment there had been no doubting the genuine nature of lances fears and those fears were very close to mr mitchelbourne now they were feeling like cold fingers about his heart he was almost in the icy grip of them he turned and rode down the lane until he came to the end of the wall a meadow stretched behind the house mitchelbourne unfastened the catch of a gate with his riding whip and entered it he found himself upon the edge of a pool which on the opposite side wetted the house wall about the pool some elder trees and elms grew and overhung and their boughs tapped like fingers upon the windowpanes mitchelbourne was assured that the house was inhabited since from one of the windows a strong yellow light blazed and whenever a sharper gust blew the branches aside swept across the face of the pool like a flaw of wind the lighted window was in the lowest storey and mitchelbourne from the back of his horse could see into the room he was mystified beyond expression by what he saw a deal table three wooden chairs some ragged curtains drawn back from the window and a single lamp made up the furniture the boards of the floor were bare and unswept the paint peeled in strips from the panels of the walls the discoloured ceiling was hung with cobwebs the room in a word matched the outward aspect of the house in its look of long disuse yet it had occupants three men were seated at the table in the scarlet coats and boots of the kings officers their faces though it was wintertime were brown with the sun and thin and drawn as with long privation and anxiety they had little to say to one another it seemed each man sat stiffly in a sort of suspense and expectation with now and then a restless movement or a curt word as curtly answered mitchelbourne rode back again crossed the bridge fastened his horse to a tree in the garden and walked down the avenue to the door as he mounted the steps he perceived with something of a shock that the door was wide open and that the void of the hall yawned black before him it was a fresh surprise but in this night of surprises one more or less he assured himself was of little account he stepped into the hall and walked forwards feeling with his hands in front of him as he advanced he saw a thin line of yellow upon the floor ahead of him the line of yellow was a line of light and it came no doubt from underneath a door and the door no doubt was that behind which the three men waited mitchelbourne stopped after all he reflected the three men were english officers wearing his majestys uniform and moreover wearing it stained with their countrys service he walked forward and tapped upon the door at once the light within the room was extinguished it needed just that swift and silent obliteration of the slip of light upon the floor to make mitchelbourne afraid he had been upon the brink of fear ever since he had seen that lonely and disquieting house he was now caught in the full stream he turned back through the open doorway he saw the avenue of leafless trees tossing against a leaden sky he took a step or two and then came suddenly to a halt for all around him in the darkness he seemed to hear voices breathing and soft footsteps he realised that his fear had overstepped his reason he forced himself to remember the contempt he had felt for lances manifestations of terror and swinging round again he flung open the door and entered the room good evening gentlemen said he airily and he got no answer whatsoever in front of him was the grey panel of dim twilight where the window stood the rest was black night and an absolute silence a map of the room was quite clear in his recollections the three men were seated he knew at the table on his right hand the faint light from the window did not reach them and they made no noise yet they were there why had they not answered him he asked himself he could not even hear them breathing though he strained his ears he could only hear his heart drumming at his breast the blood pulsing in his temples why did they hold their breath he crossed the room not knowing what he did bereft of his wits he had a confused ridiculous picture of himself wearing the flaccid panic stricken face of mr lance like an ass head not holding the wand of titania he reached the window and stood in its embrasure and there one definite practical thought crept into his mind he was visible to these men who were invisible to him the thought suggested a precaution and with the trembling haste of a man afraid he tore at the curtains and dragged them till they met across the window so that even the faint grey glimmer of the night no longer had entrance the next moment he heard the door behind him latch and a key turn in the lock he crouched beneath the window and did not stand up again until a light was struck and the lamp relit the lighting of the lamp restored mr mitchelbourne if not to the full measure of his confidence at all events to an appreciation that the chief warrant for his trepidation was removed what he had with some appearance of reason feared was a sudden attack in the dark with the lamp lit he could surely stand in no danger of any violence at the hands of three kings officers whom he had never come across in all his life he took therefore an easy look at them one the youngest now leaned against the door a youth of a frank honest face unremarkable but for a firm set of the jaws a youth of no great intellect thought mitchelbourne but tenacious a youth marked out for a subordinate command and never likely for all his sterling qualities to kindle a woman to a worldforgetting passion or to tread with her the fiery heights where life throbs at its fullest mr mitchelbourne began to feel quite sorry for this young officer of the limited capacities and he was still in the sympathetic mood when one of the two men at the table spoke to him mitchelbourne turned at once the officers were sitting with a certain air of the theatre in their attitudes one a little dark man and the other a stiff light complexioned fellow with a bony barren face unmistakably a stupid man and the oldest of the three it was he who was speaking and he spoke with a sort of aggravated courtesy like a man of no breeding counterfeiting a gentleman upon the stage you will pardon us for receiving you with so little ceremony but while we expected you you on the other hand were not expecting us and we feared that you might hesitate to come in if the lamp was burning when you opened the door mitchelbourne was now entirely at his ease he perceived that there was some mistake and made haste to put it right on the contrary said he for i knew very well you were here indeed i knocked at the door to make a necessary inquiry you did not extinguish the lamp so quickly but that i saw the light beneath the door and besides i watched you some five minutes through the window from the opposite bank of the pool at the back of the house the officers were plainly disconcerted by the affability of mr mitchelbournes reply they had evidently expected to carry off a triumph not to be taken up in an argument they had planned a stroke of the theatre final and convincing and behold the dialogue went on there was a riposte to their thrust the spokesman made some gruff noises in his throat then his face cleared these are dialectics he said superbly with a wave of the hand good said the little dark fellow at his elbow very good the youth at the door nodded superciliously towards mitchelbourne true these are dialectics said he with a smack of the lips upon the word it was a good cunning scholarly word and the man who could produce it so aptly worthy of admiration you make a further error gentlemen continued mitchelbourne you no doubt are expecting some one but you were most certainly not expecting me for i am here by the purest mistake having been misdirected on the way here the three men smiled to each other and their spokesman retorted with a chuckle misdirected indeed you were we took precautions that you should be a servant of mine stationed at the parting of the roads but we are forgetting our manners he added rising from his chair you should know our names the gentleman at the door is cornet lashley this is captain bassett and i am major chantrell we are all three of trevelyans regiment and my name said mitchelbourne not to be outdone in politeness is lewis mitchelbourne a gentleman of the county of middlesex at this each of the officers was seized with a fit of laughter but before mitchelbourne had time to resent their behavior major chantrell said indulgently well well we shall not quarrel about names at all events we all four are lately come from tangier oh from tangier cried mitchelbourne the riddle was becoming clear that extraordinary siege when a handful of english redcoats unpaid and illfed fought a breached and broken town against countless hordes for the honour of their king during twenty years had not yet become the property of the historian it was still an actual war in mitchelbourne understood whence came the sunburn on his antagonists faces whence the stains and the worn seams of their clothes he advanced to the table and spoke with a greater respect than he had used did one of you he asked leave a moorish pipe behind you at an inn of saxmundham ah said the major with a reproachful glance at captain bassett the captain answered with some discomfort yes i made that mistake but what does it matter you are here none the less you have with you some of the moorish tobacco continued mitchelbourne captain bassett fetched out of his pocket a little canvas bag and handed it to mitchelbourne who untied the string about the neck and poured some of the contents into the palm of his hand the tobacco was a fine greenish seed i thought as much said mitchelbourne you expected mr lance tonight it is mr lance whom you thought to misdirect to this solitary house indeed mr lance spoke of such a place in this neighbourhood and had a mind to buy it captain bassett suddenly raised his hand to his mouth not so quickly however but mitchelbourne saw the grim amused smile upon his lips it is mr lance for whom you now mistake me he said abruptly the young man at the door uttered a short contemptuous laugh major chantrell only smiled i am aware said he that we meet for the first time tonight but you presume upon that fact too far what have you to say to this and dragging a big and battered pistol from his pocket he tossed it upon the table and folded his arms in the best transpontine manner and to this said captain bassett he laid a worn leather powder flask beside the pistol and tapped upon the table triumphantly mr mitchelbourne recognised clearly that villainy was somehow checkmated by these proceedings and virtue restored but how he could not for the life of him determine he took up the pistol it appears to have seen some honourable service said he this casual remark had a most startling effect upon his auditors it was the spark to the gunpowder of their passions their affectations vanished in a trice service yes but honourable use that lie again mr lance and i will ram the butt of it down your throat cried major chantrell he leaned forward over the table in a blaze of fury yet his face did no more than match the faces of his comrades mitchelbourne began to understand these simple soldiermen had endeavoured to conduct their proceedings with great dignity and a judicial calmness they had mapped out for themselves certain parts which they were to play as upon a stage they were to be three stern imposing figures of justice and so they had become simply absurd and ridiculous now however that passion had the upper hand of them mitchelbourne saw at once that he stood in deadly peril these were men understand me mr lance and the majors voice rang out firm the voice of a man accustomed to obedience three years ago i was in command of devils drop a little makeshift fort upon the sands outside tangier in front the moors lay about us in a semicircle sir the diameter was the line of the sea at our backs we could not retire six yards without wetting our feet not twenty without drowning one night the moors pushed their trenches up to our palisades in the dusk of the morning i ordered a sortie nine officers went out with me and three came back we three of the six we left behind five fell by my orders to be sure for i led them out but by the living god you killed them theres the pistol that shot my best friend down an english pistol theres the powder flask which charged the pistol an english flask filled with english powder and who sold the pistol and the powder to the moors englands enemies you an englishman but you have come to the end of your lane tonight turn and turn as you will you have come to the end of it the truth was out now and mitchelbourne was chilled with apprehension here were three men very desperately set upon what they considered a mere act of justice how was he to dissuade them by argument they would not listen to it by proofs he had none to offer them by excuses of all unsupported excuses which can match for futility the excuse of mistaken identity it springs immediate to the criminals lips its mere utterance is almost a conviction you persist in error major chantrell he nevertheless began show him the proof bassett chantrell interrupted with a shrug of the shoulders and captain bassett drew from his pocket a folded sheet of paper nine officers went out continued chantrell five were killed three are here the ninth was taken a prisoner into barbary the moors brought him down to their port of marmora to interpret at marmora your ship unloaded its stores of powder and guns god knows how often it had unloaded the like cargo during these twenty years often enough it seems to give you a fancy for figuring as a gentleman in the county but the one occasion of its unloading is enough our brother officer was your interpreter with the moors mr lance you may very likely know that but this you do not know mr lance he escaped he crept into tangier with this your bill of lading in his hand and bassett tossed the sheet of paper towards mitchelbourne it fell upon the floor before him but he did not trouble to pick it up is it lances death that you require he asked yes yes yes came from each mouth then already you have your wish i do not question one word of your charges against lance i have reason to believe them true but i am not lance lance lies at this moment dead at great glemham he died this afternoon of cholera here are his letters and he laid the letters on the table i rode in with them at once you do not believe me but you can put my words to the test let one of you ride to great glemham and satisfy himself he will be back before morning the three officers listened so far with impassive faces or barely listened for they were as indifferent to the words as to the passion with which they were spoken we have had enough of the gentlemans ingenuities i think said chantrell and he made a movement towards his companions one moment exclaimed mitchelbourne answer me a question these letters are to the address of mrs ufford at a house called the porch it is near to here it is the first house you passed answered the major and as he noticed a momentary satisfaction flicker upon his victims face he added but you will not do well to expect help from the porch at all events in time to be of much service to you you hardly appreciate that we have been at some pains to come up with you we are not likely again to find so many circumstances agreeing to favour us a dismantled house yourself travelling alone and off your guard in a country with which you are unfamiliar and where none know you and just outside the window a convenient pool besides besides he broke out passionately there are the little mounds about tangier under which my friends lie and he covered his face with his hands my friends he cried in a hoarse and broken voice my soldiermen come lets make an end bassett the rope is in the corner theres a noose to it the beam across the window will serve and bassett rose to obey but mitchelbourne gave them no time his fears had altogether vanished before his indignation at the stupidity of these officers he was boiling with anger at the thought that he must lose his life in this futile ignominious way for the crime of another man who was not even his friend and who besides was already dead there was just one chance to escape it seemed to him and even as bassett stooped to lift the coil of rope in the corner he took it so thats the way of it he cried stepping forward i am to be hung up to a beam till i kick to death am i i am to be buried decently in that stagnant pool am i and you are to be miles away before sunrise and no one the wiser no major chantrell i am not come to the end of my lane and before either of the three could guess what he was at he had snatched up the pistol from the table and dashed the lamp into a thousand fragments the flame shot up blue and high and then came darkness mitchelbourne jumped lightly back from his position to the centre of the room the men he had to deal with were men who would follow their instincts they would feel along the walls of so much he could be certain he heard the coil of rope drop down in a corner to his left so that he knew where captain bassett was he heard a chair upset in front of him and a man staggered against his chest mitchelbourne had the pistol still in his hand and struck hard and the man dropped with a crash the fall followed so closely upon the upsetting of the chair that it seemed part of the same movement and accident it seemed so clearly part that a voice spoke on mitchelbournes left just where the empty hearth would be get up be quick the voice was major chantrells and mitchelbourne had a throb of hope for since it was not the major who had fallen nor captain bassett it must be lashley and lashley had been guarding the door of which the key still remained in the lock if only he could reach the door and turn the key he heard chantrell moving stealthily along the wall upon his left hand and he suffered a moments agony for in the darkness he could not surely tell which way the major moved for if he moved to the window if he had the sense to move to the window and tear aside those drawn curtains the grey twilight would show the shadowy moving figures mitchelbournes chance would be gone and then something totally unexpected and unhoped for occurred the god of the machine was in a freakish mood that evening he had a mind for pranks and absurdities mitchelbourne was strung to so high a pitch that the ridiculous aspect of the occurrence came home to him before all else and he could barely keep himself from laughing aloud for he heard two men grappling and struggling silently together captain bassett and major chantrell had each other by the throat and neither of them had the wit to speak they reserved their strength for the struggle mitchelbourne stepped on tiptoe to the door felt for the key grasped it without so much as a click and then suddenly turned it flung open the door and sprang out he sprang against a fourth man the servant no doubt who had misdirected him and both tumbled on to the floor mitchelbourne however tumbled on top he was again upon his feet while major chantrell was explaining matters to captain bassett he was flying down the avenue of trees before the explanation was finished he did not stop to untie his horse he ran conscious that there was only one place of safety for him the interior of mrs uffords house he ran along the road till he felt that his heart was cracking within him expecting every moment that a hand would be laid upon his shoulder or that a pistol shot would ring out upon the night he reached the house and knocked loudly at the door he was admitted breathless by a man who said to him at once with the smile and familiarity of an old servant you are expected mr lance mitchelbourne plumped down upon a chair and burst into uncontrollable laughter he gave up all attempt for that night to establish his identity the fates were too heavily against him besides he was now quite hysterical the manservant threw open a door i will tell my mistress you have come sir said he no it would never do cried mitchelbourne you see i died at three oclock this afternoon i have merely come to leave my letters of presentation so much i think a proper etiquette may allow but it would never do for me to be paying visits upon ladies so soon after an affair of so deplorable a gravity besides i have to be buried at seven in the morning and if i chanced not to be back in time i should certainly acquire a reputation for levity which since i am unknown in the county i am unwilling to incur and leaving the butler stupefied in the hall he ran out into the road he heard no sound of pursuit the coward i geoffrey said general faversham look at the clock the hands of the clock made the acutest of angles it was close upon midnight and ever since nine the boy had sat at the dinnertable listening he had not spoken a word indeed had barely once stirred in the three hours but had sat turning a white and fascinated face upon speaker after speaker at his fathers warning he waked with a shock from his absorption and reluctantly stood up must i go father he asked the generals three guests intervened in a chorus the conversation was clear gain for the lad they declared a first taste of powder which might stand him in good stead at a future time so geoffrey was allowed furlough from his bed for another halfhour and with his face supported between his hands he continued to listen at the table the flames of the candles were more and more blurred with a haze of tobacco smoke the room became intolerably hot the level of the wine grew steadily lower in the decanters and the boys face took a strained quivering look his pallour increased his dark wideopened eyes seemed preternaturally large the stories were all of that terrible winter in the crimea now ten years past and a fresh story was always in the telling before its predecessor was ended for each of the four men had borne his share of that winters wounds and privations it was still a reality rather than a memory to them they could feel even in this hot summer evening and round this dinnertable the chill of its snows and the pinch of famine yet their recollections were not all of hardships the major told how the subalterns of whom he had then been one had cheerily played cards in the trenches three hundred yards from the malakoff one of the party was always told off to watch for shells from the forts guns if a black speck was seen in the midst of the cannon smoke then the sentinel shouted and a rush was made for safety for the shell was coming their way at night the burning fuse could be seen like a rocket in the air so long as it span and flew the cardplayers were safe but the moment it became stationary above their heads it was time to run for the shell was falling upon them the guns of the malakoff were not the rifled guns of a later decade when the major had finished the general again looked at the clock and geoffrey said goodnight he stood outside the door listening to the muffled talk on the other side of the panels and with a shiver lighted his candle and held it aloft in the dark and silent hall there was not one mans portrait upon the walls which did not glow with the colours of a uniform and there were the portraits of many men father and son the favershams had been soldiers from the very birth of the family father and son no steinkirks and plumed hats no shakos and swallow tails no frogged coats and no high stocks they looked down upon the boy as though summoning him to the like service no distinction in uniform could obscure their resemblance to each other that stood out with a remarkable clearness the favershams were men of one stamp leanfaced hard as iron they lacked the elasticity of steel rugged in feature confident in expression men with firm level mouths but rather narrow at the forehead men of resolution and courage no doubt but hardly conspicuous for intellect men without nerves or subtlety fightingmen of the firstclass but hardly firstclass soldiers some of their faces indeed revealed an actual stupidity the boy however saw none of their defects to him they were one and all portentous and terrible and he had an air of one standing before his judges and pleading mutely for forgiveness the candle shook in his hand these crimean knights as his father termed them were the worst of torturers to geoffrey faversham he sat horribly thralled so long as he was allowed he crept afterwards to bed and lay there shuddering for his mother a lady who some twenty years before had shone at the court of saxecoburg as much by the refinement of her intellect as by the beauty of her person had bequeathed to him a very burdensome gift of imagination it was visible in his face marking him off unmistakably from his father and from the study portraits in the hall he had the capacity to foresee possibilities and he could not but exercise that capacity a hint was enough for the boy straightway he had a vivid picture before his mind and as he listened to the men at the dinnertable their rough clipped words set him down in the midst of their battlefields he heard the drone of bullets he quivered expecting the shock of a charge but of all the crimean nights this had been fraught with the most torments his father had told a story with a lowered voice and in his usual jerky way but the gap was easy to fill up a captain yes and he bore one of the best names in all england it seemed incredible and mere camp rumour but the rumour grew with every fight he was engaged in at the battle of alma the thing was proved he was acting as galloper to his general i believe upon my soul that the general chose him for this duty so that the man might set himself right he was bidden to ride with a message a quarter of a mile and that quarter of a mile was bulletswept there were enough men looking on to have given him a reputation had he dared and come through but he did not dare he refused and was sent under arrest to his tent he was courtmartialled and broken he dropped out of his circle like a plummet of lead the very women in piccadilly spat if he spoke to them he blew his brains out three years later in a back bedroom off the haymarket explain that if you can turns tail and says i darent but you can you explain it you can only say its the truth and shrug your shoulders queer incomprehensible things happen theres one of them geoffrey however understood only too well he was familiar with many phases of warfare of which general faversham took little account such as for instance the strain and suspense of the hours between the parading of the troops and the first crack of a rifle he took that story with him up the great staircase past the portraits to his bed he fell asleep only in the grey of the morning and then only to dream of a crisis in some hardfought battle when through his cowardice a necessary movement was delayed his country worsted and those dead men in the hall brought to irretrievable shame geoffreys power to foresee in one flash all the perils to be encountered the hazards to be run had taught him the hideous possibility of cowardice he was now confronted with the hideous fact he could not afterwards clear his mind of the memory of that evening he grew up with it he looked upon himself as a born coward and all the time he knew that he was destined for the army he could not have avoided his destiny without an explanation and he could not explain but what he could do he did he hunted deliberately hoping that familiarity with danger would overcome the vividness of his anticipations but those imagined hours before the beginnings of battles had their exact counterpart in the moments of waiting while the covers were drawn at such times he had a map of the countryside before his eyes with every ditch and fence and pit underlined and marked dangerous and though he rode straight when the hounds were off he rode straight with a fluttering heart thus he spent his youth he passed into woolwich and out of it with high honours he went to india with battery and returned home on a two years furlough he had not been home more than a week when his father broke one morning into his bedroom in a great excitement geoff he cried guess the news today geoffrey sat up in his bed your manner sir tells me the news war is declared between france and germany geoffrey said slowly my mother sir was of germany so we can wish that country all success can we do no more said geoffrey and at breakfasttime he returned to the subject the favershams held property in germany influence might be exerted it was only right that those who held a substantial stake in a country should venture something for its cause the words came quite easily from geoffreys lips he had been schooling himself to speak them ever since it had become apparent that germany and france were driving to the collision of war general faversham laughed with content when he heard them thats a faversham talking said he but there are obstacles my boy there is the foreign enlistment act for instance you are half german to be sure but you are an english subject and by the lord you are all faversham no i cannot give you permission to seek service in germany you understand i cannot give you permission he repeated the words so that the limit as well as the extent of their meaning might be fully understood and as he repeated them he solemnly winked of course you can go to germany you can follow the army as closely as you are allowed in fact i will give you some introductions with that end in view you will gain experience of course but seek service no to do that as i have said i cannot give you permission the general went off chuckling to write his letters and with them safely tucked away in his pocket geoffrey drove later in the day to the station general faversham did not encourage demonstrations he shook his son cordially by the hand theres no way i would rather you spent your furlough but come back geoff said he he was not an observant man except in the matter of military detail and of geoffreys object he had never the slightest suspicion had it been told him however he would only have considered it one of those queer inexplicable vagaries like the history of his coward in the crimea geoffreys action however was of a piece with the rest of his life it was due to no sudden desperate resolve he went out to the war as deliberately as he had ridden out to the huntingfield the realities of battle might prove his anticipations mere unnecessary torments of the mind if only i can serve as a volunteer as a private in any capacity he thought i shall at all events know and if i fail i fail not in the company of my fellows i disgrace only myself not my name but if i do not fail he drew a great breath he saw himself waking up one morning without oppression without the haunting dread that he was destined one day to slink in forgotten corners of the world a forgotten pariah destitute even of the courage to end his misery he went out to the war because he was afraid of fear ii on the evening of the capitulation of paris two subalterns of german artillery were seated before a camp fire on a slope of hill overlooking the town to both of them the cessation of alarm was as yet strange and almost incomprehensible and the sudden silence after so many months lived amongst the booming of cannon had even a disquieting effect both were particularly alert on this night when vigilance was never less needed if a gust of wind caught the fire and drove the red flare of the flame like a ripple across the grass one would be sure to look quickly over his shoulder the other perhaps would lift a warning finger and listen to the shivering of the trees behind them then with a relaxation of his attitude he would say all right and light his pipe again at the fire but after one such gust he retained his position what is it faversham asked his companion listen max said geoffrey and they heard a faint jingle the jingle became more distinct another sound was added to it the sound of a horse galloping over hard ground both officers turned their faces away from the yellow entrenchment with its brown streak of gun below them and looked towards a roofless whitewalled farmhouse on the left of which the rafters rose black against the sky like a gigantic gallows from behind that farmhouse an aidedecamp galloped up to the fire i want the officer in command of this battery he cried out and geoffrey stood up i am in command the aidedecamp looked at the subaltern in an extreme surprise you he exclaimed since when since yesterday answered faversham i doubt if the general knows you have been hit so hard the aidedecamp continued but my orders are explicit the officer in command is to take sixty men and march tomorrow morning into st denis he is to take possession of that quarter he is to make a search for mines and bombs and wait there until the german troops march in there was to be no repetition he explained of a certain unfortunate affair when the germans after occupying a surrendered fort had been blown to the four winds he concluded with the comforting information that there were french soldiers under arms in st denis and that discretion was therefore a quality to be much exercised by faversham during his day of search thereupon he galloped back faversham remained standing a few paces from the fire looking down towards paris his companion petulantly tossed a branch upon the fire luck comes your way my friend said he enviously geoffrey looked up to the stars and down again to paris which with its lights had the look of a reflected starlit firmament individual lights were the separate stars and here and there a gash of fire where a wide thoroughfare cleaved made a sort of milky way i wonder he answered slowly max started up on his elbow and looked at his friend in perplexity why you have sixty men and st denis to command tomorrow may bring you your opportunity and again with the same slowness geoffrey answered i wonder you joined us after gravelotte continued max why my mother was german said faversham and turning suddenly back to the fire he dropped on the ground beside his companion tell me he said in a rare burst of confidence do you think a battle is the real test of courage here and there men run away to be sure but how many fight and fight no worse than the rest by reason of a sort of cowardice fear of their companions in arms might dominate fear of the enemy no doubt said max and you infer that the only touchstone is a solitary peril when danger comes upon a man and there is no one to see whether he shirks when he has no friends to share his risks that i should think would be the time when fear would twist a mans bowels i do not know said max all i am sure of is that luck comes your way and not mine tomorrow you march into st denis geoffrey faversham marched down at daybreak and formally occupied the quarter the aidedecamps calculations were confirmed there were at the least french soldiers crowded in the district geoffreys discretion warned against any foolish effort to disarm them he simply ignored their chassepts and bulging pouches and searched the barracks which the germans were to occupy from floor to ceiling late in the afternoon he was able to assure himself that his duty was ended he billeted his men and inquired whether there was a hotel where he could sleep the night a french sergeant led him through the streets to an inn which matched in every detail of its appearance that dingy quarter of the town the plaster was peeling from its walls the window panes were broken and in the upper storey and the roof there were yawning jagged holes where the prussian shells had struck in the dusk the building had a strangely mean and sordid look it recalled to favershams mind the inns in the novels of the elder dumas and acquired thus something of their sinister suggestions in the eager and arduous search of the day he had forgotten these apprehensions to which he had given voice by the camp fire they now returned to him with the relaxation of his vigilance he looked up at the forbidding house i wonder he said to himself he was met in the hall by a little obsequious man who was full of apologies for the disorder of his hostelry he opened a door into a large and dusty room i will do my best monsieur said he but food is not yet plentiful in paris in the centre of the room was a large mahogany table surrounded by chairs the landlord began to polish the table with his napkin we had an ordinary sir every day before the war broke out but most cheerful every chair had its regular occupant there were certain jokes too which every day were repeated ah but it was like home however all is changed as you see it has not been safe to sit in this room for many a long month faversham unstrapped his sword and revolver from his belt and laid them on the table i saw that your house had unfortunately suffered suffered said the garrulous little man it is ruined sir and its master with it ah war it is a fine thing no doubt for you young gentlemen but for me i have lived in a cellar sir under the ground ever since your guns first woke us from our sleep look i will show you he went out from the diningroom into the hall and from the hall into the street faversham followed him there was a wooden trap in the pavement close by the wall with an iron ring the landlord pulled at the ring and raised the trap disclosing a narrow flight of stone steps faversham bent forward and peered down into a dark cellar yes it is there that i have lived come down sir and see for yourself and the landlord moved down a couple of steps faversham drew back at once the landlord turned to him but there is nothing to fear sir he said with a deprecatory smile faversham coloured to the roots of his hair of course there is nothing said he and he followed the landlord the cellar was only lighted by the trapdoor and at first faversham coming out of the daylight could distinguish nothing at all he stood however with his back to the light and in a little he began to see a little trucklebed with a patchwork counterpane stood at the end the floor was merely hard earth the furniture consisted of a stove a stool and a small deal table and as faversham took in the poverty of this underground habitation he suddenly found himself in darkness again the explanation came to him at once the entrance to the cellar had been blocked from the light yet he had heard no sound except the footsteps of people in the street above his head he turned and faced the stair steps as he did so the light streamed down again the obstruction had been removed and that obstruction had not been the trapdoor as faversham had suspected but merely the body of some inquisitive passerby he recognised this with relief and immediately heard voices speaking together and as it seemed to him in lowered tones a sword rattled on the pavement the entrance was again darkened but faversham had just time to see that the man who stooped down wore the buttons of a uniform and a soldiers kepi he kept quite still holding his breath while the man peered down into the cellar he remembered with a throb of hope that he had himself been unable to distinguish a thing in the gloom and then the landlord knocked against the table and spoke aloud at once the man at the head of the steps stood up faversham heard him cry out in french they are here and he detected a note of exultation in the cry at the same moment a picture flashed before his eyes the picture of that dusty desolate diningroom up the steps and of a long table surrounded by chairs upon which lay a sword and a revolver his sword his revolver he had dismissed his sixty soldiers he was alone this is a trap he blurted out but sir i do not understand began the landlord but faversham cut him short with a whispered command for silence the cellar darkened again and the sound of boots rang upon the stone steps a rifle besides clanged as it struck against the wall the french soldiers were descending faversham counted them by the light which escaped past their legs there were three the landlord kept the silence which had been enjoined upon him but he fancied in the darkness that he heard some ones teeth chattering the frenchmen descended into the cellar and stood barring the steps their leader spoke i have the honour to address the prussian officer in command of st denis the frenchman got no reply whatever to his words but he seemed to hear some one sharply draw in a breath he spoke again into the darkness for it was now impossible for any one of the five men in the cellar to see a hands breadth beyond his face i am the captain plessy of mon vandons division i have the honour to address the prussian officer this time he received an answer quietly spoken yet with an inexplicable note of resignation i am lieutenant faversham in command of st denis captain plessy stepped immediately forward and bowed now as he dipped his shoulders in the bow a gleam of light struck over his head into the cellar and he could not be sure but it seemed to him that he saw a man suddenly raise his arm as if to ward off a blow captain plessy continued i ask lieutenant faversham for permission for myself and my two officers to sleep tonight at this hotel and now he very distinctly heard a long irrepressible sigh of relief lieutenant faversham gave him the permission he desired in a cordial polite way moreover he added an invitation your name captain plessy is well known to me as to all on both sides who have served in this campaign and to many more who have not i beg that you and your officers will favour me with your company at dinner captain plessy accepted the invitation and was pleased to deprecate the lieutenants high opinion of his merits but his achievement none the less had been of a redoubtable character he had broken through the lines about metz and had ridden across france into paris without a single companion in the sorties from that beleaguered town he had successively distinguished himself by his fearless audacity his name and reputation had travelled far as lieutenant faversham was that evening to learn but captain plessy for the moment was all for making little of his renown such small exploits should be expected from a soldier one brave man may say that to another is it not so and still not be thought to be angling for praise and captain plessy went up the steps wondering who it was that had drawn the long sharp breath of suspense and uttered the long sigh of immense relief the landlord or lieutenant faversham captain plessy had not been in the cellar at the time when the landlord had seemed to hear the chatter of a mans teeth the dinner was not a pronounced success in spite of favershams avoidance of any awkward topic they sat at the long table in the big desolate and shabby room lighted only by a couple of tallow candles set up in their candlesticks upon the cloth and the two junior officers maintained an air of chilly reserve and seldom spoke except when politeness compelled them faversham himself was absorbed the burden of entertainment fell upon captain plessy he strove nobly he told stories he drank a health to the camaraderie of arms he drew one after the other of his companions into an interchange of words if not of sympathies but the strain told on him visibly towards the end of the dinner his champagne glass had been constantly refilled his face was now a trifle overflushed his eyes beyond nature bright and he loosened the belt about his waist and at a moment when faversham was not looking the throat buttons of his tunic moreover while up till now he had deprecated any allusions to his reputation he now began to talk of it himself and in a particularly odious way a reputation lieutenant it has its advantages and he blew a kiss with his fingers into the air to designate the sort of advantages to which he referred then he leaned on one side to avoid the candle between faversham and himself you are english my commandant he asked my mother was german replied faversham but you are english yourself now have you ever met in england a certain miss marian beveridge and his leer was the most disagreeable thing that faversham ever remembered to have set eyes upon no he answered shortly and you have not heard of her no ah captain plessy leaned back in his chair and filled his glass lieutenant favershams tone was not that of a man inviting confidence but the captains brains were more than a little fuddled he repeated the name over to himself once or twice with the chuckle which asks for questions and since the questions did not come he must needs proceed of his own accord but i must cross to england myself i must see this miss marian beveridge ah but your english girls are strange name of heaven they are very strange lieutenant faversham made a movement the captain was his guest he was bound to save him if he could from a breach of manners and saw no way but this of breaking up the party captain plessy however was too quick for him he lifted his hand to his breast you wish for something to smoke it is true we have forgotten to smoke but i have my cigarettes and i beg you to try them the tobacco i think is good and you will be saved the trouble of moving he opened the case and reached it over to faversham but as faversham with a word of thanks took a cigarette the captain upset the case as though by inadvertence there fell out upon the table under favershams eyes not merely the cigarettes but some of the captains visitingcards and a letter the letter was addressed to captain plessy in a firm character but it was plainly the writing of a woman faversham picked it up and at once handed it back to plessy ah said plessy with a start of surprise was the letter indeed in the case and he fondled it in his hands and finally kissed it with the upturned eyes of a cheap opera singer a pigeon sir flew with it into paris happy pigeon that could be the bearer of such sweet messages he took out the letter from the envelope and read a line or two with a sigh and another line or two with a laugh but your english girls are strange he said again here is an instance an example fallen by accident from my cigarettecase m le commandant i will read it to you that you may see how strange they are one of plessys subalterns extended his hand and laid it on his sleeve plessy turned upon him angrily and the subaltern withdrew his hand i will read it to you he said again to faversham faversham did not protest nor did he now make any effort to move but his face grew pale he shivered once or twice his eyes seemed to be taking the measure of plessys strength his brain to be calculating upon his prowess the sweat began to gather upon his forehead of these signs however plessy took no note he had reached however inartistically the point at which he had been aiming he was no longer to be baulked of reading his letter he read it through to the end and faversham listened to the end it told its own story it was the letter of a girl who wrote in a frank impulse of admiration to a man whom she did not know there was nowhere a trace of coquetry nowhere the expression of a single sentimentality its tone was pure friendliness it was the work of a quite innocent girl who because she knew the man to whom she wrote to be brave therefore believed him to be honourable she expressed her trust in the very last words you will not of course show this letter to any one in the world but i wrong you even by mentioning such an impossibility but you have shown it said faversham his face was now grown of an extraordinary pallor his lips twitched as he spoke and his fingers worked in a nervous uneasy manner upon the tablecloth captain plessy was in far too complacent a mood to notice such trifles his vanity was satisfied the world was a rosy mist with a sparkle of champagne and he answered lightly as he unfastened another button of his tunic no my friend i have not shown it i keep the ladys wish you have read it aloud it is the same thing pardon me had i shown the letter i should have shown the name and that would have been a dishonour of which a gallant man is incapable is it not so i read it and i did not read the name but you took pains captain plessy that we should know the name before you read the letter i did i mention a name exclaimed plessy with an air of concern and a smile upon his mouth which gave the lie to the concern ah yes a long while ago but did i say it was the name of the lady who had written the letter indeed no you make a slight mistake my friend i bear no malice for it believe me upon my heart no after a dinner and a little bottle of champagne there is nothing more pardonable but i will tell you why i read the letter if you please said faversham and the gravity of his tone struck upon his companion suddenly as something unexpected and noteworthy plessy drew himself together and for the first time took stock of his host as of a possible adversary he remarked the agitation of his face the beads of perspiration upon his forehead the restless fingers and beyond all these a certain hunted look in the eyes with which his experience had made him familiar he nodded his head once or twice slowly as though he were coming to a definite conclusion about faversham then he sat bolt upright ah said he with a laugh i can answer a question which puzzled me a little this afternoon and he sank back again in his chair with an easy confidence and puffed the smoke of his cigarette from his mouth faversham was not sufficiently composed to consider the meaning of plessys remark he put it aside from his thoughts as an evasion you were to tell me i think why you read the letter certainly answered plessy he twirled his moustache his voice had lost its suavity and had taken on an accent of almost contemptuous raillery he even winked at his two brother officers he was beginning to play with faversham i read the letter to illustrate how strange how very strange are your english girls here is one of them who writes to me i am grateful oh beyond words but i think to myself what a different thing the letter would be if it had been written by a frenchwoman there would have been some hints nothing definite you understand but a suggestion a delicate provoking suggestion of herself like a perfume to sting one into a desire for a nearer acquaintance she would delicately and without any appearance of intention have permitted me to know her colour perhaps her height perhaps even to catch an elusive glimpse of her face very likely a silk thread of hair would have been left inadvertently clinging to a sheet of the paper she would sketch perhaps her home and speak remorsefully of her boldness in writing oh but i can imagine the letter full of pretty subtleties alluring from its omissions a vexation and a delight from end to end but this my friend he tossed the letter carelessly upon the tablecloth i am grateful from the bottom of my heart but it has no art at once geoffrey favershams hand reached out and closed upon the letter you have told me why you have read it aloud yes said plessy a little disconcerted by the quickness of favershams movement now i will tell you why i allowed you to read it to the end i was of the same mind as that english girl whose name we both know i could not believe that a man brave as i knew you to be could outside his bravery be so contemptible the words were brought out with a distinct effort none the less they were distinctly spoken a startled exclamation broke from the two subalterns plessy commenced to bluster sir do i understand you and he saw faversham standing above him in a quiver of excitement you will hold your tongue captain plessy until i have finished i allowed you to read the letter never thinking but that some pang of forgotten honour would paralyse your tongue you read it to the end you complain there is no art in it that it has no delicate provocations such as your own countrywomen would not fail to use it should be the more sacred on that account and i am glad to believe that you misjudge your country women captain plessy i acknowledge that as you read out that letter with its simple friendly expression of gratitude for the spectacle of a brave man i envied you heartily i would have been very proud to have received it i would have much liked to know that some deed which i had done had made the world for a moment brighter to some one a long way off with whom i was not acquainted captain plessy i shall not allow you to keep this letter you shall not read it aloud again faversham thrust the letter into the flame of the candle which stood between plessy and himself plessy sprang up and blew the candle out but little colourless flames were already licking along the envelope faversham held the letter downwards by a corner and the colourless flame flickered up into a tongue of yellow the paper charred and curled in the track of the flames the flames leapt to favershams fingers he dropped the burning letter on the floor and crushed it with his foot then he looked at plessy and waited he was as white as the tablecloth his dark eyes seemed to have sunk into his head and burned unnaturally bright every nerve in his body seemed to be twitching he looked very like the young boy who used to sit at the dinnertable on crimean nights and listen in a quiver to the appalling stories of his fathers guests as he had been silent then so he was silent now he waited for captain plessy to speak captain plessy however was in no hurry to begin he had completely lost his air of contemptuous raillery he was measuring faversham warily with the eyes of a connoisseur you have insulted me he said abruptly and he heard again that indrawing of the breath which he had remarked that afternoon in the cellar he also heard faversham speak immediately after he had drawn the breath there are reparations for insults said faversham captain plessy bowed he was now almost as sober as when he had sat down to his dinner we will choose a time and place said he there can be no better time than now suddenly cried faversham no better place than this you have two friends of whom with your leave i will borrow one we have a large room and a candle apiece to fight by tomorrow my duties begin again we will fight tonight captain plessy tonight and he leaned forward almost feverishly his words had almost the accent of a prayer the two subalterns rose from their chairs but plessy motioned them to keep still then he seized the candle which he had himself blown out lighted it from the candle at the far end of the table and held it up above his head so that the light fell clearly upon favershams face he stood looking at faversham for an appreciable time then he said quietly i will not fight you tonight one of the subalterns started up the other merely turned his head towards plessy but both stared at their captain with an unfeigned astonishment and an unfeigned disappointment faversham continued to plead but you must tonight for tomorrow you cannot tonight i am alone here tonight i give orders tomorrow i receive them you have your sword at your side tonight will you be wearing it tomorrow i pray you gentlemen to help me he said turning to the subalterns and he began to push the heavy table from the centre of the room i will not fight you tonight lieutenant captain plessy replied and why asked faversham ceasing from his work he made a gesture which had more of despair than of impatience captain plessy gave his reason it rang false to every man in the room and indeed he made no attempt to give to it any appearance of sincerity it was a deliberate excuse and not his reason because you are the prussian officer in command and the prussian troops march into st denis tomorrow suppose that i kill you what sort of penalty should i suffer at their hands none exclaimed faversham we can draw up an account of the quarrel here now look here is paper and ink and as luck will have it a pen that will write i will write an account with my own hand and the four of us can sign it besides if you kill me you can escape into paris i will not fight you tonight said captain plessy and he set down the candle upon the table then with an elaborate correctness he drew his sword from its scabbard and offered the handle of it to faversham lieutenant you are in command of st denis i am your prisoner of war faversham stood for a moment or two with his hands clenched the light had gone out of his face i have no authority to make prisoners he said he took up one of the candles gazed at his guest in perplexity you have not given me your real reason captain plessy he said captain plessy did not answer a word goodnight gentlemen said faversham and captain plessy bowed deeply as faversham left the room a silence of some duration followed upon the closing of the door the two subalterns were as perplexed as faversham to account for their heros conduct they sat dumb and displeased plessy stood for a moment thoughtfully then he made a gesture with his hands as though to brush the whole incident from his mind and taking a cigarette from his case proceeded to light it at the candle as he stooped to the flame he noticed the glum countenances of his brotherofficers and laughed carelessly you are not pleased with me my friends said he as he threw himself on to a couch which stood against the wall opposite to his companions you think i did not speak the truth when i gave the reason of my refusal well you are right i will give you the real reason why i would not fight it is very simple i do not wish to be killed i know these whitefaced trembling men there are no men more terrible they may run away but if they do not if they string themselves to the point of action take the word of a soldier older than yourselves then is the time to climb trees tomorrow i would very likely kill our young friend he would have had time to think to picture to himself the little point of steel glittering towards his heart but tonight he would assuredly have killed me but as i say i do not wish to be killed you are satisfied it appeared that they were not they sat with all the appearances of discontent they had no words for captain plessy captain plessy accordingly rose lightly from his seat ah said he my good friend the lieutenant has after all left me my sword the table too is already pushed sufficiently on one side there is only one candle to be sure but it will serve you are not satisfied gentlemen then but both subalterns now hastened to assure captain plessy that they considered his conduct had been entirely justified the deserter lieutenant fevrier of the th regiment which belonged to the first brigade of the first division of the army of the rhine was summoned to the belletonge farm just as it was getting dusk the lieutenant hurried thither for the belletonge farm opposite the woods of colombey was the headquarters of the general of his division i have been instructed said general montaudon to select an officer for a special duty i have selected you now for days lieutenant fevriers duties had begun and ended with him driving the soldiers of his company from eating unripe fruit and here unexpectedly he was chosen from all the officers of his division for a particular exploit the lieutenant trembled with emotion my general he cried the general himself was moved what your task will be he continued i do not known you will go at once to the mareschals headquarters when the chief of the staff general jarras will inform you lieutenant fevrier went immediately up to metz his division was entrenched on the right bank of the mosel and beyond the forts so that it was dark before he passed through the gates he had never once been in metz before he had grown used to the monotony of camps he had expected shuttered windows and deserted roads and so the aspect of the town amazed him beyond measure instead of a town besieged it seemed a town during a fairing there were railway carriages it is true in the place royale doing duty as hospitals the provision shops too were bare and there were no horses visible but on the other hand everywhere was a blaze of light and a bustle of people coming and going upon the footpaths the cafs glittered and rang with noise here one little fat burgher was shouting that the townguard was worth all the redlegs in the trenches another as loudly was criticising the tactics of bazaine and comparing him for his invisibility to a pasha in his seraglio while a third sprang upon a table and announced fresh victories an army was already on the way from paris to relieve metz only yesterday macmahon had defeated the prussians any moment he might be expected from the ardennes nor were they only civilians who shouted and complained lieutenant fevrier saw captains majors and even generals who had left their entrenchments to fight the siege their own way with dominoes upon the marble tables of the cabarets my poor france he said to himself and a passerby overhearing him answered true monsieur ah but if we had a man at metz lieutenant fevrier turned his back upon the speaker and walked on he at all events would not join in the criticisms it was just he reflected because he had avoided the cafs of metz that he was singled out for special distinction and he fell to wondering what work it was he had to do that night was it to surprise a fieldwatch or to spike a battery or to capture a convoy lieutenant fevrier raised his head for any exploit in the world he was ready general jarras was writing at a table when fevrier was admitted to his office the chief of the staff inclined his lampshade so that the light fell full upon fevriers face and the action caused the lieutenant to rejoice so much care in the choice of the officer meant so much more important a duty the general montaudon tells me said jarras that you are an obedient soldier obedience my general is the soldiers first lesson that explains to me why it is first forgotten answered jarras drily then his voice became sharp and curt you will choose fifty men you will pick them carefully they shall be the best soldiers in the regiment said fevrier no the worst lieutenant fevrier was puzzled when dangers were to be encountered when audacity was needed one requires the best soldiers that was obvious unless the mission meant annihilation that thought came to fevrier and remembering the cafs and the officers dishonouring their uniforms he drew himself up proudly and saluted already he saw his dead body recovered from the enemy and borne to the grave beneath a tricolour he heard the lamentations of his friends and the firing of the platoon he saw general montaudon in tears he was shaken with emotion but jarrass next words fell upon him like cold water you will parade your fifty men unarmed you will march out of the lines and tomorrow morning as soon as it is light enough for the prussians to see you come unarmed you will desert to them there are too many mouths to feed in metza footnote a see the daily news war correspondence the lieutenant had it on his lips to shout then why not lead us out to die but he kept silence he could have flung his kepi in the generals face but he saluted he went out again into the streets and among the lighted cafs and reeled like a drunken man thinking confusedly of many things that he had a mother in paris who might hear of his desertion before she heard of its explanation that it was right to claim obedience but lche to exact dishonour but chiefly and above all that if he had been wise and had made light of his duty and had come up to metz to rearrange the campaign with dominoes on the marbletables he would not have been specially selected for ignominy it was true it needed an obedient officer to desert and so laughing aloud he reeled blindly down to the gates of metz and it happened that just by the gates a civilian looked after him and shrugging his shoulders remarked ah but if we had a man at metz from metz lieutenant fevrier ran the night air struck cool upon him and he ran and stumbled and fell and picked himself up and ran again until he reached the belletonge farm the general he cried and so to the general a mudplastered figure with a white tormented face was admitted what is it asked montaudon what will this say lieutenant fevrier stood with the palms of his hands extended speechless like an animal in pain then he suddenly burst into tears and wept and told of the fine plan to diminish the demands upon the commissariat courage my old one said the general i had a fear of this you are not alone other officers in other divisions have the same hard duty and there was no inflection in the voice to tell fevrier what his general thought of the duty but a hand was laid soothingly upon his shoulder and that told him he took heart to whisper that he had a mother in paris i will write to her said montaudon she will be proud when she receives the letter then lieutenant fevrier being french took the generals hand and kissed it and the general being french felt his throat fill with tears fevrier left the headquarters paraded his men laid his sword and revolver on the ground and ordered his fifty to pile their arms then he made them a speech a very short speech but it cost him much to make it in an even voice my braves said he my fellowsoldiers it is easy to fight for ones country it is not difficult to die for it but the supreme test of patriotism is willingly to suffer shame for it that test your country now claims of you attention march for the last time he exchanged a password with a french sentinel and tramped out into the belt of ground between the french outposts and the prussian fieldwatch now in this belt there stood a little village which fevrier had held with skill and honour all the two days of the battle of noisseville doubtless that recollection had something to do with his choice of the village for in his martyrdom of shame he had fallen to wonder whether after all he had not deserved it and any reassurance such as the gaping housewalls of vaudre would bring to him was eagerly welcomed there was another reason however in the position of the village it stood in an abrupt valley at the foot of a steep vinehill on the summit and which was the prussian forepost the prussian fieldwatch would be even nearer to vaudre and dispersed amongst the vines so he could get his ignominious work over quickly in the morning the village would provide too safe quarters for the night since it was well within range of the heavy guns in fort st julien and the prussians on that account were unable to hold it he led his fifty soldiers then northwestward from his camp skirted the bois de grimont and marched into the village the night was dark and the sky so overhung with clouds that not a star was visible the one street of vaudre was absolutely silent the glimmering white cottages showed their black rents on either side but never the light of a candle behind any shutter lieutenant fevrier left his men at the western or frenchward end of the street and went forward alone the doors of the houses stood open the path was encumbered with the wreckage of their contents and every now and then he smelt a whiff of paraffin as though lamps had been broken or cans overset vaudre had been looted but there were no prussians now in the village he made sure of this by walking as far as the large house at the head of the village then he went back to his men and led them forward until he reached the general shop which every village has it is not likely he said that we shall find even the makeshift of a supper but courage my friends let us try he could not have eaten a crust himself but it had become an instinct with him to anticipate the needs of his privates and he acted from habit they crowded into the shop one man shut the door fevrier lighted a match and disclosed by its light stavedin barrels empty cannisters broken boxes fragments of lemonade bottles but of food not so much as a stale biscuit go upstairs and search they went and returned emptyhanded we have found nothing monsieur said they but i have replied fevrier and striking another match he held up what he had found dirty and crumpled in a corner of the shop it was a little tricolour flag of painted linen upon a bamboo stick a childs cheap and gaudy toy but fevrier held it up solemnly and of the fifty deserters no one laughed the flag of the patrie said fevrier and with one accord the deserters uncovered the match burned down to fevriers fingers he dropped it and trod upon it and there was a moments absolute stillness then in the darkness a ringing voice leapt out vive la france it was not the lieutenants voice but the voice of a peasant from the south of the loire one of the deserters ah but that is fine that cry said fevrier he could have embraced that private on both cheeks there was love in that cry pain as well it could not be otherwise but above all a very passion of confidence again said fevrier and this time all his men took it up shouting it out exultantly the little ruined shop in itself a contradiction of the cry rang out and clattered with the noise until it seemed to fevrier that it must surely pierce across the country into metz and pluck the mareschal in his headquarters from his diffidence but they were only fifty deserters in a deserted village lost in the darkness and more likely to be overheard by the prussian sentries than by any of their own blood it was fevrier who first saw the danger of their ebullition he cut it short by ordering them to seek quarters where they could sleep until daybreak for himself he thrust the little toy flag in his breast and walked forward to the larger house at the end of the village beneath the vinehill and as he walked again the smell of paraffin was forced upon his nostrils he walked more slowly that odour of paraffin began to seem remarkable the looting of the village had not occurred today for there had been thick dust about the general shop but the paraffin had surely been freshly spilt or the odour would have evaporated lieutenant fevrier walked on thinking this over he found the broken door of his house and still thinking it over mounted the stairs there was a door fronting the stairs he felt for the handle and opened it and from a corner of the room a voice challenged him in german fevrier was fairly startled there were germans in the village after all he explained to himself now the smell of paraffin meanwhile he did not answer neither did he move neither did he hear any movement he had forgotten for the moment that he was a deserter and he stood holding his breath and listening there was a tiny window opposite to the door but it only declared itself a window it gave no light and illusions came to lieutenant fevrier such as will come to the bravest man so long as he listens hard enough in the dark illusions of stealthy footsteps on the floor of hands scraping and feeling along the walls of a mans breathing upon his neck of many infinitesimal noises and movements close by the challenge was repeated and fevrier remembered his orders i am lieutenant fevrier of montaudons division you are alone fevrier now distinguished that the voice came from the righthand corner of the room and that it was faint i have fifty men with me we are deserters he blurted out and unarmed there followed silence and a long silence then the voice spoke again but in french and the french of a native my friend your voice is not the voice of a deserter there is too much humiliation in it come to my bedside here i spoke in german expecting germans but i am the cur of vaudre why are you deserters fevrier had expected a scornful order to marshal his men as prisoners the extraordinary gentleness of the curs voice almost overcame him he walked across to the bedside and told his story the cur basely heard him out it is right to obey said he but here you can obey and disobey you can relieve metz of your appetites my friend but you need not desert the cur reached up and drawing fevrier down laid a hand upon his head i consecrate you to the service of your country do you understand fevrier leaned his mouth towards the curs ear the prussians are coming tonight to burn the village yes they came at dusk just at the moment in fact when fevrier had been summoned to metz the prussians had crept down into vaudre and had been scared back to their rpli by a false alarm but they will come back you may be sure said the cur and raising himself upon his elbow he said in a voice of suspense listen fevrier went to the window and opened it it faced the hillside but no sounds came through it beyond the natural murmurs of the night the cur sank back after the fight here there were dead soldiers in the streets french soldiers and so french chassepts ah my friend the prussians have found out which is the better rifle the chassept or the needle gun after your retreat they came down the hill for those chassepts they could not find one they searched every house they came here and questioned me finally they caught one of the villagers hiding in a field and he was afraid and he told where the rifles had been buried the prussians dug for them and the hole was empty they believe they are still hidden somewhere in the village they fancy too that there are secret stores of food so they mean to burn the houses to the ground they did not know that i was here this afternoon i would have come into the french lines had it been possible but i am tied here to my bed no doubt god had sent you to me you and your fifty men you need not desert you can make your last stand here for france and perish cried fevrier caught up from the depths of his humiliation as frenchmen should arms in hand then his voice dropped again but we have no arms the cur shook the lieutenants arm gently did i not tell you the chassepts were not found and why because too many knew where they were hidden because out of that many i feared there might be one to betray there is always a judas so i got one man whom i knew and he dug them up and hid them afresh where father the question was put with a feverish eagerness it seemed to the cur with an eagerness too feverish he drew his hand his whole body away you have matches light one he said in a startled voice but the window light one every moment of time was now of value fevrier took the risk and lit the match shading it from the window so far as he could with his hand that will do fevrier blew out the light the cur had seen him his uniform and his features he too had seen the cur had noticed his thin emaciated face and the eyes staring out of it feverishly bright and preternaturally large shall i tell you your malady father he said gently it is starvation what will you my son i am alone there is not a crust from one end of vaudre to the other you cannot help me help france go to the church stand with your back to the door turn left and advance straight to the churchyard wall you will find a new grave there the rifles in the grave quick there is a spade in the tower quick the rifles are wrapped from the damp the cartridges too quick quick fevrier hurried downstairs roused three of his soldiers bade one of them go from house to house and bring the soldiers in silence to the churchyard and with the others he went thither himself in groups of two and three the men crept through the street and gathered about the grave it was already open the spade was driven hard and quick deeper and deeper and at last rang upon metal there were seventy chassepts complete with bayonets and ammunition fiftyone were handed out the remaining nineteen were hastily covered in again fevrier was immeasurably cheered to notice his men clutch at their weapons and fondle them hold them to their shoulders taking aim and work the breechblocks it is like meeting old friends is it not my children or rather new sweethearts said he come the prussians may advance from the brasserie at lanvallier from servigny from montay or from noisseville straight down the hill the last direction is the most likely but we must make no mistake ten men will watch on the lanvallier road ten on the servigny ten on the montay twenty will follow me march an hour ago lieutenant fevrier was in command of fifty men who slouched along with their hands in their pockets robbed even of selfrespect now he had fifty armed and disciplined soldiers men alert and inspired so much difference a chassept apiece had made lieutenant fevrier was moved to the conception of another plan and to prepare the way for its execution he left his twenty men in a house at the prussian end of vaudre and himself crept in among the vines and up the hill somewhere near to him would be the sentries of the fieldwatch he went down upon his hands and knees and crawled parting the vine leaves that the swish of them might not betray him in a little knoll high above his head he heard the cracking of wood the sound of men stumbling the prussians were coming down to vaudre he lay flat upon the ground waiting and waiting and the sounds grew louder and approached at last he heard that for which he waited the challenge of the fieldwatch the answer of the burningparty it came down to him quite clearly through the windless air sadowa lieutenant fevrier turned about chuckling it seemed that in some respects the world after all was not going so ill with him that night he crawled downwards as quickly as he could but it was now more than even inspiration that he should not be detected he dared not stand up and run he must still keep upon his hands and knees his arms so ached that he was forced now and then to stop and lie prone to give them ease he was soaked through and through with perspiration his blood hammered at his temples he felt his spine weaken as though the marrow had melted into water and his heart throbbed until the effort to breathe was a pain but he reached the bottom of the hill he got refuge amongst his men he even had time to give his orders before the tread of the first prussian was heard in the street they will make for the other end of vaudre they will give the village first as near to the french lines as it reaches and light the rest as they retreat let them go forward we will cut them off and remember the bayonet a shot will bring the prussians down in force it will bring the french too so there is just the chance we may find the enemy as silent as ourselves but the plan was to undergo alteration for as lieutenant fevrier ended the prussians marched in single file into the street and halted fevrier from the corner within his doorway counted them there were twentythree in all well he had twenty besides himself and the advantage of the surprise and thirty more upon the other roads for whom however he had other work in mind the officer in command of the prussians carried a dark lantern and he now turned the slide so that the light shone out his men fell out of their rank some to make a cursory search others to sprinkle yet more paraffin one man came close to fevriers doorway and even looked in but he saw nothing though fevrier was within six feet of him holding his breath then the officer closed his lantern the men reformed and marched on but they left behind with lieutenant fevrier an idea he thought it quickly over it pleased him it was feasible and there was comedy in it lieutenant fevrier laughed again his spirits were rising and the world was not after all going so ill with him he had noticed by the lantern light that the prussians had not reformed in the same order they were in single file again but the man who marched last before the halt did not march last after it each soldier as he came up fell in in the rear of the file now fevrier had in the darkness experienced some difficulty in counting the number of prussians although he had strained his eyes to that end he whispered accordingly some brief instructions to his men he sent a message to the ten on the servigny road and when the prussians marched on after their second halt lieutenant fevrier and two frenchmen fell in behind them the same procedure was followed at the next halt and at the next so that when the prussians reached the frenchward end of vaudre there were twentythree prussians and ten frenchmen in the file to fevriers thinking it was sufficiently comic there was something artistic about it too fevrier was pleased but he had not counted on the quick prussian step to which his soldiers were unaccustomed at the fourth halt the officer moved unsuspiciously first on one side of the street then on the other but gave no order to his men to fall out it seemed that he had forgotten until he came suddenly running down the file and flashed his lantern into fevriers face he had been secretly counting his men the french he cried load the one word quite compensated fevrier for the detection the germans had come down into vaudre with their rifles unloaded lest an accidental discharge should betray their neighbourhood to the french load cried the german and slipping back he tugged at the revolver in his belt but before he could draw it out fevrier dashed his bayonet through the lantern and hung it on the officers heart he whistled and his other ten men came running down the street vorwarts shouted fevrier derisively immer vorwarts the prussians surprised and ignorant how many they had to face fell back in disorder against a housewall the french soldiers dashed at them in the darkness engaging them so that not a man had the chance to load that little fight in the dark street between the whiteruined cottages made fevriers blood dance courage he cried the paraffin the combatants were well matched and it was handtohand and bayonettobayonet fevrier loved his enemies at that moment it even occurred to him that it was worth while to have deserted after the sense of disgrace the prospect of imprisonment and dishonour it was all wonderful to him the feel of the thick coat yielding to the bayonet point the fatigue of the beaten opponent the vigour of the new one the feeling of injury and unfairness when a prussian he had wounded dropped in falling the butt of a rifle upon his toes once he cried voila pour la patrie but for the rest he fought in silence as did the others having other uses for their breath all that could be heard was a loud and laborious panting as of wrestlers in a match the clang of rifle crossing rifle the rattle of bayonet guarding bayonet and now and then a groan and a heavy fall one prussian escaped and ran but the ten who had been stationed on the servigny road were now guarding the entrance from noisseville fevrier had no fears of him he pressed upon a new man drove him against the wall and the man shouted in despair a moi you philippe exclaimed fevrier that was a timely cry and he sprang back there were six men standing and the six saluted fevrier they were all frenchmen fevrier mopped his forehead but that was fine said he though whats to come will be still better oh but we will make this night memorable to our friends they shall talk of us by their firesides when they are grown old and france has had many years of peace we shall not hear but they will talk of us the deserters from metz lieutenant fevrier in a word was exalted and had lost his sense of proportion he did not however relax his activity he sent off the six to gather the rest of his contingent he made an examination of the prussians and found that sixteen had been killed outright and eight were lying wounded he removed their rifles and ammunition out of reach and from dead and wounded alike took the coats and caps to the wounded he gave instead french uniforms and then bidding twentythree of his soldiers don the prussian caps and coats he snatched a moment wherein to run to the cur it is over said he the prussians will not burn vaudre tonight and he jumped down the stairs again without waiting for any response in the street he put on the cap and coat of the prussian officer buckled the sword about his waist and thrust the revolver into his belt he had now twentythree men who at night might pass for prussians and thirteen others to these thirteen he gave general instructions they were to spread out on the right and left and make their way singly up through the vines and past the fieldwatch if they could without risk of detection they were to join him high up on the slope and opposite to the bonfire which would be burning at the rpli his twentythree he led boldly following as nearly as possible the track by which the prussians had descended the party trampled down the vinepoles brushed through the leaves and in a little while were challenged sadowa said fevrier in his best imitation of the german accent pass sadowa returned the sentry fevrier and his men filed upwards he halted some two hundred yards farther on and went down upon his knees the soldiers behind him copied his example they crept slowly and cautiously forward until the flames of the bonfire were visible through the screen of leaves until the faces of the officers about the bonfire could be read then fevrier stopped and whispered to the soldier next to him that soldier passed the whisper on and from a file the frenchmen crept into line fevrier had now nothing to do but to wait and he waited without trepidation or excitement the night from first to last had gone very well with him he could even think of mareschal bazaine without anger he waited for perhaps an hour watching the faces round the fire increase in number and grow troubled with anxiety the german officers talked in low tones staring through their nightglasses down the hill to catch the first leaping flame from the roofs of vaudre pushing forward their heads to listen for any alarm fevrier watched them with the amusement of a spectator in a play house he was fully aware that he was shortly to step upon the stage himself he was aware too that the play was to have a tragic ending meanwhile however here was very good comedy he had a frenchmans appreciation of the picturesque the dark night the glowing fire on the one broad level of grass the french soldiers hidden in the vines within a stones throw of the germans the germans looking unconsciously on over their heads for the return of those comrades who never would return lieutenant fevrier was the dramatist who had created this striking and artistic situation lieutenant fevrier could not but be pleased moreover there were better effects to follow one occurred to him at this very moment an admirable one he fumbled in his breast and took out the flag a minute later he saw the colonel of the forepost join the group hack nervously with his naked sword at a burning log and dispatch a subaltern down the hill to the fieldwatch the subaltern came crashing back through the vines fevrier did not need to hear his words in order to guess at his report it could only be that the prussian party had given the password and come safely back an hour since besides the colonels act was significant he sent four men at once in different directions and the rest of his soldiers he withdrew into the darkness behind the bonfire he did not follow them himself until he had picked up and tossed a fusee into the fire the fusee flared and spat and spurted and immediately it seemed to fevrier so short an interval of time was there that the countryside was alive with the hum of a stirring camp and the rattle of harnesschains as horses were yoked to guns for a third time that evening fevrier laughed softly the deserters had roused the prussian army round metz to the expectation of an attack in force he touched his neighbour on the shoulder one volley when i give the word then charge pass the order on and the word went along the line like a ripple across a pond he had hardly given it the fusee had barely ceased to sputter before a company doubled out on the open space behind the bonfire that company had barely formed up before another arrived to support it load as the prussian command was uttered fevrier was aware of a movement at his side the soldier next to him was taking aim fevrier reached out his hand and stopped the man fevrier was going to die in five minutes and meant to die chivalrously like a gentleman he waited until the german companies had loaded until they were ordered to advance and then he shouted fire the little flames shot out and crackled among the vines he saw gaps in the prussian ranks he saw the men waver surprised at the proximity of the attack charge he shouted and crashing through the few yards of shelter they burst out upon the rpli and across the open space to the prussian bayonets but not one of the number reached the bayonets fire shouted the prussian officer in his turn the volley flashed out the smoke cleared away and showed a little heap of men silent between the bonfire and the prussian ranks the prussians loaded again and stood ready waiting for the main attack the morning was just breaking they stood silent and motionless till the sky was flooded with light and the hills one after another came into view and the files of poplars were seen marching on the plains then the colonel approached the little heap a rifle caught his eye and he picked it up they are all mad said he forced to the point of the bayonet was a gaudy little linen tricolour flag the crossed gloves although you have not been near ronda for five years said the spanish commandant severely to dennis shere the face of the country has not changed you are certainly the most suitable officer i can select since i am told you are well acquainted with the neighbourhood you will ride therefore today to olvera and deliver this sealed letter to the officer commanding the temporary garrison there but it is not necessary that it should reach him before eleven at night so that you will still have an hour or two before you start in which you can renew your acquaintanceships as i can very well understand you are anxious to do dennis sheres reluctance however was now changed into alacrity for the road to olvera ran past the gates of that whitewalled straggling residenca where he had planned to spend this first evening that he was stationed at ronda on his way back from his colonels quarters he even avoided those squares and streets where he would be likely to meet with old acquaintances foreseeing their questions as to why he was now a spanish subject and wore the uniform of a captain of spanish cavalry and by seven oclock he was already riding through the plaza de toros upon his mission there however a familiar voice hailed him and turning about in his saddle he saw an old padre who had once gained a small prize for logic at the university of barcelona and who had since made his inferences and deductions an excuse for a great deal of inquisitiveness shere had no option but to stop he broke in however at once on the inevitable questions as to his uniform with the statement that he must be at olvera by eleven fifteen miles said the padre does it need four hours and a fresh horse to journey fifteen miles but i have friends to visit on the way and to give convincing details to an excuse which was plainly disbelieved shere added just this side of setenil i have friends the padre was still dissatisfied there is only one house just this side of setenil and esteban silvela i saw with my own eyes today in ronda he may well be home by now and it is not esteban whom i go to see not esteban exclaimed the padre then it will be his sister the seora christina said shere with a laugh at his companions persistency since the brother and sister live alone and it is not the brother why it will be the sister you argue still very closely padre the padre stood back a little from shere and stared then he said slyly and with the air of one who quotes all women are born tricksters those were rank words said shere composedly yet they were often spoken when you grew vines in the ronda valley then a crowd of men must know me for a fool a young man may make a mistake padre and exaggerate a disappointment besides i had not then seen the seora esteban i knew but she was a child and known to me only by name and then warmed by the pleasure in his old friends face he said i will tell you about it they walked on slowly side by side while shere who now that he had begun to confide was quite swept away bent over his saddle and told how after inheriting a modest fortune after wandering for three years from city to city he had at last come to paris and there at a carlist conversazione had heard the familiar name called from a doorway and had seen the unfamiliar face appear shere described christina she walked with the grace of a deer as though the floor beneath her foot had the spring of turf the blood was bright in her face her brown hair shone she was sweet with youth the suppleness of her body showed it and the steadiness of her great clear eyes she passed me he went on and the arrogance of what i used to think and say came sharp home to me like a pain i suppose that i stared it was an accident of course perhaps my face showed something of my trouble but just as she was opposite me her fan slipped through her fingers and clattered on the floor the padre was at a loss to understand sheres embarrassment in relating so small a matter well said he you picked up the fan and so no interrupted shere his embarrassment increased and he stammered out awkwardly just for the moment you see i began to wonder whether after all i had not been right before whether after all any woman would or could baulk herself of a fraction of any mans admiration supposing that it would only cost a trick to extort it and while i was wondering she herself stooped picked up the fan and goodhumouredly dropped me a curtsey for my lack of manners esteban presented me to her that evening there followed two magical months in paris and a june in london but esteban said the padre doubtfully i do not understand i know something of esteban silvela a lean man of plots and devices my friend do you know that esteban has not a groat the silvela fortunes and estate came from the mother and went to the daughter esteban is the seora christinas steward and her marriage would alter his position at the least did he not spoil the magic of the months in paris shere laughed aloud in assured confidence no indeed said he i did not know esteban was dependent on his sister but what difference would her marriage make esteban is my best friend for instance you questioned me about my uniform it is by estebans advice and help that i wear it indeed said the padre quickly tell me that june in london two years ago it was by the way the last time i saw the seora we three dined at the same house as the ladies rose from the table i said to christina quietly i want to speak to you tonight and she answered very simply and quietly with all my heart she was not so quiet however but that esteban overheard her he hitched his chair up to mine i asked him what my chances were and whether he would second them he was most cordial but he thought with his spaniards pride that i ought i use my words not his in some way to repair my insufficiency in station and the rest and he pointed out this way of the uniform i could not resist his argument i did not speak that night i took out my papers and became a spaniard with estebans help i secured a commission that was two years ago i have not seen her since nor have i written but i ride to her tonight with my two years silence and my two years service to prove the truth of what i say so you see i have reason to thank esteban and since they were now come to the edge of the town they parted company shere rode smartly down the slope of the hill the padre stood and watched him with a feeling of melancholy it was not merely that he distrusted esteban but he knew shere the cadet of an impoverished family who had come out from england to a small estate in the ronda valley which had belonged to his house since the days of the duke of wellington in spain he knew him for a man of tempests and extremes and as he thought of his ardent words and tones of his ready acceptance of estebans good faith of his description of christina he fell to wondering whether so sudden and violent a conversion from passionate cynic to passionate believer would not lack permanence there was that little instructive accident of the dropped fan even in the moment of conversion so small a thing had almost sufficed to dissuade shere shere however was quite untroubled so untroubled indeed that he even rode slowly that he might not waste the luxury of anticipating the welcome which his unexpected appearance would surely provoke he rode into the groves of almond and walnut trees and out again into a wild and stony country it was just growing dusk when he saw ahead of him the square white walls of the enclosure and the cluster of buildings within glimmering at the foot of a rugged hill the lights began to move in the windows as he approached and then a man suddenly appeared at his side on the roadway and whistled twice loudly as though he were calling his dog shere rode past the man and through the open gates into the courtyard there were three men lounging there and they came forward almost as if they had expected shere he gave his horse into their charge and impetuously mounted the flight of stone steps to the house a servant in readiness came forward at once and preceded shere along a gallery towards a door sheres impetuosity led him to outstep the servant he opened the door and so entered the room unannounced it was a long low room with a wainscot of dark walnut and a single lamp upon the table gave it shadows rather than light he had just time to notice that a girl and a man were bending over the table in the lamplight to recognise with a throb of the heart the play of the light upon the girls brown hair to understand that she was explaining something which she held in her hands and then esteban came quickly to him with a certain air of perplexity and a glance of inquiry towards the servant then he said of course of course you stopped and came in of your own accord of my own accord indeed said shere who was looking at christina instead of heeding estebans words his unexpected coming had certainly not missed its effect although it was not the effect which shere had desired there was to be sure a great deal of astonishment in her looks but there was also consternation and when she spoke it was in a numbed and absent way you are well we have not seen you this long while two years is it more than two years there have been changes said esteban we have had war and alas defeats yes i was in cuba said shere and the conversation dragged on impersonal and dull esteban talked continually with a forced heartiness christina barely spoke at all and then absently shere noticed that she had but lately come in for she still wore her hat and her gloves lay crossed on the table in the light of the lamp she moved restlessly about the room stopping now and then to give an ear to any chance noise in the courtyard and to glance alertly at the door so that shere understood that she was expecting another visitor and that he himself was in the way an inopportune intrusion it seemed was the sole outcome of the two years anticipations and utterly discouraged he rose from his chair on the instant however esteban signed to shere to remain and with a friendly smile himself made an excuse and left the room christina was now walking up and down one particular seam in the floor with as much care as if the seam was a tightrope and this exercise she continued shere moved over to the table and quite absently played with the gloves which lay there disarranging their position so that they no longer made a cross you remember that night in london said he and christina stopped for a second to say simply and without any suggestion that she was offended you should have spoken that night and then resumed her walk yes returned shere but i was always aware that i could not offer you your match and i found i thought quite suddenly that evening a way to make my insufficiency less insufficient less insufficient by a strip of brass upon your shoulder she exclaimed passionately she came and stood opposite to him well that strip of brass stops us both it stops my ears it must stop your lips too where did we meet first in paris go on at a carlist and shere broke off and took a step towards her oh he exclaimed i never thought of it i imagined you went there to laugh as i did does one laugh at ones creed she cried violently and shere with a helpless gesture of the hands sat down in a chair esteban had fooled him and why the padre had shown shere that afternoon esteban had fooled him irreparably it did not need a glance at christina as she stood facing him to convince him of that there was no anger against him he noticed in her face but on the contrary a great friendliness and pity but he knew her at that moment her looks might soften but not her resolve she was heartwhole a carlist carlism was her creed and her creed would be more than a creed it would be a passion too so it was not to persuade her but rather in acknowledgment that he said and one does not change ones creed no she answered and suggested but in a doubtful voice but one can put off ones uniform shere stood up neither can one do that he said simply it is quite true that i sought my commission upon your account i would just as readily have become a carlist had i known i had no inclination one way or the other only a great hope and longing for you but i have made the mistake and i cannot retrieve it the strip of brass obliges me to good faith already you will understand the uniform has had its inconvenience it sent me to cuba and set me armed against men almost of my own blood there was no escape then there is no escape now christina moved closer to him the reticence with which shere spoke and the fact that he made no claim upon her made her voice very gentle no she agreed i thought that you would make that answer and in my heart i do not think that i should like to have heard from you any other thank you said shere he drew out his watch i have still some way to go i have to reach olvera by eleven and he was aware that christina at his side became at once very still so that even her breathing was arrested for her sigh of emotion at the abrupt mention of parting he was thankful but it made him keep his eyes turned from her lest a sight of any distress of hers might lead him to falter from his purpose you are riding to olvera she asked after a pause and in a queer muffled voice yes so i must say goodbye and now he turned to her but she was too quick for him to catch a glimpse of her face she had already turned from him and was walking towards the door you must also say goodbye to esteban said she as though to gain time with her fingers on the doorhandle she stopped tell me she exclaimed it was esteban who advised the army who helped you to your commission you need not deny it it was esteban she stood silent turning over this revelation in her mind then she added did you see esteban in ronda this afternoon no but i heard that he was there i must go he took up his hat and turning again towards the door saw that christina stood with her back against the panels and her arms outstretched across them like a barrier you need not fear he said to reassure her i shall not quarrel with esteban he is your brother and the harm is done besides i do not know that it is all harm when i look back in the years before i wore the uniform in those times it was all ones own dissatisfactions and trivial dislikes and trivial ambitions now i find a repose in losing them in becoming a little necessary part of a big machine even though it is not the best machine of its kind and works creakily i find a dignity in it too it was the man of extremes who spoke and he spoke quite sincerely christina however neither answered him nor heard her eyes were fixed with a strange intentness upon him her breath came and went as if she had run a race and in the silence seemed unnaturally audible you carry orders to olvera she said at length shere fetched the sealed letter out of his pocket so i must go or fail in my duty said he give me the letter said christina shere stared at her in amazement the amazement changed to suspicion his whole face seemed to narrow and sharpen out of his own likeness into something foxy and mean i will not he said and slowly replaced the letter there was a man in the road he continued slowly who whistled as i passed a signal no doubt you are carlist this is a trap a trap not laid for you said christina be sure of that until you spoke of olvera i did not know no admitted shere not laid for me to your knowledge but to estebans you were surprised at my coming esteban only at the manner of my coming he asked if i had ridden into the gates of my own accord i remember he was in ronda this afternoon very likely it was he who told my colonel of my knowledge of the neighbourhood it would suit his purposes well to present me to you suddenly not merely as an enemy but an active enemy yes i understand that but and his voice hardened again even to your knowledge the trap was laid for the man who carries the letter you have your share in the trick he repeated the word with a sharp laugh savouring it dwelling upon it as upon something long forgotten and now suddenly remembered a murderous trick too it seems i wonder what would have happened if i had not turned in at the gates of my own accord how much farther should i have ridden towards olvera and by what gentle means should i have been stopped by nothing more dangerous than a hand upon your bridle and an excuse that you might do me some small service at olvera an excuse a falsity to be sure said shere bitterly yet you still stand before the door though you know the letter will not be yours is the trick after all so harmless is there no one esteban for instance in the dark passage outside the door or on the dark road outside the gates i will prove to you you are wrong christina dropped her arms to her side moved altogether from the door and rang a bell esteban shall come here he will see you outside the gates he will set you safely on your road to olvera she spoke now quite quietly all the panic and agitation had gone in a moment from her face her manner and her words but the very suddenness of the change in her increased sheres suspicions a moment ago christina was standing before the door with every nerve astrain her face white and her eyes bewildered with horror now she stood easily by the table with the lighted lamp speaking easily playing easily with the gloves upon the table shere watched for the secret of this sudden change a servant answered the bell and was bidden to find esteban no look of significance passed between them by no gesture was any signal given no harm was intended to any man christina continued as soon as the door again was closed i insisted i mean there was no need to insist for i promised to get the letter from the bearer once he had come into this room how shere asked with a blunt contempt by tricks christina raised her head quickly stung to a moments anger but she did not answer him and again her head drooped at all events she said quietly i have not tried to trick you and shere noticed that she arranged with an absent carelessness the gloves in the form of a cross beneath the lamp and at once he felt that her action contradicted her words it was merely an instinct at first then he began to reason those gloves had been so arranged when first he entered the room christina and esteban were bending over the table christina was explaining something was she explaining that arrangement of the gloves was that arrangement the reason of her ready acceptance of his refusal to part with his orders was it in a word a signal for esteban a signal which should tell him whether or not she had secured the letter shere saw a way to answer that question he was now filled with distrust of christina as half an hour back he had been filled with faith in her so that he paid no heed to her apology or to the passionate and pleading voice in which she spoke it so much was at stake for us she said it seemed a necessity that we must have that letter that no sudden orders must reach olvera tonight for there is some one at olvera i must trust you you see though you are our pledged enemy some one of great consequence to us some one we love some one to whom we look to revive this spain of ours no it is not our king but his son his young and gallant son he will be gone tomorrow but he is at olvera tonight and so when esteban found out today that orders were to be sent to the commandant there it seemed we had no choice it seemed those orders must not reach him and it seemed therefore just so that no hurt might be done which otherwise would surely have been done whatever i might order or forbid that i must use a womans way and secure the letter and the bearer asked shere advancing to the table what of him he i suppose might creep back to ronda broken in honour and with a lie to tell the best lie he could invent or would you have helped him to the lie christina shrank away from the table as though she had been struck you had not thought of his plight continued shere he rides out from ronda an honest soldier and returns what no more a soldier than this glove of yours is your hand and taking up one of the gloves he held it for a moment and then tossed it down at a distance from its fellow he deliberately turned his back to the table as christina replied the bearer would be just our pledged enemy pledged to outwit us as we to outwit him but when you came there was no effort made to outwit you own that at all events you carry your orders safely with your honour safe though the consequence may be disaster for us and disgrace for that we did not prevent you own that you and i i suppose will meet no more so you might own this that i have used no tricks with you the appeal coming as an answer to his insult and contempt and coming from one whose pride he knew to be a real and dominant quality touched shere against his expectation he faced christina on an impulse to give her the assurance she claimed but he changed his mind are you sure of that he asked slowly for he saw that the gloves while his back was turned had again been crossed he at all events was now sure he was sure that those crossed gloves were a signal for esteban a signal that the letter had not changed hands you have used no tricks with me he repeated are you sure of that the handle of the door rattled christina quickly crossed towards it shere followed her but stopped for the fraction of a second at the table and deliberately and unmistakably placed the gloves in parallel lines as the door opened he was standing between christina and the table blocking it from her view it was not she however who looked to the table but esteban she kept her eyes upon her brother and when he in his turn looked to her shere noticed a glance of comprehension swiftly interchanged so shere was confident that he had spoiled this trick of the gloves and when he took a polite leave of christina and followed esteban from the room it was not without an air of triumph christina stood without changing her attitude except that perhaps she pushed her head a little forward that she might the better hear the last of her lovers receding steps when they ceased to sound she ran quickly to the window opened it and leaned out that she might the better hear his horses hoofs on the flagged courtyard she heard besides estebans voice speaking amiably and sheres making amiable replies the sharp hard clatter upon the stones softened into the duller thud upon the road the voices became fainter and lost their character then one clear goodnight rang out loudly and was followed by the quick beats of a horse trotting christina slowly closed the window and turned her eyes upon the room she saw the lamp upon the table and the gloves in parallel lines beneath it now shere was so far right in that the gloves were intended as a signal for esteban only owing to that complete revulsion of which the padre had seen the possibility shere had mistaken the signal the passionate believer had again become the passionate cynic he saw the trick and setting no trust in the girl who played it heeding neither her looks nor words nor the sincerity of her voice had no doubt that it was aimed against him whereas it was aimed to protect him shere had no doubt that the gloves crossed meant that he still had the sealed letter in his keeping and therefore he disarranged them but in truth the gloves crossed meant that christina had it and that the messenger might go unhindered upon his way christina uttered no cry she simply did not believe what her eyes saw she needed to touch the gloves before she was convinced and when she had done that she was at once not sure but that she herself in touching them had ranged them in these lines in the end however she understood not the how or why but the mere fact she ran to the door along the gallery down the steps into the courtyard she met no one the house might have been a deserted ruin from its silence she crossed the courtyard to the glimmering white walls and passed through the gates on to the road the night was clear and ahead of her far away in the middle of the road a lantern shone very red christina ran towards it and as she approached she saw faces like miniatures grouped above it they did not heed her until she was close upon them until she had noticed one man holding a riderless horse apart from the group and another coiling up a stout rope then esteban who was holding the lantern raised his hand to keep her back there has been an accident said he he fell and fell awkwardly the horse with him an accident said christina and she pointed to the coil of rope it was no use for her now to say that she had forbidden violence indeed at no time as she told shere would it have been of any use she pushed through the group to where dennis shere lay on the ground his face white and shiny and tortured with pain she knelt down on the ground and took his head in her hands as though she would raise it on to her lap but one man stopped her saying it is his back seora shere opened his eyes and saw who it was that bent over him and christina reading their look was appalled it was surely impossible that human eyes could carry so much hate his lips moved and she leaned her ear close to his mouth to catch the words but it was only one word he spoke and repeated tricks tricks there was no time to disprove or explain christina had but one argument she kissed him on the lips this is no trick she cried and esteban laying a hand upon her shoulder said he does not hear nor can his lips answer and esteban spoke the truth shere had not heard and never would hear as christina knew he still has the letter said esteban christina thrust him back with her hand and crouched over the dead man protecting him in a little she said true there is the letter she unbuttoned sheres jacket and gently took the letter from his breast then she knelt back and looked at the superscription without speaking esteban opened the door of the lantern and held the flame towards her no said she it had better go to olvera she rode to olvera that night they let her go deceived by her composure and thinking that she meant to carry it to the man of great consequence but christinas composure meant nothing more than that her mind and her feelings were numbed she was conscious of only one conviction that shere must not fail in his duty since he had staked his honour upon its fulfilment and so she rode straight to the commandants quarters at olvera and telling of an accident to the bearer handed him the letter the commandant read it and was most politely distressed that christina should have put herself to so much trouble for the orders merely recalled his contingent to ronda in the morning it was about this time that christina began to understand precisely what had happened the shuttered house if ever a mans pleasures jumped with his duties mine did in the year when as a clerk in the service of the royal african company of adventurers i was despatched to the remote islands of scilly in search of certain information which it was believed mr robert lovyes alone could impart for even a clerk that sits all day conning his ledgers may now and again chance upon a record or name which will tickle his dull fancies with the suggestion of a story such a suggestion i had derived from the circumstances of mr lovyes he had passed an adventurous youth during which he had for eight years been held to slavery by a negro tribe on the gambia river he had afterwards amassed a considerable fortune and embarked it in the ventures of the company he had thereupon withdrawn himself to tresco where he had lived for twenty years so much any man might know without provocation to his curiosity the strange feature of mr lovyes conduct was revealed to me by the ledgers for during all those years he had drawn neither upon his capital nor his interest so that his stake in the company grew larger and larger with no profit to himself that any one could discover it seemed to me in fact clean against nature that a man so rich should so disregard his wealth and i busied myself upon the journey with discovering strange reasons for his seclusion of which none i may say came near the mark by so much did the truth exceed them all i landed at the harbour of new grimsey on tresco in the grey twilight of a september evening and asking for mr lovyes was directed across a little ridge of heather to dolphin town which lies on the eastward side of tresco and looks across old grimsey sound to the island of st helens dolphin town you should know for all its grand name boasts but a poor halfscore of houses dotted about the ferns and bracken with no semblance of order one of the houses however attracted my notice first because it was built in two storeys and was therefore by a storey taller than the rest and secondly because all its windows were closely shuttered and it wore in that falling light a drooping melancholy aspect like a derelict ship upon the seas it stood in the middle of this scanty village and had a little unkempt garden about it inclosed within a wooden paling there was a wicketgate in the paling and a rough path from the gate to the house door and a few steps to the right of this path a well was sunk and rigged with a winch and bucket i was both tired and thirsty so i turned into the garden and drew up some water in the bucket a narrow track was beaten in the grass between the well and the house and i saw with surprise that the stones about the mouth of the well were splashed and still wet the house then had an inmate i looked at it again but the shutters kept their secret there was no glimmer of light visible through any chink i approached the house and from that nearer vantage discovered that the shutters were common planks fitted into the windows and nailed fast to the woodwork from without growing yet more curious i marched to the door and knocked with an inquiry upon my tongue as to where mr lovyes lived but the excuse was not needed the sound of my blows echoed through the house in a desolate solitary fashion and no step answered them i knocked again and louder then i leaned my ear to the panel and i distinctly heard the rustling of a womans dress i held my breath to hear the more surely the sound was repeated but more faintly and it was followed by a noise like the closing of a door i drew back from the house keeping an eye upon the upper storey for i thought it possible the woman might reconnoitre me thence but the windows stared at me blind unresponsive to the right and left lights twinkled in the scattered dwellings and i found something very ghostly in the thought of this woman entombed as it were in the midst of them and moving alone in the shuttered gloom the twilight deepened and suddenly the gate behind me whined on its hinges at once i dropped to my full length on the grass the gloom was now so thick there was little fear i should be discovered and a man went past me to the house he walked so far as i could judge with a heavy stoop but was yet uncommon tall and he carried a basket upon his arm he laid the basket upon the doorstep and to my utter disappointment turned at once and so down the path and out at the gate i heard the gate rattle once twice and then a click as its latch caught i was sufficiently curious to desire a nearer view of the basket and discovered that it contained food then remembering me that all this while my own business waited i continued on my way to mr lovyes house it was a long building of a brownish granite under merchants point at the northern extremity of old grimsey harbour mr lovyes was sitting over his walnuts in the cheerless solitude of his diningroom a frail old gentleman older than his years which i took to be sixty or thereabouts and with the air of a man in a decline i unfolded my business forthwith but i had not got far before he interrupted me there is a mistake he said it is doubtless my brother robert you are in search of i am john lovyes and was it is true captured with my brother in africa but i escaped six years before he did and traded no more in those parts we fled together from the negroes but we were pursued my brother was pierced by an arrow and i left him believing him to be dead i had indeed heard something of a brother though i little expected to find him in tresco too he pressed upon me the hospitality of his house but my business was with mr robert and i asked him to direct me on my path which he did with some hesitation and reluctance i had once more to pass through dolphin town and an impulse prompted me to take another look at the shuttered house i found that the basket of food had been removed and an empty bucket stood in its place but there was still no light visible and i went on to the dwelling of mr robert lovyes when i came to it i comprehended his brothers hesitation it was a rough mean little cottage standing on the edge of the bracken close to the sea a dwelling fit for the poorest fisherman but for no one above that station and a large open boat was drawn up on the hard beside it as though the tenant fished for his bread i knocked at the door and a man with a candle in his hand opened it mr robert lovyes i asked yes i am he and he led the way into a kitchen poor and mean as the outside warranted but scrupulously clean and bright with a fire he led the way as i say and i was still more mystified to observe from his gait his height and the stoop of his shoulders that he was the man whom i had seen carrying the basket through the garden i had now an opportunity of noticing his face wherein i could detect no resemblance to his brothers for it was broader and more vigorous with a great white beard valancing it and whereas mr johns hair was neatly powdered and tied with a ribbon as a gentlemans should be mr roberts which was of a black colour with a little sprinkling of grey hung about his head in a tangled mane there was but a twoyears difference between the ages of the brothers but there might have been a decade i explained my business and we sat down to a supper of fish freshly caught which he served himself and during supper he gave me the information i was come after but i lent only an inattentive ear to his talk for my knowledge of his wealth the picture of him as he sat in his great seaboots and coarse seamans vest as though it was the most natural garb in the world and his easy discourse about those far african rivers made a veritable jumble of my mind to add to it all there was the mystery of the shuttered house more than once i was inclined to question him upon this last account but his manner did not promise confidences and i said nothing at last he perceived my inattention i will repeat all this tomorrow he said grimly you are no doubt tired i cannot i am afraid house you for as you see i have no room but i have a young friend who happens by good luck to stay this night on tresco and no doubt he will oblige me thereupon he led me to a cottage on the outskirts of dolphin town and of all in that village nearest to the sea my friend said he is named ginver wyeth and though he comes from these parts he does not live here being a schoolmaster on the mainland his mother has died lately and he is come on that account mr wyeth received me hospitably but with a certain pedantry of speech which somewhat surprised me seeing that his parents were common fisherfolk he readily explained the matter however over a pipe when mr lovyes had left us i owe everything to mrs lovyes he said she took me when a boy taught me something herself and sent me thereafter at her own charges to a school in falmouth mrs lovyes i exclaimed yes he continued and bending forward lowered his voice you went up to merchants point you say then you passed crudges folly a house of two storeys with a well in the garden yes yes i said she lives there said he behind those shutters i cried for twenty years she has lived in the midst of us and no one has seen her during all that time not even robert lovyes aye she has lived behind the shutters there he stopped i waited thinking that in a little he would take up his tale but he did not and i had to break the silence i had not heard that mr robert was ever married i said as carelessly as i might nor was he replied mr wyeth mrs lovyes is the wife of john the house at merchants point is hers and there twenty years ago she lived his words caught my breath away so little did i expect them the wife of john lovyes i stammered but and i told him how i had seen robert lovyes carry his basket up the path yes said wyeth twice a day robert draws water for her at the well and once a day he brings her food it is in his house too that she lives crudges folly that was his name for it and the name clings but none the less she is the wife of john and with little more persuasion mr wyeth told me the story it is the story of a sacrifice he began mad or great as you please but mark you it achieved its end as a boy i witnessed it from its beginnings for it was at this very door that robert lovyes rapped when he first landed on tresco on the night of the seventh of may twentytwo years ago and i was here on my holidays at the time i had been out that day in my fathers lugger to the poul which is the best fishingground anywhere near scilly and the fog took us i remember at three of the afternoon so what with that and the wind failing it was late when we cast anchor in grimsey sound the night had fallen in a brown mirk and so still that the sound of our feet brushing through the ferns was loud like the sweep of scythes we sat down to supper in this kitchen about nine my mother my father two men from the boat and myself and after supper we gathered about the fire here and talked the talk in these parts however it may begin slides insensibly to that one element of which the noise is ever in our ears and so in a little here were we chattering of wrecks and wrecks and wrecks and the bodies of dead men drowned and then in the thick of the talk came the knock on the door a light rapping of the knuckles such as one hears twenty times a day but our minds were so primed with old wives tales that it fairly shook us all no one stirred and the knocking was repeated then the latch was lifted and robert lovyes stepped in his beard was black then coal black like his hair and his face looked out from it pale as a ghost and shining wet from the sea the water dripped from his clothes and made a puddle about his feet how often did i knock he asked pleasantly twice i think yes twice then he sat down on the settle very deliberately pulled off his great seaboots and emptied the water out of them what island is this he asked tresco tresco he exclaimed in a quick agitated whisper as though he dreaded yet expected to hear the name we were wrecked then on the golden ball wrecked cried my father but the man went on pursuing his own thoughts i swam to an islet it would be norwithel said my father yes said he it would be norwithel and my mother asked curiously you know these islands for his speech was leisurely and delicate such as we heard neither from scillonians nor from the sailors who visit st marys yes he answered his face breaking into a smile of unexpected softness i know these islands from rosevean to ganilly from peninnis head to maiden bower i know them well at this point mr wyeth broke off his story and crossing to the window opened it listen he said i heard as it were the sound of innumerable voices chattering and murmuring and whispering in some mysterious language and at times the voices blended and the murmurs became a single moan it is the tide making on the golden ball said mr wyeth the reef stretches seawards from st helens island and half way across the sound you may see it at low tide a ledge level as a paved causeway and god help the ship that strikes on it even while he spoke from these undertones of sound there swelled suddenly a great booming like a battery of cannon it is the ledge cracking said mr wyeth and it cracks in the calmest weather with that he closed the window and lighting his pipe resumed his story it was on that reef that mr robert lovyes was wrecked the ship he told us was the schooner waking dawn bound from cardiff to africa and she had run into the fog about halfpast three when they were a mile short of the seven stones she bumped twice on the reef and sank immediately with so far as he knew all her crew so now robert continued tapping his belt since i have the means to pay i will make bold to ask for a lodging and for this night i will hang up here my dripping garments to neptune me tabula sacer votiva paries i began in the pride of my schooling for i had learned that verse of horace but a week before this no doubt is the cornish tongue he interrupted gravely and will you please to carry my boots outside what followed seemed to me then the strangest part of all this business though indeed our seafogs come and go as often as not with a like abruptness but the time of this fogs dispersion shocked the mind as something pitiless and arbitrary for had the air cleared an hour before the waking dawn would not have struck i opened the door and it was as though a panel of brilliant white was of a sudden painted on the floor robert lovyes sprang up from the settle ran past me into the open and stood on the bracken in his stockinged feet a little patch of fog still smoked on the shining beach of tean a scarf of it was twisted about the granite bosses of st helens and for the rest the moonlight sparkled upon the headlands and was spilled across miles of placid sea there was a froth of water upon the golden ball but no sign of the schooner sunk among its weeds my father however and the two boatmen hurried down to the shore while i was despatched with the news to merchants point my mother asked mr lovyes his name that i might carry it with me but he spoke in a dreamy voice as though he had not heard her there were eight of the crew four were below and i doubt if the four on deck could swim i ran off on my errand and coming back a little later with a bottle of cordial waters found mr lovyes still standing in the moonlight he seemed not to have moved a finger i gave him the bottle with a message that any who were rescued should be carried to merchants point forthwith and that he himself should go down there in the morning who taught you latin he asked suddenly mrs lovyes taught me the rudiments i began and with that he led me on to talk of her but with some cunning for now he would divert me to another topic and again bring me back to her so that it all seemed the vagrancies of a boys inconsequent chatter mrs lovyes who was remotely akin to the lord proprietor had come to tresco three years before immediately after her marriage and it was understood at her husbands wish i talked of her readily for apart from what i owed to her bounty she was a woman most sure to engage the affections of any boy for one thing she was past her youth being thirty years of age tall with eyes of the kindliest grey and she bore herself in everything with a tender toleration like a woman that has suffered much of the other topics of this conversation there was one which later i had good reason to remember we had caught a shark twelve feet long at the poul that day and the shark fairly divided my thoughts with mrs lovyes you bleed a fish first into the sea i explained then you bait with a chads head and let your line down a couple of fathoms you can see your bait quite clearly and you wait no doubt said robert you wait in a while said i a dim lilac shadow floats through the clear water and after a little you catch a glimpse of a forked tail and waving fins and an evil devils head the fish smells at the bait and sinks again to a lilac shadow perhaps out of sight and again it rises the shadow becomes a fish the fish goes circling round your boat and it may be a long while before he turns on his back and rushes at the bait and as like as not he carries the bait and line away that depends upon how quick you are with the gaff said i here comes my father my father returned emptyhanded not one of the crew had been saved you asked my name said robert lovyes turning to my mother it is crudge jarvis crudge with that he went to his bed but all night long i heard him pacing his room the next morning he complained of his long immersion in the sea and certainly when he told his story to mr and mrs lovyes as they sat over their breakfast in the parlour at merchants point he spoke with such huskiness as i never heard the like of mr lovyes took little heed to us but went on eating his breakfast with only a sour comment here and there i noticed however that mrs lovyes who sat over against us bent her head forward and once or twice shook it as though she would unseat some ridiculous conviction and after the story was told she sat with no word of kindness for mr crudge and what was yet more unlike her no word of pity for the sailors who were lost then she rose and stood steadying herself with the tips of her fingers upon the table finally she came swiftly across the room and peered into mr crudges face if you need help she said i will gladly furnish it no doubt you will be anxious to go from tresco at the earliest no doubt no doubt you will she repeated anxiously madame he said i need no help being by gods leave a man and he laid some stress upon the man but not boastfully rather as though all women did or might need help by the mere circumstance of their sex and as for going hence why yesterday i was bound for africa i sailed unexpectedly into a fog off scilly i was wrecked in a calm sea on the golden ball i was thrown up on tresco no one on that ship escaped but myself no sooner was i safe than the fog lifted you will stay mrs lovyes interrupted no yes said he jarvis grudge will stay and she turned thoughtfully away but i caught a glimpse of her face as we went out and it wore the saddest smile a man could see mr grudge and i walked for a while in silence and what sort of a name has mr john lovyes in these parts he asked an honest sort said i emphatically the name of a man who loves his wife or her money he sneered bah a surly illconditioned dog ill warrant the curmudgeon you are marvellously recovered of your cold said i he stopped and looked across the sound then he said in a soft musing voice i once knew just such another clever boy he was so clever that men beat him with sticks and put on great seaboots to kick him with so that he lived a miserable life and was subsequently hanged in great agony at tyburn mr grudge as he styled himself stayed with us for a week during which time he sailed much with me about these islands and i made a discovery though he knew these islands so well he had never visited them before and his knowledge was all hearsay i did not mention my discovery to him lest i should meet with another rebuff but i was none the less sure of its truth for he mistook hanjague for nornor and priglis bay for beady pool and made a number of suchlike mistakes after a week he hired the cottage in which he now lives bought his boat leased from the steward the patch of ground in dolphin town and set about building his house he undertook the work i am sure for pure employment and distraction he picked up the granite stones fitted them together panelled them made the floors from the deck of a brigantine which came ashore on annet pegged down the thatch roof in a word he built the house from first to last with his own hands and he took fifteen months over the business during which time he did not exchange a single word with mrs lovyes nor anything more than a short goodday with mr john he worked however with no great regularity for while now he laboured in a feverish haste now he would sit a whole day idle on the headlands or again he would of a sudden throw down his tools as though the work overtaxed him and leaping into his boat set all sail and run with the wind all that night you might see him sailing in the moonlight and he would come home in the flush of the dawn after he had built the house he furnished it crossing for that purpose backwards and forwards between tresco and st marys i remember that one day he brought back with him a large chest and i offered to lend him a hand in carrying it but he hoisted it on his back and took it no farther than the cottage in which he lived where it remained locked with a padlock towards christmastime then the house was ready but to our surprise he did not move into it he seemed indeed of a sudden to have lost all liking for it and whether it was that he had no longer any work upon his hands he took to following mrs lovyes about but in a way that was unnoticeable unless you had other reasons to suspect that his thoughts were following her his conduct in this respect was particularly brought home to me on christmas day the afternoon was warm and sunny and i walked over the hill at merchants point meaning to bathe in the little sequestered bay beyond from the top of the hill i saw mrs lovyes walking along the strip of beach alone and as i descended the hillside which is very deep in fern and heather i came plump upon jarvis grudge stretched fulllength on the ground he was watching mrs lovyes with so greedy a concentration of his senses that he did not remark my approach i asked him when he meant to enter his new house i do not know that i ever shall he replied then why did you build it i asked because i was a fool and then he burst out in a passionate whisper but a fool i was to stay here and a fools trick it was to build that house he shook his fist in its direction call it grudges folly and theres the name for it and with that he turned him again to spying upon mrs lovyes after a while he spoke again but slowly and with his eyes fixed upon the figure moving upon the beach do you remember the night i came ashore you had caught a shark that day and you told me of it the great lilac shadow which rises from the depths and circles about the bait and sinks again and rises again and takes how long two years maybe before he snaps it but he does not carry it away said i taking his meaning sometimes sometimes he snarled that depends on how quick we are with the gaff you he laughed and taking me by the elbows he shook me till i was giddy i owe mrs lovyes everything i said at that he let me go the ferocity of his manner however confirmed me in my fears and with a boys extravagance i carried from that day a big knife in my belt the gaff i suppose said mr grudge with a polite smile when first he remarked it during the next week however he showed more contentment with his lot and once i caught him rubbing his hands and chuckling like a man well pleased so that by new years eve i was wellnigh relieved of my anxiety on mrs lovyes account on that night however i went down to grudges cottage and peeping through the window on my way to the door i saw a strange man in the room his face was cleanshaven his hair tied back and powdered he was in his shirtsleeves with a satin waistcoat a sword at his side and shining buckles to his shoes then i saw that the big chest stood open i opened the door and entered come in said the man and from his voice i knew him to be mr crudge he took a candle in his hand and held it above his head tell me my name he said his face shaved of its beard and no longer hidden by his hair stood out distinct unmistakable lovyes i answered good boy said he robert lovyes brother to john yet he did not know you said i though indeed i could not wonder but she did he cried with a savage exultation at the first glance at the first word she knew me then quietly my coat is on the chair beside you i took it up what do you mean to do i asked it is new years eve he said grimly the season of good wishes it is only meet that i should wish my brother who stole my wife much happiness for the next twelve months he took the coat from my hands you admire the coat ah true the colour is lilac he held it out at arms length doubtless i had been staring at the coat but i had not even given it a thought the lilac shadow he went on with a sneer believe me it is the purest coincidence and as he prepared to slip his arm into the sleeve i flashed the knife out of my belt he was too quick for me however he flung the coat over my head i felt the knife twisted out of my hand he stumbled over the chair we both fell to the ground and the next thing i know i was running over the bracken towards merchants point with robert lovyes hot upon my heels he was of a heavy build and forty years of age i had the double advantage and i ran till my chest cracked and the stars danced above me i clanged at the bell and stumbled into the hall mrs lovyes i choked the name out as she stepped from the parlour well she asked what is it he is following robert lovyes she sprang rigid as though i had whipped her across the face then i knew it would come to this at the last she said and even as she spoke robert lovyes crossed the threshold molly he said and looked at her curiously she stood singularly passive twisting her fingers i hardly know you he continued in the old days you were the wilfullest girl i ever clapped eyes on that was thirteen years ago she said with a queer little laugh at the recollection he took her by the hand and led her into the parlour i followed neither mrs lovyes nor robert remarked my presence and as for john lovyes he rose from his chair as the pair approached him stretched out a trembling hand drew it in stretched it out again all without a word and his face purple and ridged with the veins brother said robert taking between his fingers half a gold coin which was threaded on a chain about mrs lovyes wrist where is the fellow to this i gave it to you on the gambia river bidding you carry it to molly as a sign that i would return i saw johns face harden and set at the sound of his brothers voice he looked at his wife and since she now knew the truth he took the bold course i gave it to her said he as a token of your death and by god she was worth the lie the two men faced one another robert smoothing his chin john with his arms folded and each as white and ugly with passion as the other robert turned to mrs lovyes who stood like a stone you promised to wait he said in a constrained voice i escaped six years after my noble brother six years she asked had you come back then you would have found me waiting i could not he said a fortune equal to your own that was what i promised to myself before i returned to marry you and much good it has done you said john and i think that he meant by the provocation to bring the matter to an immediate issue pride pride and he wagged his head sinful pride robert sprang forward with an oath and then as though the movement had awakened her mrs lovyes stepped in between the two men with an arm outstretched on either side to keep them apart wait she said for what is it that you fight not indeed for me to you my husband i will no more belong to you my lover i cannot my womans pride my womans honour those two things are mine to keep so she stood casting about for an issue while the brothers glowered at one another across her it was evident that if she left them alone they would fight and fight to the death she turned to robert you meant to live on tresco here at my gates unknown to me but you could not i could not he answered in the old days you had spoken so much of scilly every island reminded me and i saw you every day i could read the thought passing through her mind it would not serve for her to live beside them visible to them each day sooner or later they would come to grips and then her face flushed as the notion of her great sacrifice came to her i see but the one way she said i will go into the house that you robert have built neither you nor john shall see me but none the less i shall live between you holding you apart as my hands do now i give my life to you so truly that from this night no one shall see my face you john shall live on here at merchants point robert you at your cottage and every day you will bring me food and water and leave it at my door the two men fell back shamefaced they protested they would part and put the world between them but she would not trust them i think too the notion of her sacrifice grew on her as she thought of it for women are tenacious of sacrifice even as men are of revenge and in the end she had her way that night robert lovyes nailed the boards across the windows and brought the doorkey back to her and that night twenty years ago she crossed the threshold no man has seen her since but none the less for twenty years she has lived between the brothers keeping them apart this was the story which mr wyeth told me as we sat over our pipes and the next day i set off on my journey back to london the conclusion of the affair i witnessed myself for a year later we received a letter from mr robert asking that a large sum of money should be forwarded to him being curious to learn the reason for his demand i carried the sum to tresco myself mr john lovyes had died a month before and i reached the island on mr roberts weddingday i was present at the ceremony he was now dressed in a manner which befitted his station an old man bent and bowed but still handsome and he bore upon his arm a tall woman greyhaired and very pale yet with the traces of great beauty as the parson laid her hand in her husbands i heard her whisper to him dust to dust keeper of the bishop for a fortnight out of every six weeks the little white faced man walked the garrison on st marys island in a broadcloth frockcoat a low waistcoat and a black riband of a tie fastened in a bow and it gave him great pleasure to be mistaken for a commercial traveller but during the other four weeks he was headkeeper of the lighthouse on the bishops rock with thirty years of exemplary service to his credit by what circumstances he had been brought to enlist under the trinity flag i never knew but now at the age of fortyeight he was entirely occupied with a great horror of the sea and its hunger for the bodies of men the frockcoat which he wore during his spells on shore was a protest against the sea and he hated not only the sea but all things that were in the sea especially rock lighthouses and of all rock lighthouses especially the bishop the atlantics as smooth as a ballroom floor said he it was a clear still day and we were sitting among the gorse on the top of the garrison looking down the sea towards the west five miles from the scillies the thin column of the bishop showed like a cord strung tight in the sky but out there all round the lighthouse there are eddies twisting and twisting without any noise and extraordinary quick and every other second now here now there youll notice the sea dimple and youll hear a sound like a man hiccoughing and all at once theres a wicked black whirlpool the tide runs seven miles an hour past the bishop but in another year i have done with her to her garstin nodded across from st marys to that grey finger post of the atlantic one more winter well very likely during this one more winter the bishop will go on some night when a storm blows from west or westnorwest and the irish coast takes none of its strength he was only uttering the current belief of the islands the first bishop lighthouse had been swept away before its building was finished and though the second stood a fog bell weighing no less than a ton and fixed ninety feet above the water had been lifted from its fittings by a single wave and tossed like a tennisball into the sea i asked garstin whether he had been stationed on the rock at the time people talk of lightships plunging and tugging at their cables he returned well ive tried lightships and what i say is ships are built to plunge and tug at their cables thats their business but it isnt the business of one hundred and twenty upright feet of granite to quiver and tremble like a steel spring no i wasnt on the bishop when the bell went but i was there when a wave climbed up from the base of the rock and smashed in the glass wall of the lantern and put the light out that was last spring at four oclock in the morning the day was breaking very cold and wild and one could just see the waves below a lashing tumble of grey and white water as far as the eye could reach i was in the lantern reading its never too late to mend i had come to where the chaplain knocks down the warder and i was thinking how id like to have a go at that warder myself when all the guns in the world went off together in my ears and there i was dripping wet and fairly sliced with splinters of glass and the wind blowing wet in my face and the lamp out and a bitter grey light of morning as though there never never had been any sun and all the dead men in the sea shouting out for me one hundred feet below and garstin shivered and rose to his feet well i have only one more winter of it and then i asked then i get the north foreland and the trippers come out from margate and i live on shore with my wife and by the way i wanted to speak to you about my boy hes getting up in years what shall i make of him a linendraper eh in the midlands what or something in a free library handing out charles reades books hes at home now come and see him in garstins quarters within the coastguard enclosure i was introduced to his wife and the lad leopold what shall we call him mrs garstin had asked some fifteen years before i dont know any seafaring man by the name of leopold garstin had replied after a moment of reflection so leopold he was named mrs garstin was a buxom unimaginative woman but she shared to the full her husbands horror of the sea she told me of nights when she lay alone listening to the moan of the wind overhead and seeing the column of the bishop rock upon its base and of mornings when she climbed from the sheltered barracks up the gorse with her heart tugging in her breast certain certain that this morning at least there would be no bishop lighthouse visible from the top of the garrison it seems a sort of insult to the works of god said she in a hushed voice it seems as if it stood up there in gods face and cried you cant hurt me yes most presumptuous and provoking said garstin and so they fell to talking of the boy who at all events should fulfil his destiny very far inland from the sea mrs garstin leaned to the linendrapery garstin inclined to the free library well i will come down to the north foreland said i and you shall tell me which way it is yes if said garstin and stopped yes if repeated his wife with a nod of the head oh it wont go this winter said i and it didnt but on the other hand garstin did not go to the north foreland nor for two years did i hear any more of him but two years later i returned to st marys and walked across the beach of the island to the little graveyard by the sea a new tablet upon the outer wall of the church caught and held my eye i read the inscription and remained incredulous for the bishop still stood but the letters were there engraved upon the plate and as i read them again the futility of garstins fears was enforced upon me with a singular pathos for the bishop still stood and garstin had died on the christmas eve of that last year which he was to spend upon rock lighthouses of how he died the tablet gave a hint but no more than a hint there were four words inscribed underneath his name and he was not i walked back to hugh town wondering at the tragedy which those four words half hid and half revealed and remembering that the tide runs seven miles an hour past the bishop with many eddies and whirlpools almost unconsciously i went up the hill above hugh town and came to the signal station on the top of the garrison and so occupied was i with my recollections of garstin that it did not strike me as strange that i should find mrs garstin standing now where he had stood and looking out to the bishop as he was used to look i had not heard i said to her no she returned simply and again turned her eyes seawards it was late on a midsummer afternoon the sun hung a foot or so above the water a huge ball of dull red fire and from st marys out to the horizons rim the sea stretched a rippling lagoon of the colour of claret over the whole expanse there was but one boat visible a lugger between sennen and st agnes beating homewards against a light wind it was a storm i suppose said i a storm out of the west no there was no wind but there was a haze and it was growing dark mrs garstin spoke in a peculiar tone of resignation with a yearning glance towards the bishop as i thought towards the lugger as i know but even then i was sure that those last words there was a haze and it was growing dark concealed the heart of her distress she explained the inscription upon the tablet while the lugger tacked towards st marys and while i gradually began to wonder what still kept her on the island at four oclock on the afternoon of that christmas eve the lighthouse on st agnes island showed its lamps five minutes later the red beams struck out from round island to the north but to the west on the bishop all was dark the haze thickened and night came on still there was no flash from the bishop and the islands wondered half an hour passed there was still darkness in the west and the islands became alarmed the trinity brethren subsidise a st agnes lugger to serve the bishop and this boat was got ready at a quarter to five suddenly the bishop light shot through the gloom but immediately after a shutter was interposed quickly some halfadozen times it was the signal of distress and the lugger worked out to the bishop with the tide of the three keepers there were now only two it appeared from their account that garstin took the middle day watch that they themselves were asleep and that garstin should have roused them to light the lamps at a quarter to four they woke of their own accord in the dark and at once believed they had slept into the night the clock showed them it was halfpast four they mounted to the lantern room and nowhere was there any sign of garstin they lit the lamps the first thing they saw was the log it was open and the last entry was written in garstins hand and was timed pm it mentioned a ketch reaching northwards the two men descended the windingstairs and the cold air breathed upon their faces the brass door at the foot of the stairs stood open from that door thirty feet of gunmetal rungs let in to the outside of the lighthouse lead down to the setoff which is a granite rim less than a yard wide and unprotected by any rail they shouted downwards from the doorway and received no answer they descended to the setoff and again no garstin not even his cap he was not garstin had entered up the log had climbed down to the setoff for five minutes of fresh air and somehow had slipped though the wind was light and the sea whispering but the whispering sea ran seven miles an hour past the bishop this was mrs garstins story and it left me still wondering why she lived on at st marys i asked after her son how is leopold what is he a linendraper she shaded her eyes with her hand and said thats the st agnes lugger from the bishop and if we go down to the pier now we shall meet it we walked down to the pier the first person to step on shore was leopold with the trinity house buttons on his pilot coat hes the third hand on the bishop now said mrs garstin you are surprised she sent leopold into hugh town upon an errand and as we walked back up the hill she said did you notice a grave underneath johns tablet no said i i told you there was a mention in the log of a ketch yes the ketch went ashore on the crebinachs at halfpast four on that christmas eve one man jumped for the rocks when the ketch struck and was drowned the rest were brought off by the lugger but one man was drowned he drowned because he jumped said i he drowned because my man hadnt lit the bishop light said she brushing my sophistry aside so i gave my boy in his place and now i knew why those words there was a haze and it was growing dark held the heart of her distress and if the bishop goes next winter she continued why it will just be a life for a life and she choked down a sob as a young voice hailed us from behind but the bishop still stands in the atlantic and leopold now the second hand explains to the margate trippers the wonders of the north foreland lights the cruise of the willing mind the cruise happened before the steamtrawler ousted the smack from the north sea a few newspapers recorded it in halfadozen lines of small print which nobody read but it became and though nowadays the willing mind rots from month to month by the quay remains staple talk at gorleston alehouses on winter nights the crew consisted of weeks three fairly competent hands and a bakers assistant when the willing mind slipped out of yarmouth alexander duncan the photographer from derby joined the smack afterwards under peculiar circumstances duncan was a timid person but aware of his timidity he was quite clear that his paramount business was to be a man and he was equally clear that he was not successful in his paramount business meanwhile he pretended to be hoping that on some miraculous day a sudden test would prove the straw man he was to have become real flesh and blood a visit to a surgeon and the flick of a knife quite shattered that illusion he went down to yarmouth afterwards fairly disheartened the test had been applied and he had failed now weeks was a particular friend of duncans they had chummed together on gorleston quay some years before perhaps because they were so dissimilar weeks had taught duncan to sail a boat and had once or twice taken him for a short trip on his smack so that the first thing that duncan did on his arrival at yarmouth was to take the tram to gorleston and to make inquiries a fisherman lounging against a winch replied to them if weeks is a friend o yours i should get used to missin im as i tell his wife there was at that time an ingenious system by which the skipper might buy his smack from the owner on the instalment plan as people buy their furniture only with a difference for people sometimes get their furniture the instalments had to be completed within a certain period the skipper could do it he could just do it but he couldnt do it without running up one little bill here for stores and another little bill there for sailmending the owner worked in with the sailmaker and just as the skipper was putting out to earn his last instalment he would find the bailiffs on board his cruise would be delayed he would be consequently behindhand with his instalment and back would go the smack to the owner with a present of fourfifths of its price weeks had to pay two hundred pounds and had eight weeks to earn it in but he got the straight tip that his sailmaker would stop him and getting together any sort of crew he could he slipped out at night with half his stores now the noth sea concluded the fisherman in november and december aint a bobbys job duncan walked forward to the pierhead he looked out at a grey tumbled sky shutting down on a grey tumbled sea there were flecks of white cloud in the sky flecks of white breakers on the sea and it was all most dreary he stood at the end of the jetty and his great possibility came out of the grey to him weeks was shorthanded cribbed within a few feet of the smacks deck there would be no chance for any man to shirk duncan acted on the impulse he bought a fishermans outfit at gorleston travelled up to london got a passage the next morning on a billingsgate fishcarrier and that night went throbbing down the great water street of the swim past the green globes of the mouse the four flashes of the outer gabbard winked him goodbye away on the starboard and at eleven oclock the next night far out in the north sea he saw the little city of lights swinging on the dogger the willing minds boat came aboard the next morning and captain weeks with it who smiled grimly while duncan explained how he had learnt that the smack was shorthanded i cant put you ashore in denmark said weeks knowingly therell be seven weeks its true for things to blow over but ill have to take you back to yarmouth and i cant afford a passenger if you come you come as a hand i mean to own my smack at the end of this voyage duncan climbed after him into the boat the willing mind had now six for her crew weeks his son willie a lad of sixteen upton the first hand deakin the decky rall the bakers assistant and alexander duncan and of these six four were almost competent deakin it is true was making his second voyage but willie weeks though young had begun early and upton a man of forty knew the banks and currents of the north sea as well as weeks its all right said the skipper if the weather holds and for a month the weather did hold and the catches were good and duncan learned a great deal he learnt how to keep a nightwatch from midnight till eight in the morning and then stay on deck till noon how to put his tiller up and down when his tiller was a wheel and how to vary the order according as his skipper stood to windward or to lee he learnt to box a compass and to steer by it to gauge the leeway he was making by the angle of his wake and the black line in the compass above all he learnt to love the boat like a live thing as a man loves his horse and to want every scanty inch of brass on her to shine but it was not for this that duncan had come out to sea he gazed out at night across the rippling starlit water and the smacks nestling upon it and asked of his god is this all and his god answered him the beginning of it was the sudden looming of ships upon the horizon very clear till they looked like carved toys the skipper got out his accounts and totted up his catches and the prices they had fetched in billingsgate market then he went on deck and watched the sun set there were no cloudbanks in the west and he shook his head itll blow a bit from the east before morning said he and he tapped on the barometer then he returned to his accounts and added them up again after a little he looked up and saw the first hand watching him with comprehension two or three really good hauls would do the trick suggested weeks the first hand nodded if it was my boat i should chance it tomorrow before the weather blows up weeks drummed his fists on the table and agreed on the morrow the admiral headed north for the great fisher bank and the fleet followed with the exception of the willing mind the willing mind lagged along in the rear without her topsails till about halfpast two in the afternoon when captain weeks became suddenly alert he bore away till he was right before the wind hoisted every scrap of sail he could carry rigged out a spinnaker with his balloon foresail and made a clean run for the coast of denmark deakin explained the manoeuvre to duncan the old mans goin poachin hes after soles keep a lookout lads cried weeks its not the danish gunboat im afraid of its the fatherly english cruiser aturning of us back darkness however found them unmolested they crossed the threemile limit at eight oclock and crept close in under the danish headlands without a glimmer of light showing i want all hands all night said weeks and theres a couple of pounds for him as first see the bogeyman meaning the danish gunboat explained deakin the trawl was down before nine the skipper stood by his lead upton took the wheel and all night they trawled in the shallows bumping on the grounds with a sharp eye for the danish gunboat they hauled in at twelve and again at three and again at six and they had just got their last catch on deck when duncan saw by the first grey of the morning a duncoloured trail of smoke hanging over a projecting knoll there she is he cried yes thats the gunboat answered weeks we can laugh at her with this wind he put his smack about and before the gunboat puffed round the headland three miles away was reaching northwards with his sails free he rejoined the fleet that afternoon fiftytwo boxes of soles said weeks and every one of them worth twopoundten in billingsgate market this smacks mine and he stamped on the deck in all the pride of ownership well take a reef in he added theres a notheasterly gale blowin up and i dont know anything worse in the noth sea the sea piles in upon you from newfoundland piles in till it strikes the banks then it breaks you were right upton well be lying hoveto in the morning they were lying hoveto before the morning duncan tossing about in his canvas cot heard the skipper stamping overhead and in an interval of the wind caught a snatch of song bawled out in a high voice the song was not reassuring for the two lines which duncan caught ran as follows you never can tell when your deathbells are ringing your never can know when youre going to die duncan tumbled on to the floor fell about the cabin as he pulled on his seaboots and climbed up the companion he clung to the mizzenrunners in a night of extraordinary blackness to port and to starboard the lights of the smacks rose on the crests and sank in the troughs with such violence they had the air of being tossed up into the sky and then extinguished in the water while all round him there flashed little points of white which suddenly lengthened out into a horizontal line there was one quite close to the quarter of the willing mind it stretched about the height of the gaff in a line of white the line suddenly descended towards him and became a sheet and then a voice bawled water jump down the companion jump there was a scamper of heavy boots and a roar of water plunging over the bulwarks as though so many loads of wood had been dropped on the deck duncan jumped for the cabin weeks and the mate jumped the next second and the water sluiced down after them put out the fire and washed them choking and wrestling about on the cabin floor weeks was the first to disentangle himself and he turned fiercely on duncan what were you doing on deck upton and i keep the watch tonight you stay below and by god ill see you do it i have fiftytwo boxes of soles to put aboard the fishcutter in the morning and im not going to lose lives before i do that this smacks mine captain weeks was transformed into a savage animal fighting for his own all night he and the mate stood on the deck and plunged down the open companion with a torrent of water to hurry them all night duncan lay in his bunk listening to the bellowing of the wind the great thuds of solid green wave on the deck the horrid rush and roaring of the seas as they broke loose to leeward from under the smacks keel and he listened to something more the whimpering of the bakers assistant in the next bunk three inches of deck whats the use of it lord ha mercy on me whats the use of it no more than an eggshell well be broken in afore morning broken in like a mans skull under a bludgeon im no sailor im not im a baker it isnt right i should die at sea duncan stopped his ears and thought of the journey some one would have to make to the fishcutter in the morning there were fiftytwo boxes of soles to be put aboard he remembered the waves and the swirl of foam upon their crests and the wind two men would be needed to row the boat and the boat must make three trips the skipper and the first hand had been on deck all night there remained four or rather three for the bakers assistant had ceased to count willie weeks deakin and himself not a great number to choose from he felt that he was within an ace of a panic and not so far after all from that whimperer his neighbour two men to row the boat two men his hands clutched at the iron bar of his hammock he closed his eyes tight but the words were thundered out at him overhead in the whistle of the wind and slashed at him by the water against the planks at his side he found that his lips were framing excuses duncan was on deck when the morning broke it broke extraordinarily slowly a niggardly filtering of grey sad light from the under edge of the sea the bare topmasts of the smacks showed one after the other duncan watched each boat as it came into view with a keen suspense this was a ketch and that and that other for there was the peak of its reefed mainsail just visible like a birds wing and at last he saw it the fishcutter lurching and rolling in the very middle of the fleet whither she had crept up in the night he stared at it his belly was pinched with fear as a starvelings with hunger and yet he was conscious that in a way he would have been disappointed if it had not been there no other smack is shipping its fish quavered a voice at his elbow it was the voice of the bakers assistant but this smack is replied weeks and he set his mouth hard and whats more my willie is taking it aboard now wholl go with willie i will weeks swung round on duncan and stared at him then he stared out to sea then he stared again at duncan you when i shipped as a hand on the willing mind i took all a hands risks and brought the willing mind said weeks with a smile go then some one must go get the boat tackle ready forward here willie put your lifebelt on you too duncan though god knows lifebelts wont be of no manner of use but theyll save your insurance steady with the punt there if it slips inboard off the rail there will be a broken back and willie dont get under the cutters counter shell come atop of you and smash you like an egg ill drop you as close as i can to windward and pick you up as close as i can to leeward the boat was dropped into the water and loaded up with fishboxes duncan and willie weeks took their places and the boat slid away into a furrow duncan sat in the boat and rowed willie weeks stood in the stern facing him and rowed and steered water said willie every now and then and a wave curled over the bows and hit duncan a stunning blow on the back row said willie and duncan rowed and rowed his hands were ice he sat in water icecold and his body perspired beneath his oilskins but he rowed once on the crest of a wave duncan looked out and saw below them the deck of a smack and the crew looking upwards at them as though they were a horserace row said willie weeks once too at the bottom of a slope down which they had bumped dizzily duncan again looked out and saw the spar of a mainmast tossing just over the edge of a grey roller row said weeks and a moment later ship your oar and a rope caught him across the chest they were alongside the cutter duncan made fast the rope push her off suddenly cried willie and grasped an oar but he was too late the cutters bulwarks swung down towards him disappeared under water caught the punt fairly beneath the keel and scooped it clean on to the deck cargo and crew and this is only the first trip said willie the two following trips however were made without accident fiftytwo boxes at twopoundten said weeks as the boat was swung inboard thats a hundred and four and ten twos are twenty and carry two and ten fives are fifty and two carried and twenties into that makes twentysix one hundred and thirty pounds this smacks mine every rope on her i tell you what duncan youve done me a good turn today and ill do you another ill land you at helsund in denmark and you can get clear away all we can do now is to lie out this gale before the afternoon the air was dark with a swither of foam and spray blown off the waves in the thickness of a fog the heavy bows of the smack beat into the seas with a thud and a hiss the thud of a steamhammer the hiss of molten iron plunged into water the waves raced exultingly up to the bows from windward and roared angrily away in a spume of foam from the ships keel to lee and the thrumming and screaming of the storm in the rigging exceeded all that duncan had ever imagined he clung to the stays appalled this storm was surely the perfect expression of anger too persistent for mere fury there seemed to be a definite aim of destruction a deliberate attempt to wear the boat down in the steady follow of wave upon wave and in the steady volume of the wind captain weeks too had lost all of a sudden all his exhilaration he stood moodily by duncans side his mind evidently labouring like his ship he told duncan stories which duncan would rather not have listened to the story of the man who slipped as he stepped from the deck into the punt and weighted by his boots had sunk down and down and down through the clearest calmest water without a struggle the story of the punt which got its painter under its keel and drowned three men the story of the fullrigged ship which got driven across the sevenfathom part of the dogger the part that looks like a mans leg in the chart and which was turned upsidedown through the bank breaking the skipper and the mate got outside and clung to her bottom and a steamcutter tried to get them off but smashed them both with her iron counter instead look said weeks gloomily pointing his finger i dont know why that breaker didnt hit us i dont know what we should have done if it had i cant think why it didnt hit us are you saved duncan was taken aback and answered vaguely i hope so but you must know said weeks perplexed the wind made a theological discussion difficult weeks curved his hand into a trumpet and bawled into duncans ear you are either saved or not saved its a thing one knows you must know if you are saved if youve felt the glow and illumination of it he suddenly broke off into a shout of triumph but i got my fish on board the cutter the willing minds the ony boat that did then he relapsed again into melancholy but im troubled about the poachin the temptation was great but it wasnt right and im not sure but what this storm aint a judgment he was silent for a little and then cheered up i tell you what since were hoveto well have a prayermeeting in the cabin tonight and smooth things over the meeting was held after tea by the light of a smoking paraffinlamp with a broken chimney the crew sat round and smoked the companion was open so that the swish of the water and the man on deck alike joined in the hymns rail the bakers assistant who had once been a steady attendant at revivalist meetings led off with a moody and sankey hymn and the crew followed bawling at the top pitch of their lungs with now and then some suggestion of a tune the little stuffy cabin rang with the noise it burst upwards through the companionway loud and earnest and plaintive and the winds caught it and carried it over the water a thin and appealing cry after the hymn weeks prayed aloud and extempore and most seriously he prayed for each member of the crew by name one by one taking the opportunity to mention in detail each fault which he had had to complain of and begging that the offenders chastisement might be light of duncan he spoke in ambiguous terms o lord he prayed a strange gentleman mr duncan has come amongst us o lord we do not know as much about mr duncan as you do but still bless him o lord and so he came to himself o lord this smacks mine this little smack labouring in the north sea is mine through my poachin and your lovin kindness its mine and o lord see that it dont cost me dear and the crew solemnly and fervently said amen but the smack was to cost him dear for in the morning duncan woke to find himself alone in the cabin he thrust his head up the companion and saw weeks with a very grey face standing by the lashed wheel halloa said duncan wheres the binnacle overboard said weeks duncan looked round the deck wheres willie and the crew overboard said weeks all except rail hes below deck forward and clean daft listen and youll hear im hes singing hymns for those in peril on the sea duncan stared in disbelief the skippers face drove the disbelief out of him why didnt you wake me he asked whats the use you want all the sleep you can get because you an me have got to sail my smack into yarmouth but i was minded to call you lad he said with a sort of cry leaping from his throat the wave struck us at about twelve and its been mighty lonesome on deck since with willie callin out of the sea all night hes been callin out of the welter of the sea funny that i havent heard upton or deakin but ony willie all night until daybreak he called first on one side of the smack and then on tother i dont think ill tell his mother that an i dont see how im to put you on shore in denmark after all what had happened duncan put together from the curt utterances of captain weeks and the crazy lamentations of rail weeks had roused all hands except duncan to take the last reef in they were forward by the mainmast at the time the wave struck them weeks himself was on the boom threading the reefingrope through the eye of the sail he shouted water and the water came on board carrying the three men aft upton was washed over the taffrail weeks threw one end of the rope down and rail and willie caught it and were swept overboard dragging weeks from the boom on to the deck and jamming him against the bulwarks the captain held on to the rope setting his feet against the side the smack lifted and dropped and tossed and each movement wrenched his arms he could not reach a cleat had he moved he would have been jerked overboard i cant hold you both he cried and then setting his teeth and hardening his heart he addressed his words to his son willie i cant hold you both and immediately the weight upon the rope was less with each drop of the stern the rope slackened and weeks gathered the slack in he could now afford to move he made the rope fast and hauled the one survivor on deck he looked at him for a moment thank god its not my son he had the courage to say and my hearts broke had gasped rail fair broke and he had gone forward and sung hymns they saw little more of rall he came aft and fetched his meals away but he was crazed and made a sort of kennel for himself forward and the two men left on the smack had enough upon their hands to hinder them from waiting on him the gale showed no sign of abatement the fleet was scattered no glimpse of the sun was visible at any time and the compass was somewhere at the bottom of the sea we may be making a bit of headway noth or a bit of leeway west said weeks or we may be doing a sternboard all that im sure of is that you and me are one day going to open gorleston harbour this smacks cost me too dear for me to lose her now lucky theres the telltale compass in the cabin to show us the wind hasnt shifted all the energy of the man was concentrated upon this wrestle with the gale for the ownership of the willing mind and he imparted his energy to his companion they lived upon deck wet and starved and perishing with the cold the cold of december in the north sea when the spray cuts the face like a whipcord they ate by snatches when they could which was seldom and they slept by snatches when they could which was even less often and at the end of the fourth day there came a blinding fall of snow and sleet which drifted down the companion sheeted the ropes with ice and hung the yards with icicles and which made every inch of brass a searingiron and every yard of the deck a danger to the foot it was when this storm began to fall that weeks grasped duncan fiercely by the shoulder what is it you did on land he cried confess it man there may be some chance for us if you go down on your knees and confess it duncan turned as fiercely upon weeks both men were overstrained with want of food and sleep im not your jonah dont fancy it i did nothing on land then what did you come out for what did you to fight and wrestle for your ship eh well i came out to fight and wrestle for my immortal soul and let it go at that weeks turned away and as he turned slipped on the frozen deck a lurch of the smack sent him sliding into the rudderchains where he lay once he tried to rise and fell back duncan hauled himself along the bulwarks to him hurt leg broke get me down into the cabin lucky theres the telltale well get the willing mind berthed by the quay see if we dont that was still his one thought his one belief duncan hitched a rope round weeks underneath his arms and lowered him as gently as he could down the companion lift me on to the table so that my heads just beneath the compass right now take a turn with the rope underneath the table or ill roll off push an oily under my head and then go forard and see if you can find a fishbox take a look that the wheels fast it seemed to duncan that the last chance was gone there was just one inexperienced amateur to change the sails and steer a seventyton ketch across the north sea into yarmouth roads he said nothing however of his despair to the indomitable man upon the table and went forward in search of a fishbox he split up the sides into rough splints and came aft with them thank ee lad said weeks just cut my boot away and fix it up best you can the tossing of the smack made the operation difficult and long weeks however never uttered a groan only duncan once looked up and said halloa youve hurt your face too theres blood on your chin thats all right said weeks with an effort i reckon ive just bit through my lip duncan stopped his work youve got a medicinechest skipper with some laudanum in it darent replied weeks theres ony you and me to work the ship fix up the job quick as you can and ill have a drink of friars balsam afterwards seems to me the gales blowing itself out and if ony the wind holds in the same quarter and thereupon he fainted duncan bandaged up the leg got weeks round gave him a drink of friars balsam set the teapot within his reach and went on deck the wind was going down the air was clearer of foam he tallowed the lead and heaved it and brought it down to weeks weeks looked at the sand stuck on the tallow and tasted it and seemed pleased this gives me my longitude said he but not my latitude worse luck still well manage it youd better get our dinner now any odd thing in the way of biscuits or a bit of cold fish will do and then i think well be able to run after dinner duncan said ill put her about now no wear her and let her jibe said weeks then youll ony have to ease your sheets duncan stood at the wheel while weeks with the compass swinging above his head shouted directions through the companion they sailed the boat all that night with the wind on her quarter and at daybreak duncan brought her to and heaved his lead again there was rough sand with blackish specks upon the tallow and weeks when he saw it forgot his broken leg my word he cried weve hit the fisher bank youd best lash the wheel get our breakfast and take a spell of sleep on deck tie a string to your finger and pass it down to me so that i can wake you up weeks waked him up at ten oclock and they ran southwest with a steady wind till six when weeks shouted take another cast with your lead the sand upon the tallow was white like salt yes said weeks i thought we was hereabouts were on the edge of the dogger and well be in yarmouth by the morning and all through the night the orders came thick and fast from the cabin weeks was on his own ground he had no longer any need of the lead he seemed no longer to need his eyes he felt his way across the currents from the dogger to the english coast and at daybreak he shouted can you see land theres a mist lie to then till the suns up duncan lay the boat to for a couple of hours till the mist was tinged with gold and the ball of the sun showed red on his starboard quarter the mist sank the brown sails of a smack thrust upwards through it coastwards it shifted and thinned and thickened as though cunningly to excite expectation as to what it hid again weeks called out see anything yes said duncan in a perplexed voice i see something looks like a sort of mediaeval castle on a rock a shout of laughter answered him thats the gorleston hotel the harbourmouths just beneath weve hit it fine and while he spoke the mist swept clear and the long treeless esplanade of yarmouth lay there a couple of miles from duncans eyes glistening and gilded in the sun like a row of dolls houses haul in your sheets a bit said weeks keep noth of the hotel for the tidell set you up and well sail her in without dawdlin behind a tug get your mainsail down as best you can before you make the entrance half an hour afterwards the smack sailed between the pierheads who are you cried the harbourmaster the willing mind the willing minds reported lost with all hands well heres the willing mind said duncan and heres one of the hands the irrepressible voice bawled up the companion to complete the sentence and the owners reposin in his cabin but in a lower key he added words for his own ears theres the old woman to meet lord but the willing mind has cost me dear how barrington returned to johannesburg norris wanted a holiday he stood in the marketplace looking southwards to the chimneystacks and dilating upon the subject to three of his friends he was sick of the stock exchange the men the women the drinks the dances everything he was as indifferent to the price of shares as to the rise and fall of the quicksilver in his barometer he neither desired to go in on the ground floor nor to come out in the attics he simply wanted to get clean away besides he foresaw a slump and he would be actually saving money on the veld at this point teddy isaacs strolled up and interrupted the oration where are you off to then manicaland answered norris oh you had better bring barrington back teddy isaacs was a fresh comer to the rand and knew no better barrington meant to him nothing more than the name of a man who had been lost twelve months before on the eastern borders of mashonaland but he saw three pairs of eyebrows lift simultaneously and heard three simultaneous outbursts on the latest uitlander grievance however norris answered him quietly enough yes if i come across barrington ill bring him back he nodded his head once or twice and smiled you may make sure of that he added and turned away from the group isaacs gathered that there had been trouble between barrington and morris and applied to his companions for information the commencement of the trouble he was told dated back to the time when the two men were ostrichfarming side by side close to port elizabeth in the cape colony norris owned a wife barrington did not the story was sufficiently ugly as johannesburg was accustomed to relate it but upon this occasion teddy isaacs was allowed to infer the details he was merely put in possession of the more immediate facts barrington had left the cape colony in a hurry and coming north to the transvaal when johannesburg was as yet in its brief infancy had prospered exceedingly meanwhile norris as the ostrich industry declined had gone from worse to worse and finally he too drifted to johannesburg with the rest of the flotsam of south africa he came to the town alone and met barrington one morning eye to eye on the stock exchange a certain amount of natural disappointment was expressed when the pair were seen to separate without hostilities but it was subsequently remarked that they were fighting out their duel though not in the conventional way they fought with shares and barrington won he had the clearer head and besides norris didnt need much ruining barrington could see to that in his spare time it was in fact as though norris stood up with a derringer to face a machine gun his turn however had come after barringtons disappearance and he was now able to contemplate an expedition into manicaland without reckoning up his passbook he bought a buckwagon with a tent covering over the hinder part provisions sufficient for six months a span of oxen a couple of horses salted for the thickhead sickness hired a griqua lad as wagondriver and half a dozen matabele boys who were waiting for a chance to return and started northeastward from johannesburg he travelled to makonis town near the zimbabwe ruins and with half a dozen brass rings and an empty cartridge case hired a maongwi boy who had been up to the mashonaland plateau before the lad guided him to the head waters of the inyazuri and there norris fenced in his camp in a grass country fairly wooded and studded with gigantic blocks of granite the maongwi boy chose the site fifty yards west of an antheap and about a quarter of a mile from a forest of machabel he had camped on the spot before he said when asked norris twice replied the boy three years ago and last year last year norris looked up with a start of surprise you were up here last year yes for a moment or two norris puffed at his pipe then he asked slowly who with mr barrington the boy told him and added it is his wagontrack which we have been following norris rose from the ground and walked straight ahead for the distance of a hundred yards until he reached a jasmine bush which stood in a beeline with the opening of his camp fence thence he moved round in a semicircle until he came upon a wagontrack in the rear of the camp and after pausing there he went forward again and completed the circle he returned to his wagon chuckling barrington he remembered had been lost while travelling northwards to the zambesie but the track stopped here there was not a trace of it to the north or the east or the west it was evident that the boy had chosen barringtons last campingground as the site for his own and he discovered a comforting irony in the fact he felt that he was standing in barringtons shoes that night as he was smoking by the fire he called out to the maongwi boy the lad came forward from his hut behind the wagon tell me how you lost him said norris he rode that way alone after a sable antelope the boy pointed an arm to the southwest the beast was wounded and we followed its bloodspoor we found mr barringtons horse gored by the antelopes horns he himself had gone forward on foot we tracked him to a little stream but the opposite bank was trampled and we lost all sign of him this is what the boy said though his language is translated norris remained upon this encampment for a fortnight blue wildebeests koodoos elands and gemsbok were plentiful and once he got a shot at a warthog boar at the end of the fortnight he walked round the antheap early one morning and of a sudden plumped down full length in the grass straight in front of him he saw a herd of buffaloes moving in his direction down a glade of the forest a quarter of a mile away norris cast a glance backwards the camp was hidden from the herd by the intervening antheap he looked again towards the forest the buffaloes advanced slowly pasturing as they moved norris crawled behind the antheap on his hands and knees ran thence into the camp buckled on a belt of cartridges snatched up a bore metford rifle and got back to his position just as the first of the herd stepped into the open it turned to the right along the edge of the wood and the others followed in file norris wriggled forward through the grass and selecting a fat bull in the centre of the line aimed behind its shoulder and fired the herd stampeded into the forest the bull fell in its tracks norris sprang forward with a shout but he had not run more than thirty yards before the bull began to kick it kneeled upon its forelegs rose thence on to its hind legs and finally stood up norris guessed what had happened he had hit the bull in the neck instead of behind the shoulders and had broken no bones he fired his second barrel as the brute streamed away in an oblique line southeastwards from the wood and missed then he ran back to camp slapped a bridle on to his swiftest horse and without waiting to saddle it sprang on its back and galloped in pursuit he rode as it were along the base of a triangle whereas the bull galloped from the apex and since his breakfast was getting hot behind him he wished to make that triangle an isosceles so he jammed his heels into his horses ribs and was fast drawing within easy range when the buffalo got his wind and swerved on the instant into a diagonal course due southwest the manoeuvre left norris directly behind his quarry and with a long stern chase in prospect however his blood was up and he held on to wear the beast down he forgot his breakfast he took no more than a casual notice of the direction he was following he simply braced his knees in a closer grip while the distorted shadows of himself and the horse lengthened and thinned along the ground as the sun rose over his right shoulder suddenly the buffalo disappeared in a dip of the veld and a few moments later came again into view a good hundred yards further to the south norris pulled his left rein and made for the exact spot at which the bull had reappeared he found himself on the edge of a tiny cliff which dropped twenty feet in a sheer fall to a little stream and he was compelled to ride along the bank until he reached the incline which the buffalo had descended he forded the stream galloped under the opposite bank across a patch of ground which had been trampled into mud by the hoofs of beasts coming here to water and mounted again to the open the bull had gained a quarter of a miles grace from his mistake and was heading straight for a huge cone of granite norris recognised the cone it towered up from the veld its cliffs seamed into gullies by the rainwash of ages and he had used it more than once as a landmark during the last fortnight for it rose due southwest of his camp he watched the bull approach the cone and vanish into one of the gullies it did not reappear and he rode forward keeping a close eye upon the gully as he came opposite to it however he saw through the opening a vista of green trees flashing in the sunlight he turned his horse through the passage and reined up in a granite amphitheatre the floor seemed about half a mile in diameter it was broken into hillocks and strewn with patches of a dense undergrowth while here and there a big tree grew the walls which converged slightly towards an open top were robed from summit to base with wild flowers so that the whole circumference of the cone was one blaze of colour norris hitched forward and reloaded the rifle then he advanced slowly between the bushes on the alert for a charge from the wounded bull but nothing stirred no sound came to his ears except the soft padding noise of his horses hoofs upon the turf there was not a crackle of the brushwood and the trees seemed carved out of metal he rode through absolute silence in a suspension of all movement once his horse trod upon a bough and the snapping of the twigs sounded like so many cracks of a pistol at first the silence struck norris as merely curious a little later as very lonesome once or twice he stopped his horse with a sudden jerk of the reins and sat crouched forwards with his neck outstretched listening once or twice he cast a quick furtive glance over his shoulder to make certain that no one stood between himself and the entrance to the hollow he forgot the buffalo he caught himself labouring his breath and found it necessary to elaborately explain the circumstance in his thoughts on the ground of heat the next moment he began to plead this heat not merely as an excuse for his uneasiness but as a reason for returning to camp the heat was intense he argued above him the light of an african midday sun poured out of a brassy sky into a sort of inverted funnel and lay in blinding pools upon the scattered slabs of rock within the hollow every cup of the innumerable flowers which tapestried the cliffs seemed a mouth breathing heat he became possessed with a parching thirst and he felt his tongue heavy and fibrous like a dried fig there was however one obstacle which prevented him from acting upon his impulse and that obstacle was his sense of shame it was not so much that he thought it cowardly to give up the chase and quietly return but he knew that the second after he had given way he would be galloping madly towards the entrance in no childs panic of terror he finally compromised matters by dropping the reins upon his horses neck in the unformulated hope that the animal would turn of its own accord but the horse kept straight on as norris drew towards the innermost wall of granite there was a quick rustle all across its face as though the screen of shrubs and flowers had been fluttered by a draught of wind norris drew himself erect with a distinct appearance of relief loosened the clench of his fingers upon his rifle and began once more to search the bushes for the buffalo for a moment his attention was arrested by a queer object lying upon the ground to his left it was in shape something like a melon but bigger and it seemed to be plastered over with a black mould norris rode by it turned a corner and then with a gasp reined back his horse upon its haunches straight in front of him a broken rifle lay across the path norris stood still and stared at it stupidly some vague recollection floated elusively through his brain he tried to grasp and fix it clearly in his mind it was a recollection of something which had happened a long while ago in england when he was at school suddenly he remembered it was not something which had happened but something he had read under the great elm trees in the close it was that passage in robinson crusoe which tells of the naked footprint in the sand norris dismounted and stooped to lift the rifle but all at once he straightened himself and swung round with his arms guarding his head there was no one however behind him and he gave a little quavering laugh and picked up the rifle it was a heavy lobore holland a holland with a single barrel and that barrel was twisted like a corkscrew the lock had been wrenched off and there were marks upon the stock marks of teeth and other queer unintelligible marks as well norris held the rifle in his hands gazing vacantly straight ahead he was thinking of the direction in which he had come southwest and of the stream which he had crossed and of the patch of trampled mud where track obliterated track he dropped the rifle it rang upon a stone and again the screen of foliage shivered and rustled norris however paid no attention to the movement but ran back to that object which he had passed and took it in his hands it was oval in shape being slightly broader at one end than the other norris drew his knife and cleaned the mould from one side of it to the touch of the blade it seemed softer than stone and smoother than wood more like bone he said to himself in the side which he had cleaned there was a little round hole filled up with mould norris dug his knife in and scraped round the hole as one cleans a caked pipe he drew out a little cube of mud there was a second corresponding hole on the other side he turned the narrower end of the thing upwards it was hollow he saw but packed full of mould and more deliberately packed for there were fingermarks in the mould what an aimless trick he muttered vaguely he carried the thing back to the rifle and comparing them understood those queer marks upon the stock they were the mark of fingers of human fingers impressed faintly upon the wood with superhuman strength he was holding the rifle in his hands and looking down at it but he saw below the rifle and he saw that his knees were shaking in a palsy on an instant he tossed the rifle away and laughed to reassure himself laughed out boldly once twice and then he stopped with his eyes riveted upon the granite wall at each laugh that he gave the shrubs and flowers rippled and shook the sunlight from their leaves for the first time he remarked the coincidence as something strange he lifted up his face but not a breath of air fanned it he looked across the hollow the trees and bushes stood immobile he laughed a third time louder than before and all at once his laughter got hold of him he sent it pealing out hysterically burst after burst until the hollow seemed brimming with the din of it his body began to twist he beat time to his laughter with his feet and then he danced he danced there alone in the african sunlight faster and faster with a mad tossing of his limbs and with his laughter grown to a yell and as though to keep pace with him each moment the shiver of the foliage increased up and down crosswise and breadthwise the flowers were tossed and flung while their petals rained down the cliffs face in a purple storm it appeared indeed to norris that the very granite walls were moving in the midst of his dance he kicked something and stumbled he stopped dead when he saw what that something was it was the queer mudplastered object which he had compared with the broken rifle and the sight of it recalled him to his wits he tucked it hastily beneath his jacket and looked about him for his horse the horse was standing behind him some distance away and nearer to the cliff norris snatched up his own rifle and ran towards it his hand was on the horses mane when just above its head he noticed a clean patch of granite and across that space he saw a huge grey baboon leap and then another and another he turned about and looked across to the opposite wall straining his eyes and a second later to the wall on his right then he understood the twisted rifle the finger marks this thing which he held under his coat he understood them all the walls of the hollow were alive with baboons and the baboons were making along the cliffs for the entrance norris sprang on to his horse and kicked and beat it into a gallop he had only to traverse the length of a diameter he told himself the baboons the circumference of a circle he had covered threequarters of the distance when he heard a grunt and from a bush fifty yards ahead the buffalo sprang out and came charging down at him norris gave one scream of terror and with that his nerves steadied themselves he knew that it was no use firing at the front of a buffalos head when the beast was charging he pulled a rein and swerved to the left the bull made a corresponding turn a moment afterwards norris swerved back into his former course and shot just past the bulls flanks he made no attempt to shoot them he held his rifle ready in his hands and looked forwards when he was fifty yards from the passage he saw the first baboon perched upon a shoulder of rock above the entrance he lifted his rifle and fired at a venture he saw the brutes arms wave in the air and heard a dull thud on the ground behind him as he drove through the gully and out on to the open veld the next morning norris broke up his camp and started homewards for johannesburg he went down to the stock exchange on the day of his arrival and chanced upon teddy isaacs whats that asked isaacs touching a bulge of his coat that replied norris unfastening the buttons i told you i would bring back barrington if i found him and he trundled a scoured and polished skull across the floor of the stock exchange hatteras the story was told to us by james walker in the cabin of a seventon cutter one night when we lay anchored in helford river it was towards the end of september during this last week the air had grown chilly with the dusk and the sea when it lost the sun took on a leaden and a dreary look there was no other boat in the wooded creek and the swish of the tide against the planks had a very lonesome sound all the circumstances i think provoked walker to tell the story but most of all the lonely swish of the tide against the planks for it is the story of a mans loneliness and the strange ways into which loneliness misled him however let the story speak for itself hatteras and walker had been schoolfellows though never schoolmates hatteras indeed was the head of the school and prophecy vaguely sketched out for him a brilliant career in some service of importance the definite law however that the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children overbore the prophecy hatteras the father disorganised his sons future by dropping unexpectedly through one of the trap ways of speculation into the bankruptcy court beneath just two months before hatteras the son was to have gone up to oxford the lad was therefore compelled to start life in a stony world with a stock in trade which consisted of a school boys command of the classics a real inborn gift of tongues and the friendship of james walker the last item proved of the most immediate value for walker whose father was the junior partner in a firm of west african merchants obtained for hatteras an employment as the bookkeeper at a branch factory in the bight of benin thus the friends parted hatteras went out to west africa alone and met with a strange welcome on the day when he landed the incident did not come to walkers ears until some time afterwards nor when he heard of it did he at once appreciate the effect which it had upon hatteras but chronologically it comes into the story at this point and so may as well be immediately told there was no settlement very near to the factory it stood by itself on the swamps of the forcados river with the mangrove forest closing in about it accordingly the captain of the steamer just put hatteras ashore in a boat and left him with his traps on the beach halfadozen kru boys had come down from the factory to receive him but they could speak no english and hatteras at this time could speak no kru so that although there was no lack of conversation there was not much interchange of thought at last hatteras pointed to his traps the kru boys picked them up and preceded hatteras to the factory they mounted the steps to the verandah on the first floor and laid their loads down then they proceeded to further conversation hatteras gathered from their excited faces and gestures that they wished to impart information but he could make neither head nor tail of a word they said and at last he retired from the din of their chatter through the windows of a room which gave on the verandah and sat down to wait for his superior the agent it was early in the morning when hatteras landed and he waited until midday patiently in the afternoon it occurred to him that the agent would have shown a kindly consideration if he had left a written message or an intelligible kru boy to receive him it is true that the blacks came in at intervals and chattered and gesticulated but matters were not thereby appreciably improved he did not like to go poking about the house so he contemplated the mudbanks and the mudriver and the mangrove forest and cursed the agent the country was very quiet there are few things in the world quieter than a west african forest in the daytime it is obtrusively emphatically quiet it does not let you forget how singularly quiet it is and towards sundown the quietude began to jar on hatteras nerves he was besides very hungry to while away the time he took a stroll round the verandah he walked along the side of the house towards the back and as he neared the back he head a humming sound the further he went the louder it grew it was something like the hum of a mill only not so metallic and not so loud and it came from the rear of the house hatteras turned the corner and what he saw was this a shuttered window and a cloud of flies the flies were not aimlessly swarming outside the window they streamed in through the lattices of the shutters in a busy practical way they came in columns from the forest and converged upon the shutters and the hum sounded from within the room hatteras looked about for a kru boy just for the sake of company but at that moment there was not one to be seen he felt the cold strike at his spine he went back to the room in which he had been sitting he sat again but he sat shivering the agent had left no work for him the kru boys had been anxious to explain something the humming of the flies about that shuttered window seemed to hatteras to have more explicit language than the kru boys chatterings he penetrated into the interior of the house and reckoned up the doors he opened one of them ever so slightly and the buzzing came through like the hum of a wheel in a factory revolving in the collar of a strap he flung the door open and stood upon the threshold the atmosphere of the room appalled him he felt the sweat break cold upon his forehead and a deadly sickness in all his body then he nerved himself to enter at first he saw little because of the gloom in a moment however he made out a bed stretched along the wall and a thing stretched upon the bed the thing was more or less shapeless because it was covered with a black furry sort of rug hatteras however had little trouble in defining it he knew now for certain what it was that the kru boys had been so anxious to explain to him he approached the bed and bent over it and as he bent over it the horrible thing occurred which left so vivid an impression on hatteras the black furry rug suddenly lifted itself from the bed beat about hatteras face and dissolved into flies the kru boys found hatteras in a dead swoon on the floor halfanhour later and next day of course he was down with the fever the agent had died of it three days before hatteras recovered from the fever but not from the impression it left him with a prevailing sense of horror and at first with a sense of disgust too its a damned obscene country he would say but he stayed in it for he had no choice all the money which he could save went to the support of his family and for six years the firm he served moved him from district to district from factory to factory now the second item in the stock in trade was a gift of tongues and about this time it began to bring him profit wherever hatteras was posted he managed to pick up a native dialect and with the dialect inevitably a knowledge of native customs dialects are numerous on the west coast and at the end of six years hatteras could speak as many of them as some traders could enumerate languages ran in his blood because he acquired a reputation for knowledge and was offered service under the niger protectorate so that when two years later walker came out to africa to open a new branch factory at a settlement on the bonny river he found hatteras stationed in command there hatteras in fact went down to bonny river town to meet the steamer which brought his friend i say dick you look bad said walker people arent as a rule offensively robust about these parts i know that but your the weariest bag of bones ive ever seen well look at yourself in a glass a year from now for my double said hatteras and the pair went up river together your factorys next to the residency said hatteras theres a compound to each running down to the river and theres a palisade between the compounds ive cut a little gate in the palisade as it will shorten the way from one house to the other the wicket gate was frequently used during the next few months indeed more frequently than walker imagined he was only aware that when they were both at home hatteras would come through it of an evening and smoke on his verandah then he would sit for hours cursing the country raving about the lights in piccadillycircus and offering his immortal soul in exchange for a comicopera tune played upon a barrelorgan walker possessed a big atlas and one of hatteras chief diversions was to trace with his finger a beeline across the african continent and the bay of biscay until he reached london more rarely walker would stroll over to the residency but he soon came to notice that hatteras had a distinct preference for the factory and for the factory verandah the reason for the preference puzzled walker considerably he drew a quite erroneous conclusion that hatteras was hiding at the residency well some one whom it was prudent especially in an official to conceal he abandoned the conclusion however when he discovered that his friend was in the habit of making solitary expeditions at times hatteras would be absent for a couple of days at times for a week and so far as walker could ascertain he never so much as took a servant with him to keep him company he would simply announce at night his intended departure and in the morning he would be gone nor on his return did he ever offer to walker any explanation of his journeys on one occasion however walker broached the subject hatteras had come back the night before and he sat crouched up in a deck chair looking intently into the darkness of the forest i say asked walker isnt it rather dangerous to go slumming about west africa alone hatteras did not reply for a moment he seemed not to have heard the suggestion and when he did speak it was to ask a quite irrelevant question have you ever seen the horse guards parade on a dark rainy night he asked but he never moved his head he never took his eyes from the forest the wet level of ground looks just like a lagoon and the arches a venice palace above it but look here dick said walker keeping to his subject you never leave word when you are coming back one never knows that you have come back until you show yourself the morning after i think said hatteras slowly that the finest sight in the world is to be seen from the bridge in st jamess park when theres a state ball on at buckingham palace and the light from the windows reddens the lake and the carriages glance about the mall like fireflies even your servants dont know when you come back said walker oh said hatteras quietly so you have been asking questions of my servants i had a good reason replied walker your safety and with that the conversation dropped walker watched hatteras hatteras watched the forest a west african mangrove forest at night is full of the eeriest queerest sounds that ever a mans ears harkened to and the sounds come not so much from the birds or the soughing of the branches they seem to come from the swamp life underneath the branches at the roots of trees theres a ceaseless stir as of a myriad of reptiles creeping in the slime listen long enough and you will fancy that you hear the whirr and rush of innumerable crabs the flapping of innumerable fish now and again a more distinctive sound emerges from the rest the croaking of a bullfrog the whining cough of a crocodile at such sounds hatteras would start up in his chair and cock his head like a dog in a room that hears another dog barking in the street doesnt it sound damned wicked he said with a queer smile of enjoyment walker did not answer the light from a lamp in the room behind them struck obliquely upon hatteras face and slanted off from it in a narrowing column until it vanished in a yellow thread among the leaves of the trees it showed that the same enjoyment which ran in hatteras voice was alive upon his face his eyes his ears were alert and he gently opened and shut his mouth with a little clicking of the teeth in some horrible way he seemed to have something in common with he appeared almost to participate in the activity of the swamp thus had walker often seen him sit but never with the light so clear upon his face and the sight gave to him a quite new impression of his friend he wondered whether all these months his judgment had been wrong and out of that wonder a new thought sprang into his mind dick he said this house of mine stands between your house and the forest it stands on the borders of the trees on the edge of the swamp is that why you always prefer it to your own hatteras turned his head quickly towards his companion almost suspiciously then he looked back into the darkness and after a little he said its not only the things you care about old man which tug at you its the things you hate as well i hate this country i hate these miles and miles of mangroves and yet i am fascinated i cant get the forest and the undergrowth out of my mind i dream of them at nights i dream that i am sinking into that black oily batter of mud listen and he suddenly broke off with his head stretched forwards doesnt it sound wicked but all this talk about london cried walker oh dont you understand interrupted hatteras roughly then he changed his tone and gave his reason one has to struggle against a fascination of that sort its devils work so for all i am worth i talk about london look here dick said walker you had better get leave and go back to the old country for a spell a very solid piece of advice said hatteras and he went home to the residency ii the next morning he had again disappeared but walker discovered upon his table a couple of new volumes he glanced at the titles they were burtons account of his pilgrimage to almadinah and mecca five nights afterwards walker was smoking a pipe on the verandah when he fancied that he heard a rubbing scuffling sound as if some one very cautiously was climbing over the fence of his compound the moon was low in the sky and dipping down toward the forest indeed the rim of it touched the treetops so that while a full half of the enclosure was bare to the yellow light that half which bordered on the forest was inky black in shadow and it was from the furthest corner of this second half that the sound came walker bent forward listening he heard the sound again and a moment after another sound which left him in no doubt for in that dark corner he knew that a number of palisades for repairing the fence were piled and the second sound which he heard was a rattle as some one stumbled against them walker went inside and fetched a rifle when he came back he saw a negro creeping across the bright open space towards the residency walker hailed to him to stop instead the negro ran he ran towards the wicket gate in the palisades walker shouted again the figure only ran the faster he had covered half the distance before walker fired he clutched his right forearm with his left hand but he did not stop walker fired again this time at his legs and the man dropped to the ground walker heard his servants stirring as he ran down the steps he crossed quickly to the negro and the negro spoke to him but in english and with the voice of hatteras for gods sake keep your servants off walker ran to the house met his servants at the foot of the steps and ordered them back he had shot at a monkey he said then he returned to hatteras dicky are you hurt he whispered you hit me each time you fired but not very badly i think he bandaged hatteras arm and thigh with strips of his shirt and waited by his side until the house was quiet then he lifted him and carried him across the enclosure to the steps and up the steps into his bedroom it was a long and fatiguing process for one thing walker dared make no noise and must needs tread lightly with his load for another the steps were steep and ricketty with a narrow balustrade on each side waist high it seemed to walker that the day would dawn before he reached the top once or twice hatteras stirred in his arms and he feared the man would die then and there for all the time his blood dripped and pattered like heavy raindrops on the wooden steps walker laid hatteras on his bed and examined his wounds one bullet had passed through the fleshy part of the forearm the other through the fleshy part of his right thigh but no bones were broken and no arteries cut walker lit a fire baked some plaintain leaves and applied them as a poultice then he went out with a pail of water and scrubbed down the steps again he dared not make any noise and it was close on daybreak before he had done his nights work however was not ended he had still to cleanse the black stain from hatteras skin and the sun was up before he stretched a rug upon the ground and went to sleep with his back against the door walker hatteras called out in a low voice an hour or so later walker woke up and crossed over to the bed dicky im frightfully sorry i couldnt know it was you thats all right jim dont you worry about that what i wanted to say was that nobody had better know it wouldnt do would it if it got about oh i am not so sure people would think it rather a creditable proceeding hatteras shot a puzzled look at his friend walker however did not notice it and continued i saw burtons account of his pilgrimage in your room i might have known that journeys of the kind were just the sort of thing to appeal to you oh yes thats it said hatteras lifting himself up in bed he spoke eagerly perhaps a thought too eagerly yes thats it i have always been keen on understanding the native thoroughly its after all no less than ones duty if one has to rule them and since i could speak their lingo he broke off and returned to the subject which had prompted him to rouse walker but all the same it wouldnt do if the natives got to know theres no difficulty about that said walker ill give out that you have come back with the fever and that i am nursing you fortunately theres no doctor handy to come making inconvenient examinations hatteras knew something of surgery and under his directions walker poulticed and bandaged him until he recovered the bandaging however was amateurish and as a result the muscles contracted in hatteras thigh and he limped ever so slightly still he limped he limped to his dying day he did not however on that account abandon his explorations and more than once walker when his lights were out and he was smoking a pipe on the verandah would see a black figure with a trailing walk cross his compound and pass stealthily through the wicket in the fence walker took occasion to expostulate with his friend its too dangerous a game for a man to play for any length of time it is doubly dangerous now that you limp you ought to give it up hatteras made a strange reply ill try to he said walker pondered over the words for some time he set them side by side in his thoughts with that confession which hatteras had made to him one evening he asked himself whether after all hatteras explanation of his conduct was sincere whether it was really a desire to know the native thoroughly which prompted these mysterious expeditions and then he remembered that he himself had first suggested the explanation to hatteras walker began to feel uneasy more than uneasy actually afraid on his friends account hatteras had acknowledged that the country fascinated him and fascinated him through its hideous side was this masquerading as a black man a further proof of the fascination was it as it were a step downwards towards a closer association walker sought to laugh the notion from his mind but it returned and returned and here and there an incident occurred to give it strength and colour for instance on one occasion after hatteras had been three weeks absent walker sauntered over to the residency towards four oclock in the afternoon hatteras was trying cases in the courthouse which formed the ground floor of the residency walker stepped into the room it was packed with a naked throng of blacks and the heat was overpowering at the end of the hall sat hatteras his worn face shone out amongst the black heads about him white and waxy like a gardenia in a bouquet of black flowers walker invented his simile and realised its appositeness at one and the same moment bouquet was not an inappropriate word since there is a penetrating aroma about the native of the niger delta when he begins to perspire walker however thinking that the court would rise determined to wait for a little but at the last moment a negro was put up to answer to a charge of participation in fetish rites the case seemed sufficiently clear from the outset but somehow hatteras delayed its conclusion there was evidence and unrebutted evidence of the usual details human sacrifice mutilations and the like but hatteras pressed for more he sat until it was dusk and then had candles brought into the courthouse he seemed indeed not so much to be investigating the negros guilt as to be adding to his own knowledge of fetish ceremonials and walker could not but perceive that he took more than a merely scientific pleasure in the increase of his knowledge his face appeared to smooth out his eyes became quick interested almost excited and walker again had the queer impression that hatteras was in spirit participating in the loathsome ceremonies and participating with an intense enjoyment in the end the negro was convicted and the court rose but he might have been convicted a good three hours before walker went home shaking his head he seemed to be watching a man deliberately divesting himself of his humanity it seemed as though the white man were ambitious to decline into the black hatteras was growing into an uncanny creature his friend began to foresee a time when he should hold him in loathing and horror and the next morning helped to confirm him in that forecast for walker had to make an early start down river for bonny town and as he stood on the landingstage hatteras came down to him from the residency you heard that negro tried yesterday he asked with an assumption of carelessness yes and condemned what of him he escaped last night its a bad business isnt it walker nodded in reply and his boat pushed off but it stuck in his mind for the greater part of that day that the prison adjoined the courthouse and so formed part of the ground floor of the residency had hatteras connived at his escape had the judge secretly set free the prisoner whom he had publicly condemned the question troubled walker considerably during his month of absence and stood in the way of his business he learned for the first time how much he loved his friend and how eagerly he watched for the friends advancement each day added to his load of anxiety he dreamed continually of a blackpainted man slipping among the treeboles nearer and nearer towards the red glow of a fire in some open space secure amongst the swamps where hideous mysteries had their celebration he cut short his business and hurried back from bonny he crossed at once to the residency and found his friend in a great turmoil of affairs walker came back from bonny a month later and hurried across to his friend jim said hatteras starting up ive got a years leave i am going home dicky cried walker and he nearly wrung hatteras hand from his arm thats grand news yes old man i thought you would be glad i sail in a fortnight and he did for the first month walker was glad a years leave would make a new man of dick hatteras he thought or at all events restore the old man sane and sound as he had been before he came to the west african coast during the second month walker began to feel lonely in the third he bought a banjo and learnt it during the fourth and fifth during the sixth he began to say to himself what a time poor dick must have had all those six years with those cursed forests about him i dont wonder i dont wonder he turned disconsolately to his banjo and played for the rest of the year all through the wet season while the rain came down in a steady roar and only the curlews cried until hatteras returned he returned at the top of his spirits and health of course he was hallmarked west african but no man gets rid of that stamp moreover there was more than health in his expression there was a new look of pride in his eyes and when he spoke of a bachelor it was in terms of sympathetic pity jim said he after five minutes of restraint i am engaged to be married jim danced round him in delight what an ass i have been he thought why didnt i think of that cure myself and he asked when is it to be in eight months youll come home and see me through walker agreed and for eight months listened to praises of the lady there were no more solitary expeditions in fact hatteras seemed absorbed in the diurnal discovery of new perfections in his future wife yes she seems a nice girl walker commented he found her upon his arrival in england more human than hatteras conversation had led him to expect and she proved to him that she was a nice girl for she listened for hours to him lecturing her on the proper way to treat dick without the slightest irritation and with only a faintly visible amusement besides she insisted on returning with her husband to bonny river which was a sufficiently courageous thing to undertake for a year in spite of the climate the couple were commonplace and happy for a year walker clucked about them like a hen after its chickens and slept the sleep of the untroubled then he returned to england and from that time made only occasional journeys to west africa thus for awhile he almost lost sight of hatteras and consequently still slept the sleep of the untroubled one morning however he arrived unexpectedly at the settlement and at once called on hatteras he did not wait to be announced but ran up the steps outside the house and into the diningroom he found mrs hatteras crying she dried her eyes welcomed walker and said that she was sorry but her husband was away walker started looked at her eyes and asked hesitatingly whether he could help mrs hatteras replied with an illassumed surprise that she did not understand walker suggested that there was trouble mrs hatteras denied the truth of the suggestion walker pressed the point and mrs hatteras yielded so far as to assert that there was no trouble in which hatteras was concerned walker hardly thought it the occasion for a parade of manners and insisted on pointing out that his knowledge of her husband was intimate and dated from his schooldays thereupon mrs hatteras gave way dick goes away alone she said he stains his skin and goes away at night he tells me that he must that its the only way by which he can know the natives and that so its a sort of duty he says the black tells nothing of himself to the white man ever you must go amongst them if you are to know them so he goes and i never know when he will come back i never know whether he will come back but he has done that sort of thing on and off for years and he has always come back replied walker yes but one day he will not walker comforted her as well as he could praised hatteras for his conduct though his heart was hot against him spoke of risks that every one must run who serve the empire never a lotus closes you know he said and went back to the factory with the consciousness that he had been telling lies it was no sense of duty that prompted hatteras of that he was certain and he waited he waited from darkness to daybreak in his compound for three successive nights on the fourth he heard the scuffling sound at the corner of the fence the night was black as the inside of a coffin half a regiment of men might steal past him and he not have seen them accordingly he walked cautiously to the palisade which separated the enclosure of the residency from his own felt along it until he reached the little gate and stationed himself in front of it in a few moments he thought that he heard a man breathing but whether to the right or the left he could not tell and then a groping hand lightly touched his face and drew away again walker said nothing but held his breath and did not move the hand was stretched out again this time it touched his breast and moved across it until it felt a button of walkers coat then it was snatched away and walker heard a gasping indraw of the breath and afterwards a sound as of a man turning in a flurry walker sprang forward and caught a naked shoulder with one hand a naked arm with the other wait a bit dick hatteras he said there was a low cry and then a husky voice addressed him respectfully as daddy in tradeenglish that wont do dick said walker the voice babbled more tradeenglish if youre not dick hatteras continued walker tightening his grasp youve no manner of right here ill give you till i count ten and then i shall shoot walker counted up to nine aloud and then jim said hatteras in his natural voice thats better said walker lets go in and talk iii he went up the step and lighted the lamp hatteras followed him and the two men faced one another for a little while neither of them spoke walker was repeating to himself that this man with the black skin naked except for a dirty loincloth and a few feathers on his head was a white man married to a white wife who was sleeping nay more likely crying not thirty yards away hatteras began to mumble out his usual explanation of duty and the rest of it that wont wash interrupted walker what is it a woman good heaven no cried hatteras suddenly it was plain that that explanation was at all events untrue jim ive a good mind to tell you all about it you have got to said walker he stood between hatteras and the steps i told you how this country fascinated me in spite of myself he began but i thought interrupted walker that you had got over that since why man you are married and he came across to hatteras and shook him by the shoulder dont you understand you have a wife i know said hatteras but there are things deeper at the heart of me than the love of woman and one of those things is the love of horror i tell you it bites as nothing else does in this world its like absinthe that turns you sick at the beginning and that you cant do without once you have got the taste of it do you remember my first landing it made me sick enough at the beginning you know but now he sat down in a chair and drew it close to walker his voice dropped to a passionate whisper he locked and unlocked his fingers with feverish movements and his eyes shifted and glittered in an unnatural excitement its like going down to hell and coming up again and wanting to go down again oh youd want to go down again youd find the whole earth pale youd count the days until you went down again do you remember orpheus i think he looked back not to see if eurydice was coming after him but because he knew it was the last glimpse he would get of hell at that he broke off and began to chant in a crazy voice wagging his head and swaying his body to the rhythm of the lines quum subita in cantum dementia cepit amantem ignoscenda quidem scirent si ignoscere manes restilit eurydicengue suam jam luce sub ipsa immemor heu victusque animi respexit oh stop that cried walker and hatteras laughed for gods sake stop it for the words brought back to him in a flash the vision of a classroom with its chipped desks ranged against the varnished walls the droning sound of the formmasters voice and the swish of lilac bushes against the lower window panes on summer afternoons go on he said oh go on and lets have done with it hatteras took up his tale again and it seemed to walker that the man breathed the very miasma of the swamp and infected the room with it he spoke of leopard societies murder clubs human sacrifices he had witnessed them at the beginning he had taken his share in them at the last he told the whole story without shame with indeed a growing enjoyment he spared walker no details he related them in their loathsome completeness until walker felt stunned and sick stop he said again stop thats enough hatteras however continued he appeared to have forgotten walkers presence he told the story to himself for his own amusement as a child will and here and there he laughed and the mere sound of his laughter was inhuman he only came to a stop when he saw walker hold out to him a cocked and loaded revolver well he asked well walker still offered him the revolver there are cases i think which neither gods law nor mans law seems to have provided for theres your wife you see to be considered if you dont take it i shall shoot you myself now here and mark you i shall shoot you for the sake of a boy i loved at school in the old country hatteras took the revolver in silence laid it on the table fingered it for a little my wife must never know he said theres the pistol outsides the swamp the swamp will tell no tales nor shall i your wife need never know hatteras picked up the pistol and stood up goodbye jim he said and half pushed out his hand walker shook his head and hatteras went out on to the verandah and down the steps walker heard him climb over the fence and then followed as far as the verandah in the still night the rustle and swish of the undergrowth came quite clearly to his ears the sound ceased and a few minutes afterwards the muffled crack of a pistol shot broke the silence like the tap of a hammer the swamp as walker prophesied told no tales mrs hatteras gave the one explanation of her husbands disappearance that she knew and returned brokenhearted to england there was some loud talk about the selfsacrificing energy which makes the english a dominant race and there you might think is the end of the story but some years later walker went trudging up the ogow river in congo franais he travelled as far as woermanns factory in njole island and having transacted his business there pushed up stream in the hope of opening the upper reaches for trade purposes he travelled for a hundred and fifty miles in a little sternwheel steamer at that point he stretched an awning over a whaleboat embarked himself his banjo and eight blacks from the steamer and rowed for another fifty miles there he ran the boats nose into a clay cliff close to a fan village and went ashore to negotiate with the chief there was a slip of forest between the village and the river bank and while walker was still dodging the palm creepers which tapestried it he heard a noise of lamentation the noise came from the village and was general enough to assure him that a chief was dead it rose in a chorus of discordant howls low in note and longdrawn out wordless something like the howls of an animal in pain and yet human by reason of their infinite melancholy walker pushed forward came out upon a hillock fronting the palisade which closed the entrance to the single street of huts and passed down into the village it seemed as though he had been expected for from every hut the fans rushed out towards him the men dressed in their filthiest rags the women with their faces chalked and their heads shaved they stopped however on seeing a white man and walker knew enough of their tongue to ascertain that they looked for the coming of the witch doctor the chief it appeared had died a natural death and since the event is of sufficiently rare occurrence in the fan country it had promptly been attributed to witchcraft and the witch doctor had been sent for to discover the criminal the village was consequently in a lively state of apprehension since the end of those who bewitch chiefs to death is not easy the fans however politely invited walker to inspect the corpse it lay in a dark hut packed with the corpses relations who were shouting to it at the top of their voices on the onchance that its spirit might think better of its conduct and return to the body they explained to walker that they had tried all the usual varieties of persuasion they had put red pepper into the chiefs eyes while he was dying they had propped open his mouth with a stick they had burned fibres of the oil nut under his nose in fact they had made his death as uncomfortable as possible but none the less he had died the witch doctor arrived on the heels of the explanation and walker since he was powerless to interfere thought it wise to retire for the time being he went back to the hillock on the edge of the trees thence he looked across and over the palisade and had the whole length of the street within his view the witch doctor entered it from the opposite end to the beating of many drums the first thing walker noticed was that he wore a squareskirted eighteenth century coat and a tattered pair of brocaded knee breeches on his bare legs the second was that he limped ever so slightly still he limped and with the right leg walker felt a strong desire to see the mans face and his heart thumped within him as he came nearer and nearer down the street but his hair was so matted about his cheeks that walker could not distinguish a feature if i was only near enough to see his eyes he thought but he was not near enough nor would it have been prudent for him to have gone nearer the witch doctor commenced the proceedings by ringing a handbell in front of every hut but that method of detection failed to work the bell rang successively at every door walker watched the mans progress watched his trailing limb and began to discover familiarities in his manner pure fancy he argued with himself if he had not limped i should have noticed nothing then the doctor took a wicker basket covered with a rough wooden lid the fans gathered in front of him he repeated their names one after the other and at each name he lifted the lid but that plan appeared to be no improvement for the lid never stuck it came off readily at each name walker meanwhile calculated the distance a man would have to cover who walked across country from bonny river to the ogow and he reflected with some relief that the chances were several thousand to one that any man who made the attempt be he black or white would be eaten on the way the witch doctor turned up the big square cuffs of his sleeves as a conjurer will do and again repeated the names this time however at each name he rubbed the palms of his hands together walker was seized with a sudden longing to rush down into the village and examine the mans right forearm for a bullet mark the longing grew on him the witch doctor went steadily through the list walker rose to his feet and took a step or two down the hillock when of a sudden at one particular name the doctors hands flew apart and waved wildly about him a single cry from a single voice went up out of the group of fans the group fell back and left one man standing alone he made no defence no resistance two men came forward and bound his hands and his feet and his body with tietie then they carried him within a hut thats sheer murder thought walker he could not rescue the victim he knew but he could get a nearer view of that witch doctor already the man was packing up his paraphernalia walker stepped back among the trees and running with all his speed made the circuit of the village he reached the further end of the street just as the witch doctor walked out into the open walker ran forward a yard or so until he too stood plain to see on the level ground the witch doctor did see him and stopped he stopped only for a moment and gazed earnestly in walkers direction then he went on again towards his own hut in the forest walker made no attempt to follow him he has seen me he thought if he knows me he will come down to the river bank tonight consequently he made the black rowers camp a couple of hundred yards down stream he himself remained alone in his canoe the night fell moonless and black and the enclosing forest made it yet blacker a few stars burned in the strip of sky above his head like gold spangles on a strip of black velvet those stars and the glimmering of the clay bank to which the boat was moored were the only lights which walker had it was as dark as the night when walker waited for hatteras at the wicketgate he placed his gun and a pouch of cartridges on one side an unlighted lantern on the other and then he took up his banjo and again he waited he waited for a couple of hours until a light crackle as of twigs snapping came to him out of the forest walker struck a chord on his banjo and played a hymn tune he played abide with me thinking that some picture of a home of a sunday evening in englands summer time perhaps of a group of girls singing about a piano might flash into the darkened mind of the man upon the bank and draw him as with cords the music went tinkling up and down the river but no one spoke no one moved upon the bank so walker changed the tune and played a melody of the barrel organs and piccadilly circus he had not played more than a dozen bars before he heard a sob from the bank and then the sound of some one sliding down the clay the next instant a figure shone black against the clay the boat lurched under the weight of a foot upon the gunwale and a man plumped down in front of walker well what is it asked walker as he laid down his banjo and felt for a match in his pocket it seemed as though the words roused the man to a perception that he had made a mistake he said as much hurriedly in tradeenglish and sprang up as though he would leap from the boat walker caught hold of his ankle no you dont said he you must have meant to visit me this isnt heally and he jerked the man back into the bottom of the boat the man explained that he had paid a visit out of the purest friendliness youre the witch doctor i suppose said walker the other replied that he was and proceeded to state that he was willing to give information about much that made white men curious he would explain why it was of singular advantage to possess a white mans eyeball and how very advisable it was to kill any one you caught making itung the danger of passing near a cottontree which had red earth at the roots provided a subject which no prudent man should disregard and tando with his driver ants was worth conciliating the witch doctor was prepared to explain to walker how to conciliate tando walker replied that it was very kind of the witch doctor but tando didnt really worry him he was in fact very much more worried by an inability to understand how a native so high up the ogow river had learned how to speak tradeenglish the witch doctor waved the question aside and remarked that walker must have enemies pussim bad too much he called them pussim wohwoh berrah well ah send grand kraukrau and dem pussim die one time walker could not recollect for the moment any pussim whom he wished to die one time whether from grand kraukrau or any other disease wait a bit he continued there is one man dick hatteras and he struck the match suddenly the witch doctor started forward as though to put it out walker however had the door of the lantern open he set the match to the wick of the candle and closed the door fast the witch doctor drew back walker lifted the lantern and threw the light on his face the witch doctor buried his face in his hands and supported his elbows on his knees immediately walker darted forward a hand seized the loose sleeve of the witch doctors coat and slipped it back along his arm to the elbow it was the sleeve of the right arm and there on the fleshy part of the forearm was the scar of a bullet yes said walker by god it is dick hatteras well cried hatteras taking his hands from his face what the devil made you turnturn tommy atkins on the banjo damn you dick i saw you this afternoon i know i know why on earth didnt you kill me that night in your compound i mean to make up for that mistake tonight walker took his rifle on to his knees hatteras saw the movement leaned forward quickly snatched up the rifle snatched up the cartridges thrust a couple of cartridges into the breech and handed the loaded rifle back to his old friend thats right he said i remember there are some cases neither gods law nor mans law has quite made provision for and then he stopped with his finger on his lip listen he said from the depths of the forest there came faintly very sweetly the sound of churchbells ringing a peal of bells ringing at midnight in the heart of west africa walker was startled the sound seemed fairy work so faint so sweet was it its no fancy jim said hatteras i hear them every night and at matins and at vespers there was a jesuit monastery here two hundred years ago the bells remain and some of the clothes he touched his coat as he spoke the fans still ring the bells from habit just think of it every morning every evening every midnight i hear those bells they talk to me of little churches perched on hillsides in the old country of hawthorn lanes and women english women english girls thousands of miles away going along them to church god help me jim have you got an english pipe yes an english briarwood and some birdseye walker handed hatteras his briarwood and his pouch of tobacco hatteras filled the pipe lit it at the lantern and sucked at it avidly for a moment then he gave a sigh and drew in the tobacco more slowly and yet more slowly my wife he asked at last in a low voice she is in england she thinks you dead hatteras nodded theres a jar of scotch whiskey in the locker behind you said walker hatteras turned round lifted out the jar and a couple of tin cups he poured whiskey into each and handed one to walker no thanks said walker i dont think i will hatteras looked at his companion for an instant then he emptied deliberately both cups over the side of the boat next he took the pipe from his lips the tobacco was not half consumed he poised the pipe for a little in his hand then he blew into the bowl and watched the dull red glow kindle into sparks of flame as he blew very slowly he tapped the bowl against the thwart of the boat until the burning tobacco fell with a hiss into the water he laid the pipe gently down and stood up so long old man he said and sprang out on to the clay walker turned the lantern until the light made a disc upon the bank good bye jim said hatteras and he climbed up the bank until he stood in the light of the lantern twice walker raised the rifle to his shoulder twice he lowered it then he remembered that hatteras and he had been at school together good bye dicky he cried and fired hatteras tumbled down to the boatside the blacks downriver were roused by the shot walker shouted to them to stay where they were and as soon as their camp was quiet he stepped on shore he filled up the whiskey jar with water tied it to hatteras feet shook his hand and pushed the body into the river the next morning he started back to fernan vaz the princess joceliande the truth concerning the downfall of the princess joceliande has never as yet been honestly inscribed doubtless there be few alive except myself that know it for from the beginning many strange and insidious rumours were set about to account for her mishap whereby great damage was done to the memory of the sieur rudel le malaise and solita his wife and afterwards these rumours were so embroidered and painted by rhymesters that the truth has become as you might say doubly lost for minstrels take more thought of tickling the fancies of those to whom they sing with joyous and gallant histories than of their high craft and office and hence it is that though many and various accounts are told to this day throughout the countryside by grandsires at their winter hearths not one of them has so much as a grain of verity they are but rude and homely versions of the chaunts of troubadours and yet the truth is sweet and pitiful enough to furnish forth a song were our bards so minded howbeit i will set it down here in simple prose for so my duty to the sieur rudel bids me and moreover twas from this event his wanderings began wherein for twenty years i bare him company and let none gainsay my story for that i was not my masters servant at the time and saw not the truth with mine own eyes i had it from the sieur rudels lips and more than once when he was vexed at the aspersions thrown upon his name but he was ever proud as befitted so knightly a gentleman and deigned not to argue or plead his honour to the world but only with his sword thus then it falls to me to right him as skilfully as i may though alas i fear my skill is little worth and calumnies are ever fresh to the palate while truth needs the sauce of a bright fancy to command it these columnies have assuredly gained some credit because with ladies my lord was ever blithe and dbonnaire that he loved many i do not deny but while he loved he loved right loyally and indeed it is no small honour to be loved by a man of so much worship even for a little the which many women thought also and those amongst the fairest and i doubt not that as long as she lived he loved his wife solita no less ardently than those with whom he fell in after she had most unfortunately died the sieur rudel was born within the castle of princess joceliande and there grew to childhood and from childhood to youth being ever entreated with great amity and love for his own no less than for his fathers sake though of a slight and delicate figure he excelled in all manly exercises and sports and in venery and hawking there was not one about the court that could equal him books too he read and in many languages labouring at philosophies and logics so that had you but heard him speak and not marked the hardihood of his limbs and his open face you might have believed you were listening to some doxical monk in the tenth year of his age came solita to the castle whence no man knew nor could they ever learn more than this that she sailed out of the grey mists of a november morning to our bleak brittany coast in a whitepainted boat a fisherman drew the boat to land perceiving it when he was casting his nets and found a womanchild therein cushioned upon white satin and marvelling much at the richness of her purveyance for even the sail of the boat was of white silk he bore her straightway to the castle and the abbot took her and baptised her and gave her sola for a name for said he she hath come alone and none knoweth her parentage or place in time she grew to exceeding beauty with fair hair clustering like finest silk above her temples and curling waywardly about her throat wondrous fair she was and white shaming the snowdrops so that all men stopped and gazed at her as she passed and the princess joceliande perceiving her joined her to the company of her handmaidens and took great delight in her for her modesty and beauty so that at last she changed her name sola have you been called till now she said but henceforth shall your name be solita as who shall say you have become my wont meanwhile the sieur rudel was advanced from honour to honour until he stood ever at the right hand of the princess and ruled over her kingdom as her chancellor and vicegerent her enemies he conquered and added their lands and sovereignties to hers until of all the kings in those parts none had such power and dominions as the princess joceliande many ladies you may believe cast fond eyes on him and dropped their gauntlet that he might bend to them upon his knee and pick it up but his heart they could not bend strive how they might and to each and all he showed the same courtesy and gentleness for he had seen the maiden solita and of an evening when the court was feasting in the hall and the music of harps rippled sweetly in the ears he would slip from the table as one that was busied in statecraft and in company with solita pace the terrace in the dark beneath the lighted windows yet neither spoke of love though loving was their intercourse solita for that her modesty withheld her and she feared even to hope that so great a lord should give his heart to her keeping rudel because he had not achieved enough to merit she should love him in a little he would mutter in a little one more thing must i do and then will i claim my guerdon of the princess joceliande now this one more thing was the highest and most dangerous emprise of all that he had undertaken beyond the confines of the kingdom there dwelt a great horde of men that had come to brittany from the east in many deep ships and had settled upon the coast whence they would embark and travelling hard by the land burn and ravage the seaborders for many days against these did the sieur rudel make war and gathering the nobles and yeomen he mustered them in boats and prepared to sail forth to what he believed was the last of his adventures knowing not that it was indeed but the beginning and to the princess he said lady i have served you faithfully as a gentleman should serve his queen from nothing have i drawn back that could establish or increase you therefore when i get me home again one boon will i ask of you and i pray you of your mercy grant it me i will well replied the princess for such loyal service hath no queen known before nay not even dame helen among the trojans so right gladly did the sieur rudel depart from her and down he walked among the sandhills where he found solita standing in a hollow in the midst of a cloud of sand which the sharp wind whirled about her nothing she said to him but she stood with downcast head and eyes that stung with tears solita said he the princess hath granted me such boon as i may ask on my return what say you and she answered in a low voice who am i my lord that i should oppose the will of the princess a nameless maiden meet only to yoke with a nameless yeoman at that the sieur rudel laughed and said look you into a mirror sweet and your face will gainsay your words she lifted her eyes to his and the light came into them again so that they danced behind the tears and rudel clipped her about the waist for all that he had not as yet merited her and kissed her upon the lips and the forehead and upon her white hands and wrists but she gazing past his head saw the blowing sands beyond and the armed men in the boats upon the sea and o rudel my sweet lord she cried never till this moment did i know how barren and lonely was the coast come back and that soon for of a truth i dread to be left alone in gods good time and if so he will i will come back and from the moment of my coming i will never again depart from you promise me that she said clinging to him with her arms twined about his neck and he promised her and so comforting her a little more he got him into his boat and sailed away upon his errand but of all this the princess joceliande knew nothing from her balcony in the castle she saw the sieur rudel sail forth he stood upon the poop the wind blowing the hair back from his face and as she watched his straight figure she said a boon he shall ask but a greater will i grant surely no man ever did such loyal service but for love and for loves sake he shall share my throne with me with that she wept a little for fear he might be slain or ever he should return but she remembered from how many noble exploits he had come scatheless and so taking heart once more she fell to thinking of his black locks and clear olive face and darkly shining eyes for in truth these outward qualities did more enthral and delight her than his most loyal services but for the maiden solita she got her back to her chamber and remembering her lords advice spied about for a mirror no mirror however did she possess having never used aught else but a basin of clear water and till now found it allsufficient so little curious had she been concerning the whiteness of her beauty thereupon she thought for a little and unbinding her hair so that it fell to her feet in a golden cloud hied her to joceliande who bade her take a book of chivalry and read aloud but solita so bent her head that her hair fell ever across the pages and hindered her from reading and each time she put it roughly back from her forehead with some small word of anger as though she was vexed what ails you child asked the princess it is my hair replied solita but the princess paid no heed she heard little indeed even of what was read but sat by the window gazing out across the grey hungry sea and bethinking her of the sieur rudel and his gallant men and again solita let her hair fall upon the scroll and again she tossed it back saying fie fie what ails you child the princess asked it is my hair she replied and joceliande smiling heedlessly bade her read on so she read until joceliande bade her stop and called to her and solita came over to the window and knelt by the side of the princess so that her hair fell across the wrist of joceliande and fettered it it is ever in the way said solita and she loosed it from the wrist of the princess but the princess caught the silky coils within her hand and smoothed them tenderly that were easily remedied she replied with a smile and she sought for the scissors which hung at her girdle but solita bethought her that many men had praised the colour and softness of her hair why she could not tell for dark locks alone were beautiful in her eyes howbeit men praised hers and for sieur rudels sake she would fain be as praiseworthy as might be therefore she stayed joceliandes hand and cried aloud in fear nay nay sweet lady tis all the gold i have and i pray you leave it me who am so poor and the princess joceliande laughed and replaced the scissors in her girdle i did but make pretence to try you she said for in truth i had begun to think you were some holy angel and no woman so little share had you in a womans vanities but tis all unbound and i wonder not that it hinders you let me bind it up and while the princess bound the hair cunningly in a coronal upon her head solita spake again hesitatingly seeking to conceal her craft madame it is easy for you to bind my hair but for myself i have no mirror and so dress it awkwardly joceliande laughed again merrily at the words dear heart she cried what man is it hast discovered thou art a woman after all first thou fearest for thy hair and now thou askest a mirror but in truth i like thee the better for thy discovery and she kissed solita very heartily who blushed that her secret was so readily found out and felt no small shame at her lack of subtlety for many ladies she knew had secrets ay even from their bosom lords and masters and kept them without effort in the subterfuge whereas she poor fool betrayed hers at the first word and what man is it laughed the princess for there is not one that deserves thee as thou shalt judge for thyself whereupon she summoned one of her servants and bade him place a mirror in the bedchamber of solita wherein she might see herself from top to toe art content she asked thus shalt thou see thyself without blemish or fault even for this crown of hair to the heel of thy foot but i fear me the sight will change all thy thoughts and incline thee to scorn of thy suitor then she stood for a little watching the sunlight play upon the golden head and pry into the soft shadows of the curls and her face saddened and her voice faltered but what of me solita she said all men give me reverence not one knows me for a woman i crave the bread of love all day long i hunger for it but they offer me the polished stones of courtesy and respect and so i starve slowly to my death what of me solita what of me but solita made reply soothing her madame she said all your servants love you but it beseems them not to flaunt it before your face so high are you placed above them you order their fortunes and their lives and surely tis nobler work than meddling with this idle loveprattle nay replied the princess laughing in despite of her heaviness for she noted how the blush on solitas cheek belied the scorn of her tongue there spoke the saint and i will hear no more from her now that i have found the woman tell me did he kiss you and solita blushed yet more deeply so that even her neck down to her shoulders grew rosy and once or twice she nodded her head for her lips would not speak the word then joceliande sighed to herself and said and yet perchance he would not die for you whereas men die for me daily and from mere obedience how is he called madame she replied i may not tell you for all my pride in him twill be for my lord to answer you in his good time but that he would die for me if need there were i have no doubt for i have looked into his eyes and read his soul so she spake with much spirit upholding sieur rudel but joceliande was sorely grieved for that solita would not trust her with her lovers name and answered bitterly and his soul which you did see was doubtless your own image and thus it will be with the next maiden who looks into his eyes her own image will she see and she will go away calling it his soul and not knowing poor fool that it has already faded from his eyes at this solita kept silence deeming it unnecessary to make reply it might be as the princess said with other men and other women but the sieur rudel had no likeness to other men and in possessing the sieur rudels love she was far removed from other women therefore did she keep silence but joceliande fancied that she was troubled by the words which she had spoken and straightway repented her of them nay child she said and she laid her hand again upon solitas head take not the speech to heart tis but the plaint of a woman whose hair is withered from its brightness and who grows peevish in her loneliness but open your mind to me for you have twined about my heart even as your curls did but now twine and coil about my wrist and the more for this pretty vanity of yours therefore tell me his name that i may advance him but once more solita did fob her off and the princess would no longer question her but turned her wearily to the window all day long she said i listen to soft speeches and honeyed tongues and all night long i listen to the breakers booming upon the sands and in truth i wot not which sound is the more hollow such was the melancholy and sadness of her voice that the tears sprang into solitas eyes and ran down her cheeks for very pity of joceliande think not i fail in love to you sweet princess she cried but i may not tell you though i would be blithe and proud to name him but tis for him to claim me of you and i must needs wait his time but joceliande would not be comforted and chiding her roughly sent her to her chamber so solita departed out of her sight her heart heavy with a great pity though little she understood of joceliandes distress for this she could not know that at the sight of her white beauty the princess joceliande was ashamed and coming into her chamber solita beheld the mirror ranged against the wall and long she stood before it being much comforted by the image which she saw from that day ever she watched the ladies of the court noting jealously if any might be more fair than she whom sieur rudel had chosen and often of a night when she was troubled by the aspect of some fair and delicate newcomer she would rise from her couch and light a taper and so gaze at herself until the fear of her unworthiness diminished for there were none that could compare with her in daintiness and fair looks ever came to the castle of the princess joceliande but of the sieur rudel though oft she thought she never spake biding his good time and the princess questioned her in vain for she whose heart hitherto had lain plain to see like a pebble in a clear brook of water had now learnt all the sweet cunning of loves duplicity thus the time drew on towards the sieur rudels homecoming and ever the twain looked out across the sea for the black boats to round the bluff and take the beach joceliande from her balcony solita from the window of her little chamber in the tower and each night the princess gave orders to light a beacon on the highest headland that the wayfarers might steer safely down that red path across the tumbling waters so it fell that one night both ladies beheld two ships swim to the shore and each made dolorous moan seeing how few of the goodly company that sailed forth had got them home again and wondering in sore distress whether rudel had returned with them or no but in a little there came a servant to the princess and told of one sir broyance de millefaits a messenger from the neighbouring kingdom of broye that implored instant speech with her and being admitted before all the court assembled in the great hall he fell upon his knees at the foot of the princess and making his obeisance said fair lady joceliande i crave a boon and i pray you of your gentleness to grant it me but what boon good sir broyance replied the princess i know you for a true and loyal gentleman who has ever been welcome at my castle speak then your need and if so be i may you shall find me complaisant to your request thereupon sir broyance took heart and said since our king died god rest his soul there has been no peace or quiet in our kingdom of broye tis rent with strife and factions so that no man may dwell in it but he must fight from morn to night and withal win no rest for the morrow the kings three sons contend for the throne and meanwhile is the country eaten up therefore am i sent by many and those our chiefest gentlemen to ask you to send us sieur rudel that he may quell these conflicts and rule over us as our king so sir broyance spake and was silent and a great murmur and acclamation rose about the hall for that the sieur rudel was held in such honour and worship even beyond his own country but for the princess joceliande she sat with downcast head and for a while vouchsafed no reply for her heart was sore at the thought that sieur rudel should go from her there is much danger in the adventure she said at length doubtfully were there no danger madame he replied we should not ask sieur rudel of you to be our leader and great though the danger be greater far is the honour for we offer him a kingdom then the princess spake again to sir broyance it may not be she said whatever else you crave that shall you have and gladly will i grant it you but the sieur rudel is the flower of our court he stands ever at my right hand and woe is me if i let him go for i am only a woman but madame for his knighthoods sake i pray you assent to our prayer said sir broyance few enemies have you but many friends whereas we are sore pressed on every side but the princess repeated i am only a woman and for a long while he made his prayer in vain at last however the princess said for his knighthoods sake thus far will i yield to you bide here within my castle until sieur rudel gets him home and then shall you make your prayer to him and by his answer will i be bound that i will well replied sir broyance bethinking him of the sieur rudels valour and how that he had a kingdom to proffer to him but the princess joceliande said to herself i too will offer him a kingdom my throne shall he share with me and so she entertained sir broyance right pleasantly until the sieur rudel should get him back from the foray meanwhile she would say to solita he shall not go to broye for in truth i need him and solita would laugh happily replying it is truth he will not go to broye and thinking thereto silently but it is not the princess who will keep him but even i her poor handmaiden for i have his promise never to depart from me so much confidence had her mirror taught her as it ever is with women but despite them both did the sieur rudel voyage to broye and rule over the kingdom as its king and how that came about ye shall hear now on the fourth day after the coming of sir broyance the princess joceliande was leaning over the baluster of her balcony and gazing seawards as was her wont the hours had drawn towards evening and the sun stood like a glowing wheel upon the farthest edge of the seas grey floor when she beheld a black speck crawl across its globe and then another and another to the number of thirty thereupon she knew that the sieur rudel had returned and joyfully she summoned her tirewomen and bade them coif and robe her as befitted a princess a coronet of gold and rubies they set upon her head and a robe of purple they hung about her shoulders with pearls they laced her neck and her arms and with pearls they shod her feet and when she saw the ships riding at their anchorage and the sieur rudel step forth amid the shouts of the sailors then she hied her to the councilchamber and prepared to give him instant audience yet for all her jewels and rich attire she trembled like a common wench at the approach of her lover and feared that the loud beating of her heart would drown the sound of his footsteps in the passage but the sieur rudel came not and she sent a messenger to inquire why he tarried and the messenger brought word and said he is with the maiden solita in the tower then the princess stumbled as though she were about to fall and her women came about her but she waved them back with her hand and so stood shivering for a little the night blows cold she said i would the lamps were lit and when her servants had lighted the councilchamber she sent yet another messenger to sieur rudel bidding him instantly come to her and waited in great bitterness of spirit for she remembered how that she had promised to grant him the boon that he should ask and much she feared that she knew what that boon was now leave we the princess joceliande and hie before her messenger to the chamber of solita no pearls or purple robes had she to clad her beauty in but a simple gown of white wool fastened with a silver girdle about the waist and her hair she loosed so that it rippled down her shoulders and nestled round her ears and face thither the sieur rudel came straight from the sea and love he said kissing her it has been a weary waste of days and nights and yet more weary for thee than for me for stern work was there ever to my hand ay and wellnigh more than i could do but for thee nought but to wait yet my dear lord she replied the princess did give me this mirror wherein i could see myself from top to toe and a great comfort has it been to me so she spake and the messenger from the princess brake in upon them bidding the sieur rudel hasten to the councilchamber for that the princess joceliande waited this long while for his coming now will i ask for the fulfilment of her promise said rudel to solita and tonight sweet i will claim thee before the whole court with that he got him from the chamber and following the messenger came to where the princess awaited him madame he said good tidings by gods grace we have won the victory over your enemies never again will they buzz like wasps about your coasts but from this day forth they will pay you yearly truage sir she replied rebuking him shrewdly indeed you bring me good tidings but you bring them overlate for here have i tarried for you this long while and it beseems neither you nor me madame he answered i pray you acquit me of the fault and lay the blame on love for when sweet cupid thrones a second queen in ones heart beside the first what wonder that a man forgets his duty and now i would that of your gentleness you would grant me your maiden solita for wife that i may not returned joceliande stricken to the soul at that image of a second queen a nameless child and my handmaiden sieur rudel it befits a man to look above him for a wife and that madame he answered in very truth i do moreover though no man knows solitas parentage and place yet must she be of gentle nurture else had there been no silk sail to float her hitherwards and so much it liketh you to grant my boon for gods love i pray you hold your promise thereupon was the princess sore distressed for that she had given her promise howbeit she said since it is so and since my maiden solita is the boon you crave i give her to you and so dismissed the sieur rudel from her presence and getting her back to her chamber made moan out of all measure lord jesu she cried of all my kingdom and barony but one thing did i hunger for and covet and that one thing this child whom of my kindness i loved and fostered hath traitorously robbed me of why did i take her from the sea so she wept for a great while until she bethought her of a remedy then she wiped her tears and gave order that sir broyance should come to her to him she said tonight at the high feast you shall make your prayer to the lord rudel and i myself will join with you so that he shall become your leader and rule over you as king so she spake thinking that when the sieur rudel had departed she would privily put solita to death openly she dared not do it for the great love the nobles bore towards rudel and when solita was dead then would she send again for rudel and share her siege with him sir broyance as ye may believe was right glad at her words and made him ready for the feast hither when the company was assembled came the sieur rudel clad in a green tunic edged with fur of a white fox and a chain set with stones of great virtue about his neck his hose were green and of the finest silk and on his feet he wore shoes of white doeskin and the latchets were of gold so he came into the hall and seeing him thus gaily attired with all his harness off much did all marvel at his knightly prowess for in truth he looked more like some tender minstrel than a gallant warrior then up rose sir broyance and said from the kingdom of broye the nobles send greeting to the sieur rudel and a message and with that he set forth his errand and request but the sieur rudel laughed and answered sir broyance great honour you do me and so i pray tell your countrymen of broye but never more will i draw sword or feuter spear for this day hath the princess joceliande granted me her maiden solita for wife and by her side i will bide till death thereupon rose a great murmur of astonishment within the hall the men lamenting that the sieur rudel would lead them no more to battle and the women marvelling to each other that he should choose so mean a thing as solita for wife but sir broyance said never a word but got him from the table and out of the hall so that the company marvelled yet more for that he had not sought to persuade the sieur rudel then said the princess joceliande and greatly was she angered both against solita and rudel fie my lord shame on you you forget your knighthood and he replied my knighthood your highness had but one use and that to win my sweet solita wherefore was joceliandes heart yet hotter against the twain and she cried aloud nay but it is on us that the shame of your cowardice will fall even now sir broyance left our hall in anger and scorn it may not be that our chiefest noble shall so disgrace us but sieur rudel laughed lightly and answered her madame full oft have i jeopardised my life in your good cause and i fear no charge of cowardice more than i fear thistledown his words did but increase the fury of the princess and she brake out in most bitter speech nay but it is a kitchen knave we have been honouring unawares and bidding sit with us at table and straightway she called to her servants and bade them fetch the warden of the castle with the fetters but the sieur rudel laughed again and said thus it will be impossible that i leave my dear solita and voyage perilously to broye nor any effort or resistance did he make but lightly suffered them to fetter him the while the princess most foully missaid him with fetters they prisoned his feet and manacles they straitly fastened about his wrists and they bound him to a pillar in the hall by a chain about his middle there shall you bide she said in shameful bonds until you make promise to voyage forth to broye for surely there is nothing so vile in all this world as a craven gentleman with that she turned her again to the feast though little heart she had thereto but the sieur rudel was well content for not for all the honour in christendom would he break his word to his dear solita howbeit the nobles were ever urgent that the princess should set him free pleading the worshipful deeds he had accomplished in her cause but to none of them would she hearken and the fair gentle ladies of the court greatly applauded her for her persistence and especially those who had erstwhile dropped their gauntlets that rudel might bend and pick them up and many pleasant jests they passed upon the sieur rudel bidding him dance with them since he was loth to fight but he paid no heed to them nor could they provoke him by any number of taunts whereupon being angered at his silence they were fain to send to solita and make their sport with her but that joceliande would not suffer and rising she went to solitas chamber and entreated her most kindly telling her that for love of her the sieur rudel would not adventure himself at broye not a word did she say of how she had mistreated him and solita answered her jocundly for that her lord had held his pledge with her but when the castle was still the princess took solita by the hand and led her down the steps to where rudel stood against the pillar in the dark hall for thy sake sweet solita she said is he bound for thy sake and she made her feel the manacles upon his hands and when solita had so felt his bonds she wept and made the greatest sorrow that ever man heard alas she cried that my dear lord should suffer in such straits in gods mercy madame i pray you let him go loyal service hath he done for you such as no other in the kingdom loyal service i trow replied the princess he hath brought such shame upon my court that for ever am i dishonoured it may not be that i let him go without you give him back his word and bid him forth to broye and that will i never do replied solita for all your cruelty so the princess turned her away and gat her from the hall but solita remained with her lord making moan and easing his fetters with her hands as best she might hence it fell out that she who should have comforted must needs be comforted herself and that the sieur rudel did right willingly the like he would say to me hath often happened to him since and when he was harassed with sore distress he must needs turn him about to stop a womans tears for which he thanked god most heartily and prayed that so it might ever be since thus he clean forgot his own sad plight whence meseems may men understand how noble a gentleman was my good lord the sieur rudel now when the night was well spent and drawing on to dawn solita for very weariness fell asleep at the pillars foot and rudel began to take counsel with himself if by any manner of means he might outwit the princess joceliande for this he saw that she would not have him wed her handmaiden and for that cause and for no cowardice of his had so cruelly entreated him and when he had pondered a little with himself he bent and touched solita with his hands and called to her in a low voice solita he said it is in joceliandes heart to keep us twain each from other rise therefore and get thee to the good abbot who baptised thee ever hath he stood my friend and for friendships sake this thing he will do bring him hither into the hall that he may marry us even this night and when the morning comes i will tell the princess of our marriage and so will she know that her cruelty is of small avail and release me unto thee thereupon solita rose right joyously surely my dear lord said she no man can match thee neither in craft nor prowess and she hurried through the dark passages towards the lodging of the abbot hard by this lodging was the chapel of the castle and when she came thereto the windows were ablaze with light and solita clapped her ear to the door but no sound did she hear no not so much as the stirring of a mouse and bethinking her that the good abbot might be holding silent vigil she gently pressed upon the door so that it opened for the space of an inch and when she looked into the chapel she beheld the princess joceliande stretched upon the steps before the altar her coronet had fallen from her head and rolled across the stones and she lay like one that had fallen asleep in the counting of her beads greatly did solita marvel at the sight but no word she said lest she should wake the princess and in a little becoming afeard of the silence and of the shadows which the flickering candles set racing on the wall she shut the door quickly and stole on tiptoe to the abbot long she entreated him or ever she prevailed for the holy man was timorous and feared the wrath of the princess but at the last for the sieur rudels sake he consented and married them privily in the hall as the grey dawn was breaking across the sea now in the morning the princess bid solita be brought to her and when they were alone gently and cunningly she spake child she said i doubt not thy heart is hot against me for that i will not enlarge the sieur rudel alas fain were i to do this thing but for the honour of my court i may not bound are we not by our wills but by our necessities and thus it is with all women men may ride forth and shape their lives with their good swords but for us we must needs bide where we were born and order such things as fall to us as best we can therefore child take my word to heart the sieur rudel loves thee and thou wouldst keep his love let my age point to thee the way what if i release him no longer can he stay with us holding high honour and dignity since he hath turned him from his knightlihood and avoided this great adventure but forth with you must he fare and all day long will he sit with you in your chamber idle as a woman and ever his thoughts will go back to the times of his nobility the clash of steel will grow louder in his ears he will list again to the praises of minstrels in the banquethall and when men speak to him of great achievements wrought by other hands then thou wilt see the life die out of his eyes and his heart will become cold as stone and thou wilt lose his love a great thing will it be for thee if he come not to hate thee in the end but if of thy own free will thou send him from thee then shalt thou ever keep his love thy image will ride before his eyes in the van of battles for very lack of thee he will move from endeavour to endeavour and so thy life will be enshrined in his most noble deeds at these words with such cunning gentleness were they spoken solita was sore troubled i cannot send him from me she cried for never did woman so love her lord no not ever in the world then prove thy love said joceliande again a kingdom is given into his hand and he will not take it because of thee it is a hard thing i trow right well but the cross becomes a crown when a woman lifts it think a kingdom and never yet was kingdom established but the stones of its walls were mortised with the blood of womens hearts so she pleaded hiding her own thoughts until solita answered her and said god help me but he shall go to broye much ado had the princess joceliande to hide her joy for the success of her device but solita poor lass had neither eyes nor thoughts for her forthwith she rose to her feet and quickly gat her to the hall lest her courage should fail before that she had accomplished her resolve but when she came near to the sieur rudel blithely he smiled at her and called solita my wife it seemed to her that words so sweet had never as yet been spoken since the world began and all her strength ebbed from her and she stood like one that is dumb gazing piteously at her husband again rudel called to her but no answer could she make and she turned and fled sobbing to the chamber of the princess i could not speak she said my lips were locked and rudel holds the key but the princess spoke gently and craftily bidding her take heart for that she herself would go with her and second her words and taking solita by the hand she led her again to the hall this time solita made haste to speak first rudel she said no honour can i bring to you but only foul disgrace and that is no fit gift from one who loves you therefore from this hour i hold you quit of your promise and pray you to undertake this mission and set forth for broye but the sieur rudel would hearken to nothing of what she said no foul disgrace can come to me he cried but only if i prove false to you and lose your love my promise i will keep and all the more for that i see the princess joceliande hath set you on to this but solita protested that it was not so and that of her own will and desire she released him for the longing to sacrifice herself for her dear lords sake grew upon her as she thought upon it yet he would not consent my word i passed to you when you were a maid and shall i not keep it now that you are a wife he cried wife cried the princess you are his wife and she roughly gripped solitas wrist so that the girl could not withhold a cry in truth madame replied the sieur rudel even last night in this hall solita and i were married by the good abbot and therefore i will not leave her while she lives still joceliande would not believe it bethinking her that the sieur rudel had hit upon the pretence as a device for his enlargement but solita showed to her the ring which the abbot had taken from the finger of her lord and placed upon hers and then the princess knew that of a surety they were married and her hatred for solita burned in her blood like fire but no sign she gave of what she felt but rather spoke with greater softness to them both bidding them look forward beyond the first delights of love and behold how all their years to come were the price they needs must pay now while they were yet debating each with other came sir broyance into the hall and straightway the princess called to him and begged him to add his prayers to solitas but he answered that madame i will not do for indeed the esteem i have for the sieur rudel is much increased and i hold it no cowardice that he should refuse a kingdom for his wifes sake but the sweetest bravery and therefore it was that i broke off my plea last night and sought not to persuade him at that rudel was greatly rejoiced and said dost hear him solita even he who most has need of me acquits me of disgrace truly i will never leave thee while i live but the princess turned sharply to sir broyance sir have you changed your tune she said for never was a man so urgent as you with me for the sieur rudels help alas madame he replied i knew not then that he was plighted to the maiden solita or never would i have borne this message for this i surely know that all my days are waste and barren because i suffered my mistress to send me from her after a willofthewisp honour even as solita would send her lord thereupon solita brake in upon him but my lord you have won great renown and far and wide is your prowess known and sung that avails me nothing he replied my life rings hollow like an empty cup and so are two lives wasted nay my lord neither life is wasted for much have you done for others though maybe little for yourself while for her you loved the noise of your achievements must have been enough of that i cannot tell he answered but this i know she drags a pale life out behind convent walls often have i passed the gate with my warriors but never could i hold speech with her she will have seen your banners glancing in the sun said solita and so will she know her sacrifice was good thereupon she turned her again to her husband for my sake dear rudel i pray you go to broye but still he persisted saying he would not depart from her till death until at last she ceased from her importunities and went sadly to her chamber then she unbound her hair and stood gazing at her likeness in the mirror o cursed beauty she cried wherein i took vain pride for my sweet lords sake truly art thou my ruin and snare and while she thus made moan the princess came softly into her chamber he will not leave me madame she sobbed joceliande came over to her and gently laid her hand upon her head and whispered in her ear not while you live for awhile solita sat silent ay madame she said at length even as i came alone to these coasts so will i go from them and slowly she drew from its sheath a little knife which she carried at her girdle she tried the point upon her finger so that the blood sprang from the prick and dropped on her white gown at the sight she gave a cry and dropped the knife and i cannot do it she said i have not the courage but you madame ever have you been kind to me and therefore show me this last kindness i will well said the princess and she made solita to sit upon a couch and with two bands of her golden hair she tied her hands fast behind her and so laid her upon her back on the couch and when she had so laid her she said but for all that you die he shall not go to broye but here shall he bide and share my throne with me thereupon did solita perceive all the treachery of princess joceliande and vainly she struggled to free her hands and to cry out for help but joceliande clapped her palm upon solitas mouth and drawing a gold pin from her own hair she drove it straight into her heart until nothing but the little knob could be seen so solita died and quickly the princess wiped the blood from her breast and unbound her hands and arranged her limbs as though she slept then she returned to the hall and summoning the warden bade him loose the sieur rudel it shall be even as you wish she said to him wise and prudent had she been had she ended with that but her malice was not yet sated and so she suffered it to lead her to her ruin for she stretched out her hand to him and said i myself will take you to your wife and greatly marvelling the sieur rudel took her hand and followed now when they were come to solitas chamber the princess entered first and turned her again to my lord rudel and laid her finger to her lips saying hush therefore he came in after her on tiptoe and stood a little way from the foot of the couch fearing lest he might wake his wife is she not still asked joceliande in a whisper is she not still and white still and white as a folded lily he replied and like a folded lily too in her white flesh there sleeps a heart of gold therewith he crept softly to the couch and bent above her and in an instant he perceived that her bosom did not rise and fall he gazed swiftly at the princess she was watching him and their glances met he dropped upon his knees by the couch and felt about solitas heart that he might know whether it beat or not and his fingers touched the knob of joceliandes bodkin gently he drew the gown from solitas bosom and beheld how that she had been slain then did he weep believing that in truth she had killed herself but the princess must needs touch him upon the shoulder my lord she said why weep for the handmaid when the princess lives then the sieur rudel rose straightway to his feet and said this is thy doing for a little joceliande denied it saying that of her own will and desire solita had perished but rudel looked her ever sternly in the face and again he said this is thy doing and at that joceliande could gainsay him no more but she dropped upon the floor and kissed his feet and cried it was for love of thee rudel look my kingdom is large and of much wealth yet of no worth is it to me but only if it bring thee service and great honour a princess am i yet no joy do i have of my degree but only if thou share my siege with me then rudel broke out upon her thrusting her from him with his hand and spurning her with his foot as she crouched upon the floor no princess art thou but a changeling for surely princess never did such foul wrong and crime and even as he spake many of the nobles burst into the chamber for they had heard the outcry below and marvelled what it might mean and when rudel beheld them crowding the doorway come in my lords said he so that ye may know what manner of woman ye serve and worship there lies my dear wife solita murdered by this vile princess and for love of me she saith for love of me and again he turned him to joceliande now all the reverence i held thee in is turned to hatred god be thanked such is the guerdon of thy love for me joceliande when she heard his injuries knew indeed that her love was unavailing and that by no means might she win him to share her siege with her therefore her love changed to a bitter fury and standing up forthwith she bade the nobles take their swords and smite off the sieur rudels head but no one so much as moved a hand towards his hilt then spake rudel again o vile and treacherous he cried who will obey thee and his eyes fell upon solita where she lay in her white beauty upon the golden pillow of her hair thereupon he dropped again upon his knees by the couch and took her within his arms kissing her lips and her eyes and bidding her wake this with many tears but seeing she would not but was dead in very truth he got him to his feet and turned to where the princess stood like stone in the middle of the chamber now for thy sin he cried a shameful death shalt thou die and a painful and may the devil have thy soul he bade the nobles depart from the chamber and following them the last firmly barred the door upon the outside thus was the princess joceliande left alone with dead solita and ever she heard the closing and barring of doors and the sound of feet growing fainter and fainter but no one came to her loud though she cried and sorely was she afeard gazing now at the dead body now wondering what manner of death the sieur rudel planned for her then she walked to the window if by any chance she might win help that way and saw the ships riding at their anchorage with sails loose and heard the songs of the sailors as they made ready to cast free and between the coast and the castle were many men hurrying backwards and forwards with all the purveyance of a voyage then did she think that she was to be left alone in the tower to starve to death in company of the girl she had murdered and great moan she made but other device was in the mind of my ingenious master lord rudel for all about the castle he piled stacks of wood and drenched them with oil bethinking him that solita his wife if little joy she had had of her life should have undeniable honour in her obsequies and so having set fire to the stacks he got him into the ships with all the company that had dwelled within the castle and drew out a little way from shore then the ships lay to and watched the flames mounting the castle walls the tower wherein the princess joceliande was prisoned was the topmost turret of the building so that many a roof crashed in and many a rampart bowed out and crumbled to the ground or ever the fire touched it but just as night was drawing on lo a great tongue of flame burst through the window from within and the sieur rudel beheld in the midst of it as it were the figure of a woman dancing thereupon he signed to his sailors to hoist the sail again and the other ships obeying his example he led the way gallantly to broye a liberal education so you couldnt wait mrs branscome turned full on the speaker as she answered deliberately you have evidently not been long in london mr hilton or you would not ask that question i arrived yesterday evening quite so then will you forgive me one tiny word of advice you will learn the truth of it soon by yourself but i want to convince you at once of the uselessness to use no harder word of trying to revive a flirtation let me see yes quite two years old you might as well galvanise a mummy and expect it to walk about besides she added inconsistently i had to marry and and you never came then you sent the locket the word sent a shiver through mrs branscome with a remembrance of the desecration of a gift which she had cherished as a holy thing she clung to flippancy as her defence oh no i never sent it i lost it somewhere i think must you go she continued as hilton moved silently to the door i expect my husband in just now wont you wait and meet him how dare you hilton burst out is there nothing of your true self left david hiltons education was as yet in its infancy this was not only his first visit to england but indeed to any spot further afield than interlaken all of his sixandtwenty years that he could recollect had been passed in a chlet on the scheidegg above grindelwald his only companion an elderly recluse who had deliberately cut himself off from communion with his fellows the trouble which had driven mr strange an author at one time of some mark into this seclusion was now as completely forgotten as his name even david knew nothing of its cause that strange was his uncle and had adopted him when left an orphan at the age of six was the sum of his information for although the pair had lived together for twenty years there had been little intercourse of thought between them and none of sentiment strange had indeed throughout shut his nephew not merely from his heart but also from his confidence at first out of sheer neglect and afterwards as the lad grew towards manhood from deliberate intent for by continually brooding over his embittered life he had at last impregnated his weak nature with the savage cynicism which embraced even his one comrade and the child he had originally chosen as a solace for his loneliness became in the end the victim of a heartless experiment stranges plan was based upon a method of training in the first place he thoroughly isolated david from any actual experience of persons beyond the simple shepherd folk who attended to their needs and a few alpine guides who accompanied him on mountain expeditions he kept incessant guard over his own past life letting no incidents or deductions escape and fed the youths mind solely upon the ideal polities of the ancients his object being to launch him suddenly upon the world with little knowledge of it beyond what had filtered through his books and possessed of an intuitive hostility to existing modes what kind of a career would ensue strange anticipated the solution of the problem with an approach to excitement two events however prevented the complete realisation of his scheme one was a lingering illness which struck him down when david was twentyfour and about to enter on his ordeal the second occurring simultaneously was the advent of mrs branscome then kate alden to grindelwald they met by chance on the snow slopes of the wetterhorn early one august morning miss alden was trying to disentangle some meaning from the ptois of her guides and gratefully accepted hiltons assistance halfanhour after she had continued the ascent david noticed a small gold locket glistening in her steps it recalled him to himself and he picked it up and went home with a strange trouble clutching at his heart the next morning he carried the locket down into the valley found its owner and forgot to restore it it became an excuse for further descents meanwhile the theories were wooed with a certain coldness in front of them stood perpetually the one real thing which had surged up through the quiet of his life and loverlike he justified its presence to himself by seeing in kate aldens frank face the incarnation of the ideal patterns of his books the visits to grindelwald grew more frequent and more prolonged the climax however came unexpectedly to both david had commissioned a jeweller at berne to fashion a facsimile of the locket for his own wearing and meaning to restore the original handed kate alden the copy the evening before she left an explanation of the mistake led to mutual avowals and a betrothal hilton returned to nurse his adoptive father and was to seek england as soon as he could obtain his release meanwhile kate pledged herself to wait for him she kept the new locket empty except for a sprig of edelweiss he had placed in it and agreed that if she needed her lovers presence she should despatch it as an imperative summons during the next two years stranges life ebbed sullenly away the approach of death brought no closer intimacy between uncle and nephew since indeed the former held it almost as a grievance against david that he should die before he could witness the issue of his experiment consequently the younger man kept his secret to himself and embraced it the more closely for his secrecy fostering it through the dreary night watches until the image of kate alden became a starintheeast to him beckoning towards london when the end came david found himself the possessor of a moderate fortune and with the humiliating knowledge that this legacy awoke his first feeling of gratitude towards his uncle he locked the door of the chlet and so landed at charing cross one wet november evening meanwhile the locket had never come after hilton had left mrs branscomes forced indifference gave way as she crouched beside the fire numbed by pain beyond the power of thought she could conjure up but one memory the morning of their first meeting she recollected that the sun had just risen over the shoulder of the shreckhorn and how it had seemed to her young fancy that david had come to her straight from the heart of it the sound of her husbands step in the hall brought her with a shock to facts he must go back she muttered he must go back david however harboured no such design one phrase of hers had struck root in his thoughts i had to marry she had said and certain failings in her voice warned him that this whatever it meant was in her eyes the truth it had given the lie direct to the flippancy which she had assumed and david determined to remain until he had fathomed its innermost meaning a fear indeed lest the one single faith he felt as real should crumble to ashes made his resolve almost an instinct of selfpreservation the idea of accepting the situation never occurred to him his training having effectually prevented any growth of respect for the status quo as such nor did he realise at this time that his determination might perhaps prove unfair to mrs branscome a certain habit of abstraction nurtured in him by the spirit of inquiry which he had imbibed from his books had become so intuitive as to penetrate even into his passion from the first he had been accustomed to watch his increasing intimacy with kate alden from the standpoint of a third person analysing her actions and feelings no less than his own and now this tendency gave the crowning impetus to a resolve which sprang originally from his necessity to find sure foothold somewhere amid the wreckage of his hopes from this period might be dated the real commencement of hiltons education he returned to the branscomes house sedulously schooled his looks and his words save when betrayed into an occasional denunciation of the marriage laws and succeeded at last in overcoming a distaste which mr branscome unaccountably evinced for him to a certain extent also he was taken up by social entertainers there was an element of romance in the life he had led which appealed favourably to the seekers after novelty a second st simeon skylights he had been rashly termed by one good lady whose wealth outweighed her learning at first his gathering crowd of acquaintances only served to fence him more closely within himself but as he began to realise that this was only the unit of another crowd a crowd of designs and intentions working darkly even he sustained by the strength of a single aim felt himself whirling at times thus he slowly grew to some knowledge of the difficulties and complications which must beset any young girl like kate alden whose nearest relation and chaperon had been a featherheaded cousin not so many years her elder at last in a dim way he began to see the possibility of replacing his bitterness with pity for mrs branscome did not love her husband he plainly perceived that if only from the formal precision with which she performed her duties she appeared to him indeed to be paying off an obligation rather than working out the intention of her life the actual solution of his perplexities came by an accident amongst the visitors who fell under hiltons observation at the branscomes was a certain mr marston a complacent widower of some fiveandthirty years and branscomes fellow servant at the admiralty hiltons attention was attracted to this man by the air of embarrassment with which mrs branscome received his approaches resolute to neglect no clue however slight david sought marstons companionship and as a reward discovered one afternoon in a crown derby teacup on the mantelshelf of the latters room his own present of two years back the exclamation which this discovery extorted aroused marston whats up where did you get this why have you seen it before the question pointed out to david the need of wariness no he answered its shape rather struck me thats all the emblem of a conquest i suppose the invitation stumbled awkwardly from unaccustomed lips but marston noticed no more than the words he was chewing the cud of a disappointment and answered with a short laugh no rather of a rebuff the lady tore her hand away in a hurry the link on the bracelet was thin i suppose anyway that was left in my hand you were proposing to her well hardly i was married at the time there was a silence for some moments during which hilton slowly gathered into his mind a consciousness of the humiliation which kate must have endured and read in that the explanation of her words i had to marry marston took up the tale babbling resentfully of a nursery prudishness but his remarks fell on deaf ears until he mentioned a withered flower which he had found inside the locket then davids self control partially gave way in imagination he saw marston carelessly tossing the sprig aside and the touch of his fingers seemed to sully the love of which it was the token the locket burned into his hand without a word he dropped it on to the floor and ground it to pieces with his heel a new light broke in upon marston so this accounts for all your railing against the marriage laws he laughed by jove you have kept things quiet i wouldnt have given you credit for it his eyes travelled from the carpet to davids face and he stopped abruptly you had better hold your tongue david said quietly pick up the pieces do you think i would touch them now marston rose from his lounge david stepped in front of the door there was a litheness in his movements which denoted obedient muscles marston perceived this now with considerable discomfort and thought it best to comply he knelt down and picked up the fragments of the locket now throw them into the grate that done david took his leave once outside the house however his emotion fairly mastered him the episode of which he had just heard was so mean and petty in itself and yet so farreaching in its consequences that it set his senses aflame in an increased revolt against the order of the world marriage was practically a necessity to a girl as unprotected as kate alden he now acquiesced in that but that it should have been forced upon her by the vanity of a trivial person like marston engaged in the pursuit of his desires sent a fever of repulsion through his veins he turned back to the door deluded by the notion that it was his duty to render the occurrence impossible of repetition he was checked however by the thought of mrs branscome the shame he felt hinted the full force of degradation of which she must have been conscious and begot in him a strange feeling of loyalty up till now the true meaning of chivalry had been unknown to him in consequence of his bringing up he had been incapable of regarding faith in persons as a working motive in ones life even the first dawn of his passion had failed to teach him that all the confidence and trust which he gained thereby being a mere reflection from what he saw in kate alden of truth to him it was necessary that he should feel her trouble first and his poignant sense of that now revealed to him not merely the wantonness of the perils women are compelled to run but their consequent sufferings and their endurance in suppressing them a feverish impulse towards selfsacrifice sprang up within him he would bury the incident of that afternoon as a dead thing nay more for mrs branscomes sake he would leave england and return to his retreat among the mountains if she had suffered why should he claim an exemption the idea had just sufficient strength to impel him to catch the nightmail from charing cross that it was already weakening was evidenced by a halffeeling of regret that he had not missed the train the regret swelled during his journey to the coast the scene he had just come through became from much pondering on it almost unreal and with the blurring of the impression it had caused there rose a doubt as to the accuracy of his vision of mrs branscomes distress which he had conjured out of it his chivalry in a word had grown too quickly to take firm root it was an exotic planted in soil not yet fully prepared david began to think himself a fool and at last as the train neared dover a question which had been vaguely throbbing in his brain suddenly took shape why had she not sent for him true the locket was lost but she might have written the formulation of the question shattered almost all the work of the last few hours he cursed his recent thoughts as a childs fairy dreams why should he leave england after all if he was to sacrifice himself it should be for some one who cared sufficiently for him to justify the act there might of course have been some hidden obstacle in the way which mrs branscome could not surmount the revelation of marstons unimagined story warned him of the possibility of that but the chances were against it anyway he quibbled to himself he had a clear right to pursue the matter until he unearthed the truth acting upon this decision david returned to town though not without a lurking sense of shame a few evenings after he sought out mrs branscome at a dance the blood rushed to her face when she caught his figure and as quickly ebbed away so you have not gone after all there was something pitiful in her tone of reproach no what made you think i had mr marston told me did he tell you why i guessed that and i thanked you in my heart david was disconcerted the woman he saw corresponded so ill with what he was schooling himself to believe her he sought to conceal his confusion as she had once done and played a part like her he overplayed it well i came to see london life you know it makes a pretty comedy comedies end in tears at times even then common politeness makes us sit them out can you spare me a dance mrs branscome pleaded fatigue and barely suppressed a sigh of relief as she noted her husbands approach david followed her glance and bent over her speaking hurriedly you said you knew why i went away i want to tell you why i came back no no she exclaimed it could be of no use of no help to either of us i came back he went on ignoring her interruption merely to ask you one question will you hear it and answer it i can wait he added as she kept silence then tomorrow as soon as possible mrs branscome replied beaten by his persistency come at seven we dine at eight so i can give you halfanhour but you are ungenerous that night began what may be termed the crisis of hiltons education this was the second time he had caught mrs branscome unawares on the first occasion that of his unexpected arrival in england he did not possess the experience to measure accurately looks and movements or to comprehend them as the connotation of words it is doubtful besides whether had he owned the skill he would have had the power to exercise it so engrossed was he in his own distress by the process however of continually repressing the visible signs of his own emotions he had now learnt to appreciate them in others and in mrs branscomes sudden change of colour in little convulsive movements of her hands and in a certain droop of eyelids veiling eyes which met the gaze frankly as a rule he read this evening sure proofs of the constancy of her heart this fresh knowledge affected him in two ways on the one hand it gave breath to the selfish passion which now dominated his ideas at the same time however it assured him that when he asked his question why did you not send for me an unassailable answer would be forthcoming and moreover by convincing him of this it destroyed the sole excuse he had pleaded to himself for claiming the right to ask it in selfdefence hilton had recourse to his old outcry against the marriage laws and finding this barren came in the end to frankly devising schemes for their circumvention such inward personal conflicts were of necessity strange to a man drynursed on abstractions and after a night of tension they tossed him up on the shores of the morning broken in mind and irresolute for good or ill mrs branscome received him impassively at the appointed time david saw that he was expected to speak to the point and a growing scorn for his own insistence urged him to the same course he plunged abruptly into his subject and his manner showed him in the rough more particularly to himself what i came back to ask you is just this you know you must know that i would have come whatever the consequence why did you not send for me after after why did i not send for you mrs branscome took him up repeating his words mechanically as though their meaning had not reached her you dont mean that you never received my letter oh dont say that it cant have miscarried i registered it then you did write this confirmation of her fear drove a breach through her composure of course of course i wrote she cried you doubt that what can you think of me yes i wrote and when no answer came i fancied you had forgotten me that you had never really cared and so i i married her voice dried in her throat the thought of this ruin of two lives made inevitable by a mistake in which neither shared brought a sense of futility which paralysed her the same idea was working in hiltons mind but to a different end it fixed the true nature of this woman for the first time clearly within his recognition and the new light blinded him before his imagined grievance had always coloured the picture now he began to realise not only that she was no more responsible for the catastrophe than himself but that he must have stood in the same light to her as she had done to him the events of the past few months passed before his mind as on a clear mirror he compared the gentle distinction of her bearing with his own flaunting resentment i am sorry he said i have wronged you in thought and word and action the fact is i never saw you plainly before myself stood in the way mrs branscome barely heeded his words the feelings her watchfulness had hitherto restrained having once broken their barriers swept her away on a full flow she recalled the very terms of her letter she had written it in the room in which they were standing mr branscome had called just as she addressed the envelope she had questioned him about its registration to switzerland and yes he had promised to look after it and had taken it away yes she repeated to herself aloud directing her eyes instinctively towards her husbands study door he promised to post it the sound of the words and a sudden movement from hilton woke her to alarm david had turned to the window and she felt that he had heard and understood the silence pressed on her like a dead weight for hilton this was the crucial moment of his ordeal he had understood only too clearly and this second proof of the harm a petty sin could radiate struck through him the same fiery repulsion which had stung him to revolt when he quitted marstons rooms he flung up the window and faced the sunset strips of black cloud barred it across and he noticed with a minute attention of which he was hardly conscious that their lower edges took a colour like the afterglow on a swiss rock mountain the perception sent a riot of associations through his brain which strengthened his wavering purpose must he lose her after all he thought now that he had risen to a true estimation of her worth his fancy throned kate queen of his mountain home and he turned towards her but a light of fear in her eyes stopped the words on his lips i trust you she said simply the storm of his passions quieted down that one sentence just expressed to him the debt he owed to her in return well he could do no less than leave her her illusion goodbye he said all the good that comes to us somehow seems to spring from women like yourself while we give you nothing but trouble in return even this last misery which my selfishness has brought to you lifts me to breathe a cleaner air he must have forgotten to post it mrs branscome pleaded yes we must believe that goodbye for a moment he stayed to watch her white figure outlined against the dusk of the room and then gently closed the door on her the next morning david left england not however for grindelwald he dreaded the morbid selfishness which grows from isolation and sought a finishing school in the companionship of practical men the twentykroner story the surgeon has a weakness for men who make their living on the sea from the skipper of a dogger bank fishingsmack to the stoker of a cardiff tramp from margate longshoreman to a crabber of the stilly isles he embraces them all in a lusty affection and this not merely out of his own love of salt water but because his diagnosis reveals the gentleman in them more surely than in the general run of his wealthier patients a primitive gentleman if you like lincott will say not above tearing his meat with his fingers or wearing the same shirt night and day for a couple of months on end but still a gentleman as one of the innumerable instances which had built up his conviction lincott will offer you the twentykroner story as he was walking through the wards of his hospital he stopped for a moment by the bed of a brewers drayman who was suffering from an access of delirium tremens the draymans language was violent and voluble but he sank into a coma with the usual suddenness common to such cases and in the pause which followed lincott heard a gentle voice a few beds away earnestly apologising to a nurse for the trouble she was put to why she replied with a laugh i am here to be troubled apologies of the kind are not so frequently heard in the wards of an east end hospital this one besides was spoken with an accent not very pronounced it is true but unfamiliar lincott moved down to the bed it was occupied by a man apparently tall with a pair of remorseful blue eyes set in an open face and a thatch of yellow hair dusted with grey whats the matter asked lincott and the patient explained he was a norseman from finland fiftythree years old and he had worked all his life on english ships he had risen from decky to mate then he had injured himself and since he could work no more he had come into the hospital to be cured lincott examined him found that a slight operation was all the man needed and performed it himself in six weeks time helling as the sailor was named was discharged he made a simple and dignified little speech of thanks to the nurses for their attention and another to the surgeon for saving his life nonsense said lincott as he held out his hand any medical student could have performed that operation then i have another reason to thank you answered helling the nurses have told me about you sir and im grateful you spared the time to perform it yourself what are you going to do asked lincott find a ship sir answered helling then he hesitated and slowly slipped his finger and thumb along the waistband of his trousers but he only repeated i must find a ship and so left the hospital three weeks later helling called at lincotts house in harley street now when hospital patients take the trouble after they have been discharged to find out the doctors private address and call it generally means they have come to beg lincott remembering how hellings simple courtesies had impressed him experienced an actual disappointment he felt his theories about the seafaring man begin to totter however helling was shown into the consultingroom and at the sight of him lincotts disappointment vanished he did not start up since manifestations of surprise are amongst those things with which doctors find it advisable to dispense but he hooked a chair forward with his foot now then sit down chuck yourself about sit down said lincott genially you look bad helling in fact was gaunt with famine his eyes were sunk and dull he was so thin that he seemed to have grown in height i had some trouble in finding a ship he said and sitting down on the edge of the chair twirled his hat in some embarrassment it is three weeks since you left the hospital yes you should have come here before the surgeon was moved to say no answered helling i couldnt come before sir you see i had no ship but i found one this morning and i start tomorrow but for these three weeks you have been starving lincott slipped his hand into his pocket it seemed to him afterwards simply providential that he did not fumble his money that no clink of coins was heard for helling answered yes sir ive been starving he drew back his shoulders and laughed im proud to know that ive been starving he laid his hat on the ground drew out and unclasped his knife felt along the waistband of his breeches cut a few stitches and finally produced a little gold coin this coin he held between his forefinger and thumb forty years ago he said when i was a nipper and starting on my first voyage my mother gave me this she sewed it up in the waistband of my breeches with her own hands and told me never to part with it until id been starving ive been near to starvation often and often enough but i never have starved before this coin has always stood between that and me now however i have actually been starving and i can part with it he got up from his chair and timidly laid the piece of gold on the table by lincotts elbow then he picked up his hat the surgeon said nothing and he did not touch the coin neither did he look at helling but sat with his forehead propped in his hand as though he were reading the letters on his desk helling afraid to speak lest his coin should be refused walked noiselessly to the door and noiselessly unlatched it wait a bit said lincott helling stopped anxiously in the doorway where have you slept lincott paused to steady his voice for the last three weeks he continued under arches by the river sir replied helling on benches along the embankment once or twice in the parks but thats all over now he said earnestly im all right ive got my ship i couldnt part with that before because it was the only thing i had to hang on to the world with but im all right now lincott took up the coin and turned it over in the palm of his hand twenty kroners he said do you know what thats worth in england yes i do answered helling with some trepidation fifteen shillings said lincott think of it fifteen shillings perhaps sixteen i know interrupted helling quickly mistaking the surgeons meaning but please please you mustnt think i value what you have done for me at that its only fifteen shillings but it has meant a fortune to me all the last three weeks each time that ive drawn my belt tighter i have felt that coin underneath it burn against my skin when i passed a coffeestall in the early morning and saw the steam and the cake i knew i could have bought up the whole stall if i chose i could have had meals and meals and meals i could have slept in beds under roofs its only fifteen shillings nothing at all to you and he looked round the consultingroom with its pictures and electric lights but i want you to take it at what it has been worth to me ever since i came out of the hospital lincott took helling into his diningroom on a pedestal stood a great silver vase blazing its magnificence across the room you see that he asked yes said helling it was given to me by a patient it must have cost at the least helling tapped the vase with his knuckles yes sir thats a present he said enviously that is a present lincott laughed and threw up the window you can pitch it out into the street if you like by the side of your coin its muck lincott keeps the coin he points out that helling was fiftythree at the time that he gave him this present and that the operation was one which any practitioner could have performed the fifth picture lady tamworth felt unutterably bored the sensation of lassitude even in its less acute degrees was rare with her for she possessed a nature of so fresh a buoyancy that she was able as a rule to extract diversion from any environment her mind took impressions with the vivid clearness of a mirror and also it should be owned with a mirrors transient objectivity today however the mirror was clouded she looked out of the window a level row of grey houses frowned at her across the street she looked upwards a grey pall of cloud swung over the rooftops the interior of the room appeared to her even less inviting than the street it was the afternoon of the first drawingroom and a debutante was exhibiting herself to her friends she stood in the centre a figure from a twelfthnight cake amidst a babble of congratulations and was plainly occupied in a perpetual struggle to conceal her moments of enthusiasm beneath a crust of deprecatory languor the spectacle would have afforded choice entertainment to lady tamworth had she viewed it in the company of a sympathetic companion solitary appreciation of the humorous however only induced in her a yet more despondent mood the tea seemed tepid the conversation matched the tea epigrams without point sallies void of wit and cynicisms innocent of the sting of an apt application floated about her on a ripple of unintelligent laughter a phrase of mr dales recurred to her mind hock and seltzer with the sparkle out of it so he had stigmatised the style and she sadly thanked him for the metaphor there was moreover a particular reason for her discontent nobody realised the presence of lady tamworth and this unaccustomed neglect shot a barbed question at her breast after all why should they she was useless she reflected she did nothing exercised no influence the thought however was too painful for lengthened endurance the very humiliation of it produced the antidote she remembered that she had at last persuaded her lazy sir john to stand for parliament only wait until he was elected she would exercise an influence then the vision of a salon was miraged before her with herself in the middle deftly manipulating the destinies of a nation lady tamworth a voice sounded at her elbow mr dale she turned with a sudden sprightliness my guardian angel sent you so bad as that i have an intuition she paused impressively upon the word never mind said he soothingly it will go away lady tamworth glared that is as well as she could nature had not really adapted her for glaring i have an intuition she resumed that this is what the suburbs mean and she waved her hand comprehensively they are perhaps a trifle excessive he returned but then you neednt have come oh yes clients of sir john lady tamworth sighed and sank with a weary elegance into a chair mr dale interpreted the sigh ah a wifes duties he began no man can know she interrupted and she spread out her hands in pathetic forgiveness of an overexacting world her companion laughed brutally you are rude she said and laughed too and then tell me something new i met an admirer of yours today but thats nothing new she looked up at him with a plaintive reproach i will begin again he replied submissively i walked down the mileend road this morning to sir johns jutefactory you fail to interest me she said with some emphasis i am so sorry goodbye mr dale yes you may if you like go on with the first story there is only one it was in the mileend road i met the admirer julian fairholm oh lady tamworth sat up and blushed however lady tamworth blushed very readily it was a queer incident mr dale continued i caught sight of a necktie in a little dusty shopwindow near the pavilion theatre i had never seen anything like it in my life it fairly fascinated me seemed to dare me to buy it the ladys foot began to tap upon the carpet mr dale stopped and leaned critically forward well why dont you go on she asked impatiently its pretty he reflected aloud the foot disappeared demurely into the seclusion of petticoats you exasperate me she remarked but her face hardly guaranteed her words we were speaking of ties ah the tie wasnt pretty it was of satin bright yellow with blue spots and an idea struck me yes an idea sir johns election colours are yellow his opponents blue so i thought the tie would make a tactful present symbolical do you see of the state of the parties in the constituency he paused a second time well i went in and bought it well julian fairholm sold it to me lady tamworth stared at the speaker in pure perplexity then all at once she understood and the blood eddied into her cheeks i dont believe it she exclaimed his face would be difficult to mistake mr dale objected besides i had time to assure myself for i had to wait my turn when i entered the shop he was serving a woman with babylinen oh yes julian fairholm sold me the tie lady tamworth kept her eyes upon the ground then she looked up she struck the arm of her chair with her closed fist and cried in a quick petulance how dare he exactly what i thought answered her companion smoothly the colours were crude by themselves the combination was detestable and he an artist too mr dale laughed pleasantly did he speak to you he asked me whether i would take a packet of pins instead of a farthing ah dont she entreated and rose from her chair it might have been her own degradation of which mr dale was speaking by the way he added i was so taken aback that i forgot to present the tie would you no no she said decisively and turned away but a sudden notion checked her on second thoughts i will but i cant promise to make him wear it the smile which sped the words flickered strangely upon quivering lips and her eyes shone with anger however the tie changed hands and lady tamworth tripped down stairs and stepped into her brougham the packet lay upon her lap and she unfolded it a round ticket was enclosed and the bill on the ticket was printed a present from zedediah moss with a convulsion of disgust she swept the parcel on to the floor how dare he she cried again and her thoughts flew back to the brief period of their engagement she had been just kitty arlton in those days the daughter of a poor seacaptain but dowered with the compensating grace of personal attractions providence had indisputably designed her for the establishment of the family fortunes such at all events was the family creed and the girl herself felt no inclination to doubt a faith which was backed by the evidence of her lookingglass julian fairholm at that time shared a studio with her brother and the acquaintance thus begun ripened into an attachment and ended in a betrothal for julian in the common prediction possessed that vague blessing a future it is true the common prediction was always protected by a saving clause if he could struggle free from his mysticism but none the less his pictures were beginning to sell and the family displayed a moderate content the discomposing appearance of sir john tamworth however gave a different complexion to the matter sir john was rich and had besides the confident pertinacity of success in a word kitty arlton married sir john lady tamworths recollections of the episode were characteristically vague they came back to her in pieces like disconnected sections of a wooden puzzle she remembered that she had written an exquisitely pathetic letter to fairholm when the end came as she expressed it and she recalled queer scraps of the artists talk about the danger of forming ties new ties he would say mean new duties and they hamper and clog the will ah yes the will he was always holding forth about that and here was the lecture finally exemplified he was selling babylinen in the mileend road she had borne her disappointment she reflected without any talk about will the thought of her selfsacrifice even now brought the tears to her eyes she saw herself wearing her orangeblossoms in the spirit of an iphigeneia sections of the puzzle however were missing to lady tamworths perceptions for in fact her sense of sacrifice had been mainly artificial and fostered by a vanity which made the possession of a broken romance seem to pose her on a notable pedestal of duty what had really attracted her to julian was the evidence of her power shown in the subjugation of a being intellectually higher than his compeers it was not so much the man she had cared for as the sight of herself in a superior setting a sure proof whereof might have been found in a certain wilful pleasure which she had drawn from constantly impelling him to acts and admissions which she knew to be alien to his nature it was some revival of this idea which explained her exclamation how dare he for his conduct appeared more in the light of an outrage and insult to her than of a degradation of himself he must be rescued from his position she determined she stooped to pick up the bill from the floor as the brougham swung sharply round a corner she looked out of the window the coachman had turned into berkeley square in another hundred yards she would reach home she hastily pulled the checkstring and the footman came to the door drive down the mileend road she said i will fetch sir john home lady tamworth read the address on the bill near the pavilion theatre mr dale had explained she would just see the place this evening she determined and then reflect on the practical course to be pursued the decision relieved her of her sense of humiliation and she nestled back among her furs with a sigh of content there was a pleasurable excitement about her present impulse which contrasted very brightly with her recent ennui she felt that her wish to do something to exert an influence had been providentially answered the task besides seemed to her to have a flavour of antique chivalry it smacked of the princess undoing enchantments and reminded her vaguely of camelot she determined to stop at the house and begin the work at once so she summoned the footman a second time and gave him the address so great indeed was the charm which her conception exercised over her that her very indignation against julian changed to pity he had to be fitted to the chivalric pattern and consequently refashioned her harlequin fancy straightway transformed him into the romantic lover who having lost his mistress had lost the world and therefore naturally held the sale of babylinen on a par with the painting of pictures poor julian she thought the carriage stopped suddenly in front of a shuttered window a neighbouring gaslamp lit up the letters on the board above it z moss this unexpected check in the full flight of ardour dropped her to earth like a plummet and as if to accentuate her disappointment the surrounding shops were aglare with light customers pressed busily in and out of them and even on the roadway naphthajets waved flauntingly over barrows of sweetstuff and fruit only this sordid little house was dark they cant afford to close at this hour she murmured reproachfully the footman came to the carriage door disdain perceptibly struggling through his mask of impassivity why is the shop closed lady tamworth asked the name perhaps my lady he suggested it is friday lady tamworth had forgotten the day very well she said sullenly home at once however she corrected herself adroitly i mean of course fetch sir john first sir john was duly fetched and carried home jubilant at so rare an attention the tie was presented to him on the way and he bellowed his merriment at its shape and colour to her surprise lady tamworth found herself defending the style and inveighing against the monotony of the fashions of the west end nor was this the only occasion on which she disagreed with her husband that evening he launched an aphorism across the dinnertable which he had cogitated from the report of a divorcesuit in the evening papers it is a strange thing he said that the woman who knows her influence over a man usually employs it to hurt him the woman who doesnt employs it unconsciously for his good you dont mean that she asked earnestly i have noticed it more than once he replied for a moment lady tamworths chivalric edifice showed cracks and rents it threatened to crumble like a house of cards but only for a moment for she merely considered the remark in reference to the future she applied it to her present wish to exercise an influence over julian the issue of that however lay still in the dark and was consequently imaginable as inclination prompted a glance at sir julian sufficed to finally reassure her he was rosy and modern and so plainly incapable of appreciating chivalric impulses to estimate them rightly one must have an insight into their nature and therefore an actual experience of their fire but such fire left traces on the person chivalric people were hollowcheeked with luminous eyes at least chivalric men were hollowcheeked she corrected herself with a look at the mirror at all events sir john and his aphorism were beneath serious reflection and she determined to repeat her journey upon the first opportunity the opportunity however was delayed for a week and occasioned lady tamworth no small amount of selfpity here was noble work waiting for her hand and duty kept her chained to the social oar on the afternoon then of the following friday she dressed with what even for her was unusual care aiming at a complex effect of daintiness and severity and drove down in a hansom to whitechapel she stopped the cab some yards from the shop and walked up to the window through the glass she could see julian standing behind the counter his hands she noticed them particularly because he was displaying some cheap skeins of coloured wool seemed perhaps a trifle thinner and more nervous his features a little sharpened and there was a sprinkling of grey in the black of his hair for the first time since the conception of her scheme lady tamworth experienced a feeling of irresolution with fairholm in the flesh before her eyes the task appeared difficult its reality pressed in upon her driving a breach through the flimsy wall of her fancies she resolved to wait until the shop should be empty and to that end took a few steps slowly up the street and returned yet more slowly she looked into the window again julian was alone now and still she hesitated the admiring comments of two loungers on the kerb concerning her appearance at last determined her and she brusquely thrust open the door a little bell jangled shrilly above it and julian looked up lady tamworth he said after the merest pause and with no more than a natural start of surprise lady tamworth however was too taken aback by the cool manner of his greeting to respond at once she had forecast the commencement of the interview upon such wholly different lines that she felt lost and bewildered an abashed confusion was the least that she expected from him and she was prepared to increase it with a nicelytempered indignation now the positions seemed actually reversed he was looking at her with a composed attention while she was filled with embarrassment a suspicion flashed through her mind that she had come upon a fools errand julian she said with something of humility in her voice and she timidly reached out her little gloved hand towards him julian took it into the palm of his own and gazed at it with a sort of wondering tenderness as though he had lighted upon a toy which he remembered to have prized dearly in an almost forgotten childhood this second blow to her pride quickened in her a feeling of exasperation she drew her fingers quickly out of his grasp what brought you down to this she snapped out the words at him she had not come to whitechapel to be slighted at all events i have risen he answered quietly risen and you sell babylinen julian laughed in pure contentment you dont understand he said for a moment he looked at her as one debating with himself and then you have a right to understand i will tell you he leaned across the counter and as he spoke the eager passion of a devotee began to kindle in his eyes and vibrate through the tones of his voice the knowledge of a truth worked into your heart will lift you eh must lift you high but base your life upon that truth centre yourself about it till your thoughts become instincts born from it it must lift you still higher then ah how much higher well i have done that yes thats why i am here and i owe it all to you lady tamworth repeated his words in sheer bewilderment you owe it all to me yes he nodded all to you and with genuine gratitude he added you didnt know the good that you had done ah dont say that she cried the bell tinkled over the shopdoor and a woman entered lady tamworth bent forward and said hastily i must speak to you then you must buy something what shall it be fairholm had already recovered his selfpossession and was drawing out one of the shelves in the wall behind him no no she exclaimed not here i cant speak to you here come and call on me what day will you come julian shook his head not at all i am afraid i have not the time a boy came out from the inner room and began to get ready the shutters ah its friday she said you will be closing soon in five minutes then i will wait for you yes i will wait for you she paused at the door and looked at julian he was deferentially waiting on his customer and lady tamworth noticed with a queer feeling of repugnance that he had even acquired the shopmans trick of rubbing the hands those five minutes proved for her a most unenviable period julians sentence i owe it all to you pressed heavily upon her conscience spoken bitterly she would have given little heed to it but there had been a convincing sincerity in the ring of his voice the words besides brought back to her sir johns uncomfortable aphorism and freighted it with an accusation she applied it now as a searchlight upon her jumbled recollections of julians courtship and began to realise that her efforts during that time had been directed thoughtlessly towards enlarging her influence over him if indeed julian owed this change in his condition to her then sir john was right and she had employed her influence to his hurt and it only made her fault the greater that julian was himself unconscious of his degradation she commenced to feel a personal responsibility commanding her to rescue him from his slough which was increased moreover by a fear that her persuasions might prove ineffectual for julians manner pointed now to an utter absence of feeling so far as she was concerned at last julian came out to her you will leave here she cried impulsively you will come back to us to your friends never he answered firmly you must she pleaded you said you owed it all to me yes well dont you see if you stay here i can never forgive myself i shall have ruined your life ruined it julian asked in a tone of wonder you have made it he stopped and looked at lady tamworth in perplexity the same perplexity was stamped upon her face we are at crosspurposes i think he continued my rooms are close here let me give you some tea and explain to you that you have no cause to blame yourself lady tamworth assented with some relief the speech had an odd civilised flavour which contrasted pleasantly with what she had imagined of his mode of life they crossed the road and turned into a narrow sidestreet julian halted before a house of a slovenly exterior and opened the door a bare rickety staircase rose upwards from their feet fairholm closed the door behind lady tamworth struck a match for it was quite dark within this passage and they mounted to the fourth and topmost floor they stopped again upon a little landing in front of a second door a wallpaper of a cheap and offensive pattern which had here and there peeled from the plaster added lady tamworth observed a paltry air of tawdriness to the poverty of the place julian fumbled in his pocket for a key unlocked the door and stepped aside for his companion to enter following her in he lit a pair of wax candles on the mantelpiece and a brass lamp in the corner of the room lady tamworth fancied that unawares she had slipped into fairyland so great was the contrast between this retreat and the sordid surroundings amidst which it was perched it was furnished with a dainty and almost a feminine luxury the room she could see was no more than an oblong garret but along one side mousecoloured curtains fell to the ground in folds from the angle where the sloping roof met the wall on the other a cheerful fire glowed from a hearth of white tiles and a kettle sang merrily upon the hob a broad couch piled with silk cushions occupied the far end beneath the window and the feet sank with a delicate pleasure into a thick velvety carpet in the centre a small inlaid table of cedar wood held a silver teaservice the candlesticks were of silver also and cast in a light and fantastic fashion the solitary discord was a black easel funereally draped julian prepared the tea and talked while he prepared it it is this way he began quietly you know what i have always believed that the will was the man his soul his life everything well in the old days thoughts and ideas commenced to make themselves felt in me to crop up in my work i would start on a picture with a clear settled design when it was finished i would notice that by some unconscious freak i had introduced a figure an arabesque always something which made the whole incongruous and bizarre i discovered the cause during the week after i received your last letter the thoughts the ideas were yours better than mine perhaps but none the less death to me lady tamworth stirred uneasily under a sense of guilt and murmured a faint objection julian shook off the occupation of his theme and handed her some cake and began again standing over her with the cake in his hand and to all seeming unconscious that there was a strain of cruelty in his words i found out what that meant my emotions were mastering me drowning the will in me you see i cared for you so much then a frank contempt stressing the last word cut into his hearer with the keenness of a knife you are unkind she said weakly theres no reproach to you i have got over it long ago he replied cheerily and you showed me how to get over it thats why i am grateful for i began to wonder after that why i who had always been on my guard against the emotions should become so thoroughly their slave and at last i found out the reason it was the work i was doing your work she exclaimed exactly you remember what plato remarked about the actor how should i asked poor lady tamworth well he wouldnt have him in his ideal state because acting develops the emotions the shifty unstable part of a man but thats true of art as well to do good work in art you must feel your work as an emotion so i cut myself clear from it all i furnished these rooms and came down here to live and julian drew a long breath like a man escaped from danger but why come here lady tamworth urged you might have gone into the country anywhere no no no he answered setting down the cake and pacing about the room wherever else i went i must have formed new ties created new duties i didnt want that ones feelings form the ties ones soul pays the duties no london is the only place where a man can disappear besides i had to do something and i chose this work because it didnt touch me i could throw it off the moment it was done in the shop i earn the means to live i live here but what kind of a life is it she asked in despair i will tell you he replied sinking his tone to an eager whisper but you mustnt repeat it you must keep it a secret when i am in this room alone at night the walls widen and widen away until at last they vanish and he nodded mysteriously at her the roof curls up like a roll of parchment and i am left on an open platform what do you mean gasped lady tamworth yes on an open platform underneath the stars and do you know he sank his voice yet lower i hear them at times very faintly of course their songs have so far to travel but i hear them yes i hear the stars lady tamworth rose in a whirl of alarm before this crazy exaltation her very desire to pursue her purpose vanished for julians manner even more than his words contributed to her fears in spite of his homily emotion was dominant in his expression swaying his body burning on his face and lighting his eyes with a fire of changing colours and every note in his voice was struck within the scale of passion she glanced about the room her eyes fell on the easel dont you ever paint she asked hurriedly he dropped his head and stood shifting from one foot to the other as if he was ashamed at times he said hesitatingly at times i have to i cant help it i have to express myself look he stepped suddenly across the room and slid the curtains back along the rail the wall was frescoed from floor to ceiling julian lady tamworth cried she forgot all her fears in face of this splendid revelation of his skill here was the fulfilment of his promise in the centre four pictures were ranged the stages in the progress of an allegory but executed with such masterful craft and of so vivid an intention that they read their message straightway into the heart of ones understanding round about this group were smaller sketches miniatures of pure fancy it seemed as if the artist had sought relief in painting these from the pressure of his chief design here for instance day and night were chasing one another through the rings of saturn there a swarm of silver stars was settling down through the darkness to the earth julian you must come back you cant stay here i dont mean to stay here long it is merely a haltingplace but for how long i have one more picture to complete they turned again to the wall suddenly something caught lady tamworths eye she bent forward and examined the four pictures with a close scrutiny then she looked back again to julian with a happy smile upon her face you have done these lately quite lately they are the stages of a mans life of the struggle between his passions and his will he began to describe them in the first picture a brutish god was seated on a throne of clay before the god a man of coarse heavy features lay grovelling but from his shoulders sprang a white figure weak as yet and shadowy but pointing against the god the shadow of a spear and underneath was written at last he knoweth what he made in the second the figure which grovelled and that which sprang from its shoulders were plodding along a highroad at night chained together by the wrist the white figure halted behind the other pressed on and underneath was written they know each other not in the third the figures marched level that which had grovelled scowling at its companion but the white figure had grown tall and strong and watched its companion with contempt above the sky had brightened with the gleam of stars and underneath was written they know each other in the fourth the white figure pressed on ahead and dragged the other by the chain impatiently before them the sun was rising over the edge of a heath and the road ran straight towards it in a golden line and underneath was written he knoweth his burden lady tamworth waited when he had finished in a laughing expectancy and is that all she asked is that all no he replied slowly there is yet a further stage it is unfinished and he pointed to the easel i dont mean that is that all you have to say of these i think so yes look at me julian turned wonderingly to lady tamworth she watched him with a dancing sparkle of her eyes now look at the pictures julian obeyed her well she said after a pause with a touch of anxiety what do you see now nothing nothing she asked do you mean that yes what should i see she caught him by the arm and stared intently into his eyes in a horror of disbelief he met her gaze with a frank astonishment she dropped his arm and turned away what should i see he repeated nothing she echoed with a quivering sadness in her voice it is late i must go the white figure in each of those four pictures wore her face idealised and illumined but still unmistakably her face and he did not know it could not perceive it though she stood by his side the futility of her errand was proved to her she drew on her gloves and looking towards the easel inquired dully what stage is that the last and it is the last picture i shall paint as soon as it is completed i shall leave here you will leave she asked paying little heed to his words yes the experiment has not succeeded and he waved a hand towards the wall i shall take better means next time how much remains to be done lady tamworth stepped over to the easel with a quick spring julian placed himself in front of it no he cried vehemently raising a hand to warn her off no lady tamworths curiosity began to reawaken you have shown me the rest i know you had a right to see them then why not that i have told you he said stubbornly it is not finished but when it is finished she insisted julian looked at her strangely well why not he said reasoning with himself why not it is the masterpiece you will let me know when its ready i will send it to you for i shall leave here the day i finish it they went down stairs and back into the mileend road julian hailed a passing hansom and lady tamworth drove westwards to berkeley square the fifth picture arrived a week later in the dusk of the afternoon lady tamworth unpacked it herself with an odd foreboding it represented an orchard glowing in the noontide sun from the branches of a tree with lolling tongue and swollen twisted face swung the figure which had grovelled before the god a broken chain dangled on its wrist a few links of the chain lay on the grass beneath and above the white figure winged and triumphant faded into the blue of the sky and underneath was written he freeth himself from his burden lady tamworth rushed to the bell and pealed loudly for her maid quick she cried i am going out but the shrill screech of a newsboy pierced into the room with a cry she flung open the window she could hear his voice plainly at the corner of the square for a while she clung to the sash in a dumb sickness then she said quietly never mind i will not go out after all i did not know i was so late
