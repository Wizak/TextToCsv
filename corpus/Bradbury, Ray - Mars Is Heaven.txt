mars is heaven by ray bradbury the ship came down from space it came from the stars and the black velocities and the shining movements and the silent gulfs of space it was a new ship it had fire in its body and men in its metal cells and it moved with a clean silence fiery and warm in it were seventeen men including a captain the crowd at the ohio field had shouted and waved their hands up into the sunlight and the rocket bad bloomed out great flowers of beat and cobs and run away into space on the third voyage to mars now it was decelerating with metal efficiency in the upper martian atmospheres it was still a thing of beauty and strength it had moved in the midnight waters of space like a pale sea leviathan it had passed the ancient moon and thrown itself onward into one nothingness following another the men within it had been battered thrown about sickened made well again each in his turn one man had died but now the remainiig sixteen with their eyes clear in their heads and their faces pressed to the thick glass ports watched mars swing up under them mars mars good old mars here we are cried navigator lustig good old mars said samuel hinkston archaeologist well said captain john black the ship landed softly on a lawn of green grass outside upon the lawn stood an iron deer further up the lawn a tall brown victorian house sat in the quiet sunlight all covered with scrolls and rococo its windows made of blue and pink and yellow and green colored glass upon the porch were hairy geraniums and an old swing which was hooked into the porch ceiling and which now swung back and forth back and forth in a little breeze at the top of the house was a cupola with diamond leadedglass windows and a duncecap roof through the front window you could see an ancient piano with yellow keys and a piece of music titled beautiful ohio sitting on the music rest around the rocket in four directions spread the little town green and motionless in the martian spring there were white houses and red brick ones and tall elm trees blowing in the wind and tall maples and horse chestnuts and church steeples with golden bells silent in them the men in the rocket looked out and saw this then they looked at one another and then they looked out again they held on to each others elbows suddenly unable to breathe it seemed their faces grew pale and they blinked constantly running from glass port to glass port of the ship ill be damned whispered lustig rubbing his face with his numb fingers his eyes wet ill be thinned damned damned it cant be it just cant be said samuel hinkston lord said captain john black there was a call from the chemist sir the atmosphere is fine for breathing sir black turned slowly are you sure no doubt of it sir then well go out said lustig lord yes said samuel hinkston hold on said captain john black just a moment nobody gave any orders but sir sir nothing how do we know what this is we know what it is sir said the chemist its a small town withgood air in it sir and its a small town the like of earth towns said samuel hinkston the archaeologist incredible j cant be but it is captain john black looked at him idly do you think that the civilizations of two planets can progress at the same rate and evolve in the same way hinkston i wouldnt have thought so sir captain black stood by the port look out there the geraniums a specialized plant that specific variety has only been known on earth for fifty years think of the thousands of years of time it takes to evolve plants then tell me if it is logical that the martians should have one leaded glass windows two cupolas three porch swings four an instrument that looks like a piano and probably is a piano and five if you look closely if a martian composer would have published a piece of music titled strangely enough beautiful ohio all of which means that we have an ohio river here on marst it is quite strange sir strange hell its absolutely impossible and i suspect the whole bloody shooting setup somethings wrong here and im not leaving the ship until i know what it is oh sir said lustig dam it said samuel hinkston sir i want to investigate this at first hand it may be that there are similar patterns of thought movement civilization on every planet in our system we may be on the threshold of the great psychological and metaphysical discovery in our time sir dont you think im willing to wait a moment said captain john black it may be sir that we are looking upon a phenomenon that for the first time would absolutely prove the existence of a god sir there are many people who are of good faith without such proof mr hinkston im one myself sir but certainly a thing like this out there said hinkston could not occur without divine intervention sir it fills me with such terror and elation i dont know whether to laugh or cry sir do neither then until we know what were up against up against sir inquired lustig i see that were up against nothing its a good quiet green town much like the one i was born in and i like the looks of it when were you born lustig in sfr that makes you fifty years old now doesnt it this being yes sir and you hinkston sir in illinois and this looks swell to me sir this couldnt be heaven said the captain ironically though i must admit it looks peaceful and cool and pretty much like green bluff where i was born in lie looked at the chemist the airs all right is it yes sir well then tell you what well do lustig you and ilinkston and i will fetch ourselves out to look this town over the other men will stay aboard ship if anything untoward happens lift the ship and get the hell out do you bear what i say craner yes sir the hell out well go sir leaving you a loss of three mens better than a whole ship if something bad happens get back to earth and warn the next rocket thats lingles rocket i think which will be completed and ready to take off some time around next christmas what he has to meet up with if theres something hostile about mars we certainly want the next expedition to be well armed so are we sir weve got a regular arsenal with us tell the men to stand by the guns then as lustig and hinkston and i go out right sir come along lustig hinkston the three men walked together down through the levels of the ship it was a beautiful spring day a robin sat on a blossoming apple tree and sang continuously showers of petal snow sifted down when the wind touched the apple tree and the blossom smell drifted upon the air somewhere in the town somebody was playing the piano and the music came and went came and went softly drowsily the song was beautiful dreamer somewhere else a phonograph scratchy and faded was hissing out a record of roamin in the gloamin sung by harry lapder the three men stood outside the ship the port closed behind them at every window a face pressed looking out the large metal guns pointed this way and that ready now the phonograph record being played was oh give me a june night the moonlight and you lustig began to tremble samuel hinkston did likewise hinkstons voice was so feeble and uneven that the captain had to ask him to repeat what he had said i said sir that i think i have solved this all of this sir and what is the solution hinkston the soft wind blew the sky was serene and quiet and somewhere a stream of water ran through the cool caverns and treeshadings of a ravine somewhere a horse and wagon trotted and rolled by bumping sir it must be it has to be this is the only solution rocket travel began to mars in the years before the first world war sir s the captain stared at his archaeologist no but yes sir you must admit look at all of this how else explain it the houses the lawns the iron deer the flowers the pianos the music hinkston hinkston oh and the captain put his hand to his face shaking his head his hand shaking nov his lips blue sir listen to me hinkston took his elbow persuasively and looked up into the captains face pleading say that there were some people in the year perhaps who hated wars and wanted to get away from earth and they got together some scientists in secret and built a rocket and came out here to mars no no hinkston why not the world was a different place in they could have kept it a secret much more easily but the work hinkston the work of building a corn plex thing like a rocket oh no no the captain looked at his shoes looked at his hands looked at the houses and then at hinkston and they caine up here and haturally the houses they built were similar to earth houses because they brought the cultural architecture with them and here it is and theyve lived here all these years said the captain in peace and quiet sir yes maybe they made a few trips to bring enough people here for one small town and then stopped for fear of being discovered thats why the town seems so oldfashioned i dont see a thing myself that is older than the year do you no frankly i dont hinkston these are our people sir this is an american city its definitely not european thatthats right too hinkston or maybe just maybe sir rocket travel is older than we think perhaps it started in some part of the world hundreds of years ago was discovered and kept secret by a small number of men and they came to mars with only occasional visits to earth over the centuries you make it sound almost reasonable it is sir it has to be we have the proof here before us all we have to do now is find some people and verify it youre right there of course we cant just stand here and talk did you bring your gun yes but we wont need it well see about it come along well ring that doorbell and see if anyone is home their boots were deadened of all sound in the thick green grass it smelled from a fresh mowing in spite of himself captain john black felt a great peace come over him it had been thirty years since he had been in a small town and the buzzing of spring bees on the air lulled and quieted him and the fresh look of things was a balm to the soul hollow echoes sounded from under the boards as they walked across the porch and stood before the screen door inside they could see a bead curtain hung across the hall entry and a crystal chandelier and a maxfleld parrish painting framed on one wall over a comfortable morris chair the house smelled old and of the attic and infinitely comfortable you could hear the tinkle of ice rattling in a lemonade pitcher in a distant kitchen because of the day someone was preparing a soft lemon driel captain john black rang the bell footsteps dainty and thin came along the hail and a kindfaced lady of some forty years dressed in the sort of dress you might expect in the year peered out at them can i help you she asked beg your pardon said captain black uncertainly but were looking for that is could you help us i mean he stopped she looked out at him with dark wondering eyes if youre selling something she said im much too busy and i havent time she turned to go no wail he cried bewilderedly what town is this she looked him up and down as if he were crazy what do you mean what town is it how could you be in a town and not know what town it was the captain looked as if he wanted to go sit under a shady apple tree i beg your pardon he said but were strangers here were from earth and we want to know how this town got here and you got here are you census takers she asked no be said what do you want then she demanded well said the captain well she asked how long has this town been here he wondered it was built in she snapped at them is this a game no not a game cried the captain oh god be said look here were from earthi from where she said prom earth he said wheres that she said from earth he cried out of the ground do you mean no from the planet earth he almost shouted here je insisted come out on the porфh and ill show you no she said i wont come out there you are all evidently quite mad from the sun lustig and hinkston stood behind the captain hinkston now spoke up mrs he said we came in a flying ship across space among the stars we came from the third planet from the sun earth to tbis planet which is mars now do you understand mrs mad from the sun she said taking hold of the door go away now before i call my husband whos upstairs taking a nap and hell beat you all with his fists but said hinkston this is mars is it not this explained the woman as if she were addressing a child is green lake wisconsin on the continent of america surrounded by the pacific and atlantic oceans on a place called the world or sometimes the earth go away now goodbye she slammed the door the three men stood before the door with their hands up in the air toward it as if pleading with her to open it once more they looked at one another lets knock the door down said lustig we cant sighed the captain why not she didnt do anything bad did she were the strangers here this is private property good god hinkstonl he went and sat down on the porchstep what sir did it ever strike you that maybe we got ourselves somehow some way fouled up and by accident came back and landed on earth oh sir oh sir oh oh sir and hinkston sat down numbly and thought about it lustig stood up in the sunlight how could we have done that i dont know just let me think iinkston said but we checked every mile of the way and we saw mars and our chronometers said so many miles gone and we went past the moon and out into space and here we are on mars im sure were on mars sir lustig said but suppose that by accident in space in time or something we landed on a planet in space in another time suppose this is earth thirty or fifty yeara ago maybe we got lost in the dimensions do you think oh go away lustig are the men in the ship keeping an eye on us hink ston at their guns sir lustig went to the door rang the bell when the door opened again he asked what year is this of course cried the woman furiously and slammed the door again did you bear that lustig ran back to them wildly she said we have gone back in time this iv earth lutig sat down and the three men let the wonder and terror of the thought afflict them their hands stirred fitfully on their knees the wind blew nodding the locks of hair on their heads the captain stood up brushing off his pants i never thought it would be like this it scares the hell out of me how can a thing like this happen will anybody in the whole town believe us won dered hinkston are we playing around with something dangerous time i mean shouldnt we just take off and go home no well try another house they walked three houses down to a little white cot tage under an oak tree i like to be as logical as i can get said the captain he nodded at the town how does this sound to you hinkston suppose as you said originally that rocket travel occurred years ago and when the earth people had lived here a numbet of years they began to get homesick for earth first a mild neuro sis about it then a fullfledged psychosis then threatened insanity what would you do as a psychiatrist if fated with such a problem hinkston thought well i think id rearrange the civilization on mars so it resembled earth more and more each day if there was any way of reproducing every plant every road and every lake and even an ocean i would do so then i would by some vast crowd hyp nosis theoretically anyway convince everyone in a town this size that this really was earth not mars at all good enough hinkston i think were on the right track now that woman in that house back there just minks shes living on earth it protects her sanity she and all the others in this town are the patients of the greatest experiment in migration and hypnosis you will ever lay your eyes on in your life thats it sir cried lustig well the captain sighed now were getting some where i feel better it all sounds a bit more logical now this talk about time and going back and forth and traveling in time turns my stomach upside down but this way he actually smiled for the first time in a month well it looks as if well be fairly welcome here or will we sir said lustig after all like the pilgrims these people came here to escape earth maybe they wont be too happy to see us sir maybe theyll try to drive us out or kill us we have superior weapons if that should happen anyway all we can do is try this next house now up we go but they had hardly crossed the lawn when lustig stopped and looked off across the town down the quiet dreaming afternoon street sir he said what is it lustig asked the captain oh sir sir what i see what i do see now before me oh oh said lustig and he began to cry his fingers came up twisting and trembling and his face was all wonder and joy and incredulity he sounded as if any moment he might go quite insane with happiness he looked down the street and he began to run stumblin awkwardly falling picking himself up and running on oh god god thank you god thank you dont let him get away the captain broke into a run now lustig was running at full speed shouting he turned into a yard half way down the little shady side street and leaped up upon the porch of a large green house with an iron rooster on the rool re was beating upon the door shouting and hollering and crying whаn hinkston and the captain ran up and stood in the yard the door opened lustig yanked the screen wide and in a high wail of discovery and happiness cried out grandma grandpa two old people stood in the dooeway their faces light lug up albert their voices piped and they rushed out to embrace and pat him on the back and move around him albert oh albert its been so many years how youve grown boy how big you ate boy oh albert boy how are you grandma grandpa sobbed albert lustig good to see you you look fine fine oh fine he held them turned them kissed them hugged them cried on them held them out again blinked at the little old people the sun was in the sky the wind blew the grass was green the screen door stood open come in lad come in theres lemonade for youfresh lots of it grandma grandpa good to see you ive got friends down here here lustig turned and waved wildly at the captain and hinkston who all during the adventure on the porch had stood in the shade of a tree holding onto each other captain captain come up come up i want you to meet my grandfolks howdy said the folks any friend of alberts is ours too dont stand there with your mouths openi come on in the living room of the old house it was cool and a grandfather clock ticked high and long and bronzed in one corner there were soft pillows on large couches and walls filled with books and a rug cut in a thick rose pattern and antimacassars pinned to furniture and lemonade in the hand sweating and cool on the thirsty tonguo heres to our health grandma tipped her glass to her porcelain teeth how long you been here grandma said lustig a good many years she said tartly ever since we died ever since you what asked captain john black putting his drink down oh yes lustig looked at his captain theyve been dead thirty years and you sit there calmly cried the captain tush said the old woman and winked glitteringly at john black who are we to question what happens here we are whats life anyways who does what for why and where all we know is here we are alive again and no questions asked a second chance she toddled over and held out her thin wrist to captain john black feel he felt solid aint i she asked he nodded you hear my voice dont you she inquired yes he did well then she said in triumph why go around questioning well said the captain its simply that we never thought wed find a thing like this on mars and now youve found it i dare say theres lots on every planet thatll show you gods infinite ways s this heaven asked hinkston nonsense no its a world and we get a second chance nobody told us why but then nobody told us why we were on earth either that other earth i mean the one you came from how do we know there wasnt another before that one a good question said the captain the captain stood up and slapped his hand on his leg in an offhand fashion weve got to be going its been nice thank you for the drinks he stopped he turned and looked toward the door startled par away in the sunlight there was a sound of voices a crowd a shouting and a great hello whats that asked hinkston well soon find out and captain john black was out the front door abruptly jolting across the green lawn and into the street of the martian town he stood looking at the ship the ports were open and his crew were streaming out waving their hands a crowd of people had gathered and in and through and among these people the members of the crew were running talking laughing shaking hands people did little dances people swarmed the rocket lay empty and abandoned a brass band exploded in the sunlight flinging off a gay tune from upraised tubas and trumpets there was a bang of drums and a shrill of fifes little girls with golden hair jumped up and down little boys shouted hoorayl and fat men passed around tencent cigars the mayor of the town made a speech then each member of the crew with a mother on one arm a father or sister on the other was spirited off down the street into little cottages or big mansions and doors slammed shut the wind rose in the clear spring sky and all was silent the brass band had banged off around a corner leaving the rocket to shine and dazzle alone in the sunlight abandoned cried the captain abandoned the ship they did ill have their skins by god they had orders sir said lustig dont be too hard on them those were all old relatives and friends thats no excuse think how they felt captain seeing familiar faces outside the ship i would have obeyed orders i would havo the captains mouth remained open striding along the sidewalk under the martian sun tall smiling eyes blue face tan came a young man of some twentysix years john the man cried and broke into a run what said captainjohn black he swayed john you old beggar you the man ran up and gripped his hand and slapped him on the back its you said john black of course whod you think it was edward the captain appealed now to lustig and hinkston holding the strangers hand this is my brothet edward ed meet my men lustig hinkstont my brother they tugged at each others hands and arms and then finally embraced ed john you old bum you youre locking fine ed but ed whatis this you havent changed over the years you died i remember when you were twentysix and was nineteen oh god so many years ago and here you are and lord what goes on what goes on edward black gave him a brotherly knock on the chin moms waiting he said mom and dad too and dad the captain lmost fell to earth as if hit upon the chest with a mighty weapon he walked stiffly and awkwardly out of coordination he stuttered and whispered and talked only one or two words at a time mom alive dad where at the old house on oak knoll avenue the old house the captain stared in delighted amazement did you hear that lustig hinkstou i know its hard for you to beliуve but alive real dont i feel real the strong arm the firm grip the white smile the light curling hair hinkaton was gone he had seen his own house down the street and was running for it lustig was grinning now you understand sir what happened to everybody on the ship they couldnt help themselves yes yes said the captain eyes shut yes he put out his hand when i open my eyes youll be gone he opened his eyes youre still here god edward you look fine come along lunch is waiting for you i told mom lustig said sir ui be with my grandfolks if you want me what oh fine lustig later then edward grabbed his arm and marched him you need support i do my knees all funny my stomach loose god theres the house remember it remember it hell i bet i can beat you to the front porch they ran the wind roared over captain john blacks ears the earth roared under his feet he saw the golden figure of edward black pull ahead of him in the amazing dream of reality he saw the house rush forward the door open the screen swing back beat you cried edward bounding up the steps im an old man panted the cap tam and youre still young but then you always beat me i remember in the doorway mom pink and plump and bright and behind her pepper grey dad with his pipe in his hand mom dad he ran up the steps like a child to meet them it was a fine long afternoon they finished lunch and they sat in the living room and he told them all about his rocket and his being captain and they nodded and smiled upon him and mother was just the same and dad bit the end off a cigar and lighted it in his old fashion mom brought in some iced tea in the middle of the afternoon then there was a big turkey dinner at night and time flowing oil when the drumsticks were sucked clean and lay brittle upon the plates the captain leaned back in his chair and exhaled his deep contentment dad poured him a small glass of dry sherry it was seventhirty in the evening night was in all the trees and coloring the sky and the lamps were halos of dim light in the gentle house from all the other houses down the streets came sounds of music pianos playing laughter mom put a record on the victrola and she and captain john black bad a dance she was wearing the same perfume he remembered from the summer when she and dad had been killed in the train accident she was very real in his arms as they danced lightly to the music ill wake in the morning said the captain and ill be in my rocket in space and this will be gone no no dont think that she cried softly pleadingly were here dont question god is good to us lets be happy the record ended with a hissing youre tired son said dad he waved his pipe you and ed go on upstairs your old bedroom is waiting for you the old one the brass bed and all laughed edward but i should report mymen in why mother was logical why well i dont know no reason i guess no none at all whats the difference he shook his head im not being very logical these days good night son she kissed his cheek night mom sleep tight son dad shook his hand same to you pop its good to have you home its good to be home he left the land of cigar smoke and perfume and books and gentle light and ascended the stairs talking talking with edward edward pushed a door open and there was the yellow brass bed and the old semaphore banners from college days and a very musty raccoon coat which he petted with strange muted affection its too much he said faintly like being in a thunder shower without an umbrella fm soaked to the skin with emotion im numb im tired a nights sleep between cool clean sheets for you my bucko edward slapped wide the snowy linens and flounced the pillows then he put up a window and let the night blooming jasmine float in there was moonlight and the sound of distant dancing and whispering so this is mars said the captain undressing so this is mars edward undressed in idle leisurely moves drawing his shirt off over his head revealing golden shoulders and the good muscular neck the lights were out they were into bed side by side as in the days how many decades ago the captain lolled and was nourished by the night wind pushing the lace curtains out upon the dark room air among the trees upon a lawn someone had cranked up a portable phonograph and now it was playing softly ill be loving you always with a love thats true always the thought of anna came to his mind is anna here his brother lying straight out in the moonlight from the window waited and then said yes shes out of town but shell be here in the morning the captain shut his eyes i want to see anna very much the room was square and quiet except for their breathing good night ed a pause good night john he lay peacefully letting his thoughts float for the first time the stress of the day was moved aside all of the excitement was calmed he could think logically now it had all been emotion the bands playing the sight of familiar faces the sick pounding of your heart but now how he thought how was all this made and why for what purpose out of the goodness of some kind god was god then really that fine and thoughtful of his children how and why and what for he thought of the various theories advanced in the first heat of the afternoon by hinkston and lustig he let all kinds of new theories drop in lazy pebbles down through his mind as through a dark water now turning throwing out dull flashes of white light mars earth mom dad edward mars martians who had lived here a thousand years ago on mars martians or had this always been like this martians he repeated the word quietly inwardly he laughed out loud almost he had the ridiculous theory all of a sudden it gave him a kind of аhilled feeling it was really nothing to think of of course highly improbable silly forget it ridiculous but he thought just suppose just suppose now that there were martians living on mars and they saw our ship coming and saw us inside our ship and hated us suppose now just for the hell of it that they wanted to destroy us as invaders as unwanted ones and they wanted to do it in a very clever way so that we would be taken off guard well what would the best weapon be that a martian could use against earthmen with atom weapons the answer was interesting telepathy hypnosis mem ory and imagination suppose all these houses werent real at all this bed not real but only figments of my own imagination given substance by telepathy and hypnosis by the martians suppose these houses are really some other shape a martian shape but by playing on my desires and wants these martians have made this seem like my old home town my old house to lull me out of my suspicions what better way to fool a man by his own emotions and suppose those two people in the next room asleep are not my mother and father at all but two martians incredibly brilliant with the ability to keep me under this dreaming hypnosis all of the time and that brass band today what a clever plan it would be first fool lustig then fool hinkston then gather a crowd around the rocket ship and wave and all the men in the ship seeing mothers aunts uncles sweethearts dead ten twenty years ago naturally disregardig orders would rush out and abandon the ship what more atural what more unsuspecting what more simple a man doesnt ask too many questions when his mother is suddenly brought back to life hes much too happy and the brass band played and everybody was taken off to private homes and here we all are tonight in various houses in various beds with no weapons to protect us and the rocket lies in the moonlight empty and wouldnt it be horrible and terrifying to discover that all of this was part of some great clever plan by the martians to divide and conquer us and kill us some time during the night perhaps my brother here on this bed wifi change form melt shift and become a oneeyed green and yellowtoothed martian it would be very simple for him just to turn over in bed and put a knife into my heart and in all those other houses down the street a dozen other brothers or fathers suddenly melting away and taking out knives and doing things to the unsuspecting sleeping men of earth his hands were shaking under the covers his body was cold suddenly it was not a theory suddenly he was very afraid he lifted himself in bed an listened the night was very quiet the music had stopped the wind had died his brother lay sleeping beside him very carefully he lifted the sheets rolled them back he slipped from bed and was walking softly across the room when his brothers voice said where are you going what his brothers voice was quite cold i said where do you think youre going for a drink of water but youre not thirsty yes yes i ani no youre not captain john black broke and ran across the room he screamed he screamed twice he never reached the door in the morning the brass band played a mournful dirge from every house in the street came little solemn processions bearing long boxes and along the sunfilled street weeping and changing caine the grandmas and grandfathers and mothers and sisters and brothers walking to the churchyard where there were open holes dug freshly and new tombstones installed seventeen holes in all and seventeen tombstones three of the tombstones said captain john black albert lustig and samuel iflnkston the mayor made a little sad speech his face sometimes looking like the mayor sometimes looking like some thing else mother and father black were there with brother edward and they cried their faces melting now from a familiar face into something else grandpa and grandma lustig were there weeping their faces also shifting like wax shivering as a thing does in waves of heat on a summer day the coffins were lowered somebody murmured about the unexpected and sudden deaths of seventeen fine men during the night earth was shoveled in on the coffin tops after the funeral the brass band slammed and banged into town and the crowd stood around and waved and shouted as the rocket was torn to pieces and strewn about and blown up
