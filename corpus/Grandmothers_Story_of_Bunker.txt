illustration grandmothers story of bunker hill battle t is like stirring living embers when at eighty one remembers all the achings and the quakings of the times that tried mens souls when i talk of whig and tory when i tell the rebel story to you the words are ashes but to me theyre burning coals i had heard the muskets rattle of the april running battle lord percys hunted soldiers i can see their red coats still but a deadly chill comes oer me as the day looms up before me when a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of bunkers hill illustration illustration t was a peaceful summers morning when the first thing gave us warning was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore child says grandma whats the matter what is all this noise and clatter have those scalping indian devils come to murder us once more poor old soul my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking to hear her talk of indians when the guns began to roar she had seen the burning village and the slaughter and the pillage when the mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door illustration illustration then i said now dear old granny dont you fret and worry any for ill soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play there cant be mischief in it so i wont be gone a minute for a minute then i started i was gone the livelong day no time for bodicelacing or for lookingglass grimacing down my hair went as i hurried tumbling halfway to my heels god forbid your ever knowing when theres blood around her flowing how the lonely helpless daughter of a quiet household feels illustration illustration in the street i heard a thumping and i knew it was the stumping of the corporal our old neighbor on that wooden leg he wore with a knot of women round him it was lucky i had found him so i followed with the others and the corporal marched before they were making for the steeple the old soldier and his people the pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair just across the narrow river oh so close it made me shiver stood a fortress on the hilltop that but yesterday was bare illustration illustration not slow our eyes to find it well we knew who stood behind it though the earthwork hid them from us and the stubborn walls were dumb here were sister wife and mother looking wild upon each other and their lips were white with terror as they said the hour has come the morning slowly wasted not a morsel had we tasted and our heads were almost splitting with the cannons deafening thrill when a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately it was prescott one since told me he commanded on the hill illustration illustration every womans heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure with the banyan buckled round it standing up so straight and tall like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure through the storm of shells and cannonshot he walked around the wall at eleven the streets were swarming for the redcoats ranks were forming at noon in marching order they were moving to the piers how the bayonets gleamed and glistened as we looked far down and listened to the trampling and the drumbeat of the belted grenadiers illustration illustration at length the men have started with a cheer it seemed fainthearted in their scarlet regimentals with their knapsacks on their backs and the reddening rippling water as after a seafights slaughter round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks so they crossed to the other border and again they formed in order and the boats came back for soldiers came for soldiers soldiers still the time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting at last theyre moving marching marching proudly up the hill illustration illustration we can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing now the front rank fires a volley they have thrown away their shot for behind their earthwork lying all the balls above them flying our people need not hurry so they wait and answer not then the corporal our old cripple he would swear sometimes and tipple he had heard the bullets whistle in the old french war before calls out in words of jeering just as if they all were hearing and his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor illustration illustration oh fire away ye villains and earn king georges shillins but yell waste a ton of powder afore a rebel falls you may bang the dirt and welcome theyre as safe as danl malcolm ten foot beneath the gravestone that youve splintered with your balls in the hush of expectation in the awe and trepidation of the dread approaching moment we are wellnigh breathless all though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing we are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall illustration illustration just a glimpse the air is clearer they are nearer nearer nearer when a flash a curling smokewreath then a crash the steeple shakes the deadly truce is ended the tempests shroud is rended like a morning mist it gathered like a thundercloud it breaks oh the sight our eyes discover as the blueblack smoke blows over the redcoats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay here a scarlet heap is lying there a headlong crowd is flying like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray illustration illustration then we cried the troops are routed they are beat it cant be doubted god be thanked the fight is over ah the grim old soldiers smile tell us tell us why you look so we could hardly speak we shook so are they beaten are they beaten are they beaten wait a while oh the trembling and the terror for too soon we saw our error they are baffled not defeated we have driven them back in vain and the columns that were scattered round the colors that were tattered toward the sullen silent fortress turn their belted breasts again illustration illustration all at once as we are gazing lo the roofs of charlestown blazing they have fired the harmless village in an hour it will be down the lord in heaven confound them rain his fire and brimstone round them the robbing murdering redcoats that would burn a peaceful town they are marching stern and solemn we can see each massive column as they near the naked earthmound with the slanting walls so steep have our soldiers got fainthearted and in noiseless haste departed are they panicstruck and helpless are they palsied or asleep illustration illustration now the walls theyre almost under scarce a rod the foes asunder not a firelock flashed against them up the earthwork they will swarm but the words have scarce been spoken when the ominous calm is broken and a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm so again with murderous slaughter pelted backwards to the water fly pigots running heroes and the frightened braves of howe and we shout at last theyre done for its their barges they have run for they are beaten beaten beaten and the battles over now illustration illustration and we looked poor timid creatures on the rough old soldiers features our lips afraid to question but he knew what we would ask not sure he said keep quiet once more i guess theyll try it heres damnation to the cutthroats then he handed me his flask saying gal youre looking shaky have a drop of old jamaiky im afeard therell be more trouble afore the job is done so i took one scorching swallow dreadful faint i felt and hollow standing there from early morning when the firing was begun illustration illustration all through those hours of trial i had watched a calm clock dial as the hands kept creeping creeping they were creeping round to four when the old man said theyre forming with their bagonets fixed for storming its the deathgrip thats acoming they will try the works once more with brazen trumpets blaring the flames behind them glaring the deadly wall before them in close array they come still onward upward toiling like a dragons fold uncoiling like the rattlesnakes shrill warning the reverberating drum illustration illustration over heaps all torn and gory shall i tell the fearful story how they surged above the breastwork as a sea breaks over a deck how driven yet scarce defeated our wornout men retreated with their powderhorns all emptied like the swimmers from a wreck it has all been told and painted as for me they say i fainted and the woodenlegged old corporal stumped with me down the stair when i woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted on the floor a youth was lying his bleeding breast was bare illustration illustration and i heard through all the flurry send for warren hurry hurry tell him heres a soldier bleeding and hell come and dress his wound ah we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow how the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground who the youth was what his name was where the place from which he came was who had brought him from the battle and had left him at our door he could not speak to tell us but t was one of our brave fellows as the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore illustration illustration for they all thought he was dying as they gathered round him crying and they said oh how theyll miss him and what will his mother do then his eyelids just unclosing like a childs that has been dozing he faintly murmured mother and i saw his eyes were blue why grandma how youre winking ah my child it sets me thinking of a story not like this one well he somehow lived along so we came to know each other and i nursed him like a mother till at last he stood before me tall and rosycheeked and strong illustration illustration and we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather please to tell us what his name was just your own my little dear theres his picture copley painted we became so well acquainted that in short thats why im grandma and you children all are here
