chicago newsboy news and mail one cent each half a dozen chicago newsboys varying in age from ten to sixteen years with piles of papers in their hands joined in the chorus they were standing in front and at the sides of the sherman house on the corner of clark and randolph streets one of the noted buildings in the lake city on the opposite side of randolph street stands a gloomy stone structure the court house and city hall in the shadow of these buildings at the corner luke walton one of the largest newsboys had posted himself there was something about his bearing and appearance which distinguished him in a noticeable way from his companions to begin with he looked out of place he was well grown with a frank handsome face and was better dressed than the average newsboy that was one reason perhaps why he preferred to be by himself rather than to engage in the scramble for customers which was the habit of the boys around him it was halfpast five the numerous cars that passed were full of business men clerks and boys returning to their homes after a busy day luke had but two papers left but these two for some unaccountable reason remained on his hands an unusual length of time but at length a comfortablelooking gentleman of middle age coming from the direction of la salle street paused and said you may give me a news my boy here you are sir he said briskly the gentleman took the paper and thrusting his hand into his pocket began to feel for a penny but apparently without success i declare he said smiling i believe i am penniless i have nothing but a fivedollar bill never mind sir take the paper and pay me to morrow but i may not see you i am generally here about this time and if i shouldnt see you you will lose the penny i will risk it sir said luke smiling you appear to have confidence in me yes sir then it is only fair that i should have confidence in you luke looked puzzled for he didnt quite understand what was in the gentlemans mind i will take both of your papers here is a fivedollar bill you may bring me the change tomorrow at my office no la salle street my name is benjamin afton but sir objected luke there is no occasion for this it is much better that i should trust you for two cents than that you should trust me with five dollars probably the two cents are as important to you as five dollars to me at any rate it is a matter of confidence and i am quite willing to trust you thank you sir but i shall have to leave you or i shall be home late to dinner before luke had a chance to protest further he found himself alone his stock of papers exhausted and a fivedollar bill in his hand while he stood on the corner in some perplexity a newsboy crossed randolph street and accosted him my eyes if you aint in luck luke walton he said where did you get that bill is it a one no its a five whered you get it a gentleman just bought two papers of me and gave you five dollars you dont expect me to swaller all that do you im to bring him the change tomorrow continued luke the other boy nearly doubled up with merriment wasnt he jolly green though he ejaculated why was he asked luke who by this time felt considerably annoyed hell have to whistle for his money why will he cause he will he wont do anything of the sort i shall take him his change tomorrow morning what ejaculated tom brooks i shall carry him his change in the morning four dollars and ninetyeight cents cant you understand that you aint going to be such a fool luke walton if its being a fool to be honest then im going to be that kind of a fool wouldnt you do the same no i wouldnt id just invite all the boys round the corner to go with me to the theayter come luke be a good feller and give us all a blowout well go to the theayter and afterwards well have an oyster stew i know a bully place on clark street near monroe do you take me for a thief tom brooks exclaimed luke indignantly the gentleman meant you to have the money of course he knew you wouldnt bring it back lemme see theres a good play on to hooleys six of us will cost a dollar and a half and the oyster stews will be fifteen cents apiece thatll only take half the money and youll have half left for yourself i am ashamed of you tom brooks you want me to become a thief and it is very evident what you would do if you were in my place what would the gentleman think of me he dont know you you can go on state street to sell papers so he wont see you suppose he should see me you can tell him you lost the money you aint smart luke walton or youd know how to manage no i am not smart in that way i confess i shant waste any more time talking to you im going home i know what youre going to do youre goin to spend all the money on yourself dont you believe that i mean to return the change no i dont i ought not to complain of that you merely credit me with acting as you would act yourself how many papers have you got left eight here give me half and i will sell them for you that is if i can do it in fifteen minutes id rather youd take me to the theayter grumbled tom ive already told you i wont do it in ten minutes luke had sold his extra supply of papers and handed the money to tom tom thanked him in an ungracious sort of way and luke started for home it was a long walk for the poor cannot afford to pick and choose their localities luke took his way through clark street to the river and then turning in a north westerly direction reached milwaukee avenue this is not a fashionable locality and the side streets are tenanted by those who are poor or of limited means luke paused in front of a threestory frame house in green street he ascended the steps and opened the door for this was the newsboys home chapter ii a letter from the dead in the entry luke met a girl of fourteen with fiery red hair which apparently was a stranger to the comb and brush she was the landladys daughter and though of rather fitful and uncertain temper always had a smile and pleasant word for luke who was a favorite of hers well nancy hows mother asked the newsboy as he began to ascend the front stairs she seems rather upset like luke answered nancy what has happened to upset her asked luke anxiously i think its a letter she got about noon it was a queer letter all marked up as if it had been travelin round i took it in myself and carried it up to your ma i stayed to see her open it for i was kind of curious to know who writ it well as soon as your ma opened it she turned as pale as ashes and i thought shed faint away she put her hand on her heart just so and nancy placed a rather dirty hand of her own on which glittered a fivecent brass ring over that portion of her anatomy where she supposed her heart lay she didnt faint away did she asked luke no not quite did she say who the letter was from no i asked her but she said from no one that you ever saw nancy i say luke if you find out whos it from let me know i wont promise nancy perhaps mother would prefer to keep it a secret oh well keep your secrets if you want to dont be angry nancy i will tell you if i can and luke hurried upstairs to the third story which contained the three rooms occupied by his mother his little brother and himself opening the door he saw his mother sitting in a rockingchair apparently in deep thought for the work had fallen from her hands and lay in her lap there was an expression of sadness in her face as if she had been thinking of the happy past when the little family was prosperous and undisturbed by poverty or privation whats the matter mother asked luke with solicitude mrs walton looked up quickly i have been longing to have you come back luke she said something strange has happened today you received a letter did you not who told you luke nancy i met her as i came in she said she brought up the letter and that you appeared very much agitated when you opened it it is true from whom was the letter then mother from your father what exclaimed luke with a start is he not dead the letter was written a year ago why then has it arrived so late your father on his deathbed intrusted it to someone who mislaid it and has only just discovered and mailed it on the envelope he explains this and expresses his regret it was at first mailed to our old home and has been forwarded from there but that is not all luke i learn from the letter that we have been cruelly wronged your father when he knew he could not live intrusted to a man in whom he had confidence ten thousand dollars to be conveyed to us this wicked man could not resist the temptation but kept it thinking we should never know anything about it you will find it all explained in the letter let me read it mother said luke in excitement mrs walton opened a drawer of the bureau and placed in her sons hands an envelope brown and soiled by contact with tobacco it was directed to her in a shaky hand across one end were written these words this letter was mislaid i have just discovered it and mail it hoping it will reach you without further delay many apologies and regrets j hanshaw luke did not spend much time upon the envelope but opened the letter the sight of his fathers familiar handwriting brought the tears to his eyes this was the letter gold gulch california my dear wife it is a solemn thought to me that when you receive this letter these trembling fingers will be cold in death yes dear mary i know very well that i am on my deathbed and shall never more be permitted to see your sweet face or meet again the gaze of my dear children last week i contracted a severe cold while mining partly through imprudent exposure and have grown steadily worse till the doctor whom i summoned from sacramento informs me that there is no hope and that my life is not likely to extend beyond two days this is a sad end to my dreams of future happiness with my little family gathered around me it is all the harder because i have been successful in the errand that brought me out here i have struck it rich as they say out here and have been able to lay by ten thousand dollars i intended to go home next month carrying this with me it would have enabled me to start in some business which would have yielded us a liberal living and provided a comfortable home for you and the children but all this is over for me at least for you i hope the money will bring what i anticipated i wish i could live long enough to see it in your hands but that cannot be i have intrusted it to a friend who has been connected with me here thomas butler of chicago he has solemnly promised to seek you out and put the money into your hands i think he will be true to his trust indeed i have no doubt on the subject for i cannot conceive of any man being base enough to belie the confidence placed in him by a dying man and despoil a widow and her fatherless children no i will not permit myself to doubt the integrity of my friend if i should it would make my last sickness exceedingly bitter yet as something might happen to butler on his way home though exceedingly improbable i think it well to describe him to you he is a man of nearly fifty i should say about five feet ten inches in height with a dark complexion and dark hair a little tinged with gray he will weigh about one hundred and sixty pounds but there is one striking mark about him which will serve to identify him he has a wart on the upper part of his right cheek a mark which disfigures him and mortifies him exceedingly he has consulted a physician about its removal but has been told that the operation would involve danger and moreover would not be effectual as the wart is believed to be of a cancerous nature and would in all probability grow out again for these reasons he has given up his intention of having it removed and made up his mind unwillingly enough to carry it to the grave with him i have given you this long description not because it seemed at all necessary for i believe thomas butler to be a man of strict honesty but because for some reason i am impelled to do so i am very tired and i feel that i must close god bless you dear wife and guard our children soon to be fatherless your loving husband frederick walton ps butler has left for the east this letter i have given to another friend to mail after my death chapter iii luke forms a resolution as luke read this letter his pleasant face became stern in its expression they had indeed been cruelly wronged the large sum of which they had been defrauded would have insured them comfort and saved them from many an anxiety his mother would not have been obliged to take in sewing and he himself could have carried out his cherished design of obtaining a college education this man in whom his father had reposed the utmost confidence had been false to his trust he had kept in his own hands the money which should have gone to the widow and children of his dying friend could anything be more base mother said luke this man thomas butler must be a villain yes luke he has done us a great wrong he thought no doubt that we should never hear of this money i almost wish i had not luke it is very tantalizing to think how it would have improved our condition then you are sorry to receive the letter mother no luke it seems like a message from the dead and shows me how good and thoughtful your poor father was to the last he meant to leave us comfortable but his plans were defeated by a rascal mother i should like to meet and punish this thomas butler even if you should meet him luke you must be prudent he is probably a rich man made so at our expense added luke bitterly and he would deny having received anything from your father mother said luke sternly and deliberately i feel sure that i shall some day meet this man face to face and if i do it will go hard if i dont force him to give up this money which he has falsely converted to his own use the boy spoke with calm and resolute dignity hardly to be expected in one so young and with a deep conviction that surprised his mother luke she said i hardly know you tonight you dont seem like a boy you speak like a man i feel so it is the thought of this man triumphant in his crime that makes me feel older than i am now mother i feel that i have a purpose in life it is to find this man and punish him for what he has done unless he will make reparation mrs walton shook her head it was not from her that luke had inherited his independent spirit she was a fond mother of great amiability but of a timid shrinking disposition which led her to deprecate any aggressive steps promise me not to get yourself into any trouble luke she said even if you do meet this man i cant promise that mother for i may not be able to help it besides i havent met him yet and it isnt necessary to cross a bridge till you get to it now let us talk of something else how much did you make today luke asked bennie his young brother seven years old i didnt make my fortune bennie including the morning papers i only made sixty cents that seems a good deal to me luke said his mother i only made twentyfive they pay such small prices for making shirts i should think they did and yet you worked harder and more steadily than i did i have worked since morning probably about eight hours then you have made only three cents an hour what a shame if i had a sewingmachine i could do more but that is beyond our means i hope soon to be able to get you one mother i can pay something down and the rest on installments that would be quite a relief luke if you had a sewingmachine perhaps i could help you suggested bennie i should hardly dare to let you try bennie suppose you spoiled a shirt it would take off two days earnings but ill tell you what you can do you can set the table and wash the dishes and relieve me in that way or you might take in washing said luke with a laugh that pays better than sewing just imagine how nice it would look in an advertisement in the daily papers a boy of seven is prepared to wash and iron for responsible parties address bennie walton no green street now you are laughing at me luke said bennie pouting why dont you let me go out with you and sell papers i hope bennie said luke gravely you will never have to go into the street with papers i know what it is and how poor boys fare one night last week at the corner of monroe and clark streets i saw a poor little chap no older than you selling papers at eleven oclock he had a dozen papers which he was likely to have left on his hands for there are not many who will buy papers at that hour did you speak to him luke asked benny interested yes i told him he ought to go home but he said that if he went home with all those papers unsold his stepfather would whip him there were tears in the poor boys eyes as he spoke what did you do luke ill tell you what i did bennie i thought of you and i paid him the cost price on his papers it wasnt much for they were all penny papers but the poor little fellow seemed so relieved did you sell them yourself luke i sold four of them i went over to madison street and stood in front of mcvickers theater just as the people were coming out it so happened that four persons bought papers so i was only two cents out after all you remember mother that was the evening i got home so late yes luke i felt worried about you but you did right i am always glad to have you help those who are worse off than we are how terribly i should feel if bennie had to be out late in the streets like that there are many newsboys as young or at any rate not much older i have sometimes seen gentlemen handsomely dressed and evidently with plenty of money speak roughly to these young boys it always makes me indignant why should they have so easy a time while there are so many who dont know where their next meal is coming from why what such a man spends for his meals in a single day would support a poor newsboy in comfort for a week my dear luke this is a problem that has puzzled older and wiser heads than yours there must always be poor people but those who are more fortunate ought at least to give them sympathy it is the least acknowledgment they can make for their own more favored lot i am going out a little while this evening mother very well luke dont be late no mother i wont i want to call on a friend of mine who is sick who it is luke it is jim norman the poor boy took cold one day his shoes were so far gone he has a bad cough and i am afraid it will go hard with him is he a newsboy too luke asked bennie walton no he is a bootblack i shouldnt like to black boots nor i bennie but if a boy is lucky there is more money to be made in that business where does he live asked mrs walton on ohio street not very far from here theres another boy i know lives on that street tom brooks but he isnt a friend of mine he wanted me to keep five dollars and treat him and some other boys to an evening at the theater and a supper afterwards i hope you wont associate with him luke not more than i can help luke took his hat and went downstairs into the street in the hall he met nancy she waylaid him with an eager look on her face who was the letter from luke she asked from a friend of the family who is now dead answered luke gravely good gracious how could he write it after he was dead ejaculated nancy it was given to a person to mail who forgot all about it and carried it in his pocket for a year my sakes alive if i got a letter from a dead man it would make me creep all over no wonder your ma came near faintin chapter iv an attack in the dark luke turned into milwaukee avenue and a few steps took him to west ohio street where his friend lived on his way he met tom brooks who was lounging in front of a cigar store smoking a cigarette goodevening tom said luke politely evenin responded tom briefly where you goin to see jim norman hes sick whats the matter of him hes got a bad cold and is confined to the house tom shrugged his shoulders i dont go much on jim norman he said he ought to be a girl he never smoked a cigarette in his life didnt he all the better for him i dont smoke myself you have smoked yes i used to but it troubled my mother and i promised her i wouldnt do it again so you broke off yes i wouldnt be tied to a womans apron strings wouldnt you try to oblige your mother no i wouldnt what does a woman know about boys if i was a gal it would be different then we dont agree that is all i say luke wont you take me to the theayter i cant afford it thats all bosh havent you got five dollars id feel rich on five dollars perhaps i might if it were mine but it isnt you can use it all the same said tom in an insinuating voice yes i can be dishonest if i choose but i dont choose what sunday school do you go to asked tom with a sneer none at present i thought you did by your talk it makes me sick then said luke goodnaturedly there is no need to listen to it i am afraid you are not likely to enjoy my company so i will walk along luke kept on his way leaving tom smoking sullenly that fellers a fool he muttered in a disgusted tone what feller tom turned and saw his friend and chum pat oconnor who had just come up what feller why luke walton of course whats the matter of him hes got five dollars and he wont pay me into the theayter where did he get such a pile of money asked pat in surprise a gentleman gave it to him for a paper tellin him to bring the change tomorrer is he goin to do it yes thats why i call him a fool i wish you and i had his chance said pat enviously wed paint the town red i guess tom nodded he and pat were quite agreed on that point wheres luke goin asked pat to see jim norman jims sick with a cold what times he comin home i dont know why do you think hes got the money with him the fivedollar bill what are you up to asked tom with a quick glance at his companion i was thinkin we might borrer the money answered pat with a grin to tom this was a new suggestion but it was favorably received he conferred with pat in a low tone and then the two sauntered down the street in the direction of jim normans home meanwhile we will follow luke he kept on till he reached a shabby brick house jim and his mother with two smaller children occupied two small rooms on the top floor luke had been there before and did not stop to inquire directions but ascended the stairs till he came to jims room the door was partly open and he walked in hows jim mrs norman he asked mrs norman was wearily washing dishes at the sink hes right sick luke she answered turning round and recognizing the visitor do you hear him cough from a small inner room came the sound of a hard and rasping cough how are you feeling jim inquired luke entering and taking a chair at the bedside i dont feel any better luke answered the sick boy his face lighting up with pleasure as he recognized his friend im glad you come youve got a hard cough yes it hurts my throat when i cough and i cant get a wink of sleep ive brought you a little cough medicine it was some we had in the house thank you luke youre a good friend to me give me some please if your motherll give me a spoon ill pour some out when the medicine was taken the boys began to talk i ought to be at work said jim sighing i dont know how well get along if i dont get out soon mother has some washing to do but it isnt enough to pay all our expenses i used to bring in seventyfive cents a day and that with what mother could earn kept us along i wish i was rich enough to help you jim but you know how it is all i can earn i have to carry home my mother sews for a house on state street but sewing doesnt pay as well as washing i know youd help me if you could luke you have helped me by bringing in the medicine and it does me good to have you call but i would like to do more ill tell you what i will do i know a rich gentleman one of my customers i am to call upon him tomorrow ill tell him about you and perhaps he will help you any help would be acceptable luke if you dont mind asking him i wouldnt like to ask for myself but i dont mind asking for you luke stayed an hour and left jim much brighter and more cheerful for his visit when he went out into the street it was quite dark although the moon now and then peeped out from behind the clouds that a brisk breeze sent scurrying across the sky having a slight headache he thought he would walk it off so he sauntered slowly in the direction of the business portion of the city walking farther than he intended he found himself almost before he was aware crossing one of the numerous bridges that span the river he was busy with thoughts of jim and how he could help him and did not notice that two boys were following him stealthily it was a complete surprise to him therefore when they rushed upon him and each seizing an arm rendered him helpless hand over what money youve got and be quick about it demanded one of the boys chapter v how luke escaped the attack was so sudden and unexpected that luke was for the moment incapable of resistance though in general quite ready to defend himself it was not till he felt a hand in his pocket that he pulled himself together as the english express it and began to make things lively for his assailants what are you after he demanded do you want to rob me give us the money and be quick about it how do you know i have any money asked luke beginning to suspect in whose hands he was never mind how hand over that fivedollar bill was the reply in the same hoarse whisper i know you now youre tom brooks said luke youre in bad business no im not tom brooks it was pat who spoke now come we have no time to lose stephen give me your knife the name was a happy invention of pats to throw luke off the scent he was not himself acquainted with our hero and did not fear identification one of you two is tom brooks said luke firmly youd better give up this attempt at highway robbery if i summon an officer youre liable to a long term of imprisonment ill save you trouble by telling you that i havent any money with me except a few pennies wheres the fivedollar bill it was tom who spoke now i left it at home with my mother its lucky i did though you would have found it hard to get it from me i dont believe it said tom in a tone betraying disappointment you may search me if you like but if a policeman comes by youd better take to your heels the boys appeared disconcerted is he lying asked pat no responded tom hed own up if he had the money thank you for believing me it is very evident that one of you knows me goodnight youd better find some other way of getting money wait a minute are you going to tell on us it wouldnt be fair to tom brooks he aint here but you might get him into trouble i shant get you into trouble tom but im afraid you bring trouble on yourself apparently satisfied with this promise the two boys slunk away in the darkness and luke was left to proceed on his way unmolested i wouldnt have believed that of tom thought luke im sorry it happened if it had been anyone but me and a cop had come by it would have gone hard with him its lucky i left the money with mother though i dont think theyd have got it at any rate luke did not acquaint his mother with the attempt that had been made to rob him he merely told of his visit and of the sad plight of the little bootblack i would like to have helped him mother luke concluded if we hadnt been robbed of that money father sent us we could afford the luxury of doing good said his mother finishing the sentence for him lukes face darkened with justifiable anger i know it is wrong to hate anyone mother he said but i am afraid i hate that man thomas butler whom i have never seen it is sometimes hard to feel like a christian luke said his mother this man must be one of the meanest of men suppose you or i should fall sick what would become of us we wont borrow trouble luke let us rather thank god for our present good health if i should be sick it would not be as serious as if you were to become so for you earn more than twice as much as i do it ought not to be so mother for you work harder than i do when i get a sewing machine i shall be able to contribute more to the common fund i hope that will be soon has bennie gone to bed yes he is fast asleep i hope fortune will smile on us before he is much older than i i cant bear the idea of sending him into the street among bad boys i have been accustomed to judge of the newsboys by my son are there many bad boys among them many of them are honest hardworking boys but there are some black sheep among them i know one boy who tried to commit highway robbery stopping a person whom he had seen with money did he get caught no he failed of his purpose and no complaint was made of him though his intended victim knew who his assailant was i am glad of that it would have been hard for his poor mother if he had been convicted and sent to prison this mrs walton said without a suspicion that it was luke that the boy had tried to rob when luke heard his mothers comment he was glad that he had agreed to overlook toms fault the next morning luke went as usual to the vicinity of the sherman house and began to sell papers he looked in vain for tom brooks who did not show up where is tom brooks he asked of one of toms friends toms goin to try another place said the boy he says theres too many newsboys round this corner he thinks he can do better somewheres else where is he do you know i seed him near the corner of dearborn in front of the saratoga well i hope hell make out well said luke luke had the fivedollar bill in his pocket but he knew that it was too early for the offices on la salle street to be open lukes stock of morning papers included the chicago tribune the times herald and interocean he seldom disposed of his entire stock as early as ten oclock but this morning another newsboy in addition to tom was absent and luke experienced the advantage of diminished competition as he sold the last paper the clock struck ten i think it will do for me to go to mr aftons office now thought luke if i dont find him in i will wait la salle street runs parallel with clark it is a busy thoroughfare and contains many buildings cut up into offices this was the case with no luke entered the building and scanned the directory on either side of the door he had no difficulty in finding the name of benjamin afton he had to go up two flights of stairs for mr aftons office was on the third floor chapter vi mr aftons office mr aftons office was of unusual size and fronted on la salle street as luke entered he observed that it was furnished better than the ordinary business office on the floor was a handsome turkey carpet the desks were of some rich dark wood and the chairs were as costly as those in his library in a closed bookcase at one end of the room surmounted by bronze statuettes was a full library of reference at one desk stood a tall man perhaps thirtyfive with red hair and prominent features at another desk was a young fellow of eighteen bearing a marked resemblance to the head bookkeeper there was besides a young man of perhaps twentytwo sitting at a table apparently filing bills mr afton must be a rich man to have such an elegant office thought luke the redhaired bookkeeper did not take the trouble to look up to see who had entered the office is mr afton in luke asked in a respectful tone the bookkeeper raised his eyes for a moment glanced at luke with a supercilious air and said curtly no do you know when he will be in continued the newsboy quite indefinite what is your business boy my business is with mr afton luke answered humph is it of an important nature it is not very important he answered but i wish to see mr afton personally whose office are you in he isnt in any office uncle nathaniel put in the redhaired boy he is a newsboy i see him every morning round the sherman house ha is that so boy we dont want to buy any papers nor does mr afton you can go as the bookkeeper spoke he pointed to the door i have no papers to sell said luke but i come here on business with mr afton and will take the liberty to wait till he comes oh my eyes aint he got cheek ejaculated the redhaired boy i say boy do you black boots as well as sell papers no i dont some of the newsboys do i thought perhaps you had got a job to black mr aftons boots every morning luke who was a spirited boy was fast getting angry i dont want to interfere with you in any way he said what do you mean demanded the redhaired boy his cheeks rivaling his hair in color i thought that might be one of your duties why you impudent young vagabond uncle nathaniel did you hear that boy you had better go said the bookkeeper you can leave your card added eustis clark the nephew a friend of lukes had printed and given him a dozen cards a few days previous and he had them in his pocket at that moment thank you for the suggestion he said and walking up to the boys desk he deposited on it a card bearing this name in neat script luke walton be kind enough to hand that to mr afton eustis held up the card and burst into a guffaw well i never he ejaculated mr walton he concluded with a ceremonious bow the same to you said luke with a smile i never saw a newsboy put on such airs before he said as luke left the office did you uncle nathaniel do you think he really had any business with the boss probably he wanted to supply the office with papers now stop fooling and go to work they didnt seem very glad to see me thought luke i want to see mr afton this morning or he may think that i have not kept my word about the money luke stationed himself in the doorway at the entrance to the building meaning to intercept mr afton as he entered from the street he had to wait less than ten minutes mr afton smiled in instant recognition as he saw luke and seemed glad to see him i am glad the boy justified my idea of him he said to himself i would have staked a thousand dollars on his honesty such a face as that doesnt belong to a rogue i am rather late he said have you been here long not very long sir i have been up in your office why didnt you sit down and wait for me i dont think the redhaired gentleman cared to have me the boy asked me to leave my card mr afton looked amused and did you he asked yes sir do you generally carry visiting cards well i happened to have some with me this morning please show me one so your name is luke walton he added glancing at the card yes sir office corner clark and randolph streets i will keep the card and bear it in mind i have brought your change sir said luke you can come upstairs and pay it to me in the office it will be more businesslike luke was glad to accept the invitation for it would prove to the skeptical office clerks that he really had business with their employer eustis clark and his uncle could not conceal their surprise when they saw luke follow mr afton into the office there was a smaller room inclosed at one corner which was especially reserved for mr afton come here luke said he pleasantly luke followed him inside he drew from his pocket four dollars and ninetyeight cents and laid it on the table behind which his patron had taken a seat wont you please count it and see if it is right he asked i can see that it is luke i am afraid i have put you to more trouble than the profit on the two papers i bought would pay for not at all sir besides its all in the way of business i thank you for putting confidence in me i thought i was not mistaken in you and the result shows that i was right my boy i saw that you had an honest face i am sure that the thought of keeping back the money never entered your head no sir it did not though one of the newsboys advised me to keep it it would have been very shortsighted as a matter of policy i will take this money but i want to encourage you in the way of welldoing he drew from his vest pocket a bill and extended it to luke it isnt meant as a reward for honesty but only as a mark of the interest i have begun to feel in you thank you sir said luke and as he took the bill he started in surprise for it was ten dollars did you mean to give as much as this how much is it ten dollars i thought it was five but i am glad it is more yes luke you are welcome to it have you anyone dependent upon you my mother she will be very much pleased thats right my lad always look out for your mother you owe her a debt which you can never repay that is true sir but i would like to use a part of this money for some one else for yourself no for a friend then he told in simple language of jim norman and how seriously his family was affected by his sickness and enforced idleness jim has no money to buy medicine he concluded if you dont object mr afton i will give jims mother half this money after buying some cough medicine out of it the merchant listened with approval i am glad luke you feel for others he said but i can better afford to help your friend than you here is a fivedollar bill tell the boy it is from a friend and if he should need more let me know thank you sir said luke fairly radiant as he thought of jims delight i wont take up any more of your time but will bid you goodmorning probably mr afton wished to give his clerks a lesson for he followed luke to the door of the outer office and shook hands cordially with him saying i shall be glad to have you call when you wish to see me luke adding i may possibly have some occasional work for you to do if so i know where to find you thank you sir whats got into the old man thought eustis clark as mr afton returned to his sanctum eustis said with a grin holding up the card mr walton left his card for you thinking you might not be in time to see him give it to me if you please and the rich man took the card without a smile and put it into his vest pocket not seeming in the least surprised mr walton called to pay me some money he said gravely whenever he calls invite him to wait till my return chapter vii a strange encounter luke went home that evening in high spirits the gift he had received from mr afton enabled him to carry out a plan he had long desired to realize it was to secure a sewing machine for his mother and thus increase her earnings while diminishing her labors he stopped at an establishment not far from clark street and entering the showroom asked what is the price of your sewing machines one in a plain case will cost you twentyfive dollars please show me one do you want it for your wife she may use it some time my mother will use it first the salesman pointed out an instrument with which luke was well pleased would you like to see how it works yes please miss morris please show this young man how to operate the machine in the course of ten minutes luke got a fair idea of the method of operating do you require the whole amount down asked luke no we sell on installments if preferred what are your terms five dollars first payment and then a dollar a week with interest on the balance till paid then i think i will engage one luke decided very well come up to the desk and give me your name and address on payment of five dollars we will give you a receipt on account specifying the terms of paying the balance etc luke transacted his business and made arrangements to have the machine delivered any time after six oclock when he knew he would be at home as luke was coming out of the sewingmachine office he saw tom brooks just passing tom looked a little uneasy not feeling certain whether luke had recognized him as one of his assailants or not the evening previous luke felt that he had a right to be angry indeed he had it in his power to have tom arrested and charged with a very serious crime that of highway robbery but his good luck made him goodnatured goodevening tom he said i didnt see you selling papers today no i was on dearborn street he doesnt know it was me thought tom congratulating himself and added have you been buying a sewing machine this was said in a joke yes answered luke considerably to toms surprise i have bought one how much twentyfive dollars where did you raise twentyfive dollars youre foolin i bought it on the installment plan five dollars down oho said tom nodding significantly i know where you got that money where did i from the gentleman that bought a couple of papers yesterday you hit it right the first time i thought you werent no better than the rest of us you that pretended to be so extra honest what do you mean by that tom brooks you pretended that you were going to give back the mans change and spent it after all i thought you werent such a saint as you pretended to be i see you keep on judging me by yourself tom brooks i took round the money this morning and he gave it to me is that true yes i generally tell the truth then youre lucky if id returned it he wouldnt have given me a cent its best to be honest on all occasions said luke looking significantly at tom who colored up for he now saw that he had been recognized the night before tom sneaked off on some pretext and luke kept on his way home did you do well today luke asked bennie yes bennie very well how much did you make ill tell you by and by mother can i help you about the supper you may toast the bread luke i am going to have your favorite dish milk toast all right mother have you been sewing today yes luke i sat so long in one position that i got cramped i wish you had a sewing machine so do i luke but i must be patient a sewing machine costs more money than we can afford one can be got for twentyfive dollars i have heard that is a good deal of money for people in our position we may as well hope for one i shouldnt be surprised if we were able to buy a sewing machine very soon meanwhile luke finished toasting the bread and his mother was dipping it in milk when a step was heard on the stairway the door was opened and nancys red head was thrust into the room please mrs walton said nancy breathlessly theres a man downstairs with a sewing machine which he says is for you there must be some mistake nancy i havent ordered any sewing machine shall i send him off maam no nancy said luke its all right ill go down stairs and help him bring it up how is this luke asked mrs walton bewildered ill explain afterwards mother up the stairs and into the room came the sewing machine and was set down near the window bennie surveyed it with wonder and admiration when the man who brought it was gone luke explained to his mother how it had all come about you see mother you didnt have to wait long he concluded i feel deeply thankful luke said mrs walton i can do three times the work i have been accustomed to do and in much less time this mr afton must be a kind and charitable man i like him better than his clerks said luke there is a redheaded bookkeeper and a boy there who tried to snub me and keep me out of the office i try to think well of redheaded people on account of nancy but i cant say i admire them after supper luke gave his mother a lesson in operating the machine both found that it required a little practice the next morning as luke was standing at his usual corner he had a surprise a gentleman came out of the sherman house and walked slowly up clark street as he passed luke he stopped and asked boy have you the interocean luke looked up in his customers face he paused in the greatest excitement the man was on the shady side of fifty nearly six feet in height with a dark complexion hair tinged with gray and a wart on the upper part of his right cheek chapter viii a marked man at last so luke verily believed he stood face to face with the man who had deceived his dying father and defrauded his mother and himself of a sum which would wholly change their positions and prospects but he wanted to know positively and he could not think of a way to acquire this knowledge meanwhile the gentleman noticed the boys scrutiny and it did not please him well boy he said gruffly you seem determined to know me again you stare hard enough let me tell you this is not good manners excuse me said luke but your face looked familiar to me i thought i had seen you before very likely you have i come to chicago frequently and generally stop at the sherman house probably that explains it said luke are you not mr thomas of st louis the gentleman laughed you will have to try again he said i am mr browning of milwaukee thomas is my first name browning thought luke disappointed evidently i am on the wrong track and yet he answers fathers description exactly i dont know anyone in milwaukee he said aloud then it appears we cant claim acquaintance the gentleman took his paper and turned down randolph street toward state strange he soliloquized that boys interest in my personal appearance i wonder if there can be a st louis man who resembles me if so he cant be a very goodlooking man this miserable wart ought to be enough to distinguish me from anyone else he paused a minute and then a new thought came into his mind there is something familiar in that boys face i wonder who he can be i will buy my evening papers of him and take that opportunity to inquire meanwhile luke to satisfy a doubt in his mind entered the hotel and going up to the office looked over the list of arrivals he had to turn back a couple of pages and found this entry thomas browning milwaukee his name is browning and he does come from milwaukee he said to himself i thought perhaps he might have given me a false name though he could have no reason for doing so luke felt that he must look farther for the man who had betrayed his fathers confidence i didnt think there could be two men of such a peculiar appearance he reflected surely there cant be three if i meet another who answers the description i shall be convinced that he is the man i am after in the afternoon the same man approached luke as he stood on his accustomed corner you may give me the mail and journal he said yes sir here they are three cents i believe you are the boy who recognized me or thought you did this morning yes sir if you ever run across this mr thomas of st louis present him my compliments will you yes sir answered luke with a smile by the way what is your name luke walton the gentleman started luke walton he repeated slowly eying the newsboy with a still closer scrutiny yes sir its a new name to me cant your father find a better business for you than selling papers my father is dead sir dead repeated browning slowly that is un fortunate for you how long has he been dead about two years what did he die of i dont know sir exactly he died away from home in california there was a strange look difficult to read on the gentlemans face that is a long way off he said i have always thought i should like to visit california when my business will permit i will take a trip out that way here was another difference between mr browning and the man of whom lukes father had written the stranger had never been in california browning handed luke a silver quarter in payment for the papers never mind about the change he said with a wave of his hand thank you sir you are very kind this must be the son of my old california friend browning said to himself can he have heard of the money intrusted to me i dont think it possible for i left walton on the verge of death that money has made my fortune i invested it in land which has more than quadrupled in value old women say that honesty pays he added with a sneer but it is nonsense in this case dishonesty has paid me richly if the boy has heard anything it is lucky that i changed my name to browning out of deference to my wifes aunt in return for a beggarly three thousand dollars i have made it up to ten thousand dollars by judicious investment my young newsboy acquaintance will find it hard to identify me with the thomas butler who took charge of his fathers money if browning had been possessed of a conscience it might have troubled him when he was brought face to face with one of the sufferers from his crime but he was a hard selfish man to whom his own interests were of supreme importance but something happened within an hour which gave him a feeling of anxiety he was just coming out of the chicago postoffice at the corner of adams and clark streets when a hand was laid upon his shoulder how are you butler said a tall man wearing a mexican sombrero i havent set eyes upon you since we were together at gold gulch in california browning looked about him apprehensively fortunately he was some distance from the corner where luke walton was selling papers i am well thank you he said are you living in chicago no i live in wisconsin have you seen anything of the man you used to be with so much walton no he died did he indeed well i am sorry to hear that he was a good fellow did he leave anything i am afraid not i thought he struck it rich so he did but he lost all he made how was that poor investments i fancy i remember he told me one day that he had scraped together seven or eight thousand dollars browning shrugged his shoulders i think that was a mistake he said walton liked to put his best foot foremost you think then he misrepresented i think he would have found it hard to find the sum you mention you surprise me butler i always looked upon walton as a singularly reliable man so he was in most things but let me correct you on one point you call me butler isnt that your name it was but i had a reason a good substantial pecuniary reason for changing it i am now thomas browning say you so are you engaged this evening yes unfortunately i was about to invite you to some theater another time thanks i must steer clear of that man thought browning i wont meet him again if i can help it chapter ix stephen webb the more browning thought of the newsboy in whom he had so strangely recognized the son of the man whom he had so cruelly wronged the more uneasy he felt he has evidently heard of me he soliloquized his father could not have been so near death as i supposed he must have sent the boy or his mother a message about that money if it should come to his knowledge that i am the thomas butler to whom his father confided ten thousand dollars which i have failed to hand over to the family he may make it very disagreeable for me the fact that so many persons were able to identify him as thomas butler made the danger more imminent i must take some steps but what browning asked himself he kept on walking till he found himself passing the entrance of a low poolroom he never played pool nor would it have suited a man of his social position to enter such a place but that he caught sight of a young man whose face and figure were familiar to him in the act of going into it he quickened his pace and laid a hand on the young mans shoulder the latter turned quickly revealing a face bearing the unmistakable marks of dissipation uncle thomas he exclaimed apparently ill at ease yes stephen it is i where are you going the young man hesitated you need not answer i see you are wedded to your old amusements are you still in the place i got for you stephen webb looked uneasy and shamefaced i have lost my place he answered after a pause how does it happen that you lost it i dont know some one must have prejudiced my employer against me it is your own habits that have prejudiced him i make no doubt this was true one morning stephen whose besetting sin was intemperance appeared at the office where he was employed in such a state of intoxication that he was summarily discharged it may be explained that he was a son of mr brownings only sister when were you discharged asked his uncle last week and have you tried to get another situation yes what are your prospects of success there seem to be very few openings just now uncle thomas the greater reason why you should have kept the place i obtained for you were you going to play pool in this low place i was going to look on a man must have some amusement said stephen sullenly amusement is all you think of however it so happens that i have something that i wish you to do stephen regarded his uncle in surprise are you going to open an office in chicago he asked no the service is of a different nature it is secret and confidential it is i may say something in the detective line then im your man said his nephew brightening up the service is simple so that you will probably be qualified to do what i require ive read lots of detective stories said stephen eagerly its just the work i should like humph i dont think much is to be learned from detective stories you will understand of course that you are not to let anyone know you are acting for me certainly you will find that i can keep a secret i leave chicago tomorrow morning and will give you directions before i go where can we have a private conference here is an oyster house we shall be quiet here very well we will go in they entered a small room with a sanded floor provided with a few unpainted tables stephen and his uncle went to the back of the room and seated themselves at the rear table we must order something suggested stephen get what you please said browning indifferently two stews ordered stephen we can talk while they are getting them ready very well now for my instructions at the corner of clark and randolph streets every morning and evening you will find a newsboy selling papers a dozen you mean true but i am going to describe this boy so that you may know him he is about fifteen i should judge neatly dressed and would be considered goodlooking do you know his name yes it is luke walton is he the one i am to watch you are to make his acquaintance and find out all you can about his circumstances do you know where he lives no that is one of the things you are to find out for me what else do you want me to find out find out how many there are in family also how they live whether they have anything to live on except what this newsboy earns all right uncle thomas you seem to have a great deal of interest in this boy that is my business said browning curtly if you wish to work for me you must not show too much curiosity never mind what my motives are do you understand certainly uncle thomas it shall be as you say i suppose i am to be paid yes how much salary did you receive where you were last employed ten dollars a week you shall receive this sum for the present it is very good pay for the small service required of you all right uncle the stews were ready by this time they were brought and set before stephen and his uncle the latter toyed with his spoon only taking a taste or two but stephen showed much more appreciation of the dish not being accustomed like his uncle to dining at firstclass hotels how am i to let you know what i find out asked stephen write me at milwaukee i will send you further instructions from there very well sir oh by the way you are never to mention me to this luke walton i have my reasons i will do just as you say how is your mother stephen about the same she isnt a very cheerful party you know she is always fretting has she any lodgers yes three but one is a little irregular with his rent of course i expect that you will hand your mother half the weekly sum i pay you she has a right to expect that much help from her son stephen assented but not with alacrity and as he had now disposed of the stew the two rose from their seats and went outside a few words of final instructions and they parted i wonder why uncle thomas takes such an interest in that newsboy thought stephen i will make it my business to find out chapter x stephen webb obtains some information luke was at his post the following morning and had disposed of half his papers when stephen webb strolled by he walked past luke and then as if it was an after thought turned back and addressed him have you a morning tribune he asked luke produced it hows business today asked stephen in an offhand manner pretty fair answered luke for the first time taking notice of the inquirer who did not impress him very favorably i have often wondered how you newsboys make it pay said stephen in a sociable tone we dont make our fortunes as a rule answered luke smiling so i cant recommend you to go into it i dont think it would suit me i dont mind owning up that i am lazy but then i am not obliged to work for the present at least i should like to be able to live without work said the newsboy but even then i would find something to do i should not be happy if i were idle i am not wholly without work said stephen my uncle who lives at a distance occasionally sends to me to do something for him i have to hold myself subject to his orders in the meantime i get an income from him how long have you been a newsboy nearly two years do you like it why dont you get a place in a store or an office i should like to if i could make enough but boys get very small salaries i was about to offer to look for a place for you i know some men in business thank you you are very kind considering that we are strangers oh well i can judge of you by your looks i shouldnt be afraid to recommend you thank you he replied but unless you can offer me as much as five dollars a week i should feel obliged to keep on selling papers i not only have myself to look out for but a mother and little brother stephen nodded to himself complacently it was the very information of which he was in search then your father isnt living he said no he died in california uncle thomas made his money in california stephen said to himself i wonder if he knew this newsboys father five dollars is little enough for three persons to live upon he went on in a sympathetic manner mother earns something by sewing luke answered unsuspiciously but it takes all we can make to support us then they cant have any other resources thought stephen i am getting on famously well goodmorning luke he said ill see you later how do you know my name asked luke in surprise im an idiot thought stephen i ought to have appeared ignorant of his name i have seen you before today he replied taking a little time to think i heard one of the other newsboys calling you by name i dont pretend to be a magician this explanation satisfied luke it appeared very natural i have a great memory for names proceeded stephen that reminds me that i have not told you mine i am stephen webb at your service i will remember it have a cigarette luke added stephen producing a packet from his pocket thank you i dont smoke dont smoke and you a newsboy i thought all of you smoked most of us do but i promised my mother i wouldnt smoke till i was twentyone then im old enough to smoke ive smoked ever since i was twelve years old well good morning thatll do for one day thought stephen webb it was three days before stephen webb called again on his new acquaintance he did not wish luke to suspect anything he said to himself really however he found other things to take up his attention at the rate his money was going it seemed very doubtful whether he would be able to give his mother any part of his salary as suggested by his uncle hang it all he said to himself as he noted his rapidly diminishing hoard why cant my uncle open his heart and give me more than ten dollars a week fifteen dollars wouldnt be any too much and to him it would be nothing positively nothing on the second evening luke went home late it had been a poor day for him and his receipts were less than usual though he had been out more hours when he entered the house however he assumed a cheerful look for he never wished to depress his mothers spirits you are late luke said mrs walton but i have kept your supper warm what makes you so late luke asked bennie the papers went slow bennie they will sometimes theres no very important news just now i suppose that explains it after a while luke thought he noticed that his mother looked more serious than usual whats the matter mother he asked have you a headache no luke i am perfectly well but i am feeling a little anxious about what mother i went around this afternoon to take half a dozen shirts that i had completed and asked for more they told me they had no more for me at present and they didnt know when i could have any more this was bad news for luke knew that he alone did not earn enough to support the family however he answered cheerfully dont be anxious mother there are plenty of other establishments in chicago besides the one you have been working for that is true luke but i dont know whether that will help me i stopped at two places after leaving gusset cos and was told that their list was full well mother dont let us think of it tonight to morrow we can try again lukes cheerfulness had its effect on his mother and the evening was passed socially the next morning luke went out to work at the usual time he had all his papers sold out by halfpast ten oclock and walked over to state street partly to fill up the time arid partly in search of some stray job he was standing in front of the bee hive a wellknown drygoods store on state street when his attention was called to an old lady who in attempting to cross the street had imprudently placed herself just in the track of a rapidly advancing cable car becoming sensible of her danger the old lady uttered a terrified cry but was too panicstricken to move on came the car with gong sounding out its alarm and a cry of horror went up from the bystanders luke alone seemed to have his wits about him he saw that there was not a moment to lose and gathering up his strength dashed to the old ladys assistance chapter xi a house on prairie avenue the old lady had just become conscious of her peril when luke reached her she was too bewildered to move and would inevitably have been crushed by the approaching car had not luke seized her by the arm and fairly dragged her out of danger then as the car passed on he took off his hat and said apologetically i hope you will excuse my roughness madam but i could see no other way of saving you please lead me to the sidewalk gasped the old lady luke complied with her request i am deeply thankful to you my boy she said as soon as she found voice i can see that i was in great danger i was busily thinking or i should not have been so careless i am glad that i was able to help you responded luke as he prepared to leave his new acquaintance dont leave me said the old lady my nerves are so upset that i dont like being left alone i am quite at your service madam replied luke politely shall i put you on board the cars no call a carriage please this was easily done for they were in front of the palmer house where a line of cabs may be found luke called one and assisted the old lady inside where shall i tell the driver to take you he asked the old lady named a number on prairie avenue which contains some of the finest residences in chicago can i do anything more for you asked our hero yes was the unexpected reply get in yourself if you can spare the time certainly assented luke he took his seat beside the old lady i hope you have recovered from your fright he said politely yes i begin to feel myself again probably you wonder why i have asked you to accompany me probably because you may need my services suggested luke not altogether i shudder as i think of the danger from which you rescued me but i have another object in view luke waited for her to explain i want to become better acquainted with you thank you madam i fully recognize that you have done me a great service now if i ask you a fair question about yourself you wont think it an old womans curiosity i hope i should not be so illbred madam really you are a very nice boy now tell me where you live on green street where is that only a stones throw from milwaukee avenue i dont think i was ever in that part of the city it is not a nice part of the city but we cannot afford to live in a better place you say we does that mean your father and mother my father is dead our family consists of my mother my little brother and myself and you are excuse my saying so poor we are poor but thus far we have not wanted for food or shelter i suppose you are employed in some way yes i sell papers then you are a newsboy yes madam i suppose you cannot save very much if i make seventyfive cents a day i consider myself quite lucky it is more than i average surely you cant live on that i mean the three of you mother earns something by making shirts at least she has done so but yesterday she was told that she would not have any more work at present and your brother he is too young to work i suppose yes madam while this conversation was going en the cab was making rapid progress and as the last words were spoken the driver reined up in front of a handsome residence is this the place madam the old lady looked out of the hack yes she answered i had no idea we had got along so far luke helped her out of the cab she paid the man his fare and then signed luke to help her up the steps i want you to come into the house with me she said i have not got through talking with you a maidservant answered the bell she looked surprised when she saw the old ladys young companion is my niece in asked the old lady no mrs merton master harold is in never mind you may come upstairs with me young man luke followed the old lady up the broad handsome staircase stealing a curious glance at an elegantlyfurnished drawingroom the door of which opened into the hall his companion led the way into the front room on the second floor remain here until i have taken off my things she said luke seated himself in a luxurious armchair he looked about him and wondered how it would seem to live in such luxury he had little time for thought for in less than five minutes mrs merton made her appearance you have not yet told me your name she said luke walton thats a good name i am mrs merton i noticed that the servant called you so said luke yes i am a widow my married niece lives here with me she is also a widow with one son harold i think he might be about your age her name is tracy you wonder why i give you all these particulars i see you do it is because i mean to keep up our acquaintance thank you mrs merton my experience this morning has shown me that i am hardly fit to go about the city alone yet i am not willing to remain at home it has occurred to me that i can make use of your services with advantage both to you and myself what do you say i shall be glad of anything that will increase my income said luke promptly please call here tomorrow morning and inquire for me i will then tell you what i require very well mrs merton you may depend upon me and accept a weeks pay in advance she put a sealed envelope into his hand luke took it and with a bow left the room chapter xii a plot that failed as the distance was considerable to the business part of the city luke boarded a car and rode downtown it did not occur to him to open the envelope till he was half way to the end of his journey when he did so he was agreeably surprised the envelope contained a tendollar bill ten dollars hasnt mrs merton made a mistake he said to himself she said it was a weeks pay but of course she wouldnt pay ten dollars for the little i am to do luke decided that the extra sum was given him on account of the service he had already been fortunate enough to render the old lady next to him sat rather a showily dressed woman with keen sharp eyes she took notice of the banknote which luke drew from the envelope and prepared to take advantage of the knowledge no sooner had luke replaced the envelope in his pocket than this woman put her hand in hers and after a pretended search exclaimed in a loud voice there is a pickpocket in this car i have been robbed of course this statement aroused the attention of all the passengers what have you lost madam inquired an old gentleman a tendollar bill answered the woman was it in your pocketbook no she replied glibly it was in an envelope it was handed to me by my sister just before i left home as soon as luke heard this declaration he understood that the woman had laid a trap for him and he realized his imprudence in displaying the money naturally he looked excited and disturbed he saw that in all probability the womans word would be taken in preference to his he might be arrested and find it difficult to prove his innocence have you any suspicion as to who took it asked the old gentleman i think this boy took it said the woman pointing to luke its terrible and he so young said an old lady with a severe cast of countenance who sat next to the old gentleman what is the world coming to what indeed maam echoed the old gentleman luke felt that it was time for him to say something this lady is quite mistaken he declared pale but resolute im no thief it can easily be proved said the woman with a cunning smile let the boy show the contents of his pockets yes that is only fair luke saw that his difficulties were increasing i admit that i have a tendollar bill in an envelope he said i told you so said the woman triumphantly but it is my own graceless boy said the old gentleman severely do not add falsehood to theft i am speaking the truth sir how the boy brazens it out murmured the sourvisaged lady return the lady her money unless you wish to be arrested said the old gentleman i dont intend to give this person luke found it hard to say lady what she has no claim to young man you will find that you are making a grand mistake probably if you give up the money the lady will not prosecute you no i will have pity upon his youth said the woman i can tell exactly where i got the money went on luke desperately where did you get it asked the old maid with a sarcastic smile from mrs merton of prairie avenue what did she give it to you for i am in her employment gentlemen said the woman shrugging her shoulders you can judge whether this is a probable story i refer to mrs merton herself said luke no doubt you want to gain time boy i am getting out of patience give me my money i have no money of yours madam replied luke provoked and you know that as well as i do so you are impertinent as well as a thief said the old gentleman i have no more pity for you madam if you will take my advice you will have the lying rascal arrested i would prefer that he should give up the money quietly i will take it upon myself to call a policeman when the car stops you do me great injustice sir said luke why do you judge so severely of one whom you do not know because young man i have lived too long to be easily deceived i pride myself upon my judgment of faces and i can see the guilt in yours luke looked about him earnestly is there no one in this car who believes me innocent he asked no said the old gentleman we all believe that this very respectable lady charges you justly i say amen to that added the old maid nodding sharply next to the old maid sat a man of about thirtyfive in a business suit who though he had said nothing had listened attentively to the charges and countercharges in him luke was to find a powerful and effective friend speak for yourself old gentleman he said you certainly are old enough to have learned a lesson of christian charity sir exclaimed the old gentleman in a lofty tone i dont require any instruction from you why do you think the boy a thief did you see him take the money no but its presence in his pocket is proof enough for me of his guilt of course it is said the old maid triumphantly the young man did not appear in the least disconcerted i have seldom encountered more uncharitable people he said you are ready to pronounce the boy guilty without any proof at all dont it occur to you that you are insulting the lady who brings the charge asked the old gentleman sternly the young man laughed the woman has brought a false charge he said really this is outrageous cried the old maid if i were in her place i would make you suffer for this calumny probably i know her better than you do i am a salesman in marshall fields drygoods store and this lady is a notorious shoplifter she is varying her performances today i have a great mind to call a policeman she deserves arrest had a bombshell exploded in the car there would not have been a greater sensation the woman rose without a word and signaled to have the car stopped now sir went on the young man sternly if you are a gentleman you will apologize to this boy for your unworthy suspicions and you too madam the old maid tossed her head but could not find a word to say while the old gentleman looked the picture of mortification we are all liable to be mistaken he muttered in a confused tone then be a little more careful next time both of you my boy i congratulate you on your triumphant vindication thank you sir for it i should have stood a very poor chance without your help the tide was turned and the uncharitable pair found so many unfriendly glances fixed upon them that they were glad to leave the car at the next crossing chapter xiii tom brooks in trouble i begin to think i am the favorite of fortune thought luke ten dollars will more than pay a months rent mother will feel easy now about her loss of employment some boys would have felt like taking a holiday for the balance of the day perhaps or going to a place of amusement but luke bought his evening papers as usual he had but half a dozen left when his new acquaintance stephen webb sauntered along hows business luke he asked very fair thank you give me a news stephen passed over a penny in payment but did not seem inclined to go away i meant to see you before he said but my time got filled up have you taken a situation then asked luke no i am still a man of leisure why dont you hire a small store and do a general periodical business it would pay you better no doubt it would but it would take money to open and stock such a store i may make a proposition to you some time to go in with me i furnishing the capital and you managing the business i am always open to a good offer said luke smiling i suppose i ought to have some business but im a social kind of fellow and should want a partner a smart enterprising trustworthy person like you thank you for the compliment never mind that i am a judge of human nature and i felt confidence in you at once somehow luke was not altogether inclined to take stephen webb at his own valuation his new acquaintance did not impress him as a reliable man of business but he had no suspicion of anything underhand by this time luke had disposed of his remaining papers i am through for the day he said and shall go home do you walk or ride i walk if you dont mind i will walk along with you i havent taken much exercise today luke had no reason for declining this proposal and accepted stephens companionship they walked on clark street to the bridge and crossed the river presently they reached milwaukee avenue isnt the walk too long for you asked luke oh no i can walk any distance when i have company i shall take a car back stephen accompanied the newsboy as far as his own door he would like to have been invited up but luke did not care to give him an invitation though stephen seemed very friendly he was not one whom he cared to cultivate well so long said stephen with his goodnight i shall probably see you tomorrow i have found out where they live thought stephen i am making a very good detective ill drop a line to uncle thomas this evening meanwhile luke went upstairs two steps at a time he was the bearer of good tidings and that always quickens the steps he found his mother sitting in her rockingchair with a sober face well mother he asked gayly how have you passed the day very unprofitably luke i went out this afternoon and visited two places where i thought they might have some sewing for me but i only met with disappointment now that i have a sewing machine it is a great pity that i cant make use of it dont be troubled mother we can get along well enough but we have only your earnings to depend upon if i always have as good a day as this we can depend on those very easily did you earn much luke i earned a lot of money mrs walton looked interested and lukes manner cheered her there are always compensations it seems i was only thinking of my own bad luck what do you say to that mother and luke displayed the tendollar bill i dont understand how you could have taken in so much money luke then i will explain and luke told the story of the adventure on state street and his rescue of the old lady from the danger of being run over the best of it is he concluded i think i shall get regular employment for part of my time from mrs merton whatever i do for her will be liberally paid for luke went to a bakery for some cream cakes of which bennie was particularly fond at the same time stephen webb was busily engaged in the writing room of the palmer house inditing a letter to his uncle dear uncle thomas i have devoted my whole time to the task which you assigned me and have met with very good success i found the boy uncommunicative and had to exert all my ingenuity of the accuracy of this and other statements the reader will judge for himself the boy has a mother and a younger brother they depend for support chiefly upon what he can earn though the mother does a little sewing but that doesnt bring in much they live in green street near milwaukee avenue i have been there and seen the house where they reside it is a humble place but as good i presume as they can afford no doubt they are very poor and have all they can do to make both ends meet i have learned this much but have had to work hard to do it of course i need not say that i shall spare no pains to meet your expectations if you should take me into your confidence and give me an idea of what more you wish to know i feel sure that i can manage to secure all needed information your dutiful nephew stephen webb thomas browning in his milwaukee home read this letter with satisfaction he wrote briefly to his nephew you have done well thus far and i appreciate your zeal get the boy to talking about his father if you can let me hear anything he may say on this subject as to my motive i suspect that mr walton may have been an early acquaintance of mine if so i may feel disposed to do something for the family on his way to the sherman house the next morning luke witnessed rather an exciting scene in which his old friend tom brooks played a prominent part there was a chinese laundry on milwaukee avenue kept by a couple of chinamen who were peaceably disposed if not interfered with but several boys headed by tom brooks had repeatedly annoyed the laundrymen and excited their resentment on this particular morning tom sent a stone crashing through the window of ah king the latter had been on the watch and provoked beyond selfcontrol rushed out into the street wild with rage and pursued tom with a flatiron in his hand help help murder exclaimed tom panicstricken running away as fast as his legs would carry him but anger excited by the broken window lent wings to the chinamans feet and he gained rapidly upon the young aggressor chapter xiv luke has a cool reception in prairie avenue tom brooks had reason to feel alarmed for his chinese pursuer fully intended to strike tom with the flatiron though this was utterly wrong some excuse must be made for ah king who had frequently been annoyed by tom it was at this critical juncture that luke walton appeared on the scene he had no reason to like tom but he instantly prepared to rescue him fortunately he knew ah king whom he had more than once protected from the annoyance of the hoodlums of the neighborhood luke ran up and seized the chinaman by the arm what are you going to do he demanded sternly fool boy bleak my window said ah king i bleak his head no you mustnt do that the police will arrest you go way me killee white boy cried ah king impatiently trying to shake off lukes grasp he bleak window cost me a dollee ill see that he pays it or is arrested said luke unwillingly ah king suffered himself to be persuaded more readily perhaps that tom was now at a safe distance you plomise me said ah king yes if he dont pay i will go and get the window mended luke easily overtook tom who was looking round the corner to see how matters were going has he gone back asked tom rather anxiously yes but if i hadnt come along he would perhaps have killed you you only say that to scare me said tom uneasily no i dont i mean it do you know how i got you off how i told ah king you would pay for the broken window it will cost a dollar i didnt promise said tom significantly no said luke sternly but if you dont do it i will myself have you arrested i saw you throw the stone at the window what concern is it of yours asked tom angrily why do you meddle with my business if i hadnt meddled with your business you might have a fractured skull by this time it is a contemptibly mean thing to annoy a poor chinaman hes only a heathen a wellbehaved heathen is better than a christian such as you are i dont want any lectures said tom in a sulky tone i presume not i have nothing more to say except that i expect you to hand me that dollar tonight i havent got a dollar then you had better get one i dont believe you got a dollars worth of sport in breaking the window and i advise you hereafter to spend your money better i dont believe i will pay it said tom eying luke closely to see if he were in earnest then i will report your case to the police youre a mean fellow said tom angrily i begin to be sorry i interfered to save you how ever take your choice if necessary i will pay the dollar myself for i have promised ah king but i shall keep my word about having you arrested it was a bitter pill for tom to swallow but he managed to raise the money and handed it to luke that evening instead of being grateful to the one who had possibly saved his life he was only the more incensed against him and longed for an opportunity to do him an injury i hate that luke walton he said to one of his intimate friends he wants to boss me and all of us but he cant do it hes only fit to keep company with a heathen chinee luke spent a couple of hours in selling papers he had not forgotten his engagement with mrs merton and punctually at ten oclock he pulled the bell of the house in prairie avenue just at that moment the door was opened and he faced a boy of his own age a thin darkcomplexioned youth of haughty bearing this no doubt he concluded was harold tracy what do you want he asked superciliously i should like to see mrs merton humph what business have you with mrs merton luke was not favorably impressed with harolds manner and did not propose to treat him with the consideration which he evidently thought his due i come here at mrs mertons request he said briefly as to what business we have together i refer you to her it strikes me that you are impudent retorted harold angrily your opinion of me is of no importance to me if you dont care to let mrs merton know i am here i will ring again and ask the servant to do so here a lady bearing a strong personal resemblance to harold made her appearance entering the hall from the breakfast room in the rear what is it harold she asked in a tone of authority here is a boy who says he wants to see aunt eliza what can he want with her i asked him but he wont tell i must trouble him to tell me said mrs tracy closing her thin mouth with a snap like mother like son thought luke do you hear demanded mrs tracy unpleasantly i am here by mrs mertons appointment mrs tracy said luke firmly i shall be glad to have her informed that i have arrived and who are you may i ask perhaps youve got your card about you sneered harold i have answered luke quietly with a comical twinkle in his eye he offered one to harold luke walton repeated harold yes that is my name i dont think my aunt will care to see you said mrs tracy who was becoming more and more provoked with the upstart boy as she mentally termed him perhaps it would be better to let her know i am here it is quite unnecessary i will take the responsibility luke was quite in doubt as to what he ought to do he could not very well prevent harolds closing the door in obedience to his mothers directions but fortunately the matter was taken out of his hands by the old lady herself who unobserved by harold and his mother had been listening to the conversation from the upper landing when she saw her visitor about to be turned out of the house she thought it quite time to interfere louisa she called in a tone of displeasure you will oblige me by not meddling with my visitors luke come upstairs luke could not forbear a smile of triumph as he passed harold and mrs tracy and noticed the look of discomfiture on their faces i didnt know he was your visitor aunt eliza said mrs tracy trembling with the anger she did not venture to display before her wealthy relative didnt he say so asked mrs merton sharply yes but i was not sure that he was not an impostor you had only to refer the matter to me and i could have settled the question luke is in my employ in your employ repeated mrs tracy in surprise yes he will do errands for me and sometimes accompany me to the city why didnt you call on harold he would be very glad to be of service to you harold had other things to occupy him i prefer the other arrangement luke come into my room and i will give you directions mrs tracy and harold looked at each other as the old lady and luke disappeared this is a new freak of aunt elizas said mrs tracy why does she pass over you and give the preference to this upstart boy i dont mind that mother replied harold i dont want to be dancing attendance on an old woman but she may take a fancy to this boy she seems to have done so already and give him part of the money that ought to be yours if we find there is any danger of that i guess we are smart enough to set her against him let her have the boy for a servant if she wishes i dont know but you are right harold we must be very discreet for aunt eliza is worth half a million and how old is she mother seventyone thats pretty old she cant live many years i hope she will live to a good old age said mrs tracy hypocritically but when she dies it is only fair that we should have her money chapter xv a welcome gift when luke and mrs merton were alone the old lady said with a smile you seemed to have some difficulty in getting into the house yes answered luke i dont think your nephew likes me probably not both he and his mother are afraid someone will come between me and them they are selfish and cannot understand how i can have any other friends or beneficiaries you are surprised that i speak so openly of such near relatives to such a comparative stranger however it is my nature to be outspoken and now luke if you dont think it will be tiresome to escort an old woman i mean to take you downtown with me i look upon you as a kind friend mrs merton responded luke earnestly i want to thank you for the handsome present you made me yesterday i didnt expect anything like ten dollars you will find it acceptable however i dont doubt seriously luke i dont think its too much to pay for saving my life now if you will wait here five minutes i will be ready to go out with you five minutes later mrs merton came into the room attired for the street they went downstairs together and luke and she got on a street car they were observed by mrs tracy and harold as they left the house aunt elizas very easily imposed upon remarked the latter she scarcely knows anything of that boy and she has taken him out with her how does she know but he is a thief he looks like one said harold in an amiable tone if aunt is robbed i shant pity her she will deserve it very true but you must remember that it will be our loss as well as hers her property will rightfully come to us and if she is robbed we shall inherit so much the less i have been thinking harold it may be well for you to find out something of this boy if you can prove to aunt eliza that he is of bad character she will send him adrift ill see about it mother meanwhile mrs merton and luke were on their way to the business portion of the city i think i will stop at adams street luke said the old lady i shall have to go to the continental bank do you know where it is i believe it is on la salle street corner of adams quite right i shall introduce you to the paying teller as in my employ as i may have occasion to send you there alone at times to deposit or draw money i wish harold was more like you she said his mothers suggestion that i should take him with me as an escort would be just as disagreeable to him as to me is he attending school asked luke yes he is preparing for college but he is not fond of study and i doubt whether he ever enters i think he must be about your age i am nearly sixteen then he is probably a little older they entered the bank and mrs merton going to the window of the paying teller presented a check for a hundred dollars how will you have it mrs merton asked the teller in fives and tens by the way mr northrop please take notice of this boy with me i shall occasionally send him by himself to attend to my business his name is luke walton his face looks familiar i think we have met before i have sold you papers more than once mr northrop said luke i stand on clark street near the sherman yes i remember now we bank officials are apt to take notice of faces here luke carry this money for me said mrs merton putting a ladys pocketbook into the hand of her young escort you are less likely to be robbed than i luke was rather pleased at the full confidence his new employer seemed to repose in him i am now going up on state street said mrs merton as they emerged into the street you know the store of marshall field oh yes everybody in chicago knows that said luke in a few minutes they stood before the large store and mrs merton entered followed by luke mrs merton went to that part of the establishment where woolens are sold and purchased a dress pattern to lukes surprise the salesman was the same one who had come to his assistance in the car the day previous when he was charged with stealing the recognition was mutual i believe we have met before said the young man with a smile yes fortunately for me answered luke gratefully the two parties who were determined to find you guilty looked foolish when they ascertained the real character of your accuser what is this luke you didnt tell me of it said mrs merton the story was related briefly i should like to meet that woman said mrs merton nodding energetically id give her a piece of my mind luke you may hand me ten dollars the goods were wrapped up and the change returned where shall i send the bundle mrs merton asked the salesman deferentially luke will take it as they left the store mrs merton said did you think i was buying this dress for myself luke i thought so luke answered no i have dresses enough to last me a lifetime i may almost say this dress pattern is for your mother for my mother repeated luke joyfully yes i hope it will be welcome indeed it will mother hasnt had a new dress for over a year then i guessed right give it to her with my compliments and tell her i give it to her for your sake now i believe i will go home no present made to luke could have given him so much pleasure as this gift to his mother for he knew how much she stood in need of it when they reached the house on prairie avenue they met mrs tracy on the steps she had been out for a short call did you have a pleasant morning aunt eliza she asked quite ignoring luke yes quite so luke i wont trouble you to come in i shall not need you tomorrow the next day you may call at the same hour luke turned away but was called back sharply by mrs tracy boy she said you are taking away my aunts bundle bring it back directly louisa said the old lady dont trouble yourself that bundle is meant for lukes mother something you bought for her yes a dress pattern oh sniffed mrs tracy eying luke with strong disapproval chapter xvi thomas browning at home in one of the handsomest streets in milwaukee stood a private residence which was quite in harmony with its surroundings it looked like the home of a man of ample means it was luxuriously furnished and at one side was a conservatory it was apt to attract the attention of strangers and the question was asked who lives there and the answer would be thomas browning he will probably be mayor some day yes this was the residence of thomas browning formerly thomas butler the man to whom the dead father of luke walton had intrusted the sum of ten thousand dollars to carry to his wife and children how he fulfilled his trust or rather did not fulfill it we already know but in milwaukee where mr browning had become a leading citizen it was not known it was entirely inconsistent with what was believed to be his character for mr browning was president of one charitable society and treasurer of another at the annual meetings of these societies he was always called upon to speak and his allusions to the poverty and privations of those who were cared for by these societies never failed to produce an impression it was popularly supposed that he gave away large sums in charity indeed he admitted the fact but explained the absence of his name from subscription papers by saying all my gifts are anonymous instead of giving my name i prefer to put down cash so much or a friend such another sum i dont wish to influence others but it jars upon me to have my name ostentatiously paraded in the public prints now in all subscriptions there are donations ascribed to cash and a friend and whenever these occurred it was generally supposed they represented mr browning but to let the reader into a little secret this was only a shrewd device of mr brownings to have the reputation of a philanthropist at little or no expense for as a matter of fact he never contributed at all to the charities in which he seemed to take such an interest in a pleasant room on the second floor sat the pseudophilanthropist the room was furnished as a library at a writing table poring over what looked like an account book he looked the picture of comfort and respectability a few wellchosen engravings adorned the walls a pleasant light was diffused about the room from a chandelier suspended over the table thomas browning leaned back in his chair and a placid smile overspread his naturally harsh features he looked about him and his thoughts somehow ran back to a time when he was very differently situated five years ago tonight he said i was wellnigh desperate i hadnt a cent to bless myself with nor was the prospect of getting one particularly bright how i lived for a considerable time i hardly know i did have a notion at one time when i was particularly down on my luck of committing suicide and so ending the struggle once for all it would have been a great mistake he added after a pause i didnt foresee at the time the prosperous years that lay before me frederick waltons money changed my whole life ten thousand dollars isnt a fortune but it proved the basis of one it enabled me to float the excelsior mine i remember there were a hundred thousand shares at two dollars a share all based upon a few acres of mining land which i bought for a song with the ten thousand dollars i hired an office printed circulars distributed glowing accounts of imaginary wealth etc it cost considerable for advertising but i sold seventy thousand shares and when i had gathered in the money i let the bottom fall out there was a great fuss of course but i figured as the largest loser being the owner of thirty thousand shares for which i hadnt paid a cent and so shared the sympathy extended to losers it was a nice scheme and after deducting all expenses i made a clean seventyfive thousand dollars out of it which added to my original capital made eightyfive thousand then i came to milwaukee and bought this house from that time my career has been upward and onward my friends say some day i shall be mayor of the city well stranger things have happened and who knows but my friends may be right at this moment a servant entered the library well mary what is it asked the philanthropist please sir theres a poor woman at the door and she would like to see you ah yes she wants relief from the widows and orphans society probably well send her up i am always at home to the poor what a good man he is thought mary its strange he gives such low wages to the girls that work for him he says its because he gives away so much money in charities mary ushered in a moment later a woman in a faded dress with a look of care and sorrow on her thin features take a seat madam said thomas browning urbanely did you wish to see me yes sir i am in difficulties and have ventured to call upon you i am glad to see you i am always ready to see the unfortunate yes sir i know you have the reputation of being a philanthropist no no said mr browning modestly dont mention it i am fully aware of the flattering estimation which is placed on my poor services but i really dont deserve it it is perhaps as the president of the widows and orphans charitable society that you wish to speak to me no sir it is as president of the excelsior mining company that i wish to make an appeal to you oh ejaculated browning with a perceptible change of countenance of course you remember it sir i was a widow with a small property of five thousand dollars left me by my late husband it was all i had on which to support myself and two children the banks paid poor interest and i was in search of a profitable investment one of your circulars fell into my hands the shares were two dollars each and it was stated that they would probably yield fifty per cent dividends that would support me handsomely but i didnt decide to invest until i had written a private letter to you she took it from the pocket of her dress and offered it to thomas browning but that gentleman waved it aside she continued you indorsed all that the circular contained you said that within a year you thought he shares would rise to at least ten dollars so i invested all the money i had you know what followed in six months the shares went down to nothing and i found myself penniless i know it my good woman said thomas browning i know it to my cost i myself had sixty thousand dollars invested in the stock i lost it all but you seem to be a rich man said the poor woman looking about her i have made it out of other ventures but the collapse of the mine was a sad blow to me as the president i might have had something from the wreck but i did not i suffered with the rest now may i ask what i can do for you it was on account of your advice that i bought stock dont you think you ought to make up to me a part of the loss impossible said browning sharply didnt i tell you i lost much more heavily than you then you can do nothing for me yes i can put you on the pension list of the widows and orphans society that will entitle you to receive a dollar a week for three months i am not an object of charity sir i wish you goodnight goodnight if you change your mind come to me very unreasonable upon my word soliloquized thomas browning at eleven oclock mr browning went to his bedchamber he lit the gas and was preparing to disrobe when his sharp ear detected the sound of suppressed breathing and the point from which it proceeded he walked quickly to the bed bent over and looked underneath in an instant he had caught a man who had been concealed beneath it the intruder was a wretchedly dressed tramp browning allowed the man to get upon his feet and then facing him demanded sternly why are you here did you come to rob me chapter xvii a strange visitor did you come to rob me repeated mr browning as he stood facing the tramp whom he had brought to the light from under the bed there was an eager questioning look on the face of the tramp as he stared at the gentleman upon whose privacy he had intruded not a look of fear but a look of curiosity thomas browning misinterpreted it he thought the man was speechless from alarm have you nothing to say for yourself demanded browning sternly the answer considerably surprised him why pard its you is it said the man with the air of one to whom a mystery was made plain what do you mean by your impertinence asked the respectable mr browning angrily well thats a good one whod have thought that this ere mansion belonged to my old friend and pard what do you mean are you crazy fellow no i aint crazy as i know of but im flabbergasted thats what i am have done with this trifling and tell me why i shouldnt hand you over to the police i guess you wont do that tom butler returned the burglar coolly browning stared in surprise and dismay at hearing his old name pronounced by this unsavory specimen of humanity who are you he demanded quickly dont you know me no i dont i never saw you before i dont associate with men of your class hear him now chuckled the tramp in an amazed tone why tom butler you an me used to be pards dont you remember jack king why weve bunked together and hunted for gold together and almost starved together but that was in the old days browning looked the amazement he felt are you really jack king he ejaculated sinking back into an easychair and staring hard at his unexpected visitor im the same old coon tom but im down at the heel while you do you really own this fine house and these elegant fixins yes answered browning mechanically well youve fared better than i ive been goin down down till ive got about as far down as i can get and you have become a burglar well a man must live you know you could work who would give such a lookin man as i any work how did you get in thats my secret you mustnt expect me to give myself away and you had no idea whose house you were in i was told it belonged to a mr browning i am mr browning thomas browning you what has become of butler i had good substantial reasons for changing my name there was money in it you understand id like to change my own name on them terms and now tom butler what are you going to do for me mr brownings face hardened he felt no sympathy for the poor wretch with whom he had once been on terms of intimacy he felt ashamed to think that they had ever been comrades and he resented the tone of familiarity with which this outcast addressed him a reputable citizen a wealthy capitalist a man whose name had been more than once mentioned in connection with the mayors office ill tell you what i ought to do he said harshly well i ought to call a policeman and give you in charge for entering my house as a burglar youd better not do that he said without betraying alarm why not why should i not treat you like any other burglar because but i want to ask you a question what did you do with that money walton gave you on his deathbed what do you mean he faltered just what i say what did you do with waltons money i am at a loss to understand your meaning no you are not however i am ready to explain on his deathbed walton gave you ten thousand dollars to carry to his wife and family did you do it who told you this it is unnecessary for me to say it is enough that i know it at the time you were poor enough you might have had a few hundred dollars of your own but certainly not much more now it isnt so many years ago i find you a rich man of course i have my own ideas of how this came about do you mean to accuse me of dishonesty demanded browning angrily i dont accuse you of anything i am only thinking of what would be natural under the circumstances im not an angel myself tom butler and i cant say but the money might have miscarried if it had been handed to me instead of to you i wish it had i wouldnt be the miserablelooking wretch i am now walton handed me some money said browning cautiously not ten thousand dollars and i handed it to his family where did they live in a country town he answered glibly i was thinking i might run across mrs walton some day he said significantly she would be glad to see me as i knew her late husband in california she is dead said browning hastily dead how long since she died soon after she heard of her husbands death died of grief poor woman were there no children yes there was a girl but she was adopted by a relative in massachusetts i dont believe a word of it thought jack king he wants to put me off the scent humph and you gave the wife the money of course i may meet the girl some time i might advertise for any of the family do you think they would be glad to see you they might help me and i stand in need of help there is no need of that you are an old comrade in distress i havent forgotten the fact though i pretended to to try you heres a fivedollar bill ill let you out of the house myself considering how you entered it you may count yourself lucky thats all right as far as it goes tom but i want to remind you of a little debt you owe me when you were out of luck at murphys diggings i lent you twentyfive dollars which you have never paid back i had forgotten it i havent that money will come mighty convenient just now it will buy me a betterlooking suit second hand and make a different man of me with it i can get a place and set up for a respectable human being heres the money said browning reluctantly drawing the additional bills from his wallet now that we are square i hope you wont annoy me by further applications i might have sent you out of the house under very different circumstances you were always considerate tom said the tramp stowing away the bills in the pocket of his ragged vest may i refer to you if i apply for a situation yes but remember i am thomas browning i prefer not to have it known that my name was ever butler all right now if youll do me the favor of showing me the door ill leave you to your slumbers its very awkward that mans turning up muttered browning as he returned from letting out his unsavory visitor how could he have heard about waltons money chapter xviii how jack king fared jack king left the house with the money browning had unwillingly given him he sought a cheap lodging and the next morning proceeded to make himself respectable when he had donned some clean linen a suit of clothes which he bought cheap at a secondhand store taken a bath and called into requisition the services of a barber it would have been hard to recognize him as the same man who had emerged from under the bed of the wellknown philanthropist a typical tramp and wouldbe burglar jack king counted over the balance of his money and found that he had nine dollars and thirtyseven cents left this wont support me forever he reflected i must get something to do while sauntering along he fell in with an old acquaintance named stone what are you up to king he asked looking for a job you are my man then i am keeping a cigar store at the prairie hotel but i have some business calling me away from the city for six weeks or two months will you take my place what are the inducements board and lodging and five dollars a week agreed come over then and i will show you the place the hotel was a cheap one not far from the railway station and though comfortable was not patronized by fastidious travelers when do you want me to take hold he asked tomorrow all right come around at ten oclock i want to leave milwaukee in the afternoon king could not help reflecting about the extraordinary prosperity of his old comrade tom butler now thomas browning esq what does it mean he asked himself he seemed very uneasy when i asked him about waltons money i believe he kept it himself i wish i knew if i could prove it it would be a gold mine for me i must make inquiries and if possible find out waltons family do you know anything of thomas browning he asked stone the philanthropist yes what of him i called on him last evening jack did not think it best to mention the circumstances of his visit indeed how did you know him in california i suppose he laid the foundation of his fortune there is he so rich then yes probably worth a quarter of a million this was an exaggeration but rich mens wealth is generally overstated how does he stand in the city firstclass he has been mentioned for mayor i shouldnt be surprised if he might get the office some day he has certainly been very lucky i should say so was he rich in california not when i knew him at one time there he had to borrow money of me he paid me back last evening he is on the top of the ladder now at any rate his respectability would suffer a little thought jack king if i could prove that he had appropriated waltons money i must think the matter over and secure some information if i can the next sunday evening he called at the house of the philanthropist and sent in his name thomas browning went himself to the door he was afraid king might be wearing the same disreputable suit in which he had made his former visit but to his relief his visitor looked quite respectable do you wish to see me he asked yes but only for a social call i am not acquainted in milwaukee and it does me good to see an old friend and comrade i have not much time to spare but come in they went into the philanthropists library formerly described have you found anything to do asked browning yes what is it king answered the question it is not much he added but will do for the present at any rate it is considerably better than entering a house at night and hiding under the bed said browning dryly so it is answered king smiling you must make allowance for my destitute condition i little thought that i was in the house of an old friend i have been asking about you tom butler i beg pardon mr browning and i find that you stand very high in milwaukee a shade of annoyance showed itself on the philanthropists face when king referred to him under his former name but when his high standing was referred to he smiled complacently yes he said i have been fortunate enough to win the good opinion of my fellowcitizens some one told me that you would probably run for mayor some day it may be i have been sounded on the subject the worst of running for office is that if a man has ever done anything discreditable it is sure to be brought out against him i hope you dont mean to imply that i have ever done anything discreditable said browning sharply oh dear no how could i think such a thing but sometimes false charges are brought if you had ever betrayed a trust or kept money belonging to another of course it would hurt you certainly it would said the philanthropist his voice betraying some nervousness but i am glad to say that my conscience is clear on that point by the way jack let me send for a bottle of wine well drink to the memory of old time with all my heart tom i see youre the right sort when you are nominated for office i will work for you browning smiled graciously on his visitor and the interview closed pleasantly hes afraid of me thought jack as he left the house chapter xix a sensational incident when luke brought home the dress pattern his mother was much pleased i have needed a dress for a good while she said but i never felt that i could spare the money to buy even a common one this material is very nice it cost seventyfive cents a yard i was with mrs merton when she bought it i hope you didnt hint to mrs merton that i needed one no that isnt like me mother but i own that i was very glad when she thought of it please tell her how grateful i am i will certainly do so now mother i want you to have it made up at once i can spare the money necessary it will cost very little i will have it cut by a dress maker and make it up myself i hope you will long retain the friendship of mrs merton it wont by my fault if i dont but i cant help seeing that her niece mrs tracy and harold a boy about my age look upon me with dislike why should they i dont see how anyone can dislike you you are my mother and are prejudiced in my favor but i am sure they have no reason to dislike me i think however they are jealous and fear the old lady will look upon me with too much favor she is very rich i hear and they expect to inherit all her fortune money makes people mean and unjust if i can only get hold of some ill run the risk of that said luke i should feel a good deal more comfortable if i hadnt two enemies in the house do your duty my son and leave the rest to god it isnt well to borrow trouble no doubt you are right mother i will follow your advice the next morning luke was at his usual stand near the sherman house when a boy who was passing uttered a slight exclamation of surprise looking up luke recognized harold tracy so its you is it said harold not over politely yes answered luke i hope you are well i didnt know you were a newsboy i spend a part of my time in selling papers does mrs merton know you are a newsboy i think i have told her but i am not certain it must be inconvenient for you to come so far as our house every day of course it takes up some time but mrs merton does not allow me to work for nothing how much does aunt eliza pay you i would rather you would ask mrs merton i am not sure that she would care to have me tell you seem to forget that i am her nephew that is her grandnephew it is hardly likely she would keep such a thing secret from me that may be but i would rather you would ask her does she pay you more than two dollars a week again i must refer you to her it is ridiculous to make a secret of such a trifle said harold annoyed how much do you make selling papers he asked i averaged about seventyfive cents a day before i began to work for mrs merton now i dont make as much why dont you black boots too many of the newsboys do i never cared to take up that business if you should go into it i would give you a job now and then i am not likely to go into that business but i shall be glad to sell you a paper whenever you need one you are not too proud to black boots are you persisted harold i dont think it necessary to answer that question i have always got along without it so far harold carried the news home to his mother that luke was a newsboy and mrs tracy found an opportunity to mention it at the supper table harold saw your paragon this morning aunt eliza she commenced have i a paragon i really wasnt aware of it returned the old lady your errand boy oh luke where did you see him harold he was selling papers near the sherman house i hope you bought one of him i didnt have any change did you know he was a newsboy aunt eliza asked mrs tracy yes he told me so you speak of it as if it were something to his discredit it is a low business of course why is it a low business oh well of course it is only poor street boys who engage in it i am aware that luke is poor and that he has to contribute to the support of his mother and brother i hope if you were poor that harold would be willing to work for you i wouldnt sell papers put in harold i dont suppose luke sells papers from choice aunt eliza i dont see why you should so persistently compare harold with that ragged errand boy of yours is he ragged i am glad you noticed it i must help him to a new suit this was far from a welcome suggestion to mrs tracy and she made haste to add i dont think hes ragged he dresses well enough for his position in life still i think he needs some new clothes and i thank you for suggesting it louisa the next day luke to his surprise was asked to ac company mrs merton to a readymade clothing house on clark street where he was presented with a fine suit costing twenty dollars how kind you are mrs merton said luke i didnt notice that you needed a new suit returned the old lady but my niece mrs tracy spoke of it and i was glad to take the hint it was in the afternoon of the same day that luke having an errand that carried him near the lake shore strolled to the end of north pier he was fond of the water but seldom had an opportunity to go out on it how are you luke said a boy in a flatbottomed boat a few rods away in the boy who hailed him luke recognized john hagan an acquaintance of about his own age wont you come aboard asked john i dont mind if youll come near enough in five minutes luke found himself on board the boat he took the oars and relieved john who was disposed to rest they rowed hither and thither never very far from the pier not far away was a boat of the same build occupied by a man of middle size whose eccentric actions attracted their attention now he would take the oars and row with feverish haste nearly fifty strokes to a minute then he would let his oars trail and seem wrapped in thought suddenly the boys were startled to see him spring to his feet and flinging up his arms leap head first into the lake chapter xx ambrose keans imprudence luke and his companion were startled by the sudden attempt at suicide and for an instant sat motionless in their boat luke was the first to regain his selfpossession quick let us try to save him he called to john hagan they plunged their oars into the water and the boat bounded over the waves fortunately they were but half a dozen rods from the place where the wouldbe suicide was now struggling to keep himself up for as frequently happens when he actually found himself in the water the instinct of selfpreservation impelled the wouldbe selfdestroyer to attempt to save himself he could swim a very little but the waters of the lake were in lively motion his boat had floated away and he would inevitably have drowned but for the energetic action of luke and john they swept their boat alongside and luke thrust his oar in the direction of the struggling man take hold of it he said and we will tow you to your own boat guided and sustained by the oar the man gripped the side of lukes boat leaving the oar free his weight nearly overbalanced the craft but with considerable difficulty the boys succeeded in reaching the other boat and though considerably exhausted its late occupant managed to get in as he took his place in the boat he presented a sorry spectacle for his clothes were wet through and dripping you will take your death of cold unless you go on shore at once said luke it wouldnt matter much if i did said the young man gloomily we will row to shore also said luke to john hagan he may make another attempt to drown himself i will see what i can do to reason him out of it they were soon at the pier and the three landed where do you live asked luke taking his position beside the young man the latter named a number on vine street it was at a considerable distance and time was precious for the young man was trembling from the effects of his immersion there is no time to lose we must take a carriage said luke he summoned one which fortunately had just returned from the pier to which it had conveyed a passenger and the two jumped in luke helped him up to his room a small one on the third floor and remained until he had changed his clothes and was reclining on the bed you ought to have some hot drink he said can any be got in the house yes mrs woods the landlady will have some hot water luke went downstairs and succeeded in enlisting the sympathetic assistance of the kindhearted woman by representing that her lodger had been upset in the lake and was in danger of a severe cold when the patient had taken down a cup of hot drink he turned to luke and said how can i thank you there is no need to thank me i am glad i was at hand when you needed me what is your name luke walton mine is ambrose kean you must think i am a fool i think said luke gently that you have some cause of unhappiness you are right there i have been unfortunate but i am also an offender against the law and it was the fear of exposure and arrest that made me take the step i did i thought i was ready to die but when i found myself in the water life seemed dearer than it had before and i tried to escape thanks to you i am alive but now i almost wish that i had succeeded i dont know how to face what is before me would you mind telling me what it is no i need someone to confide in and you deserve my confidence let me tell you then that i am employed in an office on dearborn street my pay is small twelve dollars a week but it would be enough to support me if i had only myself to look out for but i have a mother in milwaukee and i have been in the habit of sending her four dollars a week that left me only eight dollars which i found it hard to live on and there was nothing left for clothes i can easily believe that said luke i struggled along however as best i might but last week i received a letter from my mother saying that she was sick of course her expenses were increased and she wrote to know if i could send her a little extra money i have been living so close up to my income that i absolutely had less than a dollar in my pocket unfortunately temptation came at a time when i was least prepared to resist it one of our customers from the country came in when i was alone and paid me fifty dollars in bills for which i gave him a receipt no one saw the payment made it flashed upon me that this sum would make my mother comfortable even if her sickness lasted a considerable time without taking time to think i went to an express office and forwarded to her a package containing the bills it started yesterday and by this time is in my mothers hands you see the situation i am placed in the one who paid the money may come to the office at any time and reveal my guilt i dont wonder that you were dispirited returned luke but can nothing be done can you not replace the money in time how can i i have told you how small my salary is have you no friend or friends from whom you could borrow the money i know of none i have few friends and such as they are are like myself dependent on small pay i must tell you by the way how we became poor my mother had a few thousand dollars which added to my earnings would have made us comparatively independent but in an evil hour she invested them in a california mine on the strength of the indorsement of a wellknown financier of milwaukee mr thomas browning who asked luke in surprise thomas browning do you know him i have seen him he sometimes comes to chicago and stops at the sherman house he recommended the stock so highly in fact he was the president of the company that put it on the market that my poor mother thought it all right and invested all she had the stock was two dollars a share now it would not fetch two cents this it was that reduced us to such extreme poverty do you think mr browning was honest in his recommendation of the mine asked luke thoughtfully i dont know he claimed to be the principal loser himself but it is rather remarkable that he is living like a rich man now hundreds lost their money through this mine as mr browning had himself been in california what is that asked luke in excitement you say this browning was once in california can you tell when half a dozen years ago more or less and he looks like the man to whom my poor father confided ten thousand dollars for us thought luke it is very strange everything tallies but the name the wretch who swindled us was named butler why do you ask when mr browning was in california asked the young man because my father died in california answered luke evasively and i thought it possible that mr browning might have met him chapter xxi a friend in need mr browning is a man of very peculiar appearance said kean you refer to the wart on the upper part of his right cheek yes it gives him a repulsive look and yet he is popular in milwaukee yes among those who were not swindled by his mining scheme he has done more harm than he can ever repair for instance added the young man bitterly this crime which i have committed i will call it by its right name i was impelled to do by my mothers poverty brought on by him how does it happen that you are not at the office to day i felt sick sick at heart rather than sick in body and i sent word to my employer that i could not be there i dread entering the office for at any time exposure may come if you could only raise the fifty dollars you could replace the money before it was inquired for ambrose kean shook his head i cant possibly raise it he said despondently i would let you have it if i possessed as much money but as you may suppose i am poor i am no less grateful to you luke you have a good heart i am sure you dont despise me no why should i i have been guilty of a crime but you are sorry for it is there positively no one with whom you are acquainted who is rich enough to help you there is one lady in chicago a rich lady who was a schoolmate of my mother she was older and in better circumstances but they were good friends who is this lady a mrs merton mrs merton exclaimed luke in excitement of prairie avenue yes i believe she lives there why i know her i am in her employ said luke ambrose kean stared at luke in open amazement is this true he asked yes is she a kind lady do you think she would help me in this trouble of mine she is very kindhearted as i know from my own experience i will go to her at once and see what i can do ambrose kean grasped lukes hand with fervor you are a friend sent from heaven i truly believe he said you have given me hope of retrieving myself i will leave you for a time said luke there is no time to be lost i shall be full of anxiety till i see you again be hopeful i think i shall bring you good news when luke reached the house on prairie avenue he was about to ring the bell when harold tracy opened the door you here again he said in a tone of displeasure werent you here this morning yes did aunt eliza ask you to come this afternoon no then what brings you business answered luke curtly and he quietly entered the hall and said to a servant who was passing through will you be kind enough to ask mrs merton if she will see me well youre cheeky ejaculated harold who had in tended to keep him out as long as mrs merton doesnt think so i shall not trouble myself said luke coldly sooner or later aunt eliza will see you in your true colors said harold provoked i think she does now at this moment the servant returned you are to go upstairs she said mrs merton will see you the old lady was sitting back in an easychair when luke entered she smiled pleasantly this is an unexpected pleasure she said this afternoon call i will tell you at once what brought me mrs merton it isnt sickness at home i hope no i came for a comparative stranger then luke told the story of ambrose kean his sudden yielding to temptation his repentance and remorse i am interested in your friend said mrs merton you say he appropriated fifty dollars yes but it was to help his mother true but it was a dangerous step to take it wont be considered a valid excuse he realizes all that his employer is a just but strict man and if the theft is discovered kean will be arrested and of course convicted and you think i will help him is that why you have come to me with this story i dont think i would have done so if he had not mentioned you as an old friend and schoolmate of his mother whats that added mrs merton quickly his mother an old schoolmate of mine that is what he says what was her name before marriage mary robinson you dont say so mrs merton exclaimed with vivacity why mary was my favorite at school and this young man is her son i would have helped him without knowing this but now i wont hesitate a moment marys boy you must bring him here i want to question him about her i can tell you something about her she lost her money by investing in a california mine i think it was the excelsior mine she too luke looked surprised he did not understand the meaning of this exclamation i have a thousand shares of that worthless stock myself continued the old lady it cost me two thousand dollars and now it is worth nothing the one who introduced the stock was a mr browning of milwaukee i know he was an unscrupulous knave i have no doubt i could afford the loss but hundreds invested like poor mary who were ruined is the man living do you know yes he is living in milwaukee he is rich and is prominently spoken of as a candidate for mayor if he is ever a candidate i will take care that his connection with this swindling transaction is made known a man who builds up a fortune on the losses of the poor is a contemptible wretch in my opinion and mine too said luke it is very strange that he answers the description of a man who cheated our family out of ten thousand dollars indeed how was that luke told the story and mrs merton listened with great interest so all corresponds except the name yes he may have changed his name i have thought of that i mean to find out some time i wont keep you any longer your friend is no doubt in great anxiety i have the money here in bills i will give them to you for him mrs merton was in the act of handing a roll of bills to luke when the door opened suddenly and mrs tracy entered she frowned in surprise and displeasure when she saw her aunt giving money to that boy as she contemptuously called him chapter xxii how ambrose kean was saved i didnt know you were occupied aunt eliza said mrs tracy in a significant tone as she paused at the door my business is not private returned the old lady come in louisa mrs tracy did come in but she regarded luke with a hostile and suspicious glance that is all luke said his patroness you may go you can report to me tomorrow all right maam when luke had left the room mrs tracy said you appear to repose a great deal of confidence in that boy yes i think he deserves it mrs tracy coughed you seem to trust him with a great deal of money yes of course i dont want to interfere but i think you will need to be on your guard he is evidently bent on getting all he can out of you that is your judgment is it louisa yes aunt eliza since you ask me he has done me a service this morning he has brought to my notice a son of one of my old school mates who is in a strait and i have just sent him fifty dollars by that boy yes why not are you sure the person to whom you sent the money will ever get it please speak out what you mean dont hint i hate hints in plain terms then i think the boy will keep the money himself or at any rate a part of it i dont fear it have you any more to say nothing except to warn you against that designing boy you are very kind louisa but i am not quite a simpleton i have seen something of the world and i dont think i am easily taken in mrs tracy left the room not very well satisfied she really thought luke had designs upon the old ladys money and was averse even to his receiving a legacy since it would take so much from harold and herself harold when i entered your aunts room what do you think i saw this she said to harold who was waiting below i dont know aunt eliza was giving money to that boy do you know how much fifty dollars whew was it for himself he came to her with a trumpedup story of an old schoolmate of aunts who was in need of money do you think he will keep it himself i am afraid so what a cheeky young rascal he is to be sure i have no doubt you are right yes there is too much reason to think he is an unscrupulous adventurer young as he is why dont you tell aunt so i have and what does she say it doesnt make the least impression upon her what do you think the boy will do get her to make a will in his favor or at least to leave him a large legacy harold turned pale that would be robbing us he said of course it would he wouldnt mind that you know he was very impertinent to me this morning i presume so he depends upon his favor with aunt isnt there anything we can do mother i must consider meanwhile luke returned at once to the room of ambrose kean he found the young man awaiting him with great anxiety what success he asked quickly i have got the fifty dollars answered luke thank god i am saved ejaculated the young man would you mind taking it round to the office with a note from me asked kean i will do so cheerfully then i shall feel at ease mrs merton would like to have you call on her she remembered your mother at once i shall be glad to do so but shall be ashamed to meet her now that she knows of my yielding to temptation you need not mind that she also suffered from the rascality of thomas browning and she will make allowances for you then i will go some day with you you had better give me a letter to take to your employer with the money i will ambrose kean wrote the following note james cooper dear sir hiram crossley called at the office yesterday and paid in fifty dollars due to you being busy i thrust it into my pocket and inadvertently took it with me i think i shall be able to be at the office tomorrow but think it best to send the money by a young friend i gave mr crossley a receipt yours respectfully ambrose kean when luke reached the office mr cooper was conversing with a stout broadshouldered man of middle age and luke could not help hearing some of their conversation you say you paid fifty dollars to my clerk mr crossley asked the merchant yes have you his receipt here it is mr cooper examined it yes that is his signature isnt he here today no he sent word that he had a headache and you dont find the money no that is singular and the two men exchanged glances of suspicion what sort of a young man is he i never had any cause to suspect him i hope it is all right if it isnt i will discharge him said cooper nodding emphatically he probably didnt think i would be here so soon i didnt expect to be but a telegram summoned me to the city on other business of course luke understood that the conversation related to kean and that he had arrived none too soon he came forward i have a letter for you from mr kean he said ha give it to me mr cooper tore open the envelope saw the bank bills and read the letter its all right mr crossley he said his brow clearing read that letter i am really glad said crossley how is mr kean asked cooper in a friendly tone he had a severe headache but he is better and hopes to be at the office tomorrow tell him i shall be glad to see him but dont want him to come unless he is really able thank you sir i will do so and luke left the office he went back to ambrose kean and told him what had happened at the office i have escaped better than i deserved he said it will be a lesson to me please tell mrs merton that her timely aid has saved my reputation and rescued my poor mother from sorrow and destitution i will and i am sure she will consider the money well spent the next morning as luke stood at his usual post he saw thomas browning of milwaukee come out of the sherman house he knew him at once by the wart on the upper part of his right cheek which gave him a remarkable appearance can there be two persons answering this description luke asked himself thomas browning came across the street and paused in front of luke chapter xxiii stephen webb is puzzled will you have a morning paper asked luke he wanted to have a few words with mr browning even upon an indifferent subject as he now thought it probable that this was the man who had defrauded his mother and himself browning too on his part wished for an opportunity to speak with the son of the man he had so shamefully swindled yes he said abruptly you may give me the times when the paper had been paid for he said do you make a good living at selling papers it gives me about seventyfive cents a day answered luke you can live on that i suppose i have a mother to support that makes a difference why do you stay in chicago you could make a better living farther west in california asked luke looking intently at browning thomas browning started what put california into your head he asked my father died in california a good reason for your not going there i thought you might be able to tell me something about california continued luke why should i i thought perhaps you had been there you are right said browning after a pause i made a brief trip to san francisco at one time it was on a slight matter of business but i dont know much about the interior and cant give you advice i wonder if this is true thought luke he admits having been to california but says he has never been in the interior if that is the case he cant have met my father i may at some time have it in my power to find you a place farther west but not in california resumed browning i will take it into consideration i frequently come to chicago and i presume you are to be found here yes sir thomas browning waved his hand by way of goodby and continued on his way the boy seems sharp he said to himself if he had the slightest hint of my connection with his fathers money he looks as if he would follow it up luckily there is no witness and no evidence no one can prove that i received the money at the corner of adams street mr browning encountered his nephew stephen webb who was gazing in at a window with a cigar in his mouth looking the very image of independent leisure you are profitably employed said browning dryly stephen webb wheeled round quickly glad to see you uncle thomas he said effusively i suppose you received my letter yes i hope you are satisfied i had hard work to find out about the boy humph i dont see how there could be anything difficult about it i hope you didnt mention my name no i suppose you are interested in the boy said stephen with a look of curious inquiry yes i always feel interested in the poor and those who require assistance i am glad of that uncle for you have a poor nephew and a lazy one said browning sharply where would i be if i had been as indolent as you i am sure i am willing to do whatever you require uncle thomas have you any instructions well not just now except to let me know all you can learn about the newsboy has he any other source of income except selling papers i believe he does a few odd jobs now and then but i dont suppose he earns much outside i was talking with him this morning you were ejaculated stephen in a tone of curiosity did you tell him you felt an interest in him no and i dont want you to tell him so i suggested that he could make a better income by leaving chicago and going farther west i think i might like to do that uncle thomas then why dont you i cant go without money you could take up a quartersection of land and start in as a farmer i could give you a lift that way if i thought you were in earnest i dont think i should succeed as a farmer said stephen with a grimace too hard work eh i am willing to work hard but that isnt in my line well let that go you asked if i had any instructions find opportunities of talking with the boy and speak in favor of going west i will is there anything more no i believe not you couldnt let me have a couple of dollars extra could you uncle why should i i i felt sick last week and had to call in a doctor and then get some medicine theres one dollar dont ask me for any more extras hes awfully closefisted grumbled stephen i am afraid king might visit chicago and find out the boy said browning to himself as he continued his walk that would never do for he is a sharp fellow and would put the boy on my track if he saw any money in it my best course is to get this luke out of chicago if i can stephen webb made it in his way to fall in with luke when he was selling afternoon papers this is rather a slow way of making a fortune isnt it luke he asked yes i have no thoughts of making a fortune at the newspaper business do you always expect to remain in it continued webb well no answered luke with a smile if i live to be fifty or sixty i think i should find it rather tiresome you are right there but i dont see any way of getting out of it just yet there may be an opening for me by and by the chances for a young fellow in chicago are not very good here am i twentyfive years old and with no prospects to speak of a good many people seem to make good livings and many grow rich in chicago yes if youve got money you can make money did you ever think of going west luke looked a little surprised a gentleman was speaking to me on that subject this morning he said what did he say to you asked stephen curiously he recommended me to go west but did not seem to approve of california why not had he ever been there he said he had visited san francisco but had never been in the interior what a whopper that was thought stephen webb why should uncle thomas say that what sort of a looking man was he had you ever seen him before he inquired he is a peculiarlooking man has a wart on his right cheek did he mention the particular part of the west no he said he would look out for a chance for me it is curious uncle thomas feels such an interest in that boy webb said to himself meditatively chapter xxiv mrs merton passes a pleasant evening ambrose kean called with luke an evening or two later to thank mrs merton in person for her kindness they arrived ten minutes after mrs tracy and harold had started for hooleys theater and thus were saved an embarrassing meeting with two persons who would have treated them frigidly they were conducted upstairs by the servant and were ushered into mrs mertons room ambrose kean was naturally ill at ease knowing that mrs merton was acquainted with the error he had committed but the old lady received him cordially i am glad to meet the son of my old schoolmate mary robinson she said in spite of his unworthiness returned ambrose his cheek flushing with shame i dont know whether he is unworthy that remains to be seen you know i yielded to temptation and committed a theft yes but it was to help your mother it was but that does not relieve me from guilt you are right still it greatly mitigates it take my advice forget it and never again yield to a similar temptation i will not indeed mrs merton said the young many earnestly i feel that i have been very fortunate in escaping the consequences of my folly and in enlisting your sympathy that is well let us forget this disagreeable circumstance and look forward to the future how is mary your mother she is an invalid and poor there is a remedy for poverty let us also hope there is a remedy for her illhealth but tell me why did you not come to see me before you have been some time in chicago true but i knew you were a rich lady i didnt think you would remember or care to hear from one so poor and obscure as my mother come i consider that far from a compliment said the old lady you really thought as badly of me as that i know you better now said ambrose gratefully it is well you do you have no idea how intimate your mother and i used to be she is five years my junior i think so that i regarded her as a younger sister it is many years since we met and how is she looking she shows the effects of bad health but i dont think she looks older than her years we have both changed greatly no doubt it is to be expected but you can tell her that i have not forgotten the favorite companion of my school days i will do so for i know it will warm her heart and brighten her up when we were girls together our worldly circumstances did not greatly differ but i married and my husband was very successful in business while she married and lost all she had it is often so it might have been the other way your mother might have been rich and i poor but i dont think she would have been spoiled by prosperity any more than i have been now tell me how you are situated i am a clerk earning twelve dollars a week and your employer is he kind and considerate he is just but he has strict notions had he learned my slip the other day he would have discharged me perhaps had me arrested now thanks to your prompt kindness he knows and will know nothing of it is he likely to increase your salary he will probably raise me to fifteen dollars a week next january then i can get along very well at present it is difficult for me after sending my mother four dollars a week to live on the balance of my salary i should think it would be still i would have made it do but for mothers falling sick and so needing a larger allowance i hope she is not seriously ill said mrs merton with solicitude no fortunately not i think she will be as well as usual in a few weeks tell her i inquired particularly for her and that i send her my love and remembrance i shall be only too glad to do so the time slipped away so rapidly that luke was surprised when looking at the french clock on the mantel he saw that it lacked but a quarter of ten oclock mr kean he said glancing at the clock it is getting late so it is said ambrose rising i am afraid we have been trespassing upon your kindness mrs merton not at all said mrs merton promptly i have enjoyed the evening i can assure you mr kean you must call again i shall be glad to do so if you will permit me i wish you to do so luke will come with you i shall want to hear more of your mother and how she gets along as they were leaving mrs merton slipped into the hand of ambrose kean an envelope the contents is for your mother she said i have made the check payable to you thank you it is another mark of your kindness when ambrose kean examined the check he ascertained to his joy that it was for a hundred dollars what a splendid old lady she is luke he said enthusiastically she is always kind mr kean i have much to be grateful to her for i wish i could say the same of other members of the family what other members of the family are there a niece mrs tracy and her son harold why didnt we see them tonight i dont know i suppose they were out the next day ambrose handed the check to his employer and asked if he would indorse it and so enable him to draw the money james cooper took the check and examined the signature eliza merton said he is it the rich mrs merton who lives on prairie avenue yes sir indeed i did not know that you were acquainted with her she and my mother were schoolmates and so you keep up the acquaintance i spent last evening at her house this check is a gift from her to my mother ambrose kean rose greatly in the estimation of his employer when the latter learned that kean had such an aristocratic friend and he was treated with more respect and consideration than before meanwhile harold and his mother had enjoyed themselves at the theater i suppose aunt eliza went to bed early harold said mrs tracy as they were on their way home went to roost with the hens suggested harold laughing at what he thought to be a good joke probably it is as well for her said his mother it isnt good for old people to sit up late it was about halfpast eleven when they were admitted by the drowsy servant i suppose mrs merton went to bed long ago laura said mrs tracy no maam she set up later than usual that is odd i thought she would feel lonely oh she had company maam company who master luke was here all the evenin and a young man with him mrs tracy frowned ominously the sly young artful she said to harold when they were alone he is trying all he can to get on aunts weak side something will have to be done or we shall be left out in the cold chapter xxv mrs tracys brother a day or two later while mrs merton was in the city shopping accompanied by luke a man of thirty years of age ascended the steps of the house on prairie avenue and rang the bell is mrs tracy at home he asked of the servant who answered the bell yes sir what name shall i give never mind about the name say it is an old friend wont you come in sir yes i believe i will mrs tracy received the message with surprise mingled with curiosity who can it be she asked herself she came downstairs without delay the stranger who had taken a seat in the hall rose and faced her dont you know me louisa he asked is it you warner she exclaimed surprised and startled yes he answered laughing its a good while since we met five years and have you what reformed yes well i cant say as to that i can only tell you that i am not wanted by the police at present is the old lady still alive aunt eliza of course yes she is alive and well i thought perhaps she might have died and left you in possession of her property not yet i dont think she has any intention of dying for a considerable number of years that is awkward has she done nothing for you we have a free home here and she makes me a moderate allowance but she is not disposed to part with much money while she lives i am sorry for that i thought you might be able to help me to some money i am terribly hard up you always were no matter how much money you had i never had much the next thing is how does the old lady feel toward me i dont think she feels very friendly though nothing has passed between us respecting you for a long time she has very strict notions about honesty and when you embezzled your employers money you got into her black books that was a youthful indiscretion said warner smiling cant you convince her of that i doubt if i can lead her to think of it in that light i know what that means louisa you want to get the whole of the old ladys property for yourself and that boy of yours you always were selfish no warner though i think i am entitled to the larger part of aunts money i dont care to have you left out in the cold i will do what i can to reconcile her to you come thats fair and square youre a trump louisa you have not forgotten that i am your brother no i am not so selfish as you think if i dont succeed in restoring you to aunt elizas good graces and she chooses to leave me all her property i promise to take care of you and allow you a fair income thats all right but i would rather the old lady would provide for me herself do you doubt my word no but your idea of what would be a fair income might differ from mine how much do you think the old ladys worth quarter of a million i should think replied mrs tracy guardedly yes and considerably more too perhaps so i have no means of judging supposing it to be the figure you name how much would you be willing to give me if she leaves me out in the cold i am not prepared to say warner i would see that you had no good reason to complain i should prefer to have you name a figure so that i might know what to depend upon but this mrs tracy declined to do though her brother continued to urge her where have you been for a few years past warner she asked floating about at first i didnt dare to come back it was a year at least before i heard that aunt had paid up the sum i got away with when i did hear it i was in australia what did you do there i was a bookkeeper in melbourne for a time then i went into the country from australia i came to california and went to the mines in fact i have only just come from there didnt you manage to make money anywhere yes but it didnt stick by me how much money do you think i have about me now i cant guess said mrs tracy uneasily five dollars and a few cents however i am sure you will help me he continued really warner you mustnt hope for too much from me i have but a small allowance from aunt eliza hardly enough to buy necessary articles for harold and myself then you can speak to aunt in my behalf yes i can do that where is she she has gone out shopping this morning alone or is harold with her neither answered mrs tracy her brow darkening she has picked up a boy from the street and installed him as a first favorite thats queer isnt it yes but aunt eliza was always queer whats the boys name luke walton whats his character sly artful he is scheming to have aunt leave him something in her will if she leaves him a few hundred dollars it wont hurt us much you dont know the boy he wont be satisfied with that you dont mean to say that his influence over aunt is dangerous yes i do cant you get her to bounce him i have done what i could but she seems to be infatuated if he were a gentlemans son i shouldnt mind so much but harold saw him the other day selling papers near the sherman house do you think aunts mind is failing she seems rational enough on all other subjects she was always shrewd and sharp you know well thats rather an interesting state of things i havent returned to chicago any too soon why do you say that because it will be my duty to spoil the chances of this presuming young man that is easier said than done you forget that aunt eliza thinks a great deal more of him than she does of you i havent a doubt that you are right then what can you do convince her that he is a scapegrace get him into a scrape in other words but he is too smart to be dishonest if that is what you mean it is not necessary for him to be dishonest it is only necessary for her to think he is dishonest there was some further conversation as warner powell was leaving the house after promising to call in the evening he met on the steps mrs merton under the escort of luke walton the old lady eyed him sharply chapter xxvi the prodigals reception dont you know me aunt eliza asked warner powell casting down his eyes under the sharp glance of the old lady so it is you is it responded mrs merton in a tone which could not be considered cordial yes it is i i hope you are not sorry to see me humph it depends on whether you have improved or not luke walton listened with natural interest and curiosity this did not suit mrs tracy who did not care to have a stranger made acquainted with her brothers peccadilloes warner she said i think aunt eliza will do you the justice to listen to your explanation i imagine young man mrs merton will not require your services any longer today the last words were addressed to luke yes luke you can go said the old lady in a very different tone luke bowed and left the house louisa said mrs merton in five minutes you may bring your brother up to my room thank you aunt when they entered the apartment they found the old lady seated in a rockingchair awaiting them so you have reformed have you she asked abruptly i hope so aunt eliza i hope so too it is full time where have you been to australia california and elsewhere a rolling stone gathers no moss in this case it applies said warner i have earned more or less money but i have none now how old are you thirty a young man ought not to be penniless at that age if you had remained in your place at mr aftons and behaved yourself you would be able to tell a different story i know it aunt dont be too hard upon him aunt eliza put in mrs tracy he is trying to do well now i am very glad to hear it would you mind my inviting him to stay here for a time the house is large you know mrs merton paused she didnt like the arrangement but she was a just and merciful woman and it was possible that warner had reformed though she was not fully satisfied on that point for a time she answered till he can find employment thank you aunt eliza said the young man relieved for he had been uncertain how his aunt would treat him i hope to show that your kindness is appreciated i am rather tired now responded mrs merton as an indication that the interview was over wed better go and let aunt rest said warner with alacrity he did not feel altogether comfortable in the society of the old lady when they were alone mrs tracy turned to her brother with a smile of satisfaction you have reason to congratulate yourself on your reception she said i dont know about that the old woman wasnt very complimentary be careful how you speak of her she might hear you or the servants might and report well she is an old woman isnt she it is much better to refer to her as the old lady better still to speak of her as aunt eliza i hope she will make up her mind to do something for me she has she gives you a home in this house i would a good deal rather have her pay my board outside where i would feel more independent i have been thinking warner you might become her secretary and man of business in that case she would dispense with this boy whose presence bodes danger to us all i wouldnt mind being her man of business to take charge of her money but as to trotting round town with her like a tame poodle please excuse me warner said his sister rather sharply just remember if you please that beggars cant be choosers perhaps not but this plan of yours would be foolish she wouldnt like it nor would i why dont you put harold up to offering his services hes as large as this boy isnt he he is about the same size then it would be a capital plan you would get rid of the boy that way you forget that harold has not finished his education he is now attending a commercial school i should like to have him go to college but he doesnt seem to care about it so after all the boy seems to be a necessity i would prefer a different boy less artful and designing how much does the old woman beg pardon the old lady pay him i dont know harold asked luke but he wouldnt tell i have no doubt he manages to secure twice as much as his services are worth hes got on aunt elizas blind side just what i would like to do but i have never been able to discover that she had any did you take notice of the boy yes hes rather a goodlooking youngster it seems to me how can you say so demanded mrs tracy sharply theres a very common look about him i think he isnt nearly as goodlooking as harold harold used to look like you said warner with a smile natural you should think him goodlooking but dont it show a little selfconceit louisa thats a poor joke answered his sister coldly what are you going to do going out to see if i can find any of my old acquaintances you had much better look out for a position as aunt eliza hinted dont be in such a hurry louisa please bear in mind that i have only just arrived in chicago after an absence of five years dinner will be ready in half an hour thank you i dont think i should like a second interview with aunt eliza quite so soon i will lunch outside a lunch outside costs money and you are not very well provided in that way dont trouble yourself about that louisa i intend to be very economical my estimable sister is about as mean as anyone i know said warner to himself as he left the house between her and the old woman i dont think i shall find it very agreeable living here a cheap boarding house would be infinitely preferable on state street warner powell fell in with stephen webb an old acquaintance is it you warner asked webb in surprise its an age since i saw you so it is i havent been in chicago for five years i remember a little trouble wasnt there yes but im all right now except that i havent any money to speak of thats my situation exactly however ive got an old aunt worth a million more or less only she doesnt fully appreciate her nephew and i have an uncle pretty well to do who isnt so deeply impressed with my merits as i wish he were i am staying with my aunt just at present but hope to have independent quarters soon one trouble is she takes a fancy to a boy named luke walton luke walton repeated stephen in amazement do you know him yes my uncle has set me to spy on him why i havent been able to find out so he is in favor with your aunt yes he calls at the house every day and is in her employ sometimes she goes out shopping with him thats strange let us drop into the saratoga and compare notes they turned into dearborn street and sat down to lunch in the saratoga chapter xxvii uncle and nephew so this boy is an object of interest to your uncle resumed warner powell yes does he give any reason for his interest no except that he is inclined to help him when there is an opportunity does the boy know him no has he met your uncle yes uncle thomas frequently visits chicago he lives in milwaukee and stays at the sherman when he is here he has stopped and bought a paper of luke once or twice i remember my sister told me this boy luke was a newsboy how did he get in with your aunt i dont know i presume it was a chance acquaintance however that may be the young rascal seems to have got on her blind side and to be installed first favorite your sister doesnt like it not much between you and me louisa mrs tracy means to inherit all the old ladys property and doesnt like to have anyone come in even for a trifle shell have me left out in the cold if she can but i mean to have something to say to that in such matters you cant trust even your own sister i agree with you warner the two young men ate a hearty dinner and then adjourned to a billiard room where they spent the afternoon over the game warner reached home in time for supper where have you been warner asked mrs tracy looking for work was the answer what success did you meet with not much as yet i fell in with an old acquaintance who may assist me in that direction i am glad you have lost no time in seeking employment it will please aunt warner powell suppressed a smile he wondered what mrs merton would have thought could she have seen in what manner he prosecuted his search for employment this is harold said mrs tracy proudly as her son came in harold this is your uncle warner so you are harold said his uncle i remember you in short pants you have changed considerably in five years yes i suppose so answered harold curtly where have you been in australia california and so on how long are you going to stay in chicago that depends on whether i can find employment if you hear of a place let me know i dont know of any unless aunt eliza will take you into her employ in place of that newsboy luke walton she can have me if she will pay me enough salary how much does luke get i dont know he wont tell do you like him i dont consider him a fit associate for me he is a common newsboy does aunt eliza know that yes it makes no difference to her shes infatuated with him i wish she were infatuated with me i shall have to ask luke his secret aunt eliza doesnt prefer him to you does she i have no doubt she does shes very queer about some things harold said his mother solicitously i dont think you pay aunt eliza enough attention old persons you know like to receive courtesies i treat her politely dont i asked harold aggressively i cant be dancing attendance upon her and flattering her all the time from what i have seen of luke walton thought warner powell i should decidedly prefer him to this nephew of mine he seems conceited and disagreeable of course it wont do to tell louisa that for she evidently admires her graceless cub because he is hers are you intimate with this luke asked warner mischievously what do you take me for demanded harold of fended i am not in the habit of getting intimate with street boys warner powell laughed i am not so proud as you nephew harold he said travelers pick up strange companions in san francisco i became intimate with a chinaman you dont mean it exclaimed harold in incredulity and disgust yes i do you werent in the laundry business with him were you went on harold with a sneer no he answered aloud the laundry business may be a very good one i should like the income it produces even now but i dont think i have the necessary talent for it my chinese friend was a commission merchant worth at least a hundred thousand dollars i wasnt above borrowing money from him sometimes of course that makes a difference said mrs tracy desiring to make peace between her brother and son he must have been a superior man harold thought you meant a common chinaman such as we have in chicago the reunited family sat down to supper together after supper warner made an excuse for going out i have an engagement with a friend who knows of a position he thinks i can secure he said i hope you wont be late said mrs tracy no i presume not but you had better give me a pass key mrs tracy did so reluctantly she was afraid harold might want to join his uncle but the nephew was not taken with his new relative and made no such proposal in reality warner powell had made an engagement to go to mcvickers theater with his friend stephen webb who had arranged to meet him at the sherman house while waiting warner who had an excellent memory for faces recognized luke who was selling papers at his usual post there was some startling news in the evening papers a collision on lake michigan and luke had ordered an unusual supply which occupied him later than his ordinary hour he had taken a hasty supper at brockway milans foreseeing that he would not be home till late aunt elizas boy thought warner i may as well take this opportunity to cultivate his acquaintance he went up to luke and asked for a paper you dont remember me he said with a smile no answered luke looking puzzled i saw you on prairie avenue this morning mrs merton is my aunt i remember you now are you mrs tracys brother yes and the uncle of harold how do you and harold get along not at all he takes very little notice of me he is a snob being his uncle i take the liberty to say it there is no love lost between us luke said i would like to be more friendly but he treats me like an enemy he is jealous of your favor with my aunt there is no occasion for it he is a relative and i am only in her employ she thinks a good deal of you doesnt she she treats me very kindly harold suggested to me this evening at supper that i should take your place you neednt feel anxious i have no idea of doing so and she wouldnt have me if i had i think a man like you could do better i am willing to but here comes my friend who is going to the theater with me looking up luke was surprised to see stephen webb chapter xxviii harolds temptation mrs merton was rather astonished when her grandnephew harold walked into her room one day and inquired for her health she had been absent from the dinner table on account of a headache thank you harold she said i am feeling a little better have you any errand you would like to have me do for you mrs merton was still more surprised for offers of services were rare with harold thank you again she said but luke was here this morning and i gave him two or three commissions perhaps you would like me to read to you aunt eliza thank you but i am a little afraid it wouldnt be a good thing for my head how are you getting on at school harold pretty well you dont want to go to college no i think i would rather be a business man well you know your own tastes best aunt eliza said harold after a pause i want to ask a favor of you speak out harold wont you be kind enough to give me ten dollars ten dollars repeated the old lady eying harold closely why do you want ten dollars you see mother keeps me very close all the fellows have more money to spend than i how much does your mother give you as an allowance two dollars a week it seems to me that is liberal considering that you dont have to pay for your board or clothes a boy in my position is expected to spend money who expects it why everybody by the way what is your position asked the old lady pointedly why said harold uneasily i am supposed to be rich as i live in a nice neighborhood on a fashionable street that doesnt make you rich does it no answered harold with hesitation you dont feel absolutely obliged to spend more than your allowance do you well you see the fellows think i am mean if i dont theres ben clark has an allowance of five dollars a week and he is three months younger than i am then i think his parents or guardians are very unwise how does he spend his liberal allowance oh he has a good time i am afraid it isnt the sort of good time i would approve luke has more money than i have and he is only a newsboy grumbled harold how do you know i notice he always has money i doubt whether he spends half a dollar a week on his own amusement he has a mother and young brother to support he says so so you doubt it it may be true if you find it isnt true you can let me know i am sorry that you think so much more of luke than of me complained harold how do you know i do mother thinks so as well as i suppose we leave luke out of consideration i shall think as much of you as you deserve harold rose from his seat as you have no errand for me aunt eliza i will go he said mrs merton unlocked a drawer in a work table took out a pocketbook and extracted therefrom a tendollarbill you have asked me a favor and i will grant it for once she said here are ten dollars thank you said harold joyfully i wont even ask how you propose to spend it i thought of doing so but it would imply distrust and for this occasion i wont show any you are very kind aunt eliza i am glad you think so you are welcome to the money harold left the room in high spirits he decided not to let his mother know that he had received so large a sum as she might inquire to what use he intended to put it and some of his expenditures he felt pretty sure would not be approved by her he left the house and going downtown joined a couple of friends of his own stamp they adjourned to a billiard saloon and between billiards bets upon the game and drinks harold managed to spend three dollars before suppertime three days later the entire sum given him by his aunt was gone when harold made the discovery he sighed his dream was over it had been pleasant as long as it lasted but it was over too soon now i must go back to my mean allowance he said to himself in a discontented tone aunt eliza might give me ten dollars every week just as well as not she is positively rolling in wealth while i have to grub along like a newsboy why that fellow luke has a great deal more money than i a little conversation which he had with his uncle warner made his discontent more intense hello harold what makes you look so blue he asked one day because i havent got any money answered harold doesnt your mother or aunt eliza give you any i get a little but it isnt as much as the other fellows get how much two dollars a week it is more than i had when i was of your age that doesnt make it any better aunt eliza isnt exactly lavish still she pays luke walton generously do you know how much he gets a week asked harold eagerly ten dollars ten dollars ejaculated harold you dont really mean it yes i do i saw her pay him that sum yesterday i asked her if it wasnt liberal she admitted it but said he had a mother and brother to support its a shame cried harold passionately why is it the money is her own isnt it she ought not to treat a stranger better than her own nephew that means me i judge said warner smiling well there isnt anything we can do about it is there no i dont know as there is replied harold slowly but he thought over what his uncle had told him and it made him very bitter he brooded over it till it seemed to him as if it were a great outrage he felt that he was treated with the greatest injustice he was incensed with his aunt but still more so with luke walton whom he looked upon as an artful adventurer it was while he was cherishing these feelings that a great temptation came to him he found one day in the street a bunch of keys of various sizes attached to a small steel ring he picked it up and quick as a flash there came to him the thought of the drawer in his aunts work table from which he had seen her take out the morocco pocketbook he had observed that the tendollar bill she gave him was only one out of a large roll and his cupidity was aroused he rapidly concocted a scheme by which he would be enabled to provide himself with money and throw suspicion upon luke chapter xxix harolds theft the next morning mrs merton escorted by luke went to make some purchases in the city mrs tracy went out also having an engagement with one of her friends living on cottage grove avenue harold went out directly after breakfast but returned at halfpast ten he went upstairs and satisfied himself that except the servants he was alone in the house the coast is clear he said joyfully now if the key only fits he went to his aunts sitting room and not anticipating any interruption directed his steps a once to the small table from a drawer in which he had seen mrs merton take the morocco pocketbook he tried one key after another and finally succeeded in opening the drawer he drew it out with nervous anxiety fearing that the pocketbook might have been removed in which case all his work would have been thrown away but no fortune favored him this time if it can be called a favor there in plain sight was the morocco pocketbook harold pale with excitement seized and opened it his eyes glistened as he saw that it was well filled he took out the roll of bills and counted them there were five tendollar bills and three fives sixtyfive dollars in all there would have been more but mrs merton before going out had taken four fives which she intended to use it was harolds first theft and he trembled with agitation as he thrust the pocketbook into his pocket he would have trembled still more if he had known that his mothers confidential maid and seamstress felicie lacouvreur had seen everything through the crevice formed by the halfopen door felicie smiled to herself as she moved noiselessly away from her post of concealment master harold is trying a dangerous experiment she said to herself now he is in my power he has been insolent to me more than once as if he were made of superior clay but felicie though only a poor servant is not thank heaven a thief as he is it is a very interesting drama i shall wait patiently till it is quite played out in his hurry harold came near leaving the room with the table drawer open but he bethought himself in time went back and locked it securely it was like shutting the stable door after the horse was stolen then with the stolen money in his possession he left the house he did not wish to be found at home when his aunt returned harold had sixtyfive dollars in his pocket an amount quite beyond what he had ever before had at his disposal but it must be admitted that he did not feel as happy as he had expected if he had come by it honestly if for instance it had been given him his heart would have beat high with exultation but as it was he walked along with clouded brow presently he ran across one of his friends who noticed his discomposure whats the matter harold he asked you are in the dumps oh no answered harold forcing himself to assume a more cheerful aspect i have no reason to feel blue you are only acting then i must congratulate you on your success you look for all the world like the knight of the sorrowful countenance who is he asked harold who was not literary don quixote did you never hear of him no then your education has been neglected what are you going to do today i dont know suppose we visit a dime museum all right that is if you have any money i am high and dry yes i have some money they went to a dime museum on clark street harold surprised his companion by paying for the two tickets out of a fivedollar bill youre flush harold said his friend has anybody left you a fortune no answered harold uneasily ive been saving up money lately you have why ive heard of your being at theaters playing billiards and so on look here robert greve i dont see why you need trouble yourself so much about where i get my money dont be cranky harold said robert goodhumoredly i wont say another word only i am glad to find my friends in a healthy financial condition i only wish i could say the same of myself there happened to be a matinee at the grand opera house and harold proposed going first however they took a nice lunch at brockway milans a mammoth restaurant on clark street harold paying the bill as they came out of the theater luke walton chanced to pass goodafternoon harold he said harold tossed his head but did not reply who is that boy one of your acquaintances asked robert greve he works for my aunt answered harold it is like his impudence to speak to me why shouldnt he speak to you if you know him said robert greve who did not share harolds foolish pride he appears to think he is my equal continued harold he seems a nice boy you dont know him as i do he is a common newsboy suppose he is that doesnt hurt him does it you dont know what i mean you dont think a common newsboy fit to associate with on equal terms do you robert greve laughed you are too hightoned harold he said if he is a nice boy i dont care what sort of business a friend of mine follows well i do snapped harold and so does my mother i dont believe in being friends with the ragtag and bobtail of society luke walton did not allow his feelings to be hurt by the decided rebuff he had received from harold i owe it to myself to act like a gentleman he reflected if harold doesnt choose to be polite it is his lookout not mine he looks down upon me because i am a working boy i dont mean always to be a newsboy or an errand boy i shall work my way upwards as fast as i can and in time i may come to fill a good place in society it will be seen that luke was ambitious he looked above and beyond the present and determined to improve his social condition it was six oclock when harold ascended the steps of the mansion on prairie avenue he had devoted the day to amusement but had derived very little pleasure from the money he had expended he had very little left of the fivedollar bill which he had first changed at the dime museum it was not easy to say where his money had gone but it had melted away in one shape or another i wonder whether aunt eliza has discovered her loss thought harold i hope i shant show any signs of nervousness when i meet her i dont see how she can possibly suspect me if anything is said about the lost pocketbook i will try to throw suspicion on luke walton harold did not stop to think how mean this would be selfpreservation it has been said is the first law of nature and selfpreservation required that he should avert suspicion from himself by any means in his power he went into the house whistling as if to show that his mind was quite free from care in the hall he met felicie what do you think has happened master harold asked the french maid i dont know im sure your aunt has been robbed some money has been taken from her room chapter xxx luke walton is suspected of theft harold was prepared for the announcement as he felt confident his aunt would soon discover her loss but he felt a little nervous nevertheless you dont mean it he ejaculated in wellcounterfeited surprise its a fact when did aunt eliza discover her loss felicie as soon as she got home she went to her drawer to put back some money she had on hand and found the pocketbook gone was there much money in it she doesnt say how much well said harold thinking it time to carry on the programme he had determined upon i cant say i am surprised you are not surprised repeated felicie slowly why do you know anything about it do i know anything about it said harold coloring what do you mean by that because you say you are not surprised i was surprised and so was the old lady and your mother you must be very stupid not to understand what i mean said harold annoyed then i am very stupid for i do not know at all why you are not surprised i mean that the boy aunt eliza employs that boy luke has taken the money oh you think the boy luke has taken the money certainly why shouldnt he he is a poor newsboy it would be a great temptation to him you know he is always shown into aunt elizas sitting room and is often there alone that is true and of course nothing is more natural than that he should take the money but the drawer was locked he had some keys in his pocket very likely most boys have keys oh most boys have keys have you perhaps keys master harold it seems to me you are asking very foolish questions felicie i have the key of my trunk but do newsboys have trunks why should this boy luke have keys i do not see well ill go upstairs said harold who was getting tired of the interview and rather uneasy at felicies remarks and questions as felicie had said mrs merton discovered her loss almost as soon as she came home she had used but a small part of the money he took with her and not caring to carry it about with her opened the drawer to replace it in the pocketbook to her surprise the pocketbook had disappeared now the contents of the pocketbook though a very respectable sum were not sufficient to put mrs merton to any inconvenience still no one likes to lose money especially if there is reason to believe that it has been stolen and mrs merton felt annoyed she drew out the drawer to its full extent and examined it carefully in every part but there was no trace of the morocco pocketbook she locked the door and went downstairs to her niece whats the matter aunt eliza asked mrs tracy seeing at a glance from her aunts expression that some thing had happened there is a thief in the house said the old lady abruptly what there is a thief in the house what makes you think so you remember my small work table yes i have been in the habit of keeping a supply of money in a pocketbook in one of the drawers i just opened the drawer and the money is gone was there much money in the pocketbook i happen to know just how much there were sixtyfive dollars and you can find nothing of the pocketbook no that and the money are both gone i am sorry for your loss aunt eliza i dont care for the money i shall not miss it i am amply provided with funds thanks to providence but it is the mystery that puzzles me who can have robbed me mrs tracy nodded her head significantly i dont think there need be any mystery about that she said pointedly why not i can guess who robbed you then i should be glad to have you enlighten me for i am quite at a loss to fix upon the thief its that boy of yours i havent a doubt of it you mean luke walton yes the newsboy whom you have so imprudently trusted what are your reasons for thinking he is a thief asked the old lady calmly he is often alone in the room where the work table stands is he not yes he waits for me there what could be easier than for him to open the drawer and abstract the pocketbook it would be possible but he would have to unlock the drawer probably he took an impression of the lock some day and had a key made you are giving him credit for an unusual amount of cunning i always supposed he was sly i am aware louisa that you never liked the boy i admit that what has happened seems to show that i was right now you are jumping to conclusions you decide without any proof or even investigation that luke took the money i feel convinced of it it appears to me that you are not treating the boy fairly my instinct tells me that it is he who has robbed you instinct would have no weight in law if he didnt take it who did asked mrs tracy triumphantly that question is not easy to answer louisa i am glad you admit so much aunt eliza i admit nothing but i will think over the matter carefully and investigate do so aunt eliza in the end you will agree with me in the meanwhile louisa there is one thing i must insist upon what is that that you leave the matter wholly in my hands certainly if you wish it there are some circumstances connected with the robbery which i have not mentioned what are they asked mrs tracy her face expressing curiosity i shall keep them to myself for the present mrs tracy looked disappointed if you mention them to me i may think of something that would help you if i need help in that way i will come to you meanwhile shall you continue to employ the boy yes why not he might steal something more i will risk it mrs merton returned to her room and presently harold entered his mothers presence what is this i hear about aunt eliza having some money stolen he asked it is true she has lost sixtyfive dollars felicie told me something about it that it was taken out of her drawer mrs tracy went into particulars unconscious that her son was better informed than herself does aunt suspect anyone asked harold uneasily she doesnt but i do who is it that boy luke walton the very one i thought of said harold eagerly did you mention him to aunt eliza yes but she is so infatuated with him that she didnt take the suggestion kindly she has promised to investigate however and meanwhile doesnt want us to interfere things are working round as i want them thought harold chapter xxxi who stole the money did mrs merton suspect anyone of the theft this is the question which will naturally suggest itself to the reader no thought of the real thief entered her mind though she was fully sensible of harolds faults though she knew him to be selfish badtempered and envious she did not suppose him capable of theft the one who occurred to her as most likely to have robbed her was her recently returned nephew warner powell who had been compelled to leave chicago years before on account of having yielded to a similar temptation she knew that he was hard up for money and it was possible that he had opened the table drawer and abstracted the pocketbook as to luke walton she was not at all affected by the insinuations of her niece she knew that mrs tracy and harold had a prejudice against luke and that this would make them ready to believe anything against him she was curious however to hear what warner had to say about the robbery would he too try to throw suspicion upon luke in order to screen himself if he were the real thief this remained to be proved warner powell did not return to the house till five oclock in the afternoon his sister and harold hastened to inform him of what had happened and to communicate their conviction that luke was the thief warner said little but his own suspicions were different he went up stairs and made his aunt a call well aunt he said i hear that you have been robbed yes warner i have lost some money answered the old lady composedly louisa told me yes she suspects luke of being the thief do you agree with her no i dont answered warner mrs mertons face brightened and she looked kindly at warner then you dont share louisas prejudice against luke she said no i like the boy i would sooner suspect myself of stealing the money for you know aunt eliza that my record is not a good one and i am sure luke is an honest boy mrs mertons face fairly beamed with delight she understood very well the low and unworthy motives which influenced her niece and harold and it was a gratifying surprise to find that her nephew was free from envy and jealousy warner she said what you say does you credit in this particular case i happen to know that luke is innocent you dont know the real thief asked warner no but my reason for knowing that luke is innocent i will tell you the money was safe in my drawer when i went out this morning it was taken during my absence from the house luke was with me during this whole time of course it is impossible that he should be the thief i see did you tell louisa this no i am biding my time besides i am more likely to find the real thief if it is supposed that luke is under suspicion tell me truly aunt eliza didnt you suspect me since you ask me warner i will tell you frankly that it occurred to me as possible that you might have yielded to temptation it would have been a temptation for i have but twentyfive cents but even if i had known where you kept your money which i didnt i would have risked applying to you for a loan or gift as it would have turned out to be rather than fall back into my old disreputable ways i am very much encouraged by what you say warner here are ten dollars use it judiciously try to obtain employment and when it is gone you may let me know aunt eliza you are kinder to me than i deserve i will make a real effort to secure employment and will not abuse your confidence keep that promise warner and i will be your friend one thing more dont tell louisa what has passed between us i can at any time clear luke but for the present i will let her think i am uncertain on that point i shall not forget that you took the boys part where your sister condemned him louisa and harold can see no good in the boy but i have observed him carefully and formed my own opinion warner could have done nothing better calculated to win his aunts favor than to express a favorable opinion of luke it must be said however in justice to him that this had not entered into his calculations he really felt kindly towards the boy whom his sister denounced as sly and artful and liked him much better than his own nephew harold who looking upon warner as a poor relation had not thought it necessary to treat him with much respect or attention he had a better heart and a better disposition than mrs tracy or harold notwithstanding his early shortcomings who could have been the thief warner asked himself as he left his aunts sitting room could it have been harold he resolved to watch his nephew carefully and seek some clew that would lead to a solution of the mystery i hope it isnt my nephew he said to himself i dont want him to follow in the steps of his scapegrace uncle but i would sooner suspect him than luke walton they say blood is thicker than water but i confess that i like the newsboy better than i do my hightoned nephew have you made any discovery of the thief aunt eliza asked mrs tracy as her aunt seated herself at the evening repast nothing positive answered the old lady significantly have you discovered anything at all i have discovered who is not the thief said mrs merton then you had suspicions no definite suspicions wouldnt it be well to talk the matter freely over with me something might be suggested i beg your pardon louisa but i think it would be well to banish this disagreeable matter from our table talk if i should stand in need of advice i will consult you i dont want to obtrude my advice but i will venture to suggest that you call in a private detective harold looked alarmed i wouldnt bother with a detective he said they dont know half as much as they pretend i am inclined to agree with harold said mrs merton i will act as my own detective save for the compliment to harold mrs tracy was not pleased with this speech of her aunt at any rate she said you would do well to keep a strict watch over that boy luke walton i shall answered the old lady simply mrs tracy looked triumphant warner kept silent but a transient smile passed over his face as he saw how neatly aunt eliza had deceived his astute sister what do you think warner asked mrs tracy desirous of additional support i think aunt eliza will get at the truth sooner or later of course i will do anything to help her but i dont want to interfere dont you think she ought to discharge luke if she did she would have no chance of finding out whether he was guilty or not that is true i did not think of that warner is more sensible than any of you said mrs merton i am glad you have changed your opinion of him said mrs tracy sharply she was now beginning to be jealous of her scapegrace brother so am i said warner smiling at the same time i dont blame aunt for her former opinion the next morning harold was about leaving the house when felicie the french maid came up softly and said master harold may i have a word with you i am in a hurry said harold impatiently it is about the stolen money continued felicie in her soft voice you had better listen to what i have to say i have found out who took it harolds heart gave a sudden thump and his face indicated dismay chapter xxxii harold and felicie make an arrangement you have found out who took the money stammered harold yes i didnt think it would be found out so soon said harold trying to recover his equanimity of course it was taken by luke walton you are quite mistaken said felicie luke walton did not take it harolds heart gave another thump he scented danger but remained silent you dont ask me who took the money said felicie after a pause because i dont believe you know returned harold youve probably got some suspicion i have more than that the person who took the money was seen at his work harold turned pale there is no use in mincing matters continued felicie you took the money what do you mean by such impertinence gasped harold it is no impertinence if you doubt my knowledge ill tell you the particulars you opened the drawer with one of a bunch of keys which you took from your pocket took out a morocco pocketbook opened it and counted the roll of bills which it contained then put the pocketbook into your pocket locked the drawer and left the room thats a fine story said harold forcing himself to speak i dare say all this happened only you were the one who opened the drawer i saw it all through a crack in the halfopen door continued felicie not taking the trouble to answer his accusation if you want further proof suppose you feel in your pocket i presume the pocketbook is there at this moment instinctively harold put his hand into his pocket then suddenly withdrew it as if his fingers were burned for the pocketbook was there as felicie had said there is one thing more said felicie as she drew from her pocket a bunch of keys i found this bunch of keys in your room this morning they are not mine answered harold hastily i dont know anything about that they are the ones you had in your hand when you opened the drawer i think this is the key you used the keys belong to you asserted harold desperately thank you for giving them to me but i shall have no use for them said felicie coolly and now master harold do you want to know why i have told you this little story yes answered harold feebly because i think it will be for our mutual advantage to come to an understanding i dont want to inform your aunt of what i have seen unless you compel me to do so how should i compel you to do so stammered harold uneasily step into the parlor where we can talk comfortably your aunt is upstairs and your mother is out so that no one will hear us harold felt that he was in the power of the cunning felicie and he followed her unresistingly sit down on the sofa and we will talk at our ease i will keep silent about this matter and no one else knows a word about it if well if you will give me half the money but said harold who now gave up the pretense of denial i have spent part of it you have more than half of it left yes give me thirty dollars and i will be content i saw you count it there were sixtyfive dollars i dont see what claim you have to it said harold angrily i have as much as you answered felicie coolly still if you prefer to go to your aunt own up that you took it and take the consequences i will agree not to interfere but if i am to keep the secret i want to be paid for it harold thought it over he hated to give up so large a part of his plunder for he had appropriated it in his own mind to certain articles which he wished to purchase ill give you twenty dollars he said no i will take thirty dollars or go to your aunt and tell her all i know there was no help for it poor harold took out three tendollar bills reluctantly enough and gave them to felicie all right master harold youve done wisely i thought you would see matters in the right light think how shocked your mother and aunt eliza would be if they had discovered that you were the thief dont use such language felicie said harold wincing there is no need to refer to it again as you say master harold i wont detain you any longer from your walk and felicie with a smile rose from the sofa and left the room harold following dont disturb yourself any more she said as she opened the door for harold it will never be known besides your aunt can well afford to lose this little sum she is actually rolling in wealth she ought to be more liberal to you so she ought felicie if she had this would not have happened very true at the same time i dont suppose a jury would accept this as an excuse why do you say such things felicie what has a jury got to do with me nothing i hope still if it were a poor boy that had taken the money luke walton for instance he might have been arrested excuse me i see this annoys you let me give you one piece of advice master harold what is it get rid of that morocco pocketbook as soon as you can if it were found on you or you should be careless and leave it anywhere you would give yourself away my friend you are right felicie said harold hurriedly goodmorning goodmorning and a pleasant walk my friend said felicie mockingly when harold was fairly out in the street he groaned in spirit he had lost half the fruits of his theft and his secret had become known felicie had proved too much for him and he felt that he hated her i wish i could get mother to discharge her with out her knowing that it was i who had brought it about i shall not feel safe as long as she is in the house why didnt i have the sense to shut and lock the door then she wouldnt have seen me then the thought of the morocco pocketbook occurred to him he felt that felicie was right that it was imprudent to carry it around he must get rid of it in some way he took the money out and put it in another pocket the pocketbook he replaced till he should have an opportunity of disposing of it hardly had he made these preparations when he met luke walton who had started unusually early and was walking towards the house an idea came to harold goodmorning luke he said in an unusually friendly tone goodmorning harold answered luke agreeably surprised by the others cordiality are you going out with aunt eliza this morning i am not sure whether she will want to go out i shall call and inquire you seem to be quite a favorite of hers i hope i am she always treats me kindly i really believe she thinks more of you than she does of me you mustnt think that said luke modestly you are a relation and i am only in her employ oh it doesnt trouble me i am bound for the city i think i shall take the next car goodday goodday harold luke walked on quite unconscious that harold as he passed by his side had managed to slip the morocco wallet into the pocket of his sack coat chapter xxxiii harolds plot fails luke wore a sack coat with side pockets it was this circumstance that had made it easy for harold to transfer the wallet unsuspected to his pocket quite ignorant of what had taken place luke kept on his way to mrs mertons house he rang the bell and on being admitted went up as usual to the room of his patroness good morning luke said mrs merton pleasantly goodmorning responded luke i dont think i shall go out this morning and i dont think of any commission so you will have a vacation i am afraid i am not earning my money mrs merton you make it very easy for me at any rate luke the money is cheerfully given and i have no doubt you find it useful how are you getting along very well indeed i have just made the last payment on mothers machine and now we owe nothing except perhaps for the rent and only a week has gone by on the new month you seem to be a good manager luke you succeed in keeping your money while i have not always found it easy yesterday for instance i lost sixtyfive dollars how was that inquired luke with interest the drawer in which i keep a pocketbook was unlocked and this with its contents was stolen dont you suspect anyone i did but he has cleared himself in my opinion it is possible it was one of the servants at this moment luke pulled his handkerchief from his side pocket and with it came the morocco pocketbook which fell on the carpet mrs merton uttered an exclamation of surprise why that is the very pocketbook she said luke stooped and picked it up with an expression of bewilderment on his face i dont understand it he said i never saw that pocketbook before in my life please hand it to me luke did so yes that is the identical pocketbook said the old lady and it came from my pocket yes is there any money in it mrs merton mrs merton opened it and shook her head that has been taken out she answered i hope you wont think i took the money said luke with a troubled look i know you did not it was taken while we were out together yesterday the last thing before i left the house i locked the drawer and the pocketbook with the money inside was there when i returned it was gone that is very mysterious i dont understand how the pocketbook came in my pocket someone must have put it there who wished you to be suspected of the theft yes said luke eagerly i see then he stopped suddenly for what he was about to say would throw suspicion upon harold well go on i dont know that i ought to speak it might throw suspicion on an innocent person speak it is due to me i will judge on that point who has had the chance of putting the wallet into your pocket i will speak if you insist upon it mrs merton said luke reluctantly a few minutes since i met harold on the street we were bound in opposite directions he surprised me by stopping me and addressing me quite cordially we stood talking together two or three minutes did he have an opportunity of putting the wallet in your pocket he might have done so but i was not conscious of it let me think said the old lady slowly harold knew where i kept my money for i opened the drawer in his presence the other day and he saw me take a bill from the pocketbook i did not think him capable of robbing me perhaps he did not said luke it may be explained in some other way can you think of any other way asked the old lady suppose a servant had taken the money and left the pocketbook somewhere where harold found it even in that case why should he put it in your pocket he does not like me he might wish to throw suspicion upon me that would be very mean i think it would but still he might not be a thief i would sooner excuse a thief it is certainly disreputable to steal but it is not necessarily mean or contemptible trying to throw suspicion on an innocent person would be both luke remained silent for nothing occurred to him to say he did not wish to add to mrs mertons resentment against harold after a moments thought the old lady continued leave the pocketbook with me and say nothing about what has happened till i give you leave very well mrs merton took the pocketbook replaced it in the drawer and carefully locked it someone must have a key that will open this drawer she said i should like to know who it is do you think anyone will open it again asked luke no it will be supposed that i will no longer keep money there i think however i will sooner or later find out who opened it i hope it wont prove to be harold i hope so too i would not like to think so near a relative a thief well luke i wont detain you here any longer you may come tomorrow as usual it is lucky mrs merton has confidence in me thought luke otherwise she might have supposed me to be the thief what a mean fellow harold tracy is to try to have an innocent boy suspected of such a crime as he was going out of the front door mrs tracy entered she cast a withering glance at luke have you seen my aunt this morning she asked yes madam i wonder you had the face to stand in her presence it must be said in justification of mrs tracy that she really believed that luke had stolen mrs mertons money i know of no reason why i should not said luke calmly will you be kind enough to explain what you mean you know well enough retorted mrs tracy nodding her head venomously mrs merton appears to be well satisfied with me said luke quietly when she is not she will tell me so and i shall never come again you are the most brazen boy i know of why it is that my aunt is so infatuated with you i cant for my part pretend to understand if you will allow me i will bid you goodmorning said luke with quiet dignity mrs tracy did not reply and luke left the house if i ever hated and despised a boy it is that one said mrs tracy to herself as she went upstairs to remove her street dress i wish i could strip the mask from him and get aunt to see him in his real character he is a sly artful young adventurer ah felicie come and assist me by the way i want you to watch that boy who has just gone out luke walton yes of course you have heard of my aunts loss i suspect that this luke walton is the thief is it possible madam have you any evidence no but we may find some what do you think i havent thought much about the matter it seems to me very mysterious when felicie left the presence of her mistress she smiled curiously what would madam tracy say if she knew it was her own son she soliloquized he is a young cur but she thinks him an angel chapter xxxiv harold makes a purchase harold had been compelled to give up half his money but he still had thirty dollars left how should he invest it that was the problem that occupied his thoughts thus far he had not derived so much satisfaction from the possession of the money as he had anticipated one thing at any rate he resolved he would not spend it upon others but wholly upon himself he stepped into a billiard saloon to enjoy his favorite pastime in the absence of any companion he played a game with a man employed in the establishment and naturally got beaten though he was given odds at the end of an hour he owed sixty cents and decided not to continue you play too well for me he said in a tone of disappointment you had bad luck answered his opponent soothingly however i can more than make it up to you how inquired harold becoming interested a friend of mine has pawned his watch for fifteen dollars it is a valuable gold watch cost seventyfive he could have got more on it but expected to redeem it he has been in bad luck and finds it no use he has put the ticket in my hands and is willing to sell it for ten dollars that will only make the watch cost twentyfive its a big bargain for somebody harold was much interested he had always wanted a gold watch and had dropped more than one hint to that effect within the hearing of aunt eliza but the old lady had always said when you are eighteen it will be time enough to think of a gold watch till then your silver watch will do harold took a different view of the matter and his desire for a gold watch had greatly increased since a school friend about his own age had one for this reason he was considerably excited by the chance that seems to present itself you are sure the watch is a valuable one he asked yes i have seen it myself then why dont you buy the ticket yourself i havent the money if i had i wouldnt let anybody else have it let me see the ticket the other produced it from his vest pocket but of course this threw no light upon the quality of the watch i can secure the watch and have nearly five dollars left thought harold it is surely worth double the price it will cost me and then i shall have something to show for my money on the other hand his possession of the watch would excite surprise at home and he would be called upon to explain how he obtained it this however did not trouble harold ive a great mind to take it he said slowly you cant do any better to tell the truth i hate to let it go but i dont see any prospect of my being able to get it out myself and my friend needs the money harold hesitated a moment then yielded to the inducement offered give me the ticket he said here is the money as he spoke he produced a tendollar bill in return the ticket was handed to him the pawnbroker whose name was found on the ticket was located less than fifteen minutes walk from the billiard saloon harold eager to secure the watch went directly there well young man what can i do for you asked a small man with wrinkled face and blinking eyes i want to redeem my watch here is the ticket the old man glanced at the ticket then went to a safe and took out the watch here were kept the articles of small bulk and large value harold took out fifteen dollars which he had put in his vest pocket for the purpose and tendered them to the pawnbroker i want a dollar and a half more said the old man what for asked harold in surprise one months interest you dont think i do business for nothing do you isnt that high asked harold and not without reason its our regular charge young man ten per cent a month thats what we all charge this statement was correct though the new york pawnbroker is allowed to charge but three per cent a month his chicago associate charges more than three times as much there was nothing for it but to comply with the terms demanded and harold reluctantly handed out the extra sum you ought to have a watch chain my friend said the pawnbroker i should like one but i cannot afford it i can give you a superior article rolled gold for a dollar let me see it the chain was displayed it looked very well and certainly set off the watch to better advantage harold paid down the dollar and went out of the pawn brokers with a gold watch and chain of the same color with only two dollars left of his illgotten money this was somewhat inconvenient but he rejoiced in the possession of the watch and chain now ralph kennedy cant crow over me he soliloquized ive got a gold watch as well as he as he left the pawnbrokers he did not observe a familiar face and figure on the opposite side of the street it was warner powell his mothers brother who recognized with no little surprise his nephew coming from such a place what on earth has carried harold to a pawn brokers he asked himself then he caught sight of the watch chain and got a view of the watch as harold drew it out ostentatiously to view his new acquisition there is some mystery here he said to himself i must investigate he waited till harold was at a safe distance then crossed the street and entered the pawnbrokers there was a boy just went out of here he said to the old man suppose there was returned the pawnbroker suspiciously what was he doing here is that any of your business my friend i have nothing to do with you and no complaint to make against you but the boy is my nephew and i want to know whether he got a watch and chain here yes he presented a ticket and i gave him the watch is it one he pawned himself i dont know he had the ticket i cant remember everybody that deals with me can you tell me how much the watch and chain were pawned for the watch was pawned for fifteen dollars i sold him the chain for a dollar all right thank you its all right yes so far as you are concerned how long had the watch been in for three weeks warner powell left the shop after obtaining all the information he required it is harold who robbed aunt eliza he said to himself i begin to think my precious nephew is a rogue meanwhile harold eager to ascertain the value of his watch stepped into a jewelers can you tell me the value of this watch he inquired the jeweler opened it and after a brief examination said when new it probably cost thirtyfive dollars harolds countenance fell i was told that it was a seventyfive dollar watch he said then you were cheated but how can such a large watch be afforded for thirtyfive dollars it is lowgrade gold not over ten carats and the works are cheap yet itll keep fair time harold was very much disappointed chapter xxxv a skillful invention when he came to think it over harold gradually recovered his complacence it was a gold watch after all and no one would know that the gold was low grade he met one or two acquaintances who immediately took notice of the chain and asked to see the watch they complimented him on it and this gave him satisfaction when he reached home he went directly upstairs to his room and only came down when he heard the supper bell as he entered the dining room his mother was the first to notice the watch chain have you been buying a watch chain harold she asked i have something besides said harold and he produced the watch mrs tracy uttered an exclamation of surprise and mrs merton and warner exchanged significant glances how came you by the watch and chain asked mrs tracy uneasily they were given to me answered harold but that is very strange aunt eliza you have not given harold a watch have you no louisa i think a silver watch is good enough for a boy of his age why dont you ask me louisa said warner smiling i dont imagine your circumstances will admit of such a gift you are right i wish they did harold we are all anxious to know the name of the benevolent individual who has made you such a handsome present if you think he has any more to spare i should be glad if you would introduce me i will explain said harold glibly i was walking along dearborn street about two oclock when i saw a gentleman a little in advance of me he had come from the commercial bank i judge for it was not far from there i came across him by some carelessness he twitched a wallet stuffed with notes from his pocket a roughlooking fellow sprang to get it but i was too quick for him i picked it up and hurrying forward handed it to the gentleman he seemed surprised and pleased my boy he said you have done me a great service that wallet contained fifteen hundred dollars i should have lost it but for you accept this watch and chain as a mark of my deep gratitude with that he took the watch from his pocket and handed it to me i was not sure whether i ought to take it but i have long wanted a gold watch and he seemed well able to afford the gift so i took it mrs tracy never thought of doubting this plausible story harold she said i am proud of you i think there was no objection to accepting the watch what do you say aunt eliza let me look at the watch harold said the old lady not replying to her nieces question harold passed it over complacently he rather plumed himself on the ingenious story he had invented what do you think of it warner asked mrs merton passing it to her nephew it is rather a cheap watch for a rich man to carry answered warner taking it in his hand and opening it i am sure it is quite a handsome watch said mrs tracy yes it is large and showy but it is lowgrade gold of course i dont know anything about that said harold at any rate it is gold and good enough for me no doubt of that said the old lady dryly rich men dont always carry expensive watches said mrs tracy they are often plain in their tastes this watch is rather showy said warner it cant be called plain at any rate harold has reason to be satisfied i am glad he obtained the watch in so creditable a manner if it had been your protege aunt eliza i suspect he would have kept the money i dont think so louisa said mrs merton quietly i have perfect confidence in lukes honesty in spite of your lost pocketbook yes there is nothing to connect luke with that harold thought he ought to get the advantage of the trick played upon luke in the morning i dont know as i ought to say anything he said hesitating but i met luke this morning and if i am not very much mistaken i saw in his pocket a wallet that looked very much like aunts you know he wears a sack coat and has a pocket on each side again mrs merton and warner exchanged glances this is important said mrs tracy in excitement did you speak to him on the subject no why not i thought he might be innocent and i didnt want to bring a false charge against him you are very considerate said mrs merton that seems quite conclusive aunt eliza said mrs tracy triumphantly i am sure warner will agree with me as to that louisa said her brother harold is not certain it was aunts lost pocketbook but he thinks it was yes i think it was for my own part i have no doubt on the subject said mrs tracy in a positive tone he is the person most likely to take the money and this makes less proof needful but suppose after all he is innocent suggested warner you seem to take the boys side warner i am surprised at you i want him to have a fair chance that is all i must say that i have been favorably impressed by what i have seen of the boy at any rate i think aunt eliza ought to question him sternly not accepting any evasion or equivocation he has been guilty of base ingratitude supposing him to be guilty yes of course i intend to investigate the matter said the old lady what do you think harold do you think it probable that luke opened my drawer and took out the pocketbook it looks very much like it said harold certainly it does said mrs tracy with emphasis suppose we drop the conversation for the time being suggested the old lady harold has not wholly gratified our curiosity as to the watch and chain do you know harold who the gentleman is to whom you rendered such an important service no aunt eliza i did not learn his name what was his appearance describe him he was a tall man answered harold in a tone of hesitation was he an old or a young man he was an old man with gray hair he walked very erect should you know him again if you saw him yes i think so then perhaps we may have an opportunity of ascertaining who he was my broker will probably know him from your description why do you want to find out who he is asked harold uneasily dont you think i ought to keep the watch i have a feeling of curiosity on the subject as to keeping it i dont think the gentleman will be likely to reclaim it of course not why should he said mrs tracy he gave it freely and it would be very strange if he wished it back here the conversation dropped much to harolds relief warner accompanied his aunt from the room what do you think of harolds story warner asked the old lady it is very ingenious but not true no he got the watch and chain from a pawnbroker i saw him come out of the shop and going in questioned the pawnbroker he must have got the ticket somewhere then it seems that harold is not only a thief but a liar my dear aunt let us not be too hard upon him this is probably his first offense i feel like being charitable for i have been in the same scrape i can overlook theft more easily than his attempt to blacken the reputation of luke said mrs merton sternly chapter xxxvi warner powell starts on a journey thanks to the liberal compensation received from mrs merton luke was enabled to supply his mother and bennie with all the comforts they required and even to put by two dollars a week this he did as a measure of precaution for he did not know how long the engagement at the house on prairie avenue would last if he were forced to fall back on his earnings as a newsboy the family would fare badly this might happen for he found himself no nearer securing the favor of harold and his mother the manner of the latter was particularly unpleasant when they met and harold scarcely deigned to speak to him on the other hand warner powell showed himself very friendly he often took the opportunity to join luke when he was leaving the house and chat pleasantly with him luke enjoyed his companionship because warner was able to tell him about australia and california with both of which countries mrs tracys brother was familiar mother said harold one day uncle warner seems very thick with that newsboy i have several times seen them walking together mrs tracy frowned for the news displeased her i am certainly very much surprised i should think my brother might find a more congenial and suitable companion than aunt elizas hired boy i will speak to him about it she accordingly broached the subject to warner powell expressing herself with emphasis listen louisa said warner dont you think i am old enough to choose my own company it doesnt seem so retorted mrs tracy with a smile at any rate i dont need any instructions on that point as my guest you certainly ought to treat me with respect so i do but i dont feel bound to let you regulate my conduct you know what cause i have we both have to dislike this boy i dont dislike him then you ought to he is in aunt elizas employment while he remains so i shall treat him with cordiality you are blind as a mole said mrs tracy passionately you cant see that he is trying to work his way into aunts affections i think he has done so already she thinks a great deal of him when you find her remembering him in her will you may come over to my opinion she is quite at liberty to remember him in her will so far as i am concerned there will be enough for us even if she does leave luke a legacy i see you are incorrigible i am sorry i invited you to remain in my house i was under the impression that it was aunt elizas house you are claiming too much louisa mrs tracy bit her lip and was compelled to give up her attempt to secure her brothers allegiance she contented herself with treating him with formal politeness abstaining from all show of cordiality this was carried on so far that it attracted the attention of mrs merton what is the trouble between you and louisa she asked one day warner laughed she thinks i am too intimate with your boy luke i dont understand i often walk with luke either on his way to or from the house harold has reported this to his mother and the result is a lecture as to the choice of proper companions from my dignified sister mrs merton smiled kindly on her nephew then you dont propose to give up luke she said no i like the boy he is worth a dozen harolds perhaps i ought not to say this for harold is my nephew and they say blood is thicker than water however it is a fact nevertheless that i like luke the better of the two i shall not blame you for saying that warner returned the old lady i am glad that one of the family at least is free from prejudice to what do you attribute louisas dislike of luke i think aunt you are shrewd enough to guess the reason without appealing to me still i would like to hear it from your lips in plain words then louisa is afraid you will remember luke in your will she doesnt think i would leave everything to him does she she objects to your leaving anything if it were only five hundred dollars she would grudge it louisa was always selfish said mrs merton quietly i have always known that she is not wise however she does not understand that i am a very obstinate old woman and am more likely to take my own way if opposed thats right aunt you are entitled to have your own way and i for one am the last to wish to interfere with you you will not fare any the worse for that and now warner tell me what are your chances of employment i wished to speak to you about that aunt there is a gentleman in milwaukee who has a branch office in chicago and i understand that he wants someone to represent him here his present agent is about to resign his position and i think i have some chance of obtaining the place it will be necessary for me however to go to milwaukee to see him in person go then by all means said mrs merton i will defray your expenses thank you very much aunt you know that i have little money of my own but there is another thing indispensable and that i am afraid you would not be willing to do for me what is it warner i shall have charge of considerable money belonging to my employer and i learn from the present agent that i shall have to get someone to give bonds for me in the sum of ten thousand dollars very well i am willing to stand your security warner looked surprised and gratified knowing how dishonestly i have acted in the past he said the past is past you are a different man i hope and believe aunt eliza you shall never regret the generous confidence you are willing to repose in me it is likely to open for me a new career and to make a new man of me that is my desire warner let me add that i am only following your own example you have refused to believe evil of luke unlike your sister and have not been troubled by the kindness i have shown him this is something i remember to your credit thank you aunt if you have been able to discover anything creditable in me i am all the more pleased how much will this position pay you supposing you get it two thousand dollars a year to me that will be a competence i shall be able to save onehalf for i have given up my former expensive tastes and am eager to settle down to a steady and methodical business life when do you want to go to milwaukee warner i should like to go at once here is some money to defray your expenses mrs merton opened her table drawer and took out a roll of bills amounting to fifty dollars i wish you good luck she said thank you aunt i shall take the afternoon train to milwaukee and sleep there tonight warner powell hastened to catch the train and at six oclock in the evening landed with a large number of fellow passengers in the metropolis of wisconsin chapter xxxvii thomas brownings secret warner powell had learned wisdom and prudence with his increasing years and instead of inquiring for the best hotel was content to put up at a humbler hostelry where he would be comfortable he made the acquaintance on the cars of a new york drummer with whom he became quite sociable i suppose you have been in milwaukee often said warner i go there once a year sometimes twice where do you stay at the prairie hotel it is a comfortable house two dollars a day just what i want i will go there so at quarterpast six warner powell found himself in the office of the hotel he was assigned a room on the third floor after making his toilet he went down to supper at the table with him were two gentlemen who from their conversation appeared to be residents of the city they were discussing the coming municipal election i tell you browning will be our mayor said one his reputation as a philanthropist will elect him i never took much stock in his claims on that score he belongs to all the charitable societies and is generally an officer that may be how much does he give himself i dont know i suppose he is a liberal subscriber he wants to give that impression but the man is as selfish as the average he is said to be a hard landlord and his tenants get very few favors i am surprised to hear that he is trading on his philanthropy it would be interesting to learn where his wealth came from i should not be surprised if he were more smart than honest warner powell found himself getting interested in this browning was he really a good man who was unjustly criticised or was he a sham philanthropist as charged after all it doesnt concern me he said to himself the good people of milwaukee may choose whom they please for mayor so far as i am concerned after supper warner stepped up to the cigar stand to buy a cigar this as the reader will remember was kept by jack king an old california acquaintance of thomas browning whose first appearance in our story was in the character of a tramp and wouldbe burglar is business good asked warner pleasantly it is fair but it seems slow to a man like myself who has made a hundred dollars a day at the mines in california i have been in california myself said powell but it was recently and no such sums were to be made in my time that is true it didnt last with me i have noticed that even in the flush times few brought much money away with them no matter how lucky they were there must become exceptions however there were we have a notable example in milwaukee to whom do you refer to thomas browning the man who is up for mayor jack king laughed ive heard a lot of talk about that man hes very honest and very worthy i hear they call him so he answered i am afraid you are jealous of that good man said warner smiling i may be jealous of his success but not of his reputation or his moral qualities then you dont admire him as much as the public generally no i know him too well he is really rich is he not yes that is he is worth perhaps two hundred thousand dollars that would satisfy me or me but i doubt whether the money was creditably gained do you know anything about it were you an acquaintance of his yes i can remember him when he was only a rough miner i never heard that he was very lucky but he managed to take considerable money east with him warner eyed jack king attentively you suspect something he said shrewdly i do there was one of our acquaintances who had struck it rich and accumulated about ten thousand dollars browning was thick with him and i always suspected that when he found himself on his deathbed he intrusted all his savings to butler i thought you were speaking of browning his name was butler then he has changed it since but as i was saying i think he intrusted his money to browning to take home to his family well the question is did browning fulfill his trust or keep the money himself that would come out wouldnt it the family would make inquiries they did not know that the dying man had money he kept it to himself for he wanted to go home and give them an agreeable surprise butler knew this and i think he took advantage of it that was contemptible but cant it be ascertained is it known where the family lives what is the name walton walton repeated warner powell in surprise yes do you know any family of that name i know a boy in chicago named luke walton he is in the employ of my aunt a part of his time he spends in selling papers mr browning told me that walton only left a daughter and that the family had gone to the eastern states would he be likely to tell you the truth supposing he had really kept the money perhaps not what more can you tell me about this boy powells face lighted up i remember now he told me that his father died in california is it possible said jack king excited i begin to think i am on the right track i begin to think too that i can tell where tom butler got his first start and now he poses as a philanthropist yes and is nominated for mayor yes also how are your relations with him they should be friendly for he and i were comrades in earlier days and once i lent him money when he needed it but he has been puffed up by his prosperity and takes very little notice of me he had to do something for me when i first came to milwaukee but it was because he was afraid not to meanwhile warner powell was searching his memory where and how had he become familiar with the name of thomas browning at last it came to him eureka he exclaimed in excitement what does that mean i dont understand french warner smiled it isnt french he said but greek all the greek i know it means i have discovered the mystery of your old acquaintance explain please said jack king his interest be coming intense i have a friend in chicago stephen webb a nephew of your philanthropist who has been commissioned by his uncle to find out all he can about this newsboy luke walton he was speculating with me why his uncle should be so interested in an obscure boy had his uncle told him nothing no except that he dropped a hint about knowing lukes father this luke and his family are poor you say yes you can judge that from his employment he is an honest manly boy however and i have taken a fancy to him i hope it will turn out as you say but nothing can be proved this browning will probably deny that he received money in trust from the dead father jack kings countenance fell when you go back to chicago talk with the boy and find out whether the family have any evidence that will support their claim then send the boy on to me and we will see what can be done i accept the suggestion with pleasure but i will offer an amendment let us write the boy to come on at once and have a joint consultation in his interest chapter xxxviii felicie proves troublesome we must return to chicago for a short time before recording the incidents of lukes visit to milwaukee though harold had lost nearly half of his money through being compelled to divide with felicie he was upon the whole well satisfied with the way in which he had escaped from suspicion he had his gold watch and as far as he knew the story which he had told about it had not been doubted but something happened that annoyed and alarmed him one day when there was no one else in the house except the servants felicie intercepted him as he was going out i want a word with you master harold she said i am in a hurry felicie replied harold who had conceived a dislike for the french maid still i think you can spare a few minutes went on felicie smiling in an unpleasant manner well be quick about it said harold impatiently i have a sister who is very sick she is a widow with two children and her means are very small goodness felicie what is all this to me of course im sorry for her but i dont know her she looks to me to help her continued felicie well thats all right i suppose you are going to help her there is the trouble master harold i have no money on hand well im sure that is unlucky but why do you speak to me about it because and here felicies eyes glistened i know you obtained some money recently from your aunt hush said harold apprehensively but its true and its true that you made me give you half of it it all went to my poor sister said felicie theatrically i dont see what i have to do with that said harold not without reason so that i kept none for myself now i am sure you will open your heart and give me five dollars more i never heard such cheek exclaimed harold indignantly youve got half and are not satisfied with that but think of my poor sister said felicie putting her handkerchief to her eyes in which there were no tears think of me exclaimed harold angrily then you wont give me the trifle i ask trifle i havent got it where is it gone gone to buy this watch that took nearly the whole of it it is indeed so i thought you received it as a reward for picking up a pocketbook i had to tell my aunt something otherwise they would ask me embarrassing questions ah quelle invention exclaimed felicie playfully and you really have none of the money left no then there is only one way what is that to open the drawer again are you mad felicie i should surely be discovered it wont do to try it a second time when my aunt is on her guard besides very likely she dont keep her money there now oh yes she does how do you know i was in the room yesterday when she opened the drawer to take out money to pay a bill she must be foolish then ah said felicie coolly she thinks lightning wont strike twice in the same place well it wont there must have been fifty dollars in bills in the drawer continued felicie insinuatingly it may stay there for all me i wont go to the drawer again i must have some money said felicie significantly then go and tell aunt eliza and she may give you some i dont think your aunt eliza likes me said felicie frankly very likely not said harold with equal candor you can raise some money on your watch master harold suggested felicie how at the pawnbrokers well i dont mean to no no returned harold emphatically suppose i go and tell mrs merton who took her money you would only expose yourself i did not take it you made me divide with you i shall deny all that besides i shall tell all that i saw on that day harold felt troubled felicie might as he knew make trouble for him and though he could in time inform against her that would not make matters much better for him probably the whole story would come out and he felt sure that the french maid would not spare him a lucky thought came to him felicie he said i think i can suggest something that will help you well what is it go to my aunts drawer yourself you have plenty of chance and you can keep all the money you find i wont ask you for any of it felicie eyed him sharply she was not sure but he meant to trap her i have no keys she said you can use the same bunch i have here they are felicie paused a moment then took the proffered keys after all why should she not make use of the suggestion it would be thought that the second thief was the same as the first can i rely on your discretion master harold she asked yes certainly i am not very likely to say anything about the matter true it might not be for your interest goodmorning master harold i wont detain you any longer harold left the house with a feeling of relief i hope felicie will be caught he said to himself i have a great mind to give aunt eliza a hint it looked as if the generally astute felicie had made a mistake chapter xxxix luke waltons letter here is a letter for you luke said mrs walton luke took it in his hand and regarded it curiously he was not in the habit of receiving letters it is postmarked milwaukee he said do you know anyone in milwaukee asked his mother no or stay it must be from mr powell a brother of mrs tracy probably he sends a message to his sister by this time luke had opened the following letter which he read with great surprise and excitement dear luke come to milwaukee as soon as you can and join me at the prairie hotel i write in your own interest there is a large sum due to your father which i may be able to put you in the way of collecting you had better see aunt eliza and ask leave of absence for a day or two if you havent money enough to come on let her know and i am sure she will advance it to you your friend warner powell what can it mean asked mrs walton to whom luke read the letter it must refer to the ten thousand dollars which father sent to us on his dying bed if it were only so said the widow clasping her hands at any rate i shall soon find out mother i had better take the letter which was sent us giving us the first information of the legacy very well luke i dont know anything about business i must leave the matter entirely in your hands i will go at once to mrs merton and ask if it will inconvenience her if i go away for a couple of days do so luke she is a kind friend and you should do nothing without her permission luke took the cars for prairie avenue though it was afternoon and he had been there once already he was shown immediately into the old ladys presence mrs merton saw him enter with surprise has anything happened luke she asked i have received a letter from your nephew summoning me to milwaukee i hope he is not in any scrape no it is a very friendly letter written in my interest may i read it to you i shall be glad to hear it mrs merton settled herself back in her rockingchair and listened to the reading of the letter do you know what this refers to luke she asked yes my father on his deathbed in california intrusted a stranger with ten thousand dollars to bring to my mother he kept it for his own use and it was only by an accident that we heard about the matter you interest me luke what was the accident luke explained it must be this that mr powell refers to he added but i dont see how my nephew should have anything to do with it there is a man in milwaukee who answers the description of the stranger to whom my poor father intrusted his money i have seen him for he often comes to chicago i have even spoken to him have you ever taxed him with this breach of trust no for he bears a different name he is thomas browning while the letter mentions thomas butler he may have changed his name i was stupid not to think of that before there can hardly be two men so singularly alike i have come to ask you mrs merton if you can spare me for two or three days for as long as you like luke said the old lady promptly have you any money for your traveling expenses yes thank you no matter here are twenty dollars money never comes amiss you are always kind to me mrs merton said luke gratefully it is easy to be kind if one is rich i want to see that man punished let me give you one piece of advice be on your guard with this man he is not to be trusted thank you i am sure your advice is good i wish you good luck luke however things may turn out there is one thing that gratifies me warner is showing himself your friend i have looked upon him till recently as a black sheep but he is redeeming himself rapidly in my eyes i shall not forget his kindness to you as luke went downstairs he met mrs tracy here again said she coldly did my aunt send for you this afternoon no madam then you should not have intruded you are young but you are very artful i see through your schemes you may rest assured i wished to show mrs merton a letter from your brother now in milwaukee said luke oh thats it is it let me see the letter i must refer you to mrs merton he has probably sent to aunt eliza for some money thought mrs tracy he and the boy are well matched chapter xl face to face with the enemy thomas browning sat in his handsome study in a complacent frame of mind the caucus was to be held in the evening and he confidently expected the nomination for mayor it was the post he had coveted for a long time there were other honors that were greater but the mayoralty would perhaps prove a steppingstone to them he must not be impatient he was only in middle life and there was plenty of time i didnt dream this when i was a penniless miner in california he reflected gleefully fortune was hard upon me then but now i am at the top of the heap all my own good management too tom butler no browning is no fool if i do say it myself someone to see you mr browning said the servant show him in replied the philanthropist a poorly dressed man followed the maid into the room mr browning frowned he had thought it might be some influential member of his party what do you want he asked roughly the poor man stood humbly before him nervously pressing the hat between his hands i am one of your tenants mr browning i am behindhand with my rent owing to sickness in the family and i have been ordered out and very properly too said browning you cant expect me to let you stay gratis but sir you have the reputation of being a philanthropist it hardly seems the character i do not call myself a philanthropist others call me so and perhaps they are right i help the poor to the extent of my means but even a philanthropist expects his honest dues then you can do nothing for me sir no i do not feel called upon to interfere in your case the poor man went out sorrowfully leaving the philanthropist in an irritable mood five minutes later a second visitor was announced who is it asked browning fearing it might be an other tenant it is a boy sir with a message probably show him up but thomas browning was destined to be surprised when in the manlylooking youth who entered he recognized the chicago newsboy who had already excited his uneasiness what brings you here he demanded in a startled tone i dont know if you remember me mr browning said luke quietly luke walton is my name sir and i have sold you papers near the sherman house in chicago i thought your face looked familiar said browning assuming an indifferent tone you have made a mistake in coming to milwaukee you cannot do as well here as in chicago i have not come in search of a place i have a good one at home i suppose you have some object in coming to this city yes i came to see you upon my word i ought to feel flattered but i cant do anything for you i have some reputation in charitable circles but i have my hands full here i have not come to ask you a favor mr browning if you will allow me i will ask your advice in a matter of importance to me browning brightened up he was always ready to give advice go on he said when i was a young boy my father went to california he left my mother my brother and myself very poorly provided for but he hoped to earn money at the mines a year passed and we heard of his death a good many men die in california said browning phlegmatically we could not learn that father left anything and we were compelled to get long as we could mother obtained sewing to do at low prices and i sold papers a common experience said browning coldly about three months ago continued luke we were surprised by receiving in a letter from a stranger a message from my fathers deathbed thomas browning started and turned pale as he gazed intently in the boys face how much does he know he asked himself apprehensively go on he said slowly in this letter we learned for the first time that father had intrusted the sum of ten thousand dollars to an acquaintance to be brought to my mother this man proved false and kept the money this story may or may not be true said browning with an effort was the mans name given yes his name was thomas butler indeed have you ever met him i think so answered luke slowly i will read his description from the letter he has a wart on the upper part of his right cheek a mark which disfigures and mortifies him exceedingly he is about five feet ten inches in height with a dark complexion and dark hair a little tinged with gray let me see the letter said browning hoarsely he took the letter in his hand and moving near the grate fire began to read it suddenly the paper as if accidentally slipped from his fingers and fell upon the glowing coals where it was instantly consumed how careless i am ejaculated browning but there was exultation in the glance chapter xli mr browning comes to terms the destruction of the letter and the open exultation of the man who had in intention at least doubly wronged him did not appear to dismay luke walton he sat quite cool and collected facing mr browning really i dont see how this letter happened to slip from my hand continued the philanthropist i am afraid you consider it important i should if it had been the genuine letter said luke what gasped browning it was only a copy as you will be glad to hear boy i think you are deceiving me said browning sharply not at all i left the genuine letter in the hands of my lawyer your lawyer yes i have put this matter in the hands of mr jordan of this city mr browning looked very much disturbed mr jordan was a wellknown and eminent attorney moreover he was opposed in politics to the wouldbe mayor if his opponent should get hold of this discreditable chapter in his past history his political aspirations might as well be given up again he asked himself how much of the story does this boy know if you are employing a lawyer he said after a pause i dont understand why you came to me for advice i thought you might be interested in the matter said luke significantly why should i be interested in your affairs i have so many things to think of that really i cant take hold of anything new i will tell you sir you are the man who received money in trust from my dying father i look to you to restore it with interest how dare you insinuate any such thing demanded browning furiously do you mean to extort money by threats no sir i only ask for justice there is nothing to connect me with the matter according to your letter it was a thomas butler who received the money you refer to true and your name at that time was thomas butler mr browning turned livid the net seemed to be closing about him what proof have you of this ridiculous assertion he demanded the testimony of one who knew you then and now mr king who keeps a cigar stand at the prairie hotel ha traitor ejaculated browning apostrophizing the absent king this is a conspiracy he said king has put you up to this he is a discreditable tramp whom i befriended when in dire need this is my reward for it i have nothing to do with that mr browning mr king is ready to help me with his testimony my lawyer has advised me to call upon you and to say this if you will pay over the ten thousand dollars with interest i will engage in my mothers name to keep the matter from getting before the public and if i dont agree to this mr jordan is instructed to bring suit against you drops of perspiration gathered on the brow of mr browning this would never do the suit even if unsuccessful would blast his reputation as a philanthropist and his prospects as a politician i will see mr jordan he said very well sir then i wish you goodmorning within two days thomas browning had paid over to the lawyer for his young client the full sum demanded and luke left milwaukee with the happy consciousness that his mother was now beyond the reach of poverty chapter xlii conclusion felicie reflected over harolds dishonest suggestion and concluded to adopt it she meant to charge harold with the second robbery and to brazen it out if necessary accordingly one day she stole into mrs mertons sitting room and with the keys supplied by harold succeeded in opening the drawer inside greatly to her surprise she saw the identical pocketbook which it had been understood was taken at the time of the first robbery she was holding it in her hand when a slight noise led her to look up swiftly to her dismay she saw the old lady whom she had supposed out of the house regarding her sternly what does this mean felicie demanded mrs merton i i found these keys and was trying them to see if any of them had been used at the time your money was stolen do you know who took my money on that occasion continued the old lady yes i do answered felicie swiftly deciding to tell the truth who was it your nephew harold answered felicie glibly you know this i saw him open the drawer i was looking through a crack of the door and you never told me of this i didnt want to expose him he begged me not to do so that is singular he warned me yesterday that he suspected you of being the thief and that he had reason to think you were planning a second robbery he did said felicie with flashing eyes yes what have you to say to it that he put me up to it and gave me these keys to help me in doing it of course he expected to share the money this last statement was untrue but felicie was determined to be revenged upon her treacherous ally and you accepted yes said felicie seeing no way of escape i am poor and thought you wouldnt miss the money my nephew accused luke walton of being the thief it is untrue he wanted to divert suspicion from himself besides he hates luke do you no i think him much better than harold so do i where did my nephew get his gold watch it was bought with the money he stole from the drawer so i supposed well felicie you can go but i think you had better hand me that bunch of keys shall you report me to mrs tracy i have not decided for the present we will both keep this matter secret lukes absence was of course noticed by mrs tracy have you discharged luke walton she asked hopefully i observe he has not come here for the last two or three days he has gone out of the city on business i am surprised that you should trust that boy to such an extent at this moment a telegraph messenger rang the bell and a telegram was brought up to mrs merton it ran thus to mrs merton prairie avenue chicago i have recovered all my mothers money with interest mr powell is also successful will return this evening luke walton read it if you like louisa said the old lady smiling with satisfaction what does it mean that luke has recovered over ten thousand dollars of which his mother had been defrauded it was warner who put him on the track of the man who wrongfully held the money indeed said mrs tracy spitefully then the least he can do is to return the money he took from you he never took any louisa who did then your son harold who has been telling lies about my poor boy exclaimed mrs tracy angrily a person who saw him unlocking the drawer has luke walton been telling falsehoods about my son no it was quite another person i have other proof also and have known for some time who the real thief was if harold claims that i have done him injustice send him to me after an interview with harold mrs tracy was obliged to believe much against her will that he was the guilty one and not the boy she so much detested this did not prepossess her any more in favor of luke walton whom she regarded as the rival and enemy of her son it was a joyful coming home for luke he removed at once to a nice neighborhood and ceased to be a chicago newsboy he did not lose the friendship of mrs merton who is understood to have put him down for a large legacy in her will and still employs him to transact much of her business next year she proposes to establish her nephew warner powell and luke in a commission business under the style of powell walton she furnishing the capital the house on prairie avenue is closed mrs tracy is married again to a man whose intemperate habits promise her little happiness harold seems unwilling to settle down to business but has developed a taste for dress and the amusements of a young man about town he thinks he will eventually be provided for by mrs merton but in this he will be mistaken as she has decided to leave much the larger part of her wealth to charitable institutions after remembering her nephew warner powell handsomely ambrose kean never repeated the mistake he had made still more by diligent economy he saved up the sum advanced him by mrs merton and he offered it to her she accepted it but returned it many times over to his mother her patronage brought him another advantage it led his employer to increase his salary which is now double that which he formerly received felicie lost her position but speedily secured another where it is to be hoped she will be more circumspect in her conduct thomas browning after all lost the nomination which he craved and much of his wealth is gone he dabbled in foolish speculation and is now comparatively a poor man through the agency of jack king the story of his breach of trust was whispered about and the sham philanthropist is better understood and less respected by his fellowcitizens his nephew stephen webb has been obliged to buckle down to hard work at ten dollars a week and feels that his path is indeed thorny luke walton is not puffed up by his unexpected and remarkable success he never fails to recognize kindly and help if there is need the old associates of his humbler days and never tries to conceal the fact that he was once a chicago newsboy the end graphic decoration cherub with tethered birds upside down white house incidents trying the greens on jake a deputation of bankers were one day introduced to the president by the secretary of the treasury one of the party mr p of chelsea mass took occasion to refer to the severity of the tax laid by congress upon state banks now said mr lincoln that reminds me of a circumstance that took place in a neighborhood where i lived when i was a boy in the spring of the year the farmers were very fond of a dish which they called greens though the fashionable name for it nowadays is spinach i believe one day after dinner a large family were taken very ill the doctor was called in who attributed it to the greens of which all had frequently partaken living in the family was a halfwitted boy named jake on a subsequent occasion when greens had been gathered for dinner the head of the house said now boys before running any further risk in this thing we will first try them on jake if he stands it we are all right and just so i suppose said mr lincoln congress thought it would try this tax on state banks a story which lincoln told the preachers a year or more before mr lincolns death a delegation of clergymen waited upon him in reference to the appointment of the army chaplains the delegation consisted of a presbyterian a baptist and an episcopal clergyman they stated that the character of many of the chaplains was notoriously bad and they had come to urge upon the president the necessity of more discretion in these appointments but gentlemen said the president that is a matter which the government has nothing to do with the chaplains are chosen by the regiments not satisfied with this the clergymen pressed in turn a change in the system mr lincoln heard them through without remark and then said without any disrespect gentlemen i will tell you a little story once in springfield i was going off on a short journey and reached the depot a little ahead of time leaning against the fence just outside the depot was a little darkey boy whom i knew named dick busily digging with his toe in a mudpuddle as i came up i said dick what are you about making a church said he a church said i what do you mean why yes said dick pointing with his toe dont you see there is the shape of it theres the steps and front door here the pews where the folks set and theres the pulpit yes i see said i but why dont you make a minister laws answered dick with a grin i haint got mud enough how lincoln stood up for the word sugarcoated mr defrees the government printer states that when one of the presidents message was being printed he was a good deal disturbed by the use of the term sugarcoated and finally went to mr lincoln about it their relations to each other being of the most intimate character he told the president frankly that he ought to remember that a message to congress was a different affair from a speech at a mass meeting in illinois that the messages became a part of history and should be written accordingly what is the matter now inquired the president why said mr defrees you have used an undignified expression in the message and then reading the paragraph aloud he added i would alter the structure of that if i were you defrees replied mr lincoln that word expresses exactly my idea and i am not going to change it the time will never come in this country when the people wont know exactly what sugarcoated means on a subsequent occasion mr defrees states that a certain sentence of another message was very awkwardly constructed calling the presidents attention to it in the proofcopy the latter acknowledged the force of the objection raised and said go home defrees and see if you can better it the next day mr defrees took into him his amendment mr lincoln met him by saying seward found the same fault that you did and he has been rewriting the paragraph also then reading mr defrees version he said i believe you have beaten seward but i jings i think i can beat you both then taking up his pen he wrote the sentence as it was finally printed lincolns advice to a prominent bachelor upon the betrothal of the prince of wales to the princess alexandra queen victoria sent a letter to each of the european sovereigns and also to president lincoln announcing the fact lord lyons her ambassador at washington a bachelor by the way requested an audience of mr lincoln that he might present this important document in person at the time appointed he was received at the white house in company with mr seward may it please your excellency said lord lyons i hold in my hand an autograph letter from my royal mistress queen victoria which i have been commanded to present to your excellency in it she informs your excellency that her son his royal highness the prince of wales is about to contract a matrimonial alliance with her royal highness the princess alexandra of denmark after continuing in this strain for a few minutes lord lyons tendered the letter to the president and awaited his reply it was short simple and expressive and consisted simply of the words lord lyons go thou and do likewise it is doubtful if an english ambassador was ever addressed in this manner before and it would be interesting to learn what success he met with in putting the reply in diplomatic language when he reported it to her majesty illustration of carriage on forested road mr lincoln and the bashful boys the president and a friend were standing upon the threshold of the door under the portico of the white house awaiting the coachman when a letter was put into his hand while he was reading this people were passing as is customary up and down the promenade which leads through the grounds of the war department crossing of course the portico attention was attracted to an approaching party apparently a countryman plainly dressed with his wife and two little boys who had evidently been straying about looking at the places of public interest in the city as they reached the portico the father who was in advance caught sight of the tall figure of mr lincoln absorbed in his letter his wife and the little boys were ascending the steps the man stopped suddenly put out his hand with a hush to his family and after a moments gaze he bent down and whispered to them there is the president then leaving them he slowly made a circuit around mr lincoln watching him intently all the while at this point having finished his letter the president turned and said well we will not wait any longer for the carriage it wont hurt you and me to walk down the countryman here approached very diffidently and asked if he might be allowed to take the president by the hand after which would he extend the same privilege to his wife and little boys mr lincoln goodnaturedly approached the latter who had remained where they were stopped and reaching down said a kind word to the bashful little fellows who shrank close up to their mother and did not reply this simple act filled the fathers cup full the lord is with you mr president he said reverently and then hesitating a moment he added with strong emphasis and the people too sir and the people too a few moments later mr lincoln remarked to his friend great men have various estimates when daniel webster made his tour through the west years ago he visited springfield among other places where great preparations had been made to receive him as the procession was going through the town a barefooted little darkey boy pulled the sleeve of a man named t and asked what the folks were all doing down the street why jack was the reply the biggest man in the world is coming now there lived in springfield a man by the name of g a very corpulent man jack darted off down the street but presently returned with a very disappointed air well did you see him inquired t yees returned jack but laws he aint half as big as old g an irish soldier who wanted something stronger than soda water upon mr lincolns return to washington after the capture of richmond a member of the cabinet asked him if it would be proper to permit jacob thompson to slip through maine in disguise and embark from portland the president as usual was disposed to be merciful and to permit the archrebel to pass unmolested but the secretary urged that he should be arrested as a traitor by permitting him to escape the penalties of treason persistently remarked the secretary you sanction it well replied mr lincoln let me tell you a story there was an irish soldier here last summer who wanted something to drink stronger than water and stopped at a drugshop where he espied a sodafountain mr doctor said he give me plase a glass of soda wather an if yees can put in a few drops of whisky unbeknown to any one ill be obleeged now said mr lincoln if jake thompson is permitted to go through maine unbeknown to any one whats the harm so dont have him arrested looking out for breakers in a time of despondency some visitors were telling the president of the breakers so often seen ahead this time surely coming that said he suggests the story of the schoolboy who never could pronounce the names shadrach meshach and abednego he had been repeatedly whipped for it without effect some times afterwards he saw the names of the regular lesson for the day putting his finger upon the place he turned to his next neighbor an older boy and whispered here comes those tormented hebrews again a story about jack chase a farmer from one of the border counties went to the president on a certain occasion with the complaint that the union soldiers in passing his farm had helped themselves not only to hay but to his horse and he hoped the proper officer would be required to consider his claim immediately why my good sir replied mr lincoln if i should attempt to consider every such individual case i should find work enough for twenty presidents in my early days i knew one jack chase who was a lumberman on the illinois and when steady and sober the best raftsman on the river it was quite a trick twentyfive years ago to take the logs over the rapids but he was skillful with a raft and always kept her straight in the channel finally a steamer was put on and jack hes dead now poor fellow was made captain of her he always used to take the wheel going through the rapids one day when the boat was plunging and wallowing along the boiling current and jacks utmost vigilance was being exercised to keep her in the narrow channel a boy pulled his coattail and hailed him with say mister captain i wish you would just stop your boat a minute ive lost an apple overboard stories illustrating lincolns memory mr lincolns memory was very remarkable at one of the afternoon receptions at the white house a stranger shook hands with him and as he did so remarked casually that he was elected to congress about the time mr lincolns term as representative expired which happened many years before yes said the president you are from mentioning the state i remember reading of your election in a newspaper one morning on a steamboat going down to mount vernon at another time a gentleman addressed him saying i presume mr president you have forgotten me no was the prompt reply your name is flood i saw you last twelve years ago at naming the place and the occasion i am glad to see he continued that the flood flows on subsequent to his reelection a deputation of bankers from various sections were introduced one day by the secretary of the treasury after a few moments of general conversation mr lincoln turned to one of them and said your district did not give me so strong a vote at the last election as it did in i think sir that you must be mistaken replied the banker i have the impression that your majority was considerably increased at the last election no rejoined the president you fell off about six hundred votes then taking down from the bookcase the official canvass of and he referred to the vote or the district named and proved to be quite right in his assertion philosophy of canes a gentleman calling at the white house one evening carried a cane which in the course of conversation attracted the presidents attention taking it in his hand he said i always used a cane when i was a boy it was a freak of mine my favorite one was a knotted beech stick and i carved the head myself theres a mighty amount of character in sticks dont you think so you have seen these fishingpolls that fit into a cane well that was an old idea of mine dogwood clubs were favorite ones with the boys i suppose they use them yet hickory is too heavy unless you get it from a young sapling have you ever noticed how a stick in ones hand will change his appearance old women and witches wouldnt look so without sticks meg merrilies understands that common sense the hon mr hubbard of connecticut once called upon the president in reference to a newly invented gun concerning which a committee had been appointed to make a report the report was sent for and when it came in was found to be of the most voluminous description mr lincoln glanced at it and said i should want a new lease of life to read this through throwing it down upon the table he added why cant a committee of this kind occasionally exhibit a grain of common sense if i send a man to buy a horse for me i expect him to tell me his points not how many hairs there are in his tail lincolns confab with a committee on grants whisky just previous to the fall of vicksburg a selfconstituted committee solicitous for the morale of our armies took it upon themselves to visit the president and urge the removal of general grant in some surprise mr lincoln inquired for what reason why replied the spokesman he drinks too much whisky ah rejoined mr lincoln dropping his lower lip by the way gentlemen can either of you tell me where general grant procures his whisky because if i can find out i will send every general in the field a barrel of it a pretty tolerable respectable sort of a clergyman some one was discussing in the presence of mr lincoln the character of a timeserving washington clergyman said mr lincoln to his visitor i think you are rather hard upon mr he reminds me of a man in illinois who was tried for passing a counterfeit bill it was in evidence that before passing it he had taken it to the cashier of a bank and asked his opinion of the bill and he received a very prompt reply that it was a counterfeit his lawyer who had heard the evidence to be brought against his client asked him just before going into court did you take the bill to the cashier of the bank and ask him if it was good i did was the reply well what was the reply of the cashier the rascal was in a corner but he got out of it in this fashion he said it was a pretty tolerable respectable sort of a bill mr lincoln thought the clergyman was a pretty tolerable respectable sort of a clergyman opened his eyes mr lincoln sometimes had a very effective way of dealing with men who troubled him with questions a visitor once asked him how many men the rebels had in the field the president replied very seriously twelve hundred thousand according to the best authority the interrogator blanched in the face and ejaculated good heavens yes sir twelve hundred thousand no doubt of it you see all of our generals when they get whipped say the enemy outnumbers them from three or five to one and i must believe them we have four hundred thousand men in the field and three times four makes twelve dont you see it minnehaha and minneboohoo some gentlemen fresh from a western tour during a call at the white house referred in the course of conversation to a body of water in nebraska which bore an indian name signifying weeping water mr lincoln instantly responded as laughing water according to mr longfellow is minnehaha this evidently should be minneboohoo lincoln and the artist f b carpenter the celebrated artist and author of the wellknown painting of lincoln and his cabinet issuing the emancipation proclamation describes his first meeting with the president as follows two oclock found me one of the throng pressing toward the center of attraction the blue room from the threshold of the crimson parlor as i passed i had a glimpse of the gaunt figure of mr lincoln in the distance haggardlooking dressed in black relieved only by the prescribed white gloves standing it seemed to me solitary and alone though surrounded by the crowd bending low now and then in the process of handshaking and responding half abstractedly to the wellmeant greetings of the miscellaneous assemblage never shall i forget the electric thrill which went through my whole being at this instant i seemed to see lines radiating from every part of the globe converging to a focus where that plain awkwardlooking man stood and to hear in spirit a million prayers as the sound of many waters ascending in his behalf mingled with supplication i could discern a clear symphony of triumph and blessing swelled with an everincreasing volume it was the voice of those who had been bondmen and bondwomen and the grand diapason swept up from the coming ages it was soon my privilege in the regular succession to take that honored hand accompanying the act my name and profession were announced to him in a low tone by one of the assistant secretaries who stood by his side retaining my hand he looked at me inquiringly for an instant and said oh yes i know this is the painter then straightening himself to his full height with a twinkle of the eye he added playfully do you think mr c that you could make a handsome picture of me emphasizing strongly the last word somewhat confused at this pointblank shot uttered in a voice so loud as to attract the attention of those in immediate proximity i made a random reply and took the occasion to ask if i could see him in his study at the close of the reception to this he replied in the peculiar vernacular of the west i reckon resuming meanwhile the mechanical and traditional exercise of the hand which no president has ever yet been able to avoid and which severe as is the ordeal is likely to attach to the position so long as the republic
