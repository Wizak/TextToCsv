 chapter one the village of ardmore sat snug on the south coast of ireland in the county of waterford with the celtic sea spread out at its feet the stone seawall curved around following the skirt of the goldensand beach it boasted in its vicinity a pretty jut of cliffs upholstered with wild grass and a hotel that clung to them if one had a mind to it was a pleasant if hearty walk on a narrow path around the headland and at the top of the first hill were the ruins of the oratory and well of saint declan the view was worth the climb with sky and sea and village spread out below this was holy ground and though dead were buried there only one grave had its stone marked the village itself claimed neat streets and painted cottages some with the traditional thatched roofs and a number of steep hills as well flowers grew in abundance spilling out of window boxes baskets and pots and dooryards it made a charming picture from above or below and the villagers were proud to have won the tidy town award two years running atop tower hill was a fine example of a round tower with its conical top still in place and the ruins of the twelfthcentury cathedral built in honor of saint declan folks would tell you in case you wondered that declan arrived thirty years before good saint patrick not that they were bragging they were just letting you know how things stood those interested in such matters would find examples of ogham carving on the stones put for safekeeping inside the roofless cathedral and roman arcading faded with time and wind but still worth the study but the village itself made no attempt at such grandeur it was merely a pleasant place with a shop or two and a scatter of cottages built back away from lovely sand beaches the sign for ardmore said failte and that was welcome it was that very combination of ancient history and simple character and hospitality that interested trevor magee his people had come from ardmore and old parish indeed his grandfather had been born here in a small house very near ardmore bay had lived the first years of his life breathing that moist sea air had perhaps held his mothers hand as shed walked to the shops or along the surf his grandfather had left his village and his country taking his wife and young son with him to america he had never been back and so far as trevor knew had never looked back either there had been a distance and a bitter one between the old man and the country of his birth ireland and ardmore and the family dennis magee had left behind had rarely been spoken of so trevors image of ardmore had a ripple of sentiment and curiosity through it and his reasons for choosing it had a personal bent but he could afford personal bents he was a man who built and who as his grandfather and father before him built cleverly and well his grandfather had made his living laying brick and made his fortune speculating on properties during and after world war ii until the buying and selling of them was his business and the building done by those he hired old magee had been no more sentimental about his laborers beginnings than he had been about his homeland to trevors recollection the man had shown no sentiment about anything but trevor had inherited the heart and hands of the builder as much as the cool hard sense of the businessman and he had learned to use both he would use them both here and a dash of sentiment as well to build his theater a traditional structure for traditional music with its entrance the already established pub known as gallaghers the deal with the gallaghers had been set the ground broken for the project before hed been able to hack through his schedule for the time he wanted to spend here but he was here now and he intended to do more than sign checks and watch he wanted his hands in it a man could work up a good sweat even in may in such a temperate climate when he spent a morning hauling concrete that morning trevor left the cottage hed decided to rent for the duration of his stay wearing a denim jacket and carrying a steaming mug of coffee now a handful of hours later the jacket had been tossed aside and a thin line of damp ran front and back down his shirt hed have paid a hundred pounds for one cold beer the pub was only a short walk through the construction rubble he knew from stopping in the day before that it did a brisk business midday but a man could hardly quench his thirst with a chilly harp when he forbade his employees to drink on the job he rolled his shoulders circled his neck as he scanned the site the concrete truck let out its continuous rumble men shouted relaying orders or acknowledging them job music trevor thought he never tired of it that was a gift from his father learn from the ground up had been dennis juniors credo and the thirdgeneration magee had done just that for more than ten yearsfifteen if he counted the summers hed sweated on construction siteshed learned just what went into the business of building the backaches and blood and aching muscles at thirtytwo he spent more time in boardrooms and meetings than on a scaffold but hed never lost the appreciation or the satisfaction of swinging his own hammer he intended to indulge himself doing just that in ardmore in his theater he watched the small woman in a faded cap and battered boots circle around gesture as the wet concrete slid down the chute she scrambled over sand and stone used her shovel to rap the chute and alert the operator to stop then waded into the muck with the other laborers to shovel and smooth brenna otoole trevor thought and was glad hed followed his instincts there hiring her and her father as foremen on the project had been the right course of action not just for their building skills he decidedthough they were impressivebut because they knew the village and the people in it kept the job running smoothly and the men happy and productive public relations on this sort of project were just as vital as a sturdy foundation yes indeed they were working out well his three days in ardmore had shown him hed made the right choice with otoole and otoole when brenna climbed out again trevor stepped over extended a hand to give her a final boost thanks she sliced her shovel into the ground leaned on it and despite her filthy boots and faded cap looked like a pixie her skin was pure irish cream and a few curls of wild red escaped the cap tim riley says we wont have rain for another day or two and he has a way of being right about such things more than hes wrong i think well have the slab set up for you before you have to worry about weather you made considerable progress before i got here sure and once you gave us the high sign there was no reason to wait well have you a good solid foundation mr magee and on schedule trev aye trev she tipped back her cap then her head so she could meet his eyes she figured him a good foot higher than her fivetwo even wearing her boots the men you sent along from america theyre a fine team as i handpicked them i agree she thought his voice faintly aloof but not unfriendly and do you never pick females then he smiled slowly so it seemed that humor just moseyed over his face until it reached eyes the color of turf smoke i do indeed and as often as possible both on and off the job ive put one of my best carpenters on this project shell be here next week its good to know my cousin brian wasnt wrong in that area he said you hired by skill and not gender its a good mornings work here she added nodding to the site that noisy bastard of a truck will be our constant companion for a while yet darcyll be back from her holiday tomorrow and i can tell you shell bitch our ears off about the din its a good noise building ive always thought the same they stood a moment in perfect accord while the truck vomited out the last yard of concrete ill buy you lunch trevor said ill let you brenna gave a whistle to catch her fathers attention then mimed spooning up food mick responded with a grin and a wave then went back to work hes in his heaven brenna commented as they walked over to rinse off their boots nothing makes mick otoole happier than finding himself in the middle of a job site the muckier the better satisfied brenna gave her feet a couple of stomps then headed around to the kitchen door i hope youll take some time to see the area while youre here instead of locking yourself into the job at hand i plan to see whats around he had reports of coursedetailed reports on tourist draws road conditions routes to and from major cities but he intended to see for himself needed to see it trevor admitted to himself something had been pulling him toward ireland toward ardmore for more than a year in dreams ah now theres a finelooking man doing what he does best brenna said when she pushed open the kitchen door what have you for us today shawn he turned from the enormous old stove a rangy man with shaggy black hair and eyes of misty blue for the special weve sea spinach soup and the beef sandwich good day to you trevor is this one working you harder than she should she keeps things moving and so i must for the man in my life is slow i wonder shawn if youve selected another tune or two for trevors consideration ive been busy catering to my new wife shes a demanding creature so saying he reached out to cradle brennas face and kiss her get out of my kitchen its confusing enough around here without darcy shell be back tomorrow and by this time of the day youll have cursed her a dozen times why do you think i miss her give your order to sinead he told trevor shes a good girl and our judes been working with her she just needs a bit more practice a friend of my sister mary kate is sinead brenna told trevor as she pushed open the door that swung between kitchen and pub a goodnatured girl if a bit scattered in the brain she wants to marry billy ohara and that is the sum total of her ambitions at this time and what does billy ohara have to say being not quite so ambitious as sinead billy keeps his mouth shut good day to you aidan and to you the oldest of the gallaghers worked the bar and had his hands on the taps as he looked over will you be joining us for lunch then that we will weve caught you busy god bless the tour buses with a wink aidan slid two pints down the bar to waiting hands do you want us to take it in the kitchen no need for that unless youre in a great hurry his eyes a deeper blue than his brothers scanned the pub service is a mite slower than our usual but theres a table or two left well leave it to the boss brenna turned to trevor how will you have it lets get a table the better to watch how the business ran he followed her out and sat with her at one of the mushroomshaped tables there was a buzz of conversation a haze of smoke and the yeasty scent of beer will you have a pint brenna asked him not until after the workday her lips twitched as she kicked back in her chair so ive heard from some of the men word is youre a tyrant on this particular matter he didnt mind the term tyrant it meant he was in control word would be correct ill tell you this you may have a bit of a problem enforcing such a rule around here many wholl labor for you were nursed on guinness and its as natural to them as mothers milk im fond of it myself but when a man or woman is on my clock they stick with mothers milk ah youre a hard man trevor magee but she said it with a laugh so tell me how are you liking faerie hill cottage very much its comfortable efficient quiet and has a view that rips your heart into your throat its just what i was looking for so im grateful you put me on to it thats not a problem not a problem at all its in the family i think shawn misses the little kitchen there as the house were buildings far from finished more than livable she added as it was one of their current sore points but i figure to concentrate on the kitchen there on my off days so hell be happier id like to see it would you surprised she angled her head well youre welcome any time ill give you the direction do you mind me saying i didnt expect you to be as friendly a sort of man as you seem to be what did you expect more of a shark and i hope that doesnt offend you it doesnt and it depends on the waters where im swimming he glanced over and his face warmed as aidans wife came up to the table but when he started to rise jude waved him down again no im not joining you but thanks she rested a hand on her very pregnant belly hello im jude frances and ill be your server today you shouldnt be on your feet like this carrying trays jude sighed as she took out her order pad he sounds like aidan i put my feet up when i need to and i dont carry anything heavy sinead cant handle things on her own not to worry trevor why me own blessed mother dug potatoes on the day i was born then went back to roast them after the delivery at trevors narrowed glance brenna chuckled well maybe not but ill wager she could have ill have todays soup if you dont mind jude and a glass of milk she added with a wicked smile for trevor the same he said plus the sandwich a fine choice ill be right back with it shes stronger than she looks brenna told him when jude moved to another table and more stubborn now that shes found her direction so to speak shell only work harder to prove she can do what you tell her she shouldnt aidan wont let her overdo i promise you the man adores her yes ive noticed the gallagher men seem to be devoted to their women so theyd better be or their women will know why relaxed she kicked back pulled off her cap those red curls tumbled down so you arent finding it i guess wed saytoo rustic for youout in the countryside here after being used to new york city he thought of the job sites hed experienced mud slides floods blistering heat petty vandalism and sabotage not at all the village is exactly what i expected after finkles reports ah yes finkle she remembered trevors scout very well now theres a man i believe prefers urban conveniences but youre not so particular then im very particular depending thats why i incorporated most of your design into the theater project now thats a fine and sneaky compliment and nothing could have pleased her more i suppose i was angling more toward the personal i have a special fondness for the cottage on faerie hill and i wasnt sure youd find the place to your liking thinking i suppose a man with your background and wherewithal would be more inclined to settle at the cliff hotel with maid service and the restaurant and so forth hotel rooms become confining and i find it interesting to stay in the house where the woman who was engaged to one of my ancestors was born and lived and died she was a fine woman old maude a wise woman brenna kept her eyes on trevors face as she spoke her graves up near the well of saint declan and its there you can feel her shes not the one in the cottage now who is brenna lifted her eyebrows you dont know the legend then your grandfather was born here and your father as well though he was a babe when they sailed to america still he visited many years back did neither of them tell you the story of lady gwen and prince carrick no so it would be lady gwen who haunts the cottage have you seen her no trevor hadnt been raised on legends and myths but there was more than enough irish in his blood to cause him to wonder about them but theres a feminine feel to the place almost a fragrance so odds are for the lady youd be right about that who was she i figure if im sharing quarters with a ghost i should know something about her no careless dismissal of the subject no amused indulgence of the irish and their legends brenna noted just cool interest you surprise me again let me see to something first ill be right back fascinating trevor mused he had himself a ghost hed felt things before in old buildings empty lots deserted fields it wasnt the kind of thing a man generally talked about at a board meeting or over a cold one with the crew after a sweaty days work not usually but this was a different place with a different tone more he wanted to know everything to do with ardmore and the area was of interest to him now a good ghost story could draw people in just as successfully as a wellrun pub it was all atmosphere gallaghers was exactly the kind of atmosphere hed been looking for as a segue into his theater the old wood blackened by time and smoke and grease mated comfortably with the creamcolored walls the stone hearth the low tables and benches the bar itself was a beauty an aged chestnut that hed already noted the gallaghers kept wiped and polished the age of customers ranged from a baby in arms to the oldest man trevor believed hed ever seen who was balanced on a stool at the far end of the bar there were several others he took as locals just from the way they sat or smoked or sipped and three times that many who could be nothing other than tourists with their camera bags under their tables and their maps and guidebooks out the conversations were a mix of accents but predominant was that lovely lilt hed heard in his grandparents voices until the day they died he wondered if they hadnt missed hearing it themselves and why theyd never had a driving urge to come to ireland again what were the bitter memories that had kept them away whatever curiosity about them had skipped over a generation and now had caused him to come back and see for himself more he wondered why he should have recognized ardmore and the view from the cottage and even now know what he would see when he climbed the cliffs it was as if he carried a picture in his mind of this place one someone else had taken and tucked away for him theyd had no pictures to show him his father had visited once when hed been younger than trevor was now but his descriptions had been sketchy at best the reports of course there had been detailed photographs and descriptions in the reports finkle had brought back to new york but hed knownbefore hed opened the first file hed already known inherited memory he mused though he didnt put much stock in that sort of thing inheriting his fathers eyes the clear gray color the longlidded shape of them was one matter and he was told he had his grandfathers hands and his mind for business but how did a memory pass down through the blood he toyed with the idea as he continued to scan the room it didnt occur to him that he looked more the local than the tourist as he sat there in his work clothes his dark blond hair tousled from the mornings labor he had a narrow rawboned face that would put most in mind of a warrior or perhaps a scholar rather than a businessman the woman hed nearly married had said it looked to be honed and sculpted by some wild genius the faintest of scars marred his chin a result of a storm of flying glass during a tornado in houston and added to the overall impression of toughness it was a face that rarely gave anything away unless it was to trevor magees advantage at the moment it held a cool and remote expression but it shifted into easy friendliness when brenna came back toward the table with jude brenna he noted carried the tray ive asked jude to take a few moments to sit and tell you about lady gwen brenna began and was already unloading the order shes a seanachais at trevors raised eyebrow jude shook her head its gaelic for storyteller im not really im just and who has a book being published and another shes writing judes bookll be out at the end of this very summer brenna went on itll make a lovely gift so id keep it in mind when youre out shopping brenna jude rolled her eyes ill look for it some of shawns song lyrics are stories its an old and honored tradition oh hell like that one beaming now brenna scooped up the tray ill deal with this jude and give sinead a bit of a goose for you go ahead and get started ive heard it often enough before she has enough energy for twenty people a little tired now jude picked up her cup of tea im glad i found her for this project or that she found me id say it was a bit of both since youre both operators she caught herself winced i didnt mean that in a negative way wasnt taken in one baby kicking it puts a look in your eye trevor explained my sister just had her third third jude blew out a breath there are moments i wonder how im going to manage the one hes active but hes just going to have to wait another couple of months she ran a hand in slow circles over the mound of her belly soothing as she sipped you may not know it but i lived in chicago until just over a year ago he made a noncommittal sound of course he knew he had extensive reports my plan was to come here for six months to live in the cottage where my grandmother lived after she lost her parents shed inherited it from her cousin maude whod died shortly before i came here the woman my greatuncle was engaged to yes the day i arrived it was raining i thought i was lost i had been lost and not just geographically everything unnerved me you came alone to another country trevor cocked his head that doesnt sound like a woman easily unnerved thats something aidan would say and because it was she found herself very comfortable i suppose its more that i didnt know my own nerve at that point in any case i pulled into the street the driveway actually of this little thatchedroof cottage and in the upstairs window i saw a woman she had a lovely sad face and pale blond hair that fell around her shoulders she looked at me our eyes connected then brenna drove up it seemed id stumbled across my own cottage and the woman id seen in the window was lady gwen the ghost thats right yes it sounds impossible doesnt it or certainly unreasonable but i can tell you exactly what she looked like ive sketched her and i knew no more of the legend when i came here than you appear to know now id like to hear it then ill tell you jude paused as brenna came back sat and tucked into her meal she had an easy way with a story trevor noted a smooth and natural rhythm that put the listener into the tale she told him of a young maid whod lived in the cottage on the faerie hill a woman who cared for her father as her mother had been lost in childbirth who tended the cottage and its gardens and who carried herself with pride beneath the green slope of the hill was the silver glory of the faerie raft the palace where carrick ruled as prince he was also proud and he was handsome with a flowing mane of ravenblack hair and eyes of burning blue those eyes fell upon the maid gwen and hers upon him they plunged into love faerie and mortal and at night when others slept he would take her flying on his great winged horse never did they speak of that love for pride blocked the words one night gwens father woke to see her with carrick as they dismounted from his horse and in fear for her he betrothed her to another and ordered her to marry without delay carrick flew on his horse to the sun and gathered its burning sparks in his silver pouch when gwen came out of the cottage to meet him before her wedding he opened the bag and poured diamonds jewels of the sun at her feet take them and me he said for they are my passion for you he promised her immortality and a life of riches and glory but never once did he speak even then of love so she refused him and turned from him the diamonds that lay on the grass became flowers twice more he came to her the next time when she carried her first child in her womb from his silver pouch he poured pearls tears of the moon that hed gathered for her and these he told her were his longing for her but longing is not love and she had pledged herself to another when she turned away the pearls became flowers many years passed before he came the last time years during which gwen raised her children nursed her husband through his illness and buried him when she was an old woman years during which carrick brooded in his palace and swept through the sky on his horse he dived into the sea to wring from its heart the last of his gifts to her these he poured at her feet shimmering sapphires that blazed in the grass his constancy for her when now finally he spoke of love she could only weep bitter tears for her life was over she told him it was too late that she had never needed riches or promises of glory but only to know that he loved her loved her enough that she could have set aside her fear of giving up her world for his and as she turned to leave him this time as the sapphires bloomed into flowers in the grass his hurt and his temper lashed out in the spell he cast she would find no peace without him nor would they see each other again until three times lovers met and accepting each other risking hearts dared to choose love over all else three hundred years trevor thought later as he let himself into the house where gwen had lived and died a long time to wait hed listened to jude tell the tale in her quiet storytellers voice without interrupting not even to tell her that he knew parts of the story somehow he knew hed dreamed them he hadnt told her that he too could have described gwen down to the sea green of her eyes and the curve of her cheek hed dreamed her as well and had he realized nearly married sylvia because shed reminded him of that dream image a soft woman with simple ways it should have been right between them he thought as he headed upstairs to shower off the days dirt it still irritated him that it hadnt been in the end it just hadnt been right shed known it first and had gently let him go before hed admitted he already had his eye on the door maybe that was what bothered him most of all he hadnt had the courtesy to do the ending though shed forgiven him for it hed yet to forgive himself he caught the scent the minute he stepped into the bedroom delicate female like rose petals freshly fallen onto dewy grass a ghost who wears perfume he murmured oddly amused well if youre modest turn your back so saying he stripped where he stood then walked into the bath he spent the rest of his evening alone catching up on paperwork scanning the faxes that had come in on the machine hed brought with him shooting off replies he treated himself to a beer and stood outside with it in the last of the dying light listening to the aching silence and watching stars pulse to life tim riley whoever the hell he was looked to be right there was no rain coming yet the foundation he was building would set clean as he turned to go back in a streak of movement overhead caught his eye a blur of white and silver across the darkening sky but when he looked back for it narrowing his eyes to scan he saw nothing but stars and the rise of the quarter moon a falling star he decided a ghost was one thing but a flying horse ridden by the prince of the faeries was another entirely but he thought he heard the cheerful lilt of pipes and flutes dance across the silence as he shut the door of the cottage for the night chapter two darcy gallagher dreamed of paris strolling along the left bank on a perfect spring afternoon with the scent of flowers ripe in the air and the cloudless blue sky soaring overhead and perhaps best of all the weight of shopping bags heavy in her hands in her dreams she owned paris not for a brief weeks holiday but for as long as it contented her she could stop to while away an hour or two at a sidewalk cafe sipping lovely wine and watching the worldfor it seemed the whole of the worldwander by longlegged women in smart dresses and the darkeyed men who watched them the old woman on her red bicycle with her baguettes spearing up out of her bakery sack and the tidy children in their straight rows marching along in their prim school uniforms they belonged to her just as the wild and noisy traffic was hers and the cart on the corner bursting with flowers she didnt need to ride to the top of the eiffel tower to have paris at her feet as she sat sampling wine and cheese that had been aged to perfection she listened to the city that was hers for the taking there was music all around her in the cooing of the ubiquitous pigeons and the swirling whoosh when they took wing in the steady beep of horns the click of high thin heels on sidewalks the laughter of lovers even as she sighed blissfully happy the thunder rolled in at the rumble of it she glanced skyward clouds spewed in from the west dark and thick the brilliant sunlight fell into that false twilight that precedes a storm the rumble became a roar that had her leaping to her feet even while those around her continued to sit to chat to stroll as if they heard or saw nothing amiss snatching up her bags she started to dash away to safety to shelter and a bolt of lightning sizzling blue at the edges lanced into the ground at her feet she woke with a start the blood pounding in her ears and her own gasp echoing she was in her own rooms over the pub not in some freakish thunderstorm in paris she found some comfort in that in the familiar walls and quiet light found more comfort when she sat up and saw the clothes and trinkets shed treated herself to in paris strewn around the room well she was back to reality she thought but at least shed bagged a few trophies to bring home with her it had been a lovely week the perfect birthday present to give herself indulgent she admitted taking such a big chunk of her savings that way but what were savings for if a woman couldnt use them to celebrate in a spectacular way her first quarter century of living she would earn it back now that shed had her first good taste of real travel she intended to experience it on a more regular basis next year rome or florence or perhaps new york city wherever it was it would be someplace wonderful she would start her darcy gallagher holiday fund this very day shed been desperate to get away to see something almost anything that wasnt what she saw every day of her life restlessness was a sensation she was accustomed to even appreciated about herself but this had been like a panther inside her pacing and snarling and ready to claw its way out of her and leap on the people she loved best going away had been the best thing she could have done for herself and she was sure for those closest to her the restlessness was still there would always stir a bit inside her but that pacing and snarling had stopped the fact was she was glad to be home and looking forward to seeing her family her friends and all that was dear and she looked forward to telling them all shed seen and done during that glorious seven days to herself but now shed best get up and put things back in order shed gotten in too late the night before to do more than throw open her bags and admire her new things she needed to put them away proper and stack up the gifts shed bought for she was a woman who couldnt abide untidiness for long shed missed her family even through the giddy rush of seeing doing just being in paris shed missed having them around she wondered if it was shameful of her not to have expected to she couldnt say she missed the work the hefting of trays and serving yet another pint it had been glorious to be served for a change but she was eager to go down and see how the pub had fared without her even if it did mean spending the rest of the day on her feet she stretched lifting her arms high letting her head roll back focusing on the pleasure the movement gave her body she was a woman who didnt believe in wasting her senses any more than she would waste her pounds it wasnt until shed climbed out of bed that she realized the constant rumble outside wasnt thunder the construction she remembered now wasnt it going to be lovely hearing that din every blessed morning gathering up a robe she walked to the window to see what progress had been made in her absence she didnt know anything about the business of building but what she saw out her window looked to be a terrible mess created by a team of halfwit pranksters piles of rubble scars in the soil a large concrete floor bottoming out a hole in the ground squat towers of cinder block were being erected at the corners with spears of metal poking out of the tops and a great ugly truck was grinding away with an awful noise most of the workmen in their rough clothes and filthy boots were going about the business of making a bigger mess altogether she spotted brenna her cap perched on her head her boots mucked nearly to the knee seeing her this forever friend who was now her sister brought darcy a warm flood of pure pleasure it had shamed her and did still to know that part of the reason shed been wild to get away had been brenna and shawns wedding as well as her older brother aidan and his wife judes happy planning for the baby theyd have by end of summer oh she was thrilled for them all couldnt be more delighted with what theyd found together but the more content and settled they were the more discontent and unsettled she found herself shed wanted to ball her fists shake them in the air and demand wheres mine when will i have mine it was selfish she thought and it was sinful but she couldnt help it well now she was back and she hoped better darcy watched her friend stride around and give one of the laborers a hand with the blocks shes in her element here darcy mused pleased as a puppy with a teat all to herself she considered opening the window leaning out to call a hello and further considered just what having a woman leaning out a window in her robe would do to the rhythm of the work crew because the thought of causing a stir amused her darcy reached down she had the window open the first inch when she spotted the man watching her watching he was a tall one she noted shed always had a particular fondness for tall men he was hatless and his burnthoney hair was tousled by the breeze he wore the rough clothes of a laborer and in her opinion wore them better than most the long lanky build had something to do with that but she thought it was also a matter of confidence or arrogance she mused as he coolly kept his eyes on her face she didnt have a problem with arrogance as she had plenty of her own well now you might be an interesting diversion she thought a handsome face a bold eye if you can string words into a decent conversation you might be worth a bit of my time providing youre not married of course married or not she decided there was no harm in a bit of a flirt since she intended to have no more than that with a man who likely lived from one payday to the next so she smiled at him slowly warmly deliberately then touching a finger to her lips she blew him a saucy kiss she watched his teeth flash in appreciation then eased out of sight it was always best in darcys opinion to leave a man not only wanting more but wondering now there was a woman who packed a punch trevor thought and he still felt the impact if that was darcy gallagher and he assumed it was he had a good idea why the characteristically dour finkle had become tonguetied and brighteyed whenever her name had come up she was a stunner all right and he was going to appreciate a closer look what shed left him with now was the impression of sleepy beauty of dark and tumbled hair white skin and delicate features no false modesty there he decided shed met his open stare equally had taken his measure even as he took hers the carelessly blown kiss had definitely scored a point he thought darcy gallagher would be a very interesting pastime while he was in ardmore casually he hefted some blocks transferring them to brennas work area the mix suit you he asked nodding toward the trough that held fresh mortar it does yes good consistency were going through it fairly quickly but i think weve enough to do us if you see us running low order what you think we need i think your friends back from her vacation hmm distracted she knocked loose mortar from her trowel glanced up darcy pleased brenna looked toward the window lots of black hair wicked smile gorgeous that would be darcy i caught a glimpse of her in the window there if you want to go in and see her you can take a break well i would but she scooped up more mortar except that shed take one look at me as i am at the moment and bolt the door darcys very particular about her living quarters she wouldnt appreciate me trailing in dirt ill see her midday brenna spread her mortar with the quick efficiency of the experienced and hauled up the next block i can tell you this trevor your men are about to have their hearts broken its a rare one who brushes up near our darcy and walks away unaffected as long as we stay on schedule the crews hearts are their own concern oh ill keep them on schedule for you and darcy will give them happy if impossible dreams speaking of schedules im thinking we could have the plumbing roughed in on this section by end of week the pipe didnt arrive this morning as expected do you want me or dad to check on it when were done here no ill deal with it now then i hope you give them a good boot in the ass you can use the phone in the pubs kitchen i unlocked the back when i got here this morning ive the number in my book no i have it youll have the pipe today ive no doubt of that brenna murmured as he strode toward the kitchen door the kitchen was spotless it was one of the things trevor noticed and demanded when it came to any business he had a part in he imagined the gallaghers wouldnt think of him as having a part in their pub but from his viewpoint their business was now very much his concern he dug his book out of his pocket in new york his assistant would have located the number made the call she would have worked her way through the various steps until shed reached the person in charge only then if it was necessary would the matter have passed into trevors hands he had to admit though that saved time and frustration he rather enjoyed wading in at the bottom and administering that good boot in the ass in the five minutes it took him to reach the top level he spied the biscuit tin in the few days hed been in and around gallaghers hed come to know that when there were cookies they were homemade and they were spectacular he helped himself to a honey and oatmeal cookie as big as his fist as he annihilated the supply supervisor without ever raising his voice he jotted down the name in case retribution should become necessary and was given a personal guarantee that the pipe in question would be delivered to the site by noon satisfied with that he broke the connection and was considering a second cookie when he heard the footsteps on the stairs selecting peanut butter this time trevor leaned back against the counter and prepared for his first real eyeful of darcy gallagher like shawns cookies she was spectacular she stopped at the base of the stairs lifted one slim eyebrow her eyes were blue like her brothers a brilliant color against flawlessly white skin she left her hair loose so that it waved beguilingly over her shoulders she was dressed with a tailored smartness that seemed more suited to madison avenue than ardmore good morning to you having a tea break phone call he took a bite of the cookie as he watched her the voice irish and smoky as a turf fire was as straightout sexy as the rest of her well im making some tea here as ive run out upstairs and dont like to start my day without makes me cross she skimmed her gaze over him as she moved to the stove will you have a cup to wash down the biscuit or must you go straight back to work i can take a minute youre fortunate your employers not so strict ive heard that magee runs a very tight ship so he does while the kettle heated darcy dealt with the pot the man was better up close she liked the sharp angles of his face the little scar on his chin it gave him a dangerous look and she was so bloody weary of safe men no wedding ring she noted though that didnt always tell the tale youve come all the way from america she continued to work on his theater thats right a long way from home i hope you were able to bring your family with you if you mean wife im not married he broke the cookie in half offered her a share amused she took it that leaves you free to travel for your work doesnt it and what is it you do whatevers necessary oh yes she thought and nibbled on the cookie just dangerous enough id say that makes you a handy man to have around and about im going to be around and about here for some time yet he waited while she lifted the sputtering kettle poured the boiling water into the pot would you like to have dinner she sent him a long sidelong glance added a hint of a smile sure i like a good meal now and then and interesting company with it but im just back from my holiday and wont have time off for a bit my brother aidans a hard man with a schedule how about breakfast she set the kettle down i might enjoy that perhaps youll ask me again in a day or two once ive settled back in perhaps i will she was vaguely surprised and a little disappointed that he hadnt pursued the invitation then and there she was used to men pleading a bit but she turned took out a thick mug for his tea what part of america are you from then new york new york city her eyes sparkled as she turned back oh is it wonderful a lot of it is it has to be the most exciting city in the world she cupped the mug in both hands as she imagined it as shed imagined it countless times before maybe not the most beautiful i thought paris so beautifulfemale and sly and sexual i think of new york as a mandemanding and reckless and so full of energy you have to run to keep up amused at herself she set down his mug it probably doesnt strike you that way since youre used to being there your whole life i doubt you think of ardmore or this area as magic he saw her eyebrow arch up again at his words as a small and nearly perfect corner of the world where you can reach back or forward in time as suits you and while theres energy here it comes with patience so you dont have to run to keep up its interesting isnt it how people see whats the everyday to someone else she poured out his tea id think a man who can philosophize so easily over tea and biscuits might be wasting his talents hauling bricks ill keep that in mind thanks for the tea he moved toward the door passing close enough to appreciate that she smelled every bit as good as she looked ill bring back the mug mind you do shawn knows his kitchen supplies down to the last spoon come to the window again sometime he added as he opened the door i liked looking at you she smiled to herself when he left well now that goes both ways new york city debating how she would answer him the next time he asked her out she picked up the pot of tea to carry it upstairs the back door flew open youre back brenna took one leap inside little pellets of drying cement flew keep your distance darcy held up the pot like a shield christ jesus brenna you have as much of that muck on your person as you do on the brick block and not by any means dont worry i wont hug you damn right you wont but i missed you though she was touched darcy let out a snort youre too busy being a newlywed to have missed me i can do both can you spare a cup of that ive ten minutes coming all right then but get some old newspaper to put on the chair before you sit down i missed you too darcy admitted as she took out another mug i knew you would i still say it was adventurous of you to go off to paris like that by yourself did you love it brenna asked as she dutifully laid out newspaper was it everything you wanted it to be it was yes everything about it the sounds and the scents the buildings the shops and cafes i couldve spent a month just looking now if theyd just learn to make a decent cup of tea she sipped at her own but i made out fine with wine everyone dresses so smart even when they arent trying to i got some marvelous clothes the shopkeepers are very aloof and act as if theyre doing you a great favor in taking your money i found it added to the overall experience im glad you had a good holiday you look rested rested i barely slept the whole week im energized darcy decided of course id planned to lay like a slug until i had to get up for work this morning but that noise outsides enough to keep the dead alert youll have to get used to that were making fine progress not from my window it looks like a rubble heap with ditches well have the foundation finished and the plumbing roughed in by the end of the week its a good crew the ones from new york are well trained and the ones from here dad and i picked ourselves magee doesnt tolerate slackers and he knows every step of putting a building up so youd better be on your toes which tells me youre enjoying yourself tremendously and id best get back to it wait i got you a present i was counting on it ill go up and get it i dont want you tracking through my rooms i was counting on that too brenna commented as darcy hurried up the stairs its not boxed darcy called down it was easier to pack just keeping it in a bag jude was wise in telling me to take an extra suitcase as it was but yours didnt take up much room she came back with a small shopping bag then narrowed her eyes at brennas hand ill take it out for you she slid out a thin bundle wrapped in tissue carefully uncovered it then held it up brennas mouth fell open shawns going to love it darcy decided it was a short narrowstrapped nightgown in a shimmering green that was nearly transparent hed have to be a complete dunderhead not to brenna agreed once she had her voice back im trying to imagine wearing that slowly wicked amusement brightened her eyes i think ill love it too its beautiful darcy ill keep it for you until youre cleaned up and ready to go home thanks brenna kissed darcy on the cheek mindful not to transfer any dirt i wont say ill think of you when im wearing it nor do i think youd want me to that i dont dont let shawn see it brenna added as she started out ive a mind to surprise him it was almost too easy to fall back into routine though shawn refused to bicker with her because shed bought him a fancy french cookbook in paris everything else just slipped right into place as if she thought shed never been away for the life of her darcy wasnt sure if that pleased or annoyed her the lunch shift kept her busy added to the regulars were the tourists who were beginning to come in packs for the season and added to them were the men hired to work on the theater only halftwelve darcy thought and not a single empty table in the place she was grateful aidan had hired sinead on for an extra pair of hands but mother of god the girl was slower than a snail with a limp miss were still waiting to order darcy caught the tone british public school annoyed and put her best smile on her face it was sineads station but the girl was off god knew where im so sorry what would you like to have today well both have todays special and a glass of smithwicks ill have your drinks right back to you she wove her way to the bar taking three more orders as she went moving fast she scooted under the passthrough called out the drinks to aidan and swung straight into the kitchen grace under pressure trevor noted hed slipped in and joined some of his crew at a back table the perfect vantage point he decided to watch the very attractive miss gallagher at work there was a light of battle in her eye when she came back out of the kitchen and there it remained no matter how brightly she chatted up the customers she served drinks and food showering goodwill over the patrons but trevor noted that those sharp blue eyes were scanning and when they lit on sinead as the girl wandered back in from the direction of the rest rooms they fired oh honey trevor thought you are meat shes going to chew you up and spit you out which he thought was precisely how he would have dealt with a lazy employee he gave darcy full marks for holding her temper and doing no more than giving the new waitress a fulminating look and a quick order to tend to her stations a busy lunch hour wasnt the time for a dressingdown he imagined sineads ears would be burned off after shift and he figured it was his lucky day as darcy was even now working her way back to his table and what can i get you fine handsome men this afternoon she got out her pad then focused those glorious eyes on trevor you look hungry you cant go wrong with the special at gallaghers trevor said that you cant will you have a pint to go with it tea iced now she rolled her eyes thats a yanks way of ruining a perfectly good pot of tea but well accommodate you and for you gentlemen i sure like the way yall do fish and chips darcy smiled at the scrawny man with a pleasantly homely face my brother will appreciate that and where are you from if you dont mind my asking for thats a lovely accent georgia maam donny brime from macon georgia but ive never heard anyone talk prettier than you and id love some of that iced tea like the boss here and just when i was thinking you must have some irish in you and for you sir ill have the meat pie friesi mean chipson the side and the burly man with a scraggly dark beard slid a sorrowful glance at trevor make it iced tea all around ill be back with your drinks quick as i can now that donny said with a long sigh as darcy walked away is the most beautiful thing ive seen in my entire life makes you glad to be a man doesnt it lou lou stroked his beard ive got a fifteenyearold daughter and if i caught a man looking at her the way i figure i just looked at that tasty little dish there id have to kill him your wife and daughter still planning on coming over trevor asked him as soon as josies out of school nother couple of weeks trevor settled back while his two men talked of family there was no one waiting for him at home or looking forward to the day she could fly over and join him it wasnt something that troubled him it was better to live alone than to make a mistake as hed nearly done living alone meant he could come and go as he needed to as his business demanded and without the guilt or tension that regular travel could add to a relationship no matter how much his mother might pine for him to settle down and give her grandchildren the simple fact was that his life ran more efficiently solo he glanced at a nearby table where a young family was crowded together the woman was doing her best to distract a fussy infant while the man frantically mopped up the soft drink their whining toddler had just managed to spill all over everything nothing efficient about it trevor mused darcy delivered their tea apparently unaffected by the fact that the toddler had gone from whine to wail your meals will be out directly and if youve a need for more tea just give me a sign still smiling she turned to the next table and handed the young father a stack of napkins all the while waving away his apologies oh its not so much of a thing is it little man she crouched down to the little boys level wipes up doesnt it but such things scare off the faeries you might lure them back if they werent afraid your tears would flood them out again where are the faeries he demanded in the testy voice of a child who desperately needs a nap oh theyre hiding now but theyll come back when theyre sure you mean them no harm could be theyll be dancing around your bed next time you lay your head on your pillow i bet your sisters seeing them now darcy nodded toward the baby who had drifted off to sleep thats why shes smiling the boy subsided into sniffles and watched his sister sleep with both suspicion and interest that trevor thought as she moved on to the next table was efficient chapter three now sinead can we go over the things we talked about when i hired you with the pub cleared between shifts and her brothers ordered out darcy sat across from her new waitress aidan ran the pub it was true and shawn ruled the kitchen but it was understood that when it came to the serving darcy held the controls sinead shifted her skinny butt on the stool and tried to concentrate well you said as to how i was to take the orders in a friendly manner aye thats true darcy sipped her soft drink and waited and what else do you remember ah jesus god darcy thought can the girl do anything faster than the pace of a turtle well sinead chewed her lip and drew little patterns on the table with her fingertips that i was to make certain that the right food and drink was served again in a friendly manner to the proper customers and do you remember sinead anything about the taking and serving of those orders in an efficient and timely manner as well i do yes sinead dropped her gaze to her own glass all but pinned her eyes to it its all so confusing darcy with everyone wanting something and at the same time that may be but you see the thing with a pub is people tend to come in wanting something and our job is to see they get it you cant do your job if you hide in the loo half your shift jude said i was coming along sinead raised her eyes now and they brimmed with tears that wont work with me darcy leaned forward filling your eyes up and letting tears shimmer only works on men and soft hearts and thats not what youre dealing with here so sniff them back girl and listen the sniff was more of a wet snuffle but darcy nodded you came to me asking for work and promising that youd work hard now its barely three weeks since that day and youre already slacking im asking you straight out and you answer in the same manner do you want this job sinead dabbed at her eyes the new mascara shed purchased out of her first weeks pay smeared some might have found the look pitiful and softened darcy only thought the girl needed to practice shedding tears with more grace i do i need the work needing work and doing work are two different matters as youre about to discover darcy decided i want you back here in two hours for the evening shift tears dried up quickly with sheer shock but ive the night off not anymore you dont youll come back prepared to do the job youre paid to do if you want to keep it i want you moving smartly from table to table from table to kitchen and back again if something confuses you or theres something you dont remember or understand you can come to me and ill help you out but she paused waiting until sinead met her eyes again i wont tolerate you leaving your stations youve got to pee thats fine but each time i note you sliding into the back and staying over five minutes at it im docking you a pound ive got a bladder problem darcy would have laughed if it hadnt been so pathetic now thats bullshit and the both of us know it if you had any problems with your plumbing idve heard as your mother would have told brennas mother and so it would have come to my ears trapped sinead shifted from apologetic to pout but a pound darcy aye a pound so consider before you nip off what its costing you which she already decided would go into her own wish jar as shed be the one taking up the slack weve a reputation here at gallaghers thats generations in the making she continued you work for us you meet the standards we set if you cant or wont you get the boot this is your second chance sinead you wont get a third aidans not so hard as you darcy lifted a brow as sineads bottom lip trembled well now youre not dealing with aidan are you youve two hours be on time or ill assume youve decided this isnt the job for you ill be here obviously irked sinead got to her feet i can handle the work its nothing but hauling trays about doesnt take any brains darcy sent her the most pleasant of smiles there you are then when i save enough money so i can marry billy im leaving all of this behind me thats a fine ambition but this is today go on now and walk off your temper before you say something youll be sorry for later darcy sat where she was as sinead strode across the room since shed expected the girl to slam the door she only rolled her eyes at the bullet crack of it if she used half that energy for the job we wouldnt have had this pleasant little chat she shrugged her shoulders to relieve some of the tension curled her toes in her shoes to work out some of the ache then got to her feet gathering the glasses she turned to carry them to the bar and trevor came through the kitchen door that she thought was a fine example of what god had intended when hed designed man he might look a tad rough and dirty from the days work but it didnt mar the appeal were closed at the moment she told him the back door was unlocked were a friendly sort of place she carried the glasses to the bar but im afraid i cant sell you a pint right now i didnt come in for a pint didnt you now she knew what a man was after when he had his eyes on her that way but the game required playing what are you looking for then i wasnt looking for anything when i got up this morning he leaned on the bar they both knew what they were about he thought it made the dance simpler when both people knew the steps then i saw you youre a smooth one arent you mr new york city trev since youve got a couple hours free why dont you spend them with me and how would you know i have free time i came in on the end of your employer directive shes wrong you know about what it does take brains and knowing how to use them you do it surprised her it was a rare man who noticed she had a mind and a rarer one who commented on it so youre attracted to my brain are you no at the quick humor in his eyes and a flash of grin a nice little ripple moved up her spine im attracted to the package but im interested in your brain i like an honest man under most circumstances she considered him another moment he wouldnt do of course for more than a pleasant flirtation no wouldnt do she thought and was surprised by a very real tug of regret but he was right about one thing time she had i wouldnt mind a walk on the beach but arent you supposed to be working my hours are flexible lucky for you she moved down the bar lifted the passthrough and maybe for me as well he came through the opening then stopped so they stood close and facetoface one question ill try to give you one answer why isnt there someone i have to kill before i do this he leaned down and brushed his lips very lightly over hers she dropped the passthrough back in place im choosy she said she walked to the door then sent him a level and amused look over her shoulder and ill let you know if i choose to have you try that again trev of new york with a bit more enthusiasm fair enough he stepped outside with her waiting while she locked the front door the air smelled of sea and flowers it was something she loved about ardmore the scents and sounds and the wonderful spread of the water there were such possibilities in that vast sea sooner or later it would bump into land again another place with new people different things there was wonder in that and comfort here she supposed raising a hand in greeting as kathy duffy called out to her from her dooryard is this your first time in ireland darcy asked him as they walked toward the beach no ive been to dublin several times one of my favorite cities she scanned the beach noting the pockets of tourists automatically she angled away and toward the cliffs the shops and restaurants are wonderful you cant find that in ardmore why arent you in dublin my familys herewell part of them our parents are settled in boston now and i dont have a burning desire to live in dublin when there are so many places in the world and i havent seen nearly enough of them yet what have you seen she looked up at him a rare one indeed she thought most of the men of her acquaintance wanted to talk about themselves but theyd play it his way for now paris just recently dublin of course and a great deal of my own country but the pub hampers traveling she turned walking backward for a bit with her hand up to shield her eyes i wonder what itll look like when hes done with it trevor stopped studied the pub as she was the theater yes ive looked at the drawings but i dont have an eye for such things she lifted her face to the breeze of salt and sea the familys pleased with it and theyre very particular so is magee enterprise i imagine so though its difficult to understand why the man would pick a small village in the south of ireland for his project jude she says part of its sentiment it surprised and nearly disconcerted him to have the truth spoken so casually does she do you know the story of johnnie magee and maude fitzgerald ive heard it they were engaged to be married and he went off to war and was killed in france and she never married but lived alone in her cottage on faerie hill all her days long days as old maude was one hundred and one years when she passed the boys mother johnnie magees mother grieved herself to death within a few years they said she favored him and could find no comfort in her husband her other children or her faith it was odd to walk here and discuss these pieces of his family pieces he had never met with a woman he barely knew odder still that he was learning more of them from her than hed learned from anyone else id think losing a child has to be the biggest grief im sure it is but what of those who were alive yet and needed her when you forget what you have for what youve lost grievings an indulgence youre right what happened to them the story is that her husband finally took to the drink excessively wallowing in whiskeys no better or worse than wallowing in grief i suppose and her daughters i think there were three married as soon as they could and scattered her other son he who was more than ten years younger than johnnie eventually took his wife and his little boy away from ireland to america where he made his fortune never did he come back nor they say contact those left here of family and friends she turned and looked back at the pub again it takes a hard heart never to look back even once yeah trevor murmured it does but so the seeds of magee enterprise were sowed first in ardmore it seems the magee running matters now is willing to put his time and money into seeing those seeds grow here do you have a problem with that no indeed itll be good for us and for him as well most likely business is business but theres room for a bit of sentiment as long as it doesnt cloud the bottom line which is profit just profit she angled back gestured out to the bay theres tim rileys boat coming in for the day hes been out with his crew since before first light its a hard life that of a fisherman tim and those like him go out day after day casting their nets fighting weather and breaking their backs why do you suppose they do it why dont you tell me they love it she tossed her hair back watching the boat ride a crest no matter how they bitch and complain they love the life and tim he cares for his boat like a mother her firstborn he sells his catch fair so theres no one would say riley hes not to be trusted so theres love of the work tradition reputation but at the bottom of it all is profit without an eye on making a living its only a hobby isnt it he caught a curl of her hair as it flew in the wind maybe im attracted to your mind after all she laughed at that and began walking again do you love what you do yes yes i do what is it appeals to you most what did you see when you looked out your window this morning well i saw you didnt i she was rewarded by the humor that moved warmly over his face and other than that i saw a mess exactly i enjoy most an empty lot or an old building in disrepair the possibilities of what can be done about them possibilities she murmured looking out to sea again i understand about that so you enjoy building something out of nothing or out of whats been neglected yes changing it without damaging it if you cut down a tree is what youre putting in its place worth the sacrifice does it matter in the long run or it is only shortterm ego again the philosopher his face suited that even while the windblown hair and little scar spoke another less quiet side are you the conscience of magee then i like to think so an odd sentiment for a laborer she thought but it appealed to her the fact was she couldnt at the moment find one thing about him that didnt appeal up on the cliffs there beyond the big hotel men once built grandly the structures are ruins now but the heart remains and many who go there feel that the irish understand sacrifice and why and when it matters youll have to find time to walk there ill plan on it id like it better if you found time to show me the way thats another possibility judging the hour she turned to walk back lets build on it he took her hand to stop her enjoyed the faint hint of irritation that came into her eyes i want to see you i know because it was the simplest angle and never failed her she tilted her head and allowed a teasing smile to play on her lips i havent made up my mind about you as yet a woman has to be careful when dealing with strange and handsome men sweetheart a woman with your arsenal uses men for target practice irritated she tugged her hand free only if they ask for it having a pleasing face doesnt make me heartless no but having a pleasing face and a sharp mind is a potent combination and itd be a waste if you didnt know how to use both she considered flicking him off and walking away but damned if he didnt intrigue her sure and this is the strangest of conversations i dont know if i like you or not but maybe im interested enough to take some time to find out but at the moment i have to head back into work it wouldnt do for me to be late after ive lectured sinead she underestimates you i beg your pardon she underestimates you trevor repeated as they walked back across the sand she sees the surfacea beautiful woman with a keen sense of fashion whos passing the time working in her family business one her brothers run a woman who in her mind holds the lowest position on the ladder and doesnt do much more than take orders darcys eyes narrowed now but not against the sun oh is that how you see it no thats how your sinead sees it but shes young inexperienced so she doesnt see that you have as much to do with the running of gallaghers as your brothers the way you look doesnt hurt a thing when it comes to setting the atmosphere but i watched you today he glanced down at her you never missed a step even when you were pissed off you never broke rhythm if youre trying to get round me with compliments its in the way of working though i have to say i cant remember having any like these from a man before no they all tell you youre the most beautiful woman theyve ever seen its a waste of time to state the obvious and it must get tedious for you she stopped as they reached the street stared at him a moment then laughed youre a rare one trev from new york i think i like you and wouldnt mind spending a bit of time here and there in your company now if you were just rich id marry you on the spot so you could keep me entertained and indulged all my days is that what youre looking for darcy indulgence and why not ive expensive tastes that i want to feed until i meet a man whos willing and able to fill my plate ill go on filling my own she reached up to touch his cheek doesnt mean i cant have a meal or two with another along the way honesty too when it suits me and since i have a feeling youd cut through even a wellcrafted lie quick enough why waste the effort there it is again she sent him a puzzled look as they crossed the street what efficiency i find that very arousing in a woman christ youre the oddest of ducks since i find it amusing to arouse you so easily ill take you up on that breakfast offer tomorrow she jingled her keys in her pocket and wondered why the idea was so appealing eight oclock ill meet you in the restaurant at the hotel im not staying at the hotel oh well if youre at the b and b we can there you are darcy aidan came up behind his keys already in his hand jude thought you were coming down the house to visit i was distracted i see you met my sister he said to trevor why dont you come in for a pint on the house actually i have some work i was also distracted trevor said with a glance at darcy but ill take you up on the offer later always welcome your men are keeping us busy now with darcy back im wagering theyll keep us busier yet he winked and shot the key into the lock likely well have a seinsiun going later tonight come in if youve the chance and youll get a small idea of what well be offering those who come through on the way to your theater ill look forward to it darcy did you have that chat with sinead she kept her eyes on trevors its dealt with ill be coming in to tell you about it in just a minute thats fine then good evening to you trevor ill see you later your men darcy said when the door closed your theater thats right and that would make you magee she took a careful breath knowing it would only keep her calm for the short term why didnt you tell me you didnt ask what difference does it make i think it makes a difference in how you presented yourself to me i dont care to be deceived and toyed with he slapped a hand on the door before she could wrench it open weve had a couple of conversations he said evenly there was nothing deceptive about them then we have different standards in that area maybe youre just ticked off that im rich after all and now youll have to marry me he sent her a smile designed to charm and got nothing but a withering stare in return i dont find your humor appropriate now step back from the door were not yet open to the public is this our first fight no she did manage to yank open the door now nearly bashing his face with it its our last she didnt slam it but he clearly heard the click of the lock through the thick wood i dont think so he said with a great deal more cheer than another man might have felt under the circumstances nope i dont think so he strolled down to his car and thought it might be a good opportunity to wander up to the cliffs and take a look at the ruins everyone had told him about this was the ireland hed come to see the ancient and the sacred the wild and the mystic he was surprised to find himself alone as it seemed to him that any who were drawn to this area would be compelled to come here high on the cliffs where the ruins brooded he circled the steep stone gables of the oratory that had been built in the saints name it stood on the rough and uneven ground and was guarded he supposed by the souls who rested there three stone crosses stood guard as well with the fresh water quiet in the well beneath them hed been told it was a lovely walk from here around the headland but he found himself more inclined to linger where he was darcy was right he decided the structure might have tumbled but the heart of it lived he stepped back respectful enough or just superstitious enough not to step on graves he assumed the small pitted stones were graves and glancing down he saw the marker for maude fitzgerald wise woman so here you are he murmured theres a picture of you with my greatuncle in one of the old albums my mother salvaged when my grandfather died he didnt keep many pictures from here isnt it odd that he had one of you he hunkered down touched and gently amused to see that flowers had been planted over her in a soft blanket of color you must have had a fondness for flowers your garden at the cottage is lovely had a way with growing things did maude at the comment trevor looked back toward the well then rose the man who stood there was oddly dressed all in silver that sparkled in the sun a costume trevor assumed for some event at the hotel he was certainly the theatrical sort with his long flow of black hair wicked smile and lightningblue eyes dont startle easily do you well thats to your favor a man who startles easily shouldnt pass the time here great spot trevor added glancing around again i favor it youd be the magee come from america to build dreams and find answers more or less and youd be carrick prince of the faeries pleased to make your acquaintance uhhuh the bland amusement in trevors tone had carricks brows beetling youd have heard of me even over in your america sure either the man was a lunatic or he wasnt willing to step out of character probably both trevor decided it so happens im staying in the cottage over the hill i know where the devil youre staying and i dont care for that indulgent tone youre using i didnt bring you here to have you make sport of me you brought me here mortals carrick grumbled they like to think everythings their own doing your destinys here tied with mine if i planted a few seeds to get you moving on it who has a better right pal if youre going to drink this early in the day you ought to stay out of the sun why dont i give you a hand back down to the hotel drunk youre thinking im drunk carrick threw back his head and laughed until he was forced to hold his sides bloody bonehead drunk well show you drunk just give me a moment here to recover myself after several long breaths carrick continued lets see here something not so subtle im thinking for i see already youre the cynical sort ah ive got it his eyes went dark as cobalt and trevor would have sworn the tips of the mans fingers began to glow gold then in his hands was a sphere clear as water swimming in it was the image of trevor himself and darcy standing together on the beach while the celtic sea charged the shore beside them have a look at your destiny shes fair of face and strong of will and hungry of heart are you clever enough to win what the fates offer you he flicked his wrist sent the globe flying toward trevor instinctively he reached out felt his fingers pass through something cool and soft then the globe burst like a bubble hell of a trick trevor managed then looked over at the well he was alone again with just the stir of the grass in the wind for company hell of a trick he repeated and more shaken than he cared to admit he stared down at his empty hands chapter four dreams haunted him through the night trevor had always dreamed in broad and vivid strokes but since coming to faerie hill cottage his dreams had taken on a finite crystalline quality as if someone had sharpened a lens on a camera the odd man from the cemetery rode a white winged horse over a wide blue sea and trevor felt the broad back and bunching muscles of the mythic steed beneath him in the distance the sky and water were separated clearly like a thin pencil stroke drawn with a ruler the water was sapphire the sky gray as smoke the horse plunged its powerful forelegs cutting through the surface spewing up water that trevor could see could feel in individual drops he could taste the salt of it on his lips then they were in that swirling underworld cold so cold with the dark underlit with some eerie glow there were flickers of iridescent light like faerie wings fluttering and the music playing through the pulse beat of water was pipes deeper still deeper flying down in this element as smoothly as they had flown in the air the thrill of it coursed through him like blood there on the soft floor of the seabed a hillock of darker wilder blue throbbed like a waiting heart into this the man who called himself a prince thrust his arm to the shoulder and trevor felt the slick texture of the mass on his own flesh the vibration ripple up his own arm his hand flexed closed twisted and he wrenched free the heart of the sea for her he thought clutching it tight this is my constancy only for her when he woke his hand was still fisted but the only heart that pounded was his own as baffled as he was shaken trevor opened his hand it was empty of course it was empty but he felt the charge of power fading from his palm the heart of the sea it was ridiculous he didnt have to be a marine biologist to know there was no shimmering blue mass no organic life beating away on the floor of the celtic sea it was all nothing more than an entertaining scene played by the subconscious he told himself full of symbolism he was sure that he could analyze to death if he were so inclined which he wasnt he got out of bed heading for the bath absently he pushed a hand through his hair and found it damp he stopped short lowering his hand slowly staring at it cautious he brought his hand to his face sniffed sea water naked he lowered himself to the side of the bed again hed never considered himself a particularly fanciful man in fact he liked to think he was more grounded in reality than most but there was no denying that hed dreamed of flying through the sea on a winged horse and had awakened with his hair damp from sea water how did a rational man explain that explanations required information it was time he started gathering it it was too early to call new york but it was never too early to fax after hed dressed for the day trevor settled into the little office across from his bedroom and composed the first message to his parents mom and dad hope youre both well the projects on schedule and remains on budget as well though after a couple of days observation ive concluded the otooles could handle the job without me i prefer staying at least for the present to supervise theres also the matter of community relations most of the village and the surrounding parish seem to be in favor of the theater but the construction disturbs the general tranquility of the area i think its wise for me to remain visible and involved i also intend to continue the preliminary publicity from here meanwhile im enjoying the area its as beautiful as you told me dad and youre remembered fondly here the two of you should take some time and come over gallaghers is as you remembered and finkle reported a wellrun friendly and popular business connecting the theater to it was a brilliant concept dad im going to spend more time there getting a clearer feel for just how it all runs and what changes or improvements we might want to implement to benefit the theater mom youd particularly like the cottage where im staying its a postcardand better yet is reputed to have its own ghost you and aunt maggie would get a kick out of it no unearthly visitation to report im afraid but since im trying to drench myself in local color i wonder if the two of you can pass on any information you might have on the legend based here its something about starcrossed lovers of course a maid and a faerie prince ill call when i get a chance love trev he read it over to be sure hed kept his request casual then shot it off to his parents private line the next fax was to his assistant and was much more to the point angela i need you to research and relay any and all information available on a legend local to ardmore references carrick prince of faeries gwen fitzgerald faerie hill cottage old parish waterford sixteenth century trevor magee once hed transmitted he checked his watch though it was just past eight it was too early to tap his other source hed wait an hour before he paid a visit to jude gallagher with the business completed the sudden and desperate urge for coffee broke through it was strong enough to have him abandoning everything else the one thing he missed was his automatic coffeemaker and its timer it was something he intended to purchase at the first opportunity there was in trevors mind little more civilized in this world than waking up to the scent of coffee just brewed as he came to the base of the steps a knock sounded on the door with his mind already in the kitchen his system already focused on that first jolting sip he opened the door and concluded there was perhaps one thing more civilized than waking up to coffee she was standing on his little stoop a smart man a wise man would forgo a lifetime of coffee for a beautiful blueeyed woman wearing a snug scoopnecked sweater and a comegetme smile and he was a very smart man good morning do you wake up looking like that youll have to do more than offer me breakfast before you get the chance to find out for yourself breakfast i believe that was the nature of the invitation right his mind wasnt clicking rapidly along without its daily dose of caffeine you surprise me darcy shed intended to are you feeding me or arent you come in he opened the door wider well see what we can do she stepped inside with a light brush of her body against his she smelled like candycoated sin she wandered by to glance in the front parlor it was very much as maude had left it with its pretty fancies set out here and there the shelf thick with books and the soft old throw tossed over the faded fabric of the sofa youre a tidy one arent you she turned back i approve of a tidy man or perhaps you consider it efficiency efficiency is tidyand its my life with his eyes on hers he laid a hand on her shoulder pleased when she simply stared back at him with that same mild amusement on her face i was just wondering why its not cold cold shoulders are a predictable reaction and predictability is tedious i bet youre never tedious perhaps on the rare occasion im annoyed with you but i still want my breakfast she skirted around him then glanced over her shoulder are you cooking or are we going out cooking now im surprised intrigued a man in your position knowing his way around a kitchen i make a worldfamous cheddarandmushroom omelet ill be the judge of thatand im very particular about my tastes she walked back toward the kitchen and left him blowing out one long appreciative breath before he followed she sat at the little table in the center of the room draping her arm over the back of her chair and looking very much like a woman accustomed to being served though his system no longer needed a jumpstart trevor made coffee first while im sitting here watching you deal with some homey chores darcy began why dont you tell me why you let me babble on yesterday about your family and ancestors and seemed so interested in information that would be already familiar to you because it wasnt familiar to me shed suspected that after shed calmed down he didnt strike her as a man whod waste time asking questions when he already had the answers why is that if you dont mind me asking he would mind usually but he felt he owed her an explanation my grandfather had very little to say about his family here or ardmore or ireland for that matter while he waited for the coffee to brewplease god soonhe got out what he needed for the omelet he was a difficult man with a very hard shell my impression was that whatever hed left here made him bitter so it wasnt discussed i see not clearly darcy mused as it was hard to understand a family that didnt discuss everything at trevors eyebrows lifted but he turned back for flatware a generous sort i dont know about that but the pearl was given to him by carrick at old maudes grave and now its brennas the first offered was diamonds jewels of the sun ask jude about that if you have an interest the third and last he offered were sapphires from the heart of the sea the heart of the sea his dream came back to him fast and clear so that he once again stared down at his own hand a pretty story youre thinking and so i would myself if those i know hadnt become part of it theres one more step that has to be taken one more pair of hearts that have to meet and promise to each other she sipped her coffee watching him over the rim the others who lived here in this cottage since old maude passed were step one and step two he said nothing for a moment just retrieved the toast that had popped up are you warning me that ive been selected as step three it follows smoothly doesnt it now however practicalminded a man you might be magee youve irish blood in your veins and you share that blood with a man who once loved the woman who lived in the place as candidates go for the breaking of spells youd be my pick considering he took out the butter and jam and a practicalminded woman like you believes in spells believe in them she leaned toward him as he sat darling i cast them the way she looked at the moment her eyes hot and bright her smile just the other side of wicked hed have believed her a witch without hesitation setting aside your considerable powers are you going to tell me you believe this story and all its parts as reality i do yes she picked up her fork and if i were you and living here id take great care with my heart she lifted a forkful of creamy egg and cheese slid it between her lips there are those who also believe if one loses that heart here its forever pledged like maudes the idea of it worried him more than he wanted to admit why are you telling me this well i wondered if youd ask youre an attractive man and i like the look of you added to thatand im not ashamed to say its a big added to that to meyoure rich i think theres a good possibility i might enjoy your company as well are you proposing she shot a grin at him wide and gorgeous not quite yet im telling you this because ive the impression youre a man who sees through pretenses as easy as a knife slides through butter she picked up her own knife and demonstrated on the stick hed taken from the refrigerator im not a woman who falls in love ive tried she said and for a moment the light in her eyes clouded then she shrugged and spread the butter on a slice of toast its just not in me and it may be that were not what destiny has in store for each other but if we are i think we might come to an arrangement that pleases both of us under the circumstances he decided another refill of coffee couldnt hurt he got up to top off the cups ive met a lot of people in my business sampled a lot of cultures and i have to say this is the strangest breakfast conversation ive ever had i believe in fate trevor in the meeting of like minds in comfort and in honesty when it serves its purpose she took another bite of omelet do you i believe in like minds comfort and honesty when it serves its purpose as to fate thats a different matter theres too much irish in your blood for you not to be a fatalist she told him is that the nature of the beast of course and at the same time we manage to be optimistically sentimental and full of dark and exciting superstition as for honesty her eyes twinkled at him now thats a matter of degrees and viewpoints for whats better all in all than a welltold tale embroidered with colorful exaggerations however honesty is something i think you appreciate so whats wrong with letting you know that if you fall in love with me ill likely let you he enjoyed the rest of his coffee and her ive tried to fall in love it didnt take for me either for the first time sympathy moved over her face and she reached out to touch his hand its as painful not being able to stumble i think as the fall would be he looked down at their joined hands what a sad pair we are darcy best isnt it to know yourself and your limitations it could be that some pretty young woman will catch your eye and your heart will pop right out of your chest and plop at her feet she shrugged her shoulders but meanwhile i wouldnt mind having you spend some of your time and your not inconsiderable funds on me mercenary are we yes i am she gave his hand a friendly pat then went back to her breakfast youve never had to count your pennies have you got me there but if you ever have to earn a few extra you make a very fine omelet she rose taking both of the plates to the sink i appreciate a decent cook as its not a skill i have nor one i care to develop he came up behind her ran his hands over her shoulders down her arms and back again in one long stroke going to wash my dishes no she wanted to stretch like a satisfied cat but thought it wiser not to but i might be persuaded to dry them for you she let him turn her around kept her eyes on his as he lowered his head then with not a little regret placed her fingers on his lips before they touched hers heres what im thinking either of us could seduce the other with considerable style if not much effort okay let me go first her laugh was low and smooth and however satisfied we might be after its early days yet lets keep that adventure for another time he gathered her a little closer why wait youre the fatalist clever but well wait because ive a mind to ive a very strong mind she tapped his lips with her finger once then drew back me too deliberately he lifted her hand to his lips again brushed them over her palm then her knuckles i like that i might just come back for more another time and as things are i believe ill leave the dishes to you after all now will you walk me out like a proper gentleman tell me he said as they started out of the kitchen how many men have you wrapped around your finger to date oh ive lost count but none of them seemed to mind it she glanced back as the phone began to ring do you need to answer the machinell get it answering machines and faxes i wonder what old maude would think she stepped outside and off the stoop to where the flowers were dancing in the breeze you look suited to this place she said after a moments study of him and i imagine you look just as suited to some lofty boardroom he reached down to snap off a spray of verbena and handed it to her come back oh i imagine ill wander your way again she tucked the flower into her hair as she turned to the garden gate he saw then why he hadnt heard her drive up shed ridden a bike darcy if youll wait a minute ill drive you back down no need good day to you trevor magee she straddled the bike and steered down the narrow drive and into the bumps and ditches the locals claimed was a road and managed trevor noted to look outrageously sexy doing it since he stopped by the site after going into the village it was after noon when he walked to the gallagher house his knock was answered by the barking of a dog a throaty excitable sound that made him take a cautious step in reverse he was an urbanite and had a healthy respect for anything capable of making that kind of noise the barking stopped seconds before the door opened but the dog itself sat beside jude madly thumping its tail trevor had seen the dog a time or two but at a distance he hadnt realized the thing was quite so large hello trevor how nice come in ah he glanced meaningfully at the dog and jude laughed finns harmless i promise he just likes to make a racket so ill think hes protecting me say good day to mr magee jude ordered and finn obediently lifted a huge paw id like to stay on his good side hoping the dog would let him keep all his fingers trevor shook hand to paw i can put him out back if he worries you no no its fine he hoped im sorry to interrupt your day i was hoping you had a minute ive several minutes come in and sit down can i get you some tea have you had lunch shawn sent down a lovely casserole no nothing thanks im fine dont go to any trouble its not a bit of trouble she began but she pressed one hand to the small of her back and the other to her belly as she stepped back you sit down trevor took her arm and steered her to the living room ill confess large dogs and pregnant women unnerve me it wasnt true large dogs might have unnerved him but pregnant women melted him but the statement got her to a chair i promise neither of us will bite but she sat gratefully i swore i was going to stay calm and graceful through this experience im pretty calm yet but i said goodbye to grace at the sixmonth point you look like youre handling it well do you know if youre having a boy or a girl no we want to be surprised she laid a hand on finns head when he came to sit by her chair trevor noted she didnt have to reach far i took a walk last evening and looked at your site youre making progress steady this time next year youll be able to walk down and take in a show im looking forward to it very much it must be satisfying to turn your visions into reality isnt that what youre doing with your books with your baby i like you are you comfortable enough to tell me whats on your mind he waited a beat i forgot youre a psychologist i taught psychology in a gesture of apology she lifted her hands let them fall again in the last year or so ive cured myself of being too shy to say what im thinking the result has pros and cons i dont mean to be pushy i came here to ask you something talk to you about something you figured it out thats not pushy thats efficient he said after a moment one of my favorite words lately carrick and gwen yes now she folded her hands looking serene and easy what about them you believe they exist existed he corrected i know they exist she saw the doubt in his eyes and took a moment to gather her thoughts were from a different place you and i new york chicago urban sophisticated our lives based on facts and the tangible of the everyday he saw where she was going and nodded were not there anymore no were not there anymore this is a place thatthrives isnt the word i want because it doesnt need to thrive it just is this place thats home for me now this place thats drawn you to build one of your dreams here isnt just apart from where we came from because of history or geography it understands things weve forgotten reality is reality whatever part of the world youre standing in i thought that once if you still do why do carrick and gwen worry you interest me have you seen her no him then trevor hesitated remembering the man whod appeared near saint declans well i dont believe in faeries i imagine carrick believes in you jude murmured i want to show you something she started to rise cursed under her breath then held up a hand waving it testily when trevor got to his feet no damn it im not ready to be hauled up every time i sit down just a minute she shifted then boosted herself out belly first by pushing her hands against the arms of the chair relax itll take me a minute im not as light on my feet as i used to be as she walked out trevor sat back down he and finn eyed each other with interest and suspicion im not going to steal the silverware so lets both just stay in our respective corners as if it had been an invitation finn sauntered over and planted both forepaws in trevors lap christ gingerly trevor lifted the dogs feet out of his crotch perfect aim now i know why my father never let me have that puppy down at the command finns butt hit the floor then he lovingly licked trevors hand there youve made friends trevor glanced up at jude and barely resisted squirming to relieve the throbbing in his balls you bet go lie down finn jude gave the dog an absent pat before sitting on the hassock at trevors feet do you know what this is she opened her hand held it out centered in her palm was a clear and brilliant stone at a glance it looks like a diamond and given the size id say its a very nicely faceted piece of glass a diamond first water between eighteen and twenty carats i got a book a loupe and figured it out i didnt want to take it to a jeweler go ahead she invited take a closer look trevor took it out of her hand held it to the light streaming through the front window why didnt you want to take it to a jeweler it seemed rude as it was a gift i visited cousin maudes grave last year and i watched carrick pour a flood of these out of the silver bag he wears at his belt i watched them bloom into flowers except for this one that lay sparkling in the blossoms trevor turned the stone over in his hand and wondered jewels of the sun my life changed when i came here this is a symbol whether its pretty glass or a priceless gem doesnt matter really its all how you look at things i saw magic and it opened my world i like my world whether you change it or not is your choice you came here for a reason to ardmore to build a theater to build jude said quietly how much is up to you chapter five trevors decision to spend the evening in the pub was a logical one a professional one he preferred thinking of it that way as it was just a little too hard on the ego to admit he was there largely to look at darcy he wasnt a horny teenager he was a businessman gallaghers pub was now very much part of his interests and it appeared to be a thriving one most of the tables were fullfamilies couples tour groups huddled together over pints and glasses and conversations a young boy who couldnt have been more than fifteen sat in a corner playing a weepy tune on a concertina a fire had been lit as with evening the weather had gone chilly and damp and around the red glow of the simmering turf a trio of old men with windraw faces sat smoking contemplatively and tapping booted feet to the music nearby a child who couldnt have seen his first birthday bounced and giggled on his mothers knee his own mother trevor thought would have loved this carolyn ryan magee was fourthgeneration irish born of parents whod never set foot on irish soil any more than their parents before them had and she was unabashedly sentimental over what she considered her roots she was he understood the only reason he knew as much as he did about family history on his fathers side family no matter if theyd been dead and buried for generations meant something to her when something mattered to his mother she made certain it mattered to her men neither of whom trevor mused could resist her it was she whod played irish music in the house while his father had rolled his eyes and tolerated it it was she who had told her son stories at bedtime of the good people and silkies and pookas and it had been she trevor knew who had smoothed over in her fiercely determined way whatever hurts and resentments his father had felt toward his parents even with her powers she hadnt been able to add warmth but at least shed built a shaky bridge that had allowed for civility and respect on both sides in fact trevor wondered if hed have noticed the distance between his father and his fathers parents if it hadnt been for the love and openness of his own home of all the couples he knew hed never known any as cheerfully devoted to each other as the one whod created him it was a marvelously intimate miracle and one he never took for granted he imagined his mother would sit here as he was now and soak it all up join in the songs chat with all the strangers thinking of it he scanned the room through the pale blue haze of smoke and thought of ventilation systems then he shook his head and headed to the bar whatever the health hazards he supposed this was precisely the atmosphere those who came here were looking for he saw brenna at the far end of the bar working the taps and having what appeared to be the most serious of discussions with a man who had to be a hundred and six the only stool left was at the opposite end and sliding on trevor waited while aidan passed out glasses and made change well hows it all going then aidan asked and added the next layers to a pair of guinnesses he was building fine youre busy tonight and busy we should be most nights from now till winter can i quench your thirst for you you can ill have a pint of guinness thats the way jude said you were by to see her today and having some concerns about our local color not concerns curiosity curiosity to be sure aidan began the slow intricate process of building trevors pint while he finished off the two in progress a mans bound to have some curiosity about the matter when he finds himself plunked down in the middle of it judes publisher has the notion that when her book comes out it could stir more interest in our little corner of the world good business that for both of us then well have to be ready for it he glanced around noted that sinead was moving with a great deal more energy tonight but darcy was nowhere to be seen youre going to need more help in here aidan ive given that some thought he filled a basket with crisps and set them on the counter darcyll be talking to some people when the time comes as if hitting the cue darcys voice rang through the kitchen doorway in a peal of heartfelt and inventive curses youre a miserable excuse for a blind donkeys ass and why you require a head hard as rock when youve nothing inside it needing protection ill never know for youre brainless as a turnip and twice as disagreeable when trevor cocked his head in question aidan merely continued to work his taps its a bit of a temper our sister has and shawn needs only to exist to provoke it a shrew is it ill give you a shrew you slanteyed toothless toad there was an audible thud a yelp more cursing then darcy face flushed eyes lightninghot swung through the door with a large and loaded tray on her hip brenna i brained your husband with a stewpotthough why an intelligent woman such as yourself would choose to wed a baboon like that escapes me i hope it wasnt full as he makes a fine stew it was empty you get a better ring that way she tossed her head drew in a long breath and let it out again with a satisfied huff shifting the tray she turned toward the passthrough and spotted trevor temper vanished from her face like magic though her eyes remained hot they took on an unmistakable sexual edge well now look whos come in out of the rainy evening her tone went to purr as she sauntered to the end of the bar would you mind flipping up the passthrough darling ive my hands a bit full at the moment shed been balancing trays onehanded more than half her life but she liked to see him move the hum in her throat was a sound of pure appreciation when he slid off the stool and walked over to do as shed asked its nice to be rescued by a strong handsome man mind yourself trev theres a viper under that comely face this was shawns opinion and he gave it a bit testily as he came out to serve another pair of orders at the bar pay no attention to the babblings of our pet monkey she sent one steely stare over her shoulder our parents being kindhearted bought him from a traveler familygypsies youd say a waste of two pounds and ten if youre asking me with a twitch of hip she walked off to deliver her orders that was a good one shawn murmured she mustve been saving it up good evening to you trev are you looking for a meal i guess ill try the stew ive heard its good tonight aye with a rueful smile shawn rubbed the bump on his head his gaze drifted to the side where the young boy teased out a livelier tune youve come on a good evening connor there can play like an angel or a demon depending on the mood ive yet to hear you play trevor settled on his stool again im told that like the stew its good oh ive a bit of a hand with it we all do musics part of the gallagher way just a bit of advice on your music get an agent oh well shawn looked back met trevors eyes youre paying me a good price for the songs youve bought so far i trust you to be fair youve an honest face a good agent would squeeze out more ive no need for more he glanced over at brenna ive everything already with a baffled shake of his head trevor picked up the beer aidan set in front of him finkle said you werent a businessminded man but i have to say youre not anywhere near as dim as he led me to believe no offense none taken trevor watched shawn over the rim of his mug finkle said you kept getting him confused with another investor a restaurateur from london did he now amusement twinkled in shawns eyes imagine that aidan do we know anything about a restaurant man from london whod have been interested in connecting to the pub here aidan tucked his tongue in his cheek i seem to recall mr finkle bringing that matter to my attention though i assured him there was no such person at tall fact is aidan continued after a weighty pause we all of us went to great pains to assure him of it thats what i thought impressed trevor took a deep gulp of guinness very slick then he heard darcy laugh quick and bright and turned to see her rub her hand over the boy connors head she left it there her eyes sparkling on his as she began to sing it was a fast tune with lyrics tumbling into each other hed heard it before in the pubs of new york or when his mother was in the mood to listen to irish music but hed never heard it like this not in a voice that seemed soaked in rich wine with gold at the edges hed had the report from finkle and there had been mention of darcys singing voice in fact the man had rhapsodized about it trevor hadnt put any stock in that issue as his pet business was a recording company he knew how often voices were praised through the roof when they deserved no more than polite applause listening now watching now trevor admitted he should have given his scout more credit when she came back into the chorus shawn leaned on the bar and matched his voice to hers there was a laugh in the music of it as she wandered back toward the bar and laying a casual hand on trevors shoulder sang straight to her brother ill tell me ma when i go home the boys wont leave the girls alone no trevor imagined the boys had never left this one alone he had an urge to pull her hair himself but not in the playful manner the song indicated no to fill his hands with it pull it back and feast on her thousands of men he imagined would react the same way the notion appealed to his business side even as it irked on a personal level since jealousy made him feel ridiculous he concentrated on the business angle when the song was over she reached over the bar to grab shawn by the collar and haul him halfway across it for a loud kiss moron she said with obvious affection shrew three fish and chips two stews and two portions of your porter cake now back into the kitchen where you belong she ran her hand absently across trevors shoulder as she turned to aidan three pints each guinness and harp a glass of smithwicks and a pair of cokes the one cokes for connor so theres no charge do you mind she said to trevor and picked up his pint for a small sip so do you take requests hmm im here to do nothing but sing another oh its likely i will before the evenings done she transferred the drinks that were poured onto her tray no now he pulled a twentypound note out of his pocket held it up between two fingers a ballad this time her gaze shifted from his face to the bill then back again thats a considerable tip for a bit of a tune im rich remember thats something i havent forgotten she reached out for the twenty narrowed her eyes when he jerked it away sing it first she considered ignoring him on principle and perhaps a little spite but it was twenty pounds and singing wasnt a trial to her so she smiled at him then lifted her voice as she lifted her tray come all ye maidens young and fair all you that are blooming in your prime always beware and keep your garden fair let no man steal away your thyme connor picked up the melody flushing a bit when she winked at him and served his soft drink she served the others as well singing as she did a song of regret and the loss of innocence conversations hushed and more than a few hearts sighed because he was paying for it she looked at trevor as she walked back to the bar she gave the last lines to him satisfaction warmed her eyes when applause broke out it gleamed there as she nipped the bill from his hand at twenty each ill sing as many tunes as you like then taking the guinnesses aidan had finished she moved off to serve them hell ill do one for half that someone called out and over a roar of laughter began on biddy mulligan theres formal music over the weekend aidan told trevor and gallaghers pays the band ill check it out he watched darcy go back behind the bar into the kitchen do the three of you ever play together shawn and darcy and myself at ceilis now and again or in here for a bit of fun i sang for my supper a time or two when i was traveling it can be a hard life depends on the booking trevor stayed another hour nursing his pint enjoying his stew and listening to the apparently tireless connor play tune after tune he got up once to open the door for a couple who each had a sleeping child over a shoulder it was families he noted who left for home and a couple of men with weatherbeaten faces fishermen he imagined who would be up before dawn to head out to sea food orders began to taper off after nine oclock but the taps ran steadily as he rose to go are you calling it a night boss brenna called out yeah until i find out what vitamins youre taking that keep you going strong for fifteen hours work ah its not vitamins she leaned over to pat the gnarled hand of the old man whod sat on the same stool for hours its being near my true love mr riley here that keeps me going riley let out a cackle come give us a last pint then my darling and a kiss to go with it well the pint will cost you but the kiss is free she glanced back at trevor as she drew it ill see you in the morning i need to borrow your sister a minute trevor told aidan then took darcys hand before she could move past him its your turn to walk me out i suppose i can spare you a minute she set down her tray and ignoring aidans frown strolled to the door the rain was a fine mist that drenched the air smoky drifts of fog crept in from the sea to crawl along the ground through it came the steady beat of the water and the faroff call of a horn as a boat passed in the night ah its cool closing her eyes darcy lifted her face to the thin rain it gets stuffy in there by this time of night your feet must be killing you i wont deny they could use a good hard rub come back with me and ill give them my attention she opened her eyes at that now sure and thats a tempting offer but ive work yet then i need my sleep he lifted her hand to his lips as he had once before come to the window in the morning she didnt mind the way her heart gave one hard thud or the tingle low in her belly she was a woman who believed in enjoying sensations in savoring every one of them but she had to think past that and remember how the game was played i might slowly she ran a fingertip along his jaw if the thought of you comes into my mind lets make sure it does his arms slid around her but the forward motion stopped when she laid a hand against his chest her pulse was beating fast an exciting feeling of anticipation she liked the smell of the rain and wet skin the strong band of his arms around her it had been some time since shed allowed a man to put his arms around her that was the key after all the allowing her choice her move her mood it was important always to stay in charge of those parts and of the man she allowed to touch her once you turned the reins over you could forget that sensations however lovely were only fleeting after all it was safe enough here to have a sample of him she decided and to see if she really wanted more so she slid her hand up his chest around the back of his neck and with her eyes open brought his mouth down to hers he took his time she had to give him that and didnt go grabbing and fumbling and trying to extract her tonsils with his tongue he had a nice style about him firm confident with just a hint of bite not so dangerous as shed thought which was rather a shame all in all then he shifted the angle of his body his hands running up her back his lips slanting over hers the edges of her mind blurred and she thought oh god then didnt think at all he wanted to eat her alive in fast greedy bites and imagined that was just what she expected from a man greed and heat and desperation she had them all churning inside him hed seen it in a kind of mild disdain in her eyes when hed reached for her so he moved slow watched as he tasted seen the shift to approval even pleasure along with a measuring that annoyed him even as the flavor of her poured into him then he needed more just needed more and took it he felt the change register dimly in some far corner of his mind a tension in her mixed with a soft and slow yielding that was as quiet as the rain around him his eyes closed even as hers did and all calculation between them was lost the hand at his neck skimmed into his hair her body lifted pressed against his seemed to flow into him as he moved until her back was pressed to the stone wall of the pub heart thundered against heart he drew back wanting to clear his head catch his breath think she stayed against the wall then gave one long feline sigh and opened her eyes i liked that a little more she was sure than was good for her still she ran her tongue over her bottom lip as if to steal a bit more taste and had his blood swimming again why dont you do it again why dont i this time he framed her face in his hands combed his fingers through her hair until they fisted in it then hesitated waited suffered with his mouth a whisper from hers until her breath and his quickened well drive each other crazy the sound she made was more gasp than laugh ive come to the same conclusion lets start right now she closed the distance by catching his bottom lip between her teeth tugging lightly then not so lightly before soothing the nip with her tongue good start he managed and crushed his mouth to hers her head went spinning quick dancing circles that left her giddy and dizzy and delighted every sensation was a burst through her systemthe taste the hard lines of him the damp stone at her back the shimmer of rain on her skin she wanted to push him to urgency to make him weak to hear him begbefore she did she threw herself into the kiss into the moment and as a result gave him more than shed intended again it was he who drew back it was either that or drag her off to the car and tumble her in the backseat with all the finesse and control of a kid on prom night shed taken him right to the edge with a kiss on a wet sidewalk outside of a crowded pub were going to need more privacy he decided eventually she needed to get her legs back under her but at the moment weve stirred each other up enough i dont think well get much sleep tonight but i dont mind that steadier she brushed a hand through her hair scattering fine drops of rain you know the last time i kissed a yank i slept like a baby after that would be a compliment oh indeed it would ill enjoy thinking about kissing you again at the next opportunity but for now i have to go back inside and you should go home she turned to go stopping when he took her arm she wasnt quite steady enough to resist if he recognized his advantage and pressed it so she sent him a bright and sassy look over her shoulder behave yourself trevor if im any longer out here aidan will lecture me and spoil my nice mood i want your next evening off and ive a mind to give it to you she gave his hand a friendly pat then slipped quickly inside again it was a surprise and an annoyance to find himself shaken he had to sit in the car listening to the rain waiting for his blood to cool and his hands to steady he knew what it was to want a woman even to crave the feel of one under his hands under his body just as he knew and accepted that the need brought with it certain vulnerabilities and risks but whatever it was he wanted needed craved from darcy gallagher was on a different level than anything that had come before she was different he admitted frowning at the pub for a moment before starting his car sexy selfish seductive there were other women he knew with those attributes but they were rarely so unapologetic and honest about it she was toying with him and doing nothing to hide the fact and by god he had to admire her for it just as he had to admire her for being perfectly aware that he was playing the same game it was going to be fascinating to see who won and how many rounds it took relaxing since he was confident hed handle her he bumped along the track toward home and found himself smiling christ he liked her he couldnt remember another woman whod heated his blood engaged his mind and sparked his humor in quite the way she managed to do all three often at the same time if thered been no physical spark between them he would still have enjoyed being with her picking his way through that marvelous and straightforward brain of hers as it was he thought he was about to explore the best of all possible worlds romantically speaking and what a relief it was to head toward intimacy knowing that both parties looked for nothing more than mutual gratification and interesting companionship the business end of their relationship was relatively uncomplicated the pub belonged to her as much as to her brothers but it was aidan trevor had dealt with and would continue to deal with in that area there was that voice of hers which was a separate and intriguing matter he had a couple of ideas he wanted to let simmer before he discussed them with her in that area he was confident that shed be guided by his experience and lured by what he could and would offer her she appreciated money and wanted enough to live stylishly well he had a feeling he was going to be able to help her out there profit was the bottom line shed told him that day on the beach he had some ideas how that bottom line could be reached by both of them for a song he turned into his street next to his cottage very satisfied at how well his time in ireland was being spent and how successful the results were to date he got out of the car locking it out of habit then used the light hed left burning to guide him through the mist to the garden gate he didnt know why he looked up why he was compelled to lift his eyes to the window the jolt that went through him was like a lightning bolt through the center of his body one hard sizzle from head to foot at first he thought of darcy of the way shed stood framed in her bedroom window the first time hed seen her a similar jolt then not of recognition but of desire this woman stood framed in the window as well was lovely as well but her hair was pale like the mists around him her eyes he knew though it was too dark to see their color were a haunted sea green this woman had been dead for three centuries he kept his eyes on her face as he pushed open the gate saw a single tear shimmer as it slipped slowly down her cheek his heart was a triphammer in his chest as he walked quickly along the path through drenched flowers through the faint music that was the wind chimes dancing in the breeze the air was ripe almost overpowering with the wet perfume the tinkling notes he unlocked the door shoved it open there wasnt a sound the single light hed left burning caused long shadows to slant into corners over the old wooden floor with the keys still in his hand forgotten he started up the stairs as he stepped to the bedroom doorway trevor took a breath held it then flipped on the light he hadnt expected her to be there illusions faded in the light when it flashed on flooded the room he let out the breath hed been holding in one short whoosh she stood facing him her hands folded neatly at her waist her hair delicately gold spilled over the shoulders of a simple gray dress that flowed down to her feet the tear bright as silver was drying on her cheek why do we waste whats inside us why do we wait so long to embrace it her voice lifted and fell the rhythm of ireland and stunned him more than the vision of her who but of course he knew who she was and asking was a waste of time what are you doing here its always more comforting to wait at home ive waited a long time he thinks youre the last i wonder could he be right when you dont wish to be and wish it so strongly it was impossible a man didnt hold a conversation with a ghost someone for some reason was playing games and it was time to put a stop to it he strode forward reached out to take her arm and his hand passed through her as it would through smoke the keys slipped out of his numb fingers and clattered on the floor at her feet is it so difficult to believe that more exists than what you can touch she said it kindly because she understood what it was to fight beliefs she could have allowed him to touch an illusion of what she had been but it would have meant less to him you already know it in your heart in your blood its only a matter of letting your mind follow im going to sit down he did so abruptly on the side of the bed i dreamed of you and for the first time she smiled mixed with gentle humor was compassion i know it your coming here to this place at this time was determined long ago fate its a word you dont like one that makes you want to brace for battle she shook her head at him such a thing as fate takes us to certain points along a path what you do here and now is up to you the choice at the end of a path i made mine did you aye i did what i thought right annoyance filtered into the musical voice it doesnt make it right but only what i thought and what i felt needed to be done my husband was a good man a kind one we had children together who were the joy of my life a home that contented us did you love him i did oh aye i did after a time a warm and settled love we had and he would have asked no more of that from me twasnt the flash and burn i felt for another do you see thats what i believed it was i felt for carrick a fire that would flame hot and high then die away to nothing but ash and there i was wrong she turned as if looking out the window beyond the glass beyond the rain i was wrong she repeated ive bided in this place a long time a long and lonely time and still the burn of that love the ache and the joy of its inside me its so easy for love to hide itself under passion and not be recognized most would say its easy to mistake passion for love both are true enough but for me i feared the fire even as i longed for it and fearing and longing never looked into the flames for the jewels that waited there for me i know about passion but i dont know about love and still ive looked for you in other women her eyes met his again you havent realized what you look for and i hope you will were coming to the end of it one way or the other look hard at what you want to build then make your choices i know what but she was fading away he leaped to his feet reached out again wait damn it alone he tried to pace off nerves but they stretched and snapped inside him how the hell was he supposed to handle this dreams and magic and ghosts there was nothing solid there nothing tangible nothing believable if it came to that but he did believe and that was what worried him chapter six youre looking a bit the worse for wear this morning trevor took another gulp of the coffee hed brought to the site with him and sent brenna a murderous look shut up she didnt bother to disguise her snort of amusement she was used to him now and didnt worry overmuch about his bark when the likes of him meant to bite they didnt warn you first and cross as well there now i can have someone bring out a nice rocking chair and you can sit under an umbrella and have a bit of a nap he sipped again have you ever seen a cement mixer from the inside as rough as you look round the edges this morning i could take you onehanded seriously you can go into the kitchen and have your coffee in peace and in quiet construction zones cheer me up and me she glanced around at the tacks of equipment the hulking machines the men hefting pipe and cheerfully insulting each other odd creatures arent we dads off this morning doing a spot of repair jobs here and there so im glad youre here and in the mood for working off your sulks im not sulking i dont sulk ah well brooding then i enjoy a good brood myself though most often i prefer just punching something and being done with it shawn must lead an interesting life hes a darling man and the love of my life so i do my best to keep him from tedium tedium trevor muttered kills she nodded he didnt look cool and reserved this morning nor did his voice hold that faint tint of distance she judged him to be a man that put all of that up as a barrier until the one he dealt with proved trustworthy she was glad to have passed the mark i should tell you the lines from the new well and those from the septic are to be inspected this morning all goes okay well be burying them by end of day she headed over to show trevor the progress the ground was muddy from the nights rain which continued to fall steadily it dripped off the brim of brennas cap glimmered on the little silver faerie she had pinned on it as she hunkered down beside a trench the smell of mud and men and gasoline pleased her enormously as you see weve used the grade of material you specified and a pretty job it is too dad and i dealt with a busted septic line during the flood last winter and its not an experience im after repeating any time in the near future thisll hold he crouched where he was scanned the area he could see it perfectly the long low sweep of the theater faced with stone to blend with the existing pub the trim of dark distressed wood charming and simple but what it was built of and built on would be the best that modern technology offered that was the dream after all taking what was here respecting it even showcasing it while using the material and ingenuity man had devised along the way thats why he was here to put the magee mark on the place theyd come from it had nothing to do with old legends and lovely ghosts tuning back to the present he glanced back and saw brenna patiently watching him sorry mind wandered he looked perplexed and not a little angry she hesitated after all theyd only known each other in the facetoface manner for a handful of days if its something to do with the job thats troubling you i hope youll tell me so i can do what i can to smooth it out thats part of what youre paying me for if its a personal matter ill be glad to listen if its something you feel the need to talk through i guess its a combination i appreciate it but ill mull a while i find i mull most successfully when my hands are busy good point he straightened lets get to work it was rough and messy work and most wouldnt find it pleasant trevor did large sheets of plywood were spread over the mud to give barrows and boots traction as material was transported he hauled lumber for studs and joists stood under the tarp where the plumbers worked and listened to rain patter on canvas he drank a gallon of coffee and began to feel marginally human again brenna was right he decided busy hands kept the mind occupied so what was troubling it could stew and turn in the corners he would figure out what was happening and what to do about it while he dealt with the business at hand that he thought amused at himself was a great deal more efficient than brooding drenched and muddy and in a much happier frame of mind he hefted another board and nerves danced in his belly up his spine over the back of his neck he was compelled as he had been the night before to look up darcy stood in the window watching him through the thin curtain of rain she didnt smile nor did he in that meeting of eyes was an acute awareness that was primitive sexual erotic as the slide of naked flesh on naked flesh there was nothing of the casual flirtation that had passed between them that first morning nothing of the clever seductive game theyd played since the flash and burn yes he understood that exactly as he stood in the chilly rain staring at a woman he barely knew barely knew he thought but had to have and he didnt give a damn how quickly the fire died annoyed that he could be so easily manipulated by his own desires he shifted the lumber on his shoulder and carried it to the team of carpenters when unable to do otherwise he looked back she was gone she acted as if nothing had happened as if that bolt of knowledge hadnt flashed between them when trevor came in out of the wet for lunch she sent him a casual glance and continued to take the orders at one of her stations without a single hitch of rhythm it was admirable and infuriating hed never had a woman stir both emotions in him so effortlessly the lunch crowd was thinner today he supposed the weather kept some of the tourists within the confines of the hotel knowing it was perverse he deliberately chose a table in sineads section it would be interesting to see what move darcy made in this little chess match they appeared to be playing clever was darcys opinion when she noticed his strategy though it would cost him in speed of service hed made his point it was her turn to take a step ahead or back then again she pondered as she scooped up the tip from a table that had just cleared there was always sideways a bit wet out today is it trevor she called across the room while she gathered dirty dishes more than a bit ah well its what makes us what we are a day like this i imagine youd rather be tucked into your fancy office in new york city enjoying himself he propped a booted foot on his knee i like it fine where i am how about you oh when im here i think about being there and vice versa im a fickle creature pulling out her pad she moved to the next table beamed smiles and what is it i can get for you today she took their orders and those of another table besides delivered them in to shawn and served drinks before sinead managed to make her way to trevor out of the corner of his eye he saw darcy smirk he kept it simple a bowl of soup and waited until darcy was serving the next batch of meals i need to do some research in the area and this seems like a good day for it why dont you play guide for me its kind of you to think of me but i wouldnt have time to do it justice i can only spare a couple of hours myself how about it aidan can i borrow your sister between shifts her times her own until five borrow is it darcy let out a short laugh i think not but if youve a mind to hire me for the service of guiding you here and about we could negotiate a reasonable fee five pounds an hour her eyes were sharp and somehow sweet i said reasonable ten and ill spare you the time greedy piker she shot back and had several customers chuckling ten it is and youd better be good darlingshe fluttered her lashesno mans ever told me otherwise she headed toward the kitchen and trevor dipped into the soup sinead set in front of him both of them were completely satisfied with the arrangement she had to fuss a bit it would have gone against both nature and habit for darcy not to take time to put on fresh lipstick dab on some perfume rearrange her hair debate about changing her clothes in the end she decided the sage green shirt and black weskit and trousers were more than adequate for a daytime tour yanks as far as she could tell were mad keen on driving around irish roads rain or shine as if theyd never seen a field of grass in their lives mindful of the weather she tied back her hair with a black ribbon and tossed on a jacket before meandering back downstairs she was used to men waiting for her shawn was whistling over the last of the lunch shift cleanup it surprised her that trevor wasnt as shed expected cooling his heels in the kitchen and drinking a cup of the coffee he seemed to live on trevor out in the pub then couldnt say i heard him mention to brenna he had some calls to make that was before you went upstairs to redo your war paint since that remark didnt rate a response she sailed out into the pub only to find aidan alone and preparing to lock up did you kick the man out and make him wait in the car hmm oh trevor no i think he said he had someone to ring up shock ran straight down to her pretty painted toenails he left i imagine hell be back directly since youre waiting ill leave you to lock up and see that youre back on time darcy but she could barely stutter out the single syllable which didnt matter in the least as aidan was already out the door she never did the waiting it was just wrong somehow to be ready and not have the man pacing about and looking at his watch for the second or third time it set the wrong tone entirely more baffled than annoyed she turned to go back up to her rooms and forget the entire arrangement the door opened letting in a damp chill and trevor good youre ready to go sorry i got hung up he stood holding the door smiling easily the puzzled irritation on her face was very close to what hed expected he was certain that every man shed ever dealt with had waited panting for her to finally make her entrance your move gorgeous he thought my times worth considerable even if yours isnt she strode past him flashing him an annoyed look before she stepped outside times part of the problem he stood shielding her from the worst of the wet as she locked the pub doors everybody wants a piece of it what i want is a couple of hours away from phones and demands for answers then i wont ask you any questions he led her to the car held her door until she was settled and wondering how long she was going to steam rounded the hood to the drivers side i thought wed head north for a while maybe hook up with the coast road then just see youve the wheel and the wallet he pulled away from the curb everyone says getting lost in ireland is part of its charm i dont imagine those with a destination in mind would find it charming fortunately i dont have one at the moment darcy shifted settled comfortably it was a fine vehicle roomy and with an expensive smell to it even if it was leased it wasnt such a hardship she supposed to ride around in a classy car with a handsome man who was when it came down to it paying for the privilege i imagine you always have your destination firmly in mind before taking the first step the purpose he corrected thats a different matter and your purpose today is to see the near area to put a picture in your mind of what people might be coming to your theater and how theyd go about getting there yes thats one purpose the other is to have some time with you so its clever you are to find a way to do both now traveling this way she continued youll go to dungarvan if you take the coast road youll go to waterford city go north instead and you come to the mountains which way would you like to go oh im just along for the ride arent i the tourists often enjoy a stop by an rinn between here and dungarvan its a little fishing village where they still speak gaelic theres nothing much otherwise but a fine view of cliffs or the mountains but the tourists often go there finding it quaint to hear the old language spoken routinely do you speak any gaelic a bit but not enough for any real conversation its a pity such things are lost you think so because youve a sentimental view of the matter when the simple fact is english is easier all around when i was in paris i could always find someone who knew enough english so i could be understood i wouldnt have found anyone whodve understood the gaelic no sentiment about things irish darcy are you sentimental about things american no he said after a moment i take them for granted there you have it she watched the rain patter and the shift of light that brought a pearly gleam to the edges of the gray its going to clear you might spot a rainbow if you enjoy such things i do tell me what do you enjoy best about ardmore about where you are the place itself the place she couldnt remember ever being asked such a question and was surprised that the answer was right there the sea the moods of it and smell of it the feel of it in the air theres a softness to it on a quiet morning and a fury about it during a storm the sound of it trevor murmured like a heart beating thats poetic more something id expect shawn to say than you the third stage of the legend jewels from the heart of the sea ah yes she liked it that he thought of the legend shed been giving it considerable thought herself just lately and she let them go to flowers which wouldnt buy her family supper ive a great deal of respect for pride but not when its so costly youd trade your pride for pretty stones that i wouldnt she sent him a sly and confident look id find a way to keep both if anyone could he thought it would be darcy he wondered why that annoyed him sunshine streamed through the clouds sparkled off the still falling rain and turned the light into something found inside a polished seashell those luminous magical colors streaked across the sky in three distinct rainbows it seemed to trevor that the air simply bloomed a simple and delicate flower unfurling petal by petal enchanted he stopped the car right in the middle of the road and watched those three arcs of color shimmer against the fragile blue canvas of the sky darcy was more interested in watching him it was like seeing a shield drop and under it hidden under that toughness the sophistication was a core of sweetness shed never imagined it touched her the way he could stare at those pretty tricks of light and wet with the pure pleasure of it gleaming in his eyes when he turned his head and flashed a blinding grin in her direction she gave in to impulse leaning toward him she caught his face in her hands and kissed him quick and light and friendly as his grin had been for luck she said when she sat back again there must be something about rainbows and kisses and luck if there isnt there should be lets see where they take usthe rainbows he said when her eyebrow lifted i like to think i know where the kisses are leading and my lucks been pretty good lately he turned down a narrow poorly marked road away from the coast and still distant from the mountains the land rolled wet and green lines of gray from stone walls deeper green from rough trees ran through the fields and turned function into charm he spotted a cottage much like the one on faerie hill with its creamy walls and thatched roof a scatter of sheep little white blobs wandering over the postcard and above it all those three smears of color on a pale sky he opened the sunroof chuckling when darcy cursed as the water that had pooled on the glass showered in it smelled fresh gloriously clean and added something elemental to the scent of her skin then as the road climbed he saw it dull and gray and forbidding against the seashell sky only three walls of the structure were standing the fourth long fallen into a tumble of stones but what was left was defiant spearing up out of the quiet country field as a monument to blood to power to vision he swung off the road stopped the car lets go see it see what trevor its only a ruin you can find one by doing hardly more than turning a corner in ireland there are far better ones than this if such things interest you youve the oratory or the cathedral in ardmore for that matter this ones here and so are we he reached across her to open her door this is just the sort of thing that draws people to an area those who havent the sense to take holiday where theres a nice pool and a collection of fivestar restaurants grumbling a bit she climbed out then sighed and followed after him just one of the many ruined castles or forts probably sacked by the cromwelliansthey seemed to like nothing so much as sacking and burning the grass was damp which made her glad shed thought to wear boots knowing just what sheep and cows did in fields she watched her step no sign no marker nothing it just stands here darcy cocked her head deciding it was more productive to be amused than annoyed and what do you think it should do but stand here he only laid a hand on the stone and looked up how many men i wonder did it take to build this how long who ordered it built here and why shelter and defense he stepped inside and humoring him darcy followed grass had grown up wild and tough through fallen stones the walls open to the elements dripped with wet from the recent storms his builders eyes could make out where the separate stories had been and he marveled at the sheer size of the broken wooden beams it wouldve been drafty smelly as well darcy commented the light was shifting again growing and he could still see the rainbows overhead wheres your romance ha i doubt many of the women who had to cook and clean between having their babies thought it was very romantic survival would have been the point then they made their point this survived the people survived the country survived thats the magic that draws people here the magic you miss because its all around you its history not magic its both thats what im building here thats why i came thats a large ambition why have small ones now thats a sentiment i can agree with and as that ambition includes gallaghers ill do my best to help you realize it thats something else i want to talk to you about another time whats wrong with now because now i need a little more luck he took her hands threading his fingers through hers this time instead of drawing her toward him he stepped to her in an ancient castle under a trio of rainbows i think this ought to be worth big pots of luck youve your myths confused the pots at the end of the rainbow ill take my chances right here he touched his lips to hers light and friendly as she had to his he liked the glint of amusement it brought to her eyes and did it again a little firmer this time a little warmer ive also heard it said third times the charm he murmured and took her mouth again fast and deep and hot the change deliberately abrupt to test both of them she answered as if shed known as if shed only waited her lips parted for his no surrender but demand equal to equal hunger to hunger together their fingers curled until they formed taut fists held as if it was understood that if either let go theyd rush blindly to the next step her heart leaped against his a quick kick of excitement that sent his own racing it thrilled and it stunned her that it should be as wild as near to feral as it had before a storm brewed inside her wanted to whip high and free and god she wanted to ride it even at the risk of finding herself battered and wrecked at the end here now what did it matter where they were or who they were or why it seemed so desperately right when his lips left hers to trail to her temple into her hair to rest quietly there the sweetness of the gesture after the passion left her shaken and weak and allowed caution to return if such activities under rainbows bring luck darcy began the pair of us are set for life he couldnt laugh nor come up with a joke in return something was churning inside him something complicated folding itself cannily in with simple desire how many times have you felt like that before she could answer he released her hands put his own on her shoulders to draw her away enough for their eyes to meet give me a straight answer how many times have you felt the way you felt just now she could have lied she knew herself skilled at the careless and casual lie but only when it didnt matter his eyes were intense direct and she thought just a little angry she found she couldnt blame him for it i cant say i ever have excepting last night neither have i neither have i he repeated and let her go so he could pace thats something to think about trevor i think we both know that the hotter the flame the quicker it flashes and the sooner it goes cold maybe he thought of gwen the words shed spoken to him wed both know that going in we would just as they both accepted they werent capable of falling in love he was right she thought they were a sad pair wed know she agreed just as we both know well sleep together before were done but there are matters that tangle it up business matters business isnt involved in this no and it shouldnt be but since we have a business relationshipmutual professional interests that involve my family there are things to be discussed and agreed upon before we roll ourselves into bed i want you and having you is my intention but i have terms what do you want a goddamn contract nothing so formaland dont take that tone with me youre just annoyed that the bloods still in your lap and you didnt think of it first he opened his mouth then closed it again and turned away she had a point damn it so we work out what we want and expect out of our personal relationship and agree to keep it separate entirely from the business one we do yes and as you said thats something to think about you might think that i sleep with anyone i find appealing or even handy she kept her voice cool as he turned back but the fact is i dont im careful and selective and i have to have some affection for a man some understanding of him before i take him to bed darcy i understood that after an hour in your company im also selective he walked back to her i like you and im beginning to understand you and when the time comes well take each other to bed she relaxed into a smile i think weve just had a serious conversation well have to be careful not to get in the habit of it and frighten ourselves now im sorry to say you have to take me back she held out a hand next time well drive along the coast next time youll be taking me out to a candlelight dinner buying me champagne and kissing my hand in that way you have she glanced up caught another glimpse of the fading rainbows as they crossed the wet grass but we can drive along the coast road to get there sounds like a deal get a night off ill start working on that chapter seven warm dry weather returned to paint both sky and sea the vivid blue of coming summer clouds that hovered were white and harmless and the flowers of ardmore drank in the sun as they had the rain the round tower cast its long and slender shadow over the graves it guarded and high on the cliffs the wind blew gentle ripples over the water in the well of the saint in the village men worked in shirtsleeves and arms turned ruddy in the sun trevor watched the skeleton of his building take shape the beams and block that were the solid bones of his dream as the work progressed the audience grew old mr riley stopped by the site every day at ten until you could set your watch by him he brought along a folding chair and sat with his cap shielding his eyes and a thermos of tea for company there he would sit and watch sit and nap until sharply at one he would stand up fold his chair and toddle off to his greatgranddaughters for his midday meal as often as not one of his cronies would join him and they would chat about the construction while playing at checkers or gin rummy trevor began to think of him as the job mascot children came by now and again and sat in a half circle by rileys chair their big eyes would track the sway of a steel beam as it was lifted into place this event was sometimes followed by a round of appreciative applause mr rileys greatgreatgrandchildren and some friends brenna told trevor when he expressed some concern about them being near the site they wont go wandering closer than his chair greatgreatgrandchildren then he must be as old as he looks one hundred and two last winter the rileys are longlived though his father died at the tender age of ninetysix god rest him amazing how many of those double greats does he have oh well let me think fifteen no sixteen as there was a new one last winter if memory serves not all of them live in the area sixteen good god well now he had eight children six still living and between them i believe they made him near to thirty grandchildren and i dont have count on how many children they made so there you have it youve two of his greatgrandsons on your crew and the husband of one of his granddaughters as well how could i avoid it every sunday after mass he goes to visit his wifes grave she that was lizzie riley fifty years they were married he takes with him that same old ratty chair there and sits by her for two hours so he can tell her all the village gossip and family news how long has she been gone oh twenty years give or take seventy years give or take devoted to one woman it was flabbergasting and trevor thought heartening for some it worked hes a darling man is mr riley brenna added hey there declan fitzgerald have a care there with that board before you bash someone in the face with it with a shake of her head brenna strode over to heft the far end of the board herself trevor nearly followed it had been his intention to spend most of his afternoon lifting hauling hammering the sound of air guns and compressors whooshing and rumbling along with the constant rattle of the cement mixer had the young audience enthralled beside them in his chair riley sipped tea going with impulse trevor walked over to him what do you think riley watched brenna place her board im thinking you build strong and hire well mick otoole and his pretty brenna they know what theyre about riley shifted his faded eyes to trevors face and so i think do you young magee if the weather holds well be under roof ahead of schedule rileys weathered face creased into smiles it was like watching thin white paper stretch over rock youll be there when you get there lad thats the way of things youve the look of your greatuncle as hed been told so once hesitantly by his grandmother trevor considered then crouched down so riley wouldnt have to crane his neck its just that you look so like john trevor his brother who died young it makes it hard for your grandfather to it makes it hard for him do i oh aye johnnie magee i knew him and your grandfather as well a finelooking young lad was johnnie with his gray eyes and slow smile built like a whip as you are yourself what was he like oh quiet he was and deep full of thoughts and feelings and most of them for maude fitzgerald he wanted her and little else and what he got was war aye thats the way it was many young men fell in on those fields of france and here as well in our own little war for irelands independence elsewhere for that matter at any time you can pick men go to battle and women wait and weep he laid a bony hand on the head of one of the children who sat at his side the irish know it comes round again and so do the old im both old and irish you said you knew my grandfather i did riley sat back with his tea crossed his thin legs at the ankles dennis now he was a brawnier type than his brother and more apt to look a mile down the road instead of where he was standing a discontented sort was dennis magee if you dont mind me saying ardmore wasnt the place for him and he shook off the sand of it as soon as he was able did he i wonder find what he was looking for there and contentment with it i dont know trevor answered frankly i wouldnt say he was a particularly happy man im sorry for that for its often hard for those around the unhappy to be happy themselves his bride as i recall was a quietmannered lass she was mary clooney whose family farmed in old parish and one of a family of ten if my memory can be trusted it seems sharp enough to me riley cackled oh the brains stayed with me well enough just takes the body a mite longer to get up and running these days the boy wanted to know what had been and where hed come from riley decided and why shouldnt he ill tell you the babe the boy who grew to be your father was a handsome one manys the time i saw him toddling along the roads holding his mas hand and his fathers well perhaps not so often but now and again dennis was after making a living and putting by for his journey to america i hope they had a good life there they did my grandfather wanted to build and thats what he did then that was enough for him i remember your father the younger dennis coming back here when he was old enough to have grown a few whiskers riley paused to pour himself more tea from his thermos he seemed tove grown fine had a pleasing way about him and set some of the local lasses fluttering he winked as youve done yourself still he didnt choose at that time to leave anything behind him here but the memory youve chosen different riley gestured toward the construction with his cup building something heres what youre about isnt it it seems to be at the moment well johnnie he wanted nothing more than a cottage and his girl but the war took him his mother died not five years after heartbroken its a hard thing dont you think for a man to live always in the shadow of a dead brother trevor glanced up again met the faded and shrewd eyes clever old man he thought and supposed if you lived past the century mark you had to be clever i imagine it is even if you go three thousand miles to escape it thats the truth better by far to stand and build your own he nodded this time with a kind of approval well as i said youve the look of him longdead john magee in the bones of your face and around the eyes once they landed on maude fitzgerald she was his heart do you believe in romance and ever after young magee trevor glanced away up toward darcys window then back again for some you have to believe in it to get it riley winked and passed his cup to trevor whats built isnt always of wood and stone and still it lasts reaching out he once again laid one of his gnarled hands on the head of the child nearest his chair ever after some of us do better with wood and stone trevor commented then absently drank the tea he lost his breath his vision blurred jesus he managed as the heavy lacing of whiskey scored his throat riley laughed so hard he fell to wheezing and his wrinkled face went pink with humor there now lad whats a cup of tea without a shot of the irish in it id like to know never say theyve diluted your blood so over there in amerikay you cant handle your own i dont usually handle it at eleven in the morning whats the clock got to do with a bloody thing the man trevor thought seemed old as moses and had been steadily sipping the spiked tea for an hour compelled to save face trevor downed the rest of the cup and was rewarded by a wide rubbery grin youre all right young magee youre all right since you are ill tell you this that lovely lass inside gallaghers wont settle for less in a man than hot blood a strong backbone and a clever brain im considering you have all three trevor handed riley back his cup im just here to build a theater if thats the truth then ill say this as well it goes that youth is wasted on the young but im of a mind that the young waste youth he poured another cup of tea and ill just have to marry her meself amusement danced in his eyes as he sipped step lively boyo for ive a world of experience with the female of the species ill keep that in mind trevor got to his feet what did john magee do before he went to war for a living youre meaning if riley thought it was odd that trevor wouldnt know he didnt say so he was for the sea his heart belonged to it and to maude and to nothing else trevor nodded thanks for the tea he said and went back to join his crew he skipped lunch there were too many calls to make faxes expected to take time for an hour in the pub and his afternoon dose of darcy he hoped she looked for him wondered a little if he understood her as he thought he did she would expect him to come in to have to come in and it would annoy her when he didnt good trevor mused as he let himself into the cottage he wanted to keep her a little offbalance that careless confidence of hers was a formidable weapon her arrogance played right along with it and damned if he didnt find them both attractive amused at himself he went directly up to his office and spent thirty minutes immersed in business it was one of his skills this ability to tune out every other thought and zero in on the deal of the moment with rileys memories fresh in his own mind and darcy dancing at the edges of it he needed that skill now more than ever once current projects were handled faxes zipped off email answered and sent he gave his thoughts to a future project he was formulating time he thought to lay the groundwork picking up the phone he called gallaghers he was pleased that aidan answered trevor made it a point to go straight to the head of a company or in this case a family its trev well now i thought id see you sitting at one of my tables by this time of day aidan raised his voice over the lunchtime clatter and trevor imagined him pulling pints onehanded while he talked in the background he heard darcys laugh i had some business to do id like to have a meeting with you and your family when its convenient for you a meeting about the theater partly do you have an hour to spare maybe between shifts oh i imagine we can accommodate you today sooner the better fine come on by the house then we tend to hold our family meetings round the kitchen table i appreciate it would you ask brenna to come by i will yes taking her off the job aidan thought but made no comment ill see you a bit later then around the kitchen table trevor recalled several of his own family meetings in the same venue before his first day of school when he was going off to baseball camp about to take his drivers test and so on all of his rites of passage and his sisters had been discussed there serious punishments serious praise had warranted the kitchen table odd he remembered now when he had broken his engagement hed told his parents as they sat in the kitchen thats where hed told them of his plans for the ardmore theater and his intention of coming to ireland and he realized as he calculated the time in new york that was where his parents most likely were at this moment he picked up the phone again and called home good morning magee residence hello rhonda its trev mister trevor the magee housekeeper had never called him anything else even when shed threatened to swat him how are you enjoying ireland very much did you get my postcard i did you know how much i love to get them i was telling cook just yesterday that mister trevor never forgets how i like postcards for my album is it as green as that really greener you should come over rhonda oh now you know im not getting on an airplane unless somebody holds a gun to my head your folks are having breakfast theyre going to be thrilled to hear from you just hold on a minute you take care of yourself mister trevor and come back soon i will thanks he waited enjoying the picture of the railthin black woman in her ruthlessly starched apron hurrying over the rich white marble floor past the art the antiques the flowers to the back of the elegant brownstone she wouldnt use the intercom to announce his call such family dealings could only be delivered in person the kitchen would smell of coffee fresh bread and the violets his mother was most fond of his father would have the paper open to the financial section his mother would be reading the editorials and getting worked up about the state of the world and narrow minds there would be none of that uneasy quiet that underthepolish tension that had lived in his grandparents home somehow his father had escaped that just as his own father had escaped ardmore but the younger dennis had indeed stood and built his own trev baby how are you im good nearly as good as you sound i thought id catch you and dad at breakfast creatures of habit but this is an even lovelier way to start the day tell me what you see it was an old request an old habit automatically he rose to go to the window the cottage has a front garden an amazing one for such a small place whoever designed it knew just what they wanted its like a a witchs garden one of the good witches who helps maidens break evil spells the flowers tumble together color shape and scent beyond it are hedges of wild fuchsia deep red on green and taller than i am the road they line is narrow as a ditch and full of ruts your teeth rattle if you go over thirty then the hills slope down impossibly green toward the village there are rooftops and white cottages and tidy streets the church steeple and well off is a round tower i have to visit its all edged by the sea its sunny today so the light flashes off the blue its really very beautiful yes it is you sound happy why wouldnt i be you havent been not really for too long now ill let you talk to your father whos rolling his eyes at me as i imagine you have business to discuss mom there was so much so much that his morning conversation with an old man and his horde of progeny had set to swirling inside him he said what he felt the most i miss you oh oh now look what youve done she sniffled you can just talk to your father while i cry a little well you got her mind off the editorial on handguns dennis magees voice boomed over the wire hows the job going on schedule on budget good to hear going to keep it there close to there anyway you mom doro and her family better keep a week next summer open the magees should all be here for the first show back to ardmore i have to say i never figured on it from the reports it hasnt changed much its not meant to ill send you a written update on the project but thats not why i called dad did you ever visit faerie hill cottage there was a pause a sigh yes i had some curiosity about the woman whod been engaged to my uncle maybe because my father so rarely spoke of him what did you find out that john magee died a hero before he ever had the chance to live and grandfather resented that thats a hard way to put it trev he was a hard man what he felt about his brother his family he kept to himself i never tried to get through what was the point i knew i would never get through to him about what he felt about anything much less what hed left behind in ireland sorry he could hear it that weariness that vague tone of frustration in his fathers voice i shouldnt have brought it up no thats foolish it would be on your mind youre there i thinklooking back i think he was determined to be an american to raise me as an american here is where he wanted to make his mark in new york he could be his own man he was his own man a cold hard man who paid more attention to his ledgers than his family but trevor saw no point in saying so when his father knew that better than anyone what did you find for yourself when you came back here he asked instead charm some sentiment more of a link than id expected yeah exactly thats exactly it i meant to go back but something else always seemed to come up and truth is im a city boy a week in the country and im itchy you and your mother never minded roughing it but the hamptons is about as rural as i can manage and stay sane dont snicker carolyn dennis said mildly its rude trevor scanned his view again its a long way from the hamptons to here absolutely a couple of weeks in that cottage youre renting and id be babbling i dont do quaint for long but you visited saw maude fitzgerald yes jesus must be thirtyfive years ago she didnt seem old to me but i guess she was well into her seventies i remember her being graceful not creaky the way i being callow expected an old woman to be she gave me tea and cake showed me an old photograph of my uncle she kept it in a brown leather frame i remember that because it reminded me of the songwhat is itwillie macbride then she walked with me to his grave hes buried on the hill by the ruins and the round tower i havent been there yet ill go by i dont remember what we talked about exactly it was all so long ago but i do remember this because it seemed odd at the time we were standing over his grave and she took my hand she said what came from me would journey back and make a difference i would be proud i suppose she was talking about you people said she had the sight if you believe in such things you start to believe in all sorts of things once youre here cant argue with that one night while i was there i took a walk on the beach i could swear i heard flutes playing and saw a man flying overhead on a white horse of course id had a few pints at gallaghers pub even as his father laughed trevor felt a chill skate down his spine what did he look like gallagher no the man on the horse a drunken delusion well that set your mother off dennis muttered and through the line trevor could hear his mothers delighted laugh ill let you get back to breakfast take some time to enjoy yourself while youre there get me the report when you can trev and well all keep next summer in mind stay in touch i will he hung up then continued to stare thoughtfully out the window delusions illusions reality there didnt seem to be very much space between them in ardmore he finished up what business could be done before new york opened then took a walk to john magees grave the wind was high and the graves were old the shifting of ground had tipped and tilted many of the markers so they leaned and slanted toward the bumpy grass to cast their shadows over their dead john magees stood straight like the soldier hed been the stone was simple weathered by wind and time but still the carving was deep and clear john donald magee too young to die a soldier his mother had that carved in her grief carrick said as he stepped up to stand beside trevor in my estimation one is always too young to die a soldier how would you know why she had it carved oh theres little i dont know and less i cant find out you mortals make your monuments to the dead i find it an interesting habit a peculiarly human one stones and flowers symbols arent they of what lasts and what passes away and why do you come here trevor magee to visit those you never knew in life blood and bonds i suppose i dont know frustrated he turned to face carrick what the hell is this by that youre meaning me youve more of your mother in you than ever your grandfather so you know by now the answer to that even if your diluted yank blood doesnt accept whats in front of your face youre a traveled man arent you youve been more places and seen more things than most who are your age have you never found magic on your journeys till now he wanted to think he had more of his mother in him much more than he had of his grandfather but there was nothing in carolyn magee of the easy mark ive never had conversations with ghosts and faeries till now you talked with gwen the amusement died out of carricks eyes turning the bright blue dark and with an edge he gripped trevors arm with a hand that transferred a jolt of heat and energy what did she say to you i thought you knew or could find out abruptly carrick released him and turned away he began to pace through the grass around the stones in quick almost jerky movements the air around him sizzled with a visible color and spark shes the only thing that matters and the only thing i cant see clear can you know magee what it is to want one person with all your heart with all that you have in you and for her to be just out of your reach no i blundered with her now thats a deep score to the pride make no mistake not that it was only my fault she blundered as well it hardly matters who holds the heaviest weight of the blame at this point he stopped turned back the air grew still again will you tell me what she said to you she spoke of you and regrets of passions that flash and burn and love that lasts she misses you emotions swirled in carricks eyes if sheshould you speak with her again would you tell her im waiting and ive loved no other since last we met for some reason it no longer seemed odd to be asked to deliver a message to a ghost ill tell her shes beautiful isnt she yes very a man can forget to look past beauty and into the heart i did and its cost me dear you wont make that mistake its why youre here im here to build a theater and to acquaint myself with my roots his humor restored carrick strolled back to trevor youll do both and more your ancestor here was a fine young man a bit of a dreamer with a heart too soft for soldiering and what war makes men do to men but he went out of duty and left his love behind you knew him aye both of them though only maude knew me she gave him a charm before he marched off for protection he snapped his fingers and from them dangled a chain with a little silver disk i expect shed want you to have it now too curious for caution trevor reached out and took the object the silver was warm as if it had been worn against flesh and on it the carving was faint what does it say its in old irish and says simply forever love she gave it to him and he wore it faithful but war was stronger than the charm in the end if not stronger than the love he wanted a simple life unlike his brother who went off to america your fathers father wanted something more and he worked for it and brought it to be thats an admirable thing what do you want trevor magee to build thats an admirable thing as well what will you call your theater i havent thought of it why i have an idea youll choose correctly because youre a man who chooses carefully thats why youre still living alone trevors fingers curled around the disk i like living alone that may be but its making mistakes you dislike most of all true enough i have to go now i have a meeting ill walk with you a ways tis a fine summer we have in store youll hear the cuckoo call if you listen its a good omen of things to come im wishing you luck on your meeting and with darcy thanks but i know how to handle both oh well now i believe you do or i wouldnt be in so cheerful a mood shell be handling you as well it helps the last of this waiting if you dont mind me saying to be entertained by the pair of you im not part of your plan its not a matter of planning its a matter of what is and what will be youve more say in it than i and youve little enough carrick stopped he could see the cottage now the creamy walls the sunny thatched roof the rainbow spread of flowers once she would have come out to meet me her heart pounding her eyes bright fear and love so mixed together neither of us could untangle them and me so sure i could dazzle her with gifts and promises that i never held out to her the single thing that mattered no second chance a wry smile twisted carricks lips there might have been had i not waited so long to take it ill go no farther than this until the waitings done handle darcy magee before she handles you my life trevor said briefly my business he strode down the slope toward the house and his car but he couldnt resist a glance back it barely surprised him that carrick had vanished all that was left was the green hill and sweetly brightly the twotone call of a bird the cuckoo trevor supposed he couldnt think of anything more apt put it aside he ordered himself and continued to walk tuck away the sentiment over longdead relatives and their sweethearts visits with faerie princes and messages for beautiful ghosts he had business to attend to but he slipped the chain around his neck and tucked the silver disk under his shirt where it lay to warm against his heart chapter eight the home team always had the edge trevor knew it going in but didnt see a way around it not only was the house gallagher turf but the village the county the whole damn country was theirs unless he found a way to shift the meeting to new york he would just have to play it as underdog added to that they outnumbered him it couldnt be helped not that he minded working a deal when the odds were against him the challenge of it only made the satisfaction of success sweeter hed already worked out his approach the questions the doubts the general unease of what he supposed would be termed his paranormal experiences would just have to wait until after business hours the minute he knocked on the door of the gallagher house he was representing magee enterprises it was a responsibility and a privilege that he took very seriously darcy opened the door a sassy smile on her face her head tilted at the perfect angle to display both arrogance and humor jesus hed like to take her in one quick gulp and be done with it instead he greeted her with an easy grin afternoon miss gallagher and a good day to you mr magee deliberately provocative she stepped toward him rather than back dont you want to kiss me he wanted to swallow her whole later she gave her head a little toss that sent her clouds of dark hair tumbling back i might not be in the mood later you will be if i kiss you she shrugged though she was faintly irritated then moved back to let him in i like confidence in a man mostly the rest of us are in the kitchen awaiting your presence is this to do with your theater partly irritation clicked up another level but she spoke coolly as she led him toward the rear of the house and a mysterious man as well now im in love for certain how many times would this make oh i stopped counting years ago ive such a fickle heart how many is that for you still batting zero here thats a pity heres himself come to call darcy announced over what seemed to trevor to be a heated conversation around the table if im interrupting not at all aidan rose and waved a hand toward brenna and shawn who sat scowling at each other if these two dont snap at each other six times a week were worried enough to ring up the doctor you said youd leave the details of the house to me brenna reminded her husband youre talking about the materials and colors of the kitchen counters and such who does the bloody cooking the blue laminates pretty and sensible the granites subtle and strong itll last two lifetimes well weve only this one to concern us at present dont we trevor even as she turned to him trevor held up a hand no absolutely no dont even think of asking me for an opinion i have no opinion when it comes to arguments between husband and wife tisnt an argument sulking brenna sat back folded her arms but a discussion i can have the laminate done in a wink do you know how long itll take to do the damn business in granite when its right you wait shawn leaned over kissed her softly and then you treasure you think youll get around me that way i do yes she sucked in a breath then let it out on a huff bastard she said with great affection well now that weve settled that vital and thorny matter aidan gestured trevor to a chair can we get you a beer then or some tea their turf trevor reminded himself as he sat a beerd be great thanks he glanced at jude how are you doing good she didnt think hed want her to mention she felt as if she had a semi parked on her bladder aidan said you didnt stop in the pub for lunch today why dont i fix you a sandwich im fine he reached over laid his hand on hers sit i appreciate you all taking the time to meet with me on such short notice its not a problem aidan put the beer in front of trevor then sat head of the table advantage gallagher and they all knew it not a problem at all brenna tells us the buildings going up right on schedule and i have to say thats a bit of a surprise in these parts i have a good foreman he toasted brenna then sipped i think well be ready by next may so long darcy looked both shocked and horrified and will that noise be part of the whole for a year what noise he replied nonchalantly when she sputtered he simply rolled over her i hope to scatter in a few performances primarily for the locals by next spring warm things up but im aiming for the third week in june for the grand opening midsummer darcy commented the middle of summer is july dont you know your pagan calendar midsummers june twentysecond and a fine choice a night for celebrating jude had her first ceili on that night last year and it turned out well didnt it darling eventually why the month delay jude asked him basically to cover our asses to build anticipation to book acts generate press my plan is to have a small intimate opening in may exclusive invited guests which would include the village family and a select number of vips thats very clever darcy murmured its part of my job itll generate interest and publicity in the official june opening and give us time to tweak any details that need tweaking like a dress rehearsal he nodded at darcy exactly id like your help with the guest list for the area thats as easily done as said aidan told him and id like you to perform the three of you aidan reached for his own beer in the pub onstage trevor corrected the main stage in the theater aidan set his beer down again without drinking why because ive heard you and youre perfect well now trev thats flattering to be sure thoughtfully shawn reached for one of the tea biscuits jude had set out but all youve heard from us is a bit of fun its not as if were a professional act or anything of that nature the kind youre looking to have in your theater youre exactly what im looking for his gaze skimmed to darcy lingered a moment then moved on shed yet to say a word showcasing local talent is part of what this project is about mixing that together with new and established acts i cant think of anything more appropriate than having the gallaghers perform and perform a selection of shawn gallaghers music at the first showing mine shawn went very pale at such a time i dont mean to tell you your business trev but thats surely a mistake its not brenna rapped a fist on his shoulder its brilliant its perfect but youve only bought three of his tunes so far trev trevor angled his head hes only shown me three so far there brenna socked shawn again with more enthusiasm you moron hes dozens more if you come by the house you can have a look he can play them for you hes got his piano crammed in what there is of our front room already and his fiddle and quiet shawn muttered dont tell me to be quiet when quiet this time the order was sharp and brenna seethed but subsided i have to think about it flustered he dragged a hand through his hair its a lot to think about at his wifes annoyed hiss he simply looked at her brenna she quieted his look was a plea for patience and understanding how could she refuse ill just say this youve so much to give shawn and it shouldnt worry you but the fact that it does is likely part of why youre brilliant in the first place make a bargain with me he made a restless movement with his shoulders what bargain let me pick the next just one to show trev i had fine luck with the first didnt i you did that you did all right then brennall bring you a song tomorrow so you can see what you think of it ill look forward to it trevor hesitated the trouble was he realized he liked these people i wish to god youd get an agent isnt she bad enough shawn countered jerking a thumb at brenna hounds me day and night as it is and read every word in the contract you sent twice over my eyes would have bled well just go on as we are it keeps my end of it less complicated trevor set the subject aside and turned back to aidan businessman now to businessman the three of you are gallaghers and gallaghers is ardmore the theaters going to be part of that and because of it will benefit all of us here the two are linked for the very practical reason that your business is already established already considered a center for music bringing the three of you forward as the first act to perform will get us a lot of press press means tickets and tickets mean profit for gallaghers and for the theater i follow that well enough but that we are gallaghers is another point running the pub is what we do and how much will it add to gallaghers reputation when the three of you perform and record shawns music record for celtic records well have the cds available at the theater trevor went on smoothly and we have a reputation of our ownartists packaging promotion distribution you cant manufacture this kind of hook the three of you were born into it but were not performers were publicans youre wrong youre natural performers i understand the pubs your priority im counting on that but this could be would be a very interesting profitable and satisfying sideline why does it matter to you it was the first question darcy had asked and trevor shifted his attention to her because the theater matters to me and i never settle for less than the best it means profit he added isnt that the bottom line aidan said nothing for a moment then nodded youll appreciate that this is a bit of a surprise to us all and is something we need to think over and discuss the five of us have to be agreed one way or another on the matter the overall picture so to speak before we can even consider discussing details of which i can only imagine there are many understood knowing it was time to step back and let the idea percolate trevor got to his feet if you have any questions you know where to find me brenna take your time coming back im going to the site thanks ill be right along darcy tapped a finger on aidans arm to keep him in place ill walk you out she said to trevor there were so many thoughts whirling through her mind she knew it was important vital to snatch the most significant of them and get a firm hold so she kept all those thoughts to herself until they walked outside again sure and its quite the surprise youve brought us today trevor so i see but i wonder why its such a surprise youve got ears and brains youve heard how the three of you are together maybe its that ive already heard it she glanced back knowing her family was already discussing the matter still she wanted her own thoughts and feelings settled before she added them to the mix youre not the impulsive sort not with business no so this isnt something that just popped wild into your head ive been playing the angles since the first time i heard you sing youve got a voice that goes straight to the gut right after its broken the heart its quite a talent hmm she strolled by down the narrow path through judes garden and this notion youve come to us with today youre thinking itll enhance our mutual concerns not think darcy i know its my business to know she turned her head studied him over her shoulder aye i suppose so and how much would you be paying for this enhancement now he smiled trust her to get right down to the sharpest point in the quill its negotiable and what would be the floor of that negotiation five thousand for the performance the recording rights are a separate issue her eyebrows arched one evening singing and more than shed earn waitressing for weeks in the pub pounds or dollars he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans pounds she made a little humming sound again well if we decide were interested aidan will haggle with you over that pitiful amount to be sure im looking forward to it aidans the businessman keeping his eyes on hers trevor moved to her shawns the artist and what would i be the ambition put the three parts together and youve got a hell of a team as i said before youre a clever man she looked away from him and out to sea where the waves rolled in slow and smooth ive ambitions right enough and ill be honest with you here trevor and tell you this particular idea has never occurred to me the singing for anything but my own enjoyment he surprised her by trailing a finger down the line of her throat what youve got in there can make you rich famous i can help that happen thats quite an offer and appeals to my basest of egos and desires she walked on a little farther until she stood near the street of the village where shed lived all her life how rich his laugh was easy and full of pure pleasure i like you im growing fonder of you by the minute ive a yen to be rich and im not ashamed to say so he jerked his head toward the house talk them into it no that i wont ill put in my thoughts and ill shout if i need to be heard and exchange the usual insults when theyre warranted but i wont pressure them to do anything that doesnt sit comfortably itll come from all of us or not at all its the gallagher way does it sit comfortably with you i havent decided but im enjoying the trying of it on so to speak i have to get back in there as the discussions hot and heavy by this time but what i wanted to ask as youre in the way of being an expert on such things she laid a hand on his arm looked into his eyes she wanted to see her answer there before she heard it shawn hes brilliant isnt he yes it was a simple answer almost casually given and perfect i knew it tears swam into her eyes shimmered beautifully against the blue i have to get over this before i go back in or his headll swell up so i wont be able to connect with his brain next time i cosh him im so proud of him a tear spilled over made her sniffle damn it caught off guard trevor stared at her then dug in his back pocket for his bandanna here is it clean christ youre a maze darcy here he dabbed at her cheeks himself then handed the cloth to her youd do it for him wouldnt you she blew her nose what the performance the recording youd do it for shawn even if you hated the idea its not going to hurt me any is it stop it he took her arms his eyes narrowed it wouldnt matter what it cost you youd do it for him hes my brother theres nothing i wouldnt do for him she let out a steadying breath eased back then handed him the bandanna but damned if ill do it for free when she turned to walk away he fought a little war with himself pride against need and need won get a night off damn it darcy get a night off the thrill of the rough demand shivered straight up the center of her body but the look she shot over her shoulder was designed to taunt well see the minute she was inside she leaned back against the front door shut her eyes weak something about the man left her weak and it was an odd sensation when tangled with the burst of energy that his offer and his promises had spurting through her her knees wanted to shake her feet wanted to dance and despite it all she hadnt a clue what it was she wanted in her heart she opened her eyes nearly smiled from the raised voices coming from the kitchen it was clear that her family hadnt a clue either she started back then stopped in the parlor doorway and looked at the old piano music had been as much a part of her life as the pub for always but the music had always been for the fun for the pleasure of it never for money one of her earliest memories was of that piano of sitting on her mothers lap there on that same stool while the music and the laughter ran all around she had a good strong voice she wasnt a bubbleheadshe knew her voice was fine enough but to pin her hopes on it and on trevor magees making something of it that was a different matter entirely wiser she decided to consider taking that first step without any real expectations that way there couldnt be any real disappointments she headed back in time to hear brennas furious disgust a potatos got more sense than you shawn the mans giving you the opportunity of a lifetime and youre worrying it to pieces its my lifetime isnt it i think this gives me some say in your lifetime she held up the chain that held her rings its my music and even you cant hammer it out of me youve agreed to show him another tune aidan put in playing peacemaker lets see where it goes once you have as for the other we have to look at all the angles of it he looked up gestured to darcy and we havent heard what darcy thinks about it if itll put her in a spotlight and cash in her pocket shawn said we already know what she thinks darcy merely smiled sourly as im not a peabrained idiot like some at this table ive no objection to either of those things but she trailed off until shawn narrowed his eyes im also thinking that a man the likes of magee isnt after thinking in oneshot sorts of deals or in small numbers im not sure any of us are prepared for what he really has in his mind he wants shawns music and he wants the three of you to sing it brenna threw up her hands it makes good strong sense to me there are three of us aidan spoke quietly looking from face to face each of us has different needs jude the baby the pub this house theyre my center i wont change that shawn has the new home and new life hes building with brenna the pub as well and his music but the music is made in his own time and his own way do i have the right of that you do yes and darcy im thinking that what was under the idea weve heard today what was between the lines which i caught as you did might be just the sort of thing you need i havent decided music has always been a personal thing to us something shared with family and friends i understand what brennas saying as the simple part of the notionjust the singing that night to cement the link between the pub and the theater does make good strong sense and its not as if the three of us screech like cats at the moon and would embarrass the family name by doing it but hes a canny individual is trevor magee so well have to be cannier and see that whatever we do or dont is precisely what we intend aidan nodded then turned to his wife youve said nothing jude frances dont you have thoughts on the subject several now that the shouting was over she judged everyone ready to hear them she folded her hands on her belly first the practicalities i dont know anything about publicity or entertainment but it seems to me the scenario trevor outlined is simple and smart and would be effective that benefits all of us thats true aidan agreed but if we take our music into the theater what does that leave us in the pub the informality a bigger impact because you have performed onstage because youve recorded and then anyone coming in for a pint might catch you in the mood to do a song while youre at the bar or coming out of the kitchen the tourists in particular will love it well now thats bloody brilliant darcy murmured not really its just that ive sat in the pub and ive watched and i know how lovely it is so has trevor hes very much aware of how one will affect the other next she took a deep breath individually aidan it wont change your center nothing could it isnt a matter of either or whatever you decide will be right because you have that center and it matters most to you he picked up her hand kissed it isnt she wonderful have you ever seen the like of her jude merely kept her hand in his and laid them both over their baby shawn you have a beautiful talent the more brenna loves you and admires that the more impatient she is with you for hesitating to share it then she must love me a hell of a lot which is my cross to bear brenna bit into a biscuit and glared at him i would think jude continued having your family perform and record your music would be the perfect solution you trust them and they understand you wont it be easier for you to take that step when you have that bond it shouldnt be because of me oh just answer the question darcy snapped you fishfaced jackass of course itd be easier but now shut up darcy nodded smugly and let jude finish because i think shes about to come to me and i love the attention you dont shrink from attention jude picked up her tea to sip she couldnt sit much longer in one spot her back was starting to ache performing would be second nature to you youd enjoy the stage the lights the applause shawn snorted shell lap it up like cream vanity is our darcys middle name can i help it if all the good looks in the family waited for me i dont know as i havent seen your face without a layer of paint since you were thirteen the pity of it is i have to see yours every time i turn around since looking at each other is the next thing to looking in a mirror you could find something else to argue over aidan held up a finger before either of his siblings could snipe let jude finish i nearly am amazing she thought how quickly shed become used to the rhythm of this family i imagine youd enjoy being onstage playing to the audience but if the idea of it terrified you if you hated the very thought of it youd do it anyway youd do anything for these two though the statement was perilously close to the end of her conversation with trevor darcy let out an amused snort i do to please myself in a great many things jude agreed this youd do for aidan and aidans the pub youd do it for shawn and shawns the music last of all youd do it for yourself for the fun the funs a factor isnt it darcy rose started to move casually to the stove but aidan caught her hand as she went by he tugged she resisted he tugged again with a little sigh she went into his lap tell me what you want darcy darling a chance i suppose he nodded met shawns eyes across the table lets give it a day or two to simmer then ill talk to magee again and see just whats up his sleeve chapter nine the hums and grumbles and thuds outside her window drove darcy out of bed early every morning whenever she thought about it going on for nearly another year she was tempted to bury her head under the pillow and smother herself since suicide wasnt in her makeup though she tried to make the best of it she could turn up her music loud or just lie there and pretend she was in a big noisy city new york chicago all that noise was really traffic and people bustling under her lovely lofty penthouse flat most of the time that worked when it didnt she got up and spent quite a bit of time in the shower cursing otherwise if she was in the mood shed wander over to look down and watch the work for a while and look for trevor she didnt allow herself to do it dailyor allow herself to be seen daily that would be predictable she liked looking at him seeing what he was up to that morning some days he was standing on the edge of things his hair blowing in the wind discussing something or other with brenna or mick otoole in the way men did with thumbs tucked into pockets and wise sober expressions on their faces and othersand she liked the others besthe was in the middle of the thing hammering or hauling or drilling stripped down to his shirtsleeves and if the angle was right she could watch a ripple of muscle it was odd not that she hadnt always enjoyed taking a good long look at men but she couldnt remember ever being so interested in the look of one man before or being so fascinated by studying him as he went about manual labor he had a fine build she mused as she stood framed in the window that was part of it a woman who didnt appreciate a long and wiry build on a man well she had a problem as far as darcy was concerned it was the way he moved too light on his feet confident and in control she imagined and why wouldnt she imagine that he would be just as confident and in control with a female in bed control would make a man thorough and a thorough loving was no small matter to a woman still she had to wonder what it would take to snap that control a loving wild and fierce was no small matter either it concerned her in a mild sort of way that she thought of him as often as she did looked for him as often as she did in the mornings like this at midday in the evening sometimes he came into the pub sometimes he didnt she was certain it was purposeful on his part that lack of predictability they were gaming with each other and both knew it perfectly well and damn but didnt she like that about him the man was every bit as arrogant as she was herself she hadnt arranged for a night off that was purposeful on her part it was true enough that she liked keeping him waiting but she was keeping herself waiting as well with a delicious sort of tension inside her she understood that when they spent the evening together it wouldnt be just a matter of having dinner dinner wasnt what either of them wanted it had been a long time since shed had an urge for a man a particular man she missed the feel of one against her that was true the strength and the heat that flash of fire in the belly that came just before release she was a woman who enjoyed sex darcy admitted the problem being thered been no one to tempt her for more than a year sure and she was tempted now she thought when trevor looked up and their eyes met she enjoyed absorbed the edgy little thrill that whipped down her spine the man tempted her in all manner of ways so it was time to arrange for that night off she smiled down at him slow and sly then deliberately stepped back let him do some thinking about that she decided restless not ready to face the long day or even dress for it as yet she wandered her rooms she put on the kettle for tea more out of habit than desire the rooms such as they were were the first shed had all to herself in all of her life it had been a shocking surprise to realize she missed the company of her brothers even their untidiness shed always liked things just so and her rooms reflected it shed painted the walls a quiet rose well shed browbeaten shawn into doing most of the work but the results were pleasing to her from her bedroom at home shed taken her favorite framed posters monets water lilies and a forest scene shed found in a bookshop she liked the dreaminess of them shed made the curtains herself as she had a fine hand with a needle when she wanted to the pillows she piled on the ancient sofa were from her hand as well a practical woman who preferred nice things understood it was cheaper by far to buy a length of satin or velvet and put in the time than to plunk down the cost for readymade and it left more spending money for shoes or earrings standing on a table was her wish jar full of coins that came from tips and one day she thought one fine day there would be enough for her to take the next trip an extravagant trip next time to anywhere a tropical island maybe where she could wear an excuse for a bikini and drink something foolish and fruity out of a coconut shell or italy to sit on some sunbaked terrace and look out over redtiled roofs and grand cathedrals or new york where she would stroll along fifth avenue and gaze at all the treasures behind the forest of shop windows and pick out what was waiting just for her one day she thought and wished whenever she imagined it that she didnt see herself alone it didnt matter she had enjoyed her week in paris alone so she would enjoy the others in their time meanwhile she was here and so was the work she brewed the tea first and told herself that since she was up early shed lounge on the sofa page through one of her glossy magazines and enjoy a quiet morning before she settled in her gaze landed on the violin she kept on a stand more for decoration than convenience frowning she set her cup aside and picked up the instrument it was old but had a clear voice would it be this she wondered would it be the music that had always been part of her life that finally opened the doors for her that took her into those places she dreamed of and rolled out the red carpet she was dying to walk on wouldnt that be odd she murmured something you never think twice about because its always been there idly she rosined the bow tucked the violin under her chin and played what came first to mind hed expected her to come down trevor left the site slipped into the kitchen with the excuse of making a phone call but she wasnt there he heard the music the aching romantic notes of a violin the kind of music he thought that belonged to moonlight he followed it her door was at the head of the stairs and the music seemed to swell against it rising up like hope sliding down like tears he didnt even think to knock he saw her half turned away eyes closed lost her hair was loose still tumbled from sleep to rain down the back of a long blue robe one narrow bare foot tapped the time the look of her clogged his lungs the music she made had his throat burning she played for herself and the quiet pleasure of it glowed on that remarkable face everything he wanted had planned for dreamed of seemed to melt together in that one woman that one moment and left him shaken to the bone the music soared note echoing against note then slid away to silence still drifting she sighed opened her eyes and saw him her heart stuttered an almost painful sensation before she could recover before she could slip on the mask of a knowing smile he crossed to her she felt her breath catch as if someone had squeezed a hand over her throat or her heart then his mouth was on hers hot fierce glorious her arms fell weakly to her sides as if the fiddle and bow had taken on great weight his hands were on her face in her hair and need pumped like heat from his body into hers she took had no choice but to take that hard slap of desire she gave finally he felt her give that slow somehow liquid surrender of the female that made every man feel like a king because she did because it brought the ache inside him toward something like a tremble he gentledlips handscruising now caressing savoring when he drew away she fought off a shudder forced a smile to her lips well now good morning to you just shut up a minute he pulled her back but this time simply rested his cheek on top of her head she wanted to step back this embrace was more intimate than the kiss and just as stirring just she realized as she relaxed against him as irresistible trevor ssh for some reason that made her laugh arent you the bossy one the tension hed worried would blow off the top of his head faded away i dont know why i bother you dont listen anyway why should i he held her another moment steady enough now to appreciate that her robe was very thin do you ever lock that door why should i now she did step back no one comes in and stays in unless i want them to ill remember that he lifted a hand brushed at her hair i didnt know you could play oh music is the gallagher way she gestured with the violin then set it back on its stand i was in the mood for some thats all what was it you were playing one of shawns tunes there arent any words to it it doesnt need any he saw it the way her eyes warmed with pride play something else she only moved her shoulders laid the bow aside im not in the mood now she picked up her tea and now her eyes were sharp with both humor and calculation and im thinking i might start saving my songs for those who pay would you sign a recording contract solo she nearly jolted but recovered neatly why that would depend on the terms what do you want oh i want this and that and all of the other things she walked to the sofa sat crossed her legs im a selfish and greedy creature magee i want lavish luxury and pampering and slavish admiration i dont quibble about working for them but i want them at the end of the day considering her he sat on the arm of the couch beside her and testing trailed a fingertip over her collarbone paused just above the rise of her breast i can get them for you her eyes went cold shot out a blast of air so frigid it could have frozen blood ive no doubt you can with one sharp move she knocked his hand aside but thats not the sort of work i have in mind good then we keep one separate from the other ice turned to fire in the blink of an eye was that a little experiment then and what would you have done if id laid back for you cant say he took her cup and helped himself to her tea youre a delectable package darcy but youd have disappointed me he placed a hand on her shoulder when she started to spring up felt the temper vibrating like a plucked bow string ill apologize for it i dont trade myself for profit i didnt think you did but there had been other women whod offered it had and did leave a nasty taste in his mouth i want you on two levels one as a business one as a man id like you to understand the first has nothing to do with the second she eased back struggling with the temper she knew could be an ugly thing and youd like reassurance of the same from me i just got it you could have done so with more style agreed it had been cold calculatedsomething he thought that his grandfather might have done im sorry he said and meant it and which level would that apology come from touch he thought one from each as each was out of line she took her tea back from him then ill accept each lets put the business aside for now i need to go to london for a couple of days hed intended to put it off but she wanted things why not give her a taste come with me shed clicked her temper back to simmer but this sudden twist blanked it out and left her puzzled wary you want me to go to london with you why first because i want to take you to bed he took the mug back again thinking as he did that the tea had become a kind of prop between them that weve established already there are beds in ardmore our schedules havent been meshing in ardmore and second i enjoy your company have you been to london no youll like it most probably i would she took the mug when he held it out sipped the tea to give herself time to think he was offering her something shed always wanted to travel in style to see london and not to see it alone he would expect sex naturally but then so would she what point was there pretending to be coy about something they both knew was bound to happen anyway when do you go im flexible she let out a short laugh no that you are not but if your schedule is i might be able to work it out i need to speak with aidan and arrange for a replacement he wont be pleased with me but i can get round him im sure you can let me know what days work for you and ill take care of the rest that practiced feline smile was back oh i like that having a man take care of the rest you run along now she rose then deliberately trailed her fingers over his jaw ill get back to you when i can he caught her wrist his grip just hard enough to show her he was serious you wont play me darcy im not like the others she stood where she was as he released her as he walked out and shut the door yes indeed she could agree with that he wasnt anything like anyone shed known and wasnt it going to be interesting to find out just what and who he was youve had your holiday shed wanted to catch aidan at home rather than wait for him to come into the pub shed had to rush to manage it and was pleased to find him finishing up his breakfast his first response was exactly what shed expected and didnt discourage her in the least i know and a lovely one it was all cheer she topped off his tea then snuck finn a corner of toast under the table just as i know its a lot to ask of you so soon after but this is an opportunity i dont want to miss youve traveled aidan she kept her voice soft and sweet it was the tack shed decided on just as effective would have been demands curses and tempers but she was certain that this tone would work more quickly youve already seen so much and been so many places you know what it is to yearn for that its in our blood sos the pub and high seasons starting he added more jam to his bread finn knowing the routine shifted so aidan could sneak him a bite in turn i cant have jude filling in for you now when shes only weeks till term i wouldnt think of it if i see her carrying a tray ill knock you upside the head with it because he knew the sentiment and the threat were completely sincere aidan sighed darcy i count on you to keep the service running smooth i know and thats what i do day in and day out ive worked with sinead though there were times i wanted to bash the girls brains on the bar shes improved considerable over the last couple weeks she has but aidan continued to brood over his breakfast i was going to ask betsy clooney if shed do me the favor of covering for me for the two days shes worked the pub before and she knows the routine christ darcy betsys got herself a brood of kids now she hasnt worked the pub for ten years it hasnt changed overmuch and ill wager betsyd enjoy it shes reliable aidan as you know she is but and theres another thing i wanted to put to you young alice mae could use a summer job alice mae aidan stopped brooding to goggle shes barely fifteen and all three of us were working before that without harm brenna mentioned her baby sister wanted to earn some spending money id like to give her a chance shes a bright girl and being an otoole shell work hard id start her on the one shift the midday today so i can have her trained before i leave for london christ she was in nappies yesterday getting old arent you she rose just long enough to kiss his cheek i want to go aidan and ill see the service is handled smooth while im gone was a time only gallaghers worked gallaghers but for brenna now and again but that was practically the same thing we cant stay with that and because she understood some of the sentiment even a twinge of the regret she rose again and standing behind him wrapped her arms around his neck weve already made the changes i guess we started when ma and dad moved to boston well be bigger now but well still be gallaghers aye and its what i want for us still there are moments i remember and wonder if ive done right youre the worrier and bless you for it of course youve done right well and right aidan by gallaghers and all of us im proud of you he lifted a hand patted hers sliding a bit of bacon to finn with the other now youre trying to get round me that way i would if id thought of it she gave him a last squeeze i need to go i need to see he knew how it was precisely the deep churning need to go and to see hed taken five years to work it out of his system she was asking for two days but im going to say it out plain i dont care for the notion of you going off with magee darcy rounded her eyes pursed her lips when jude came in at that moment she decided it was perfect timing and turned to her sisterinlaw did you hear that no im sorry what aidans taken a sudden and avid interest in my sex life ive not damn it he wasnt easily fuddled but shed managed it i didnt say anything about sex he hissed out a breath when darcy only stared at him i implied it he said with some dignity oh implied is it i think ill go back upstairs jude began no you dont darcy waved her to a chair finn immediately bellied over prepared for the next covert treat sit down for this should be interesting your husband here my darling brother is implying that he disapproves of my having sex with magee christ jesus aidan put his head in his hands ill go upstairs that you wont would you like some tea jude darling without waiting for an answer darcy got a cup and poured out first we should establish whether your husband my brother objects to me having sex altogether or just in this particular case she sat again and her smile was sugarsweet and which would it be aidan my dear youre pissing me off oh now temper temper i didnt say anything about sex i said i didnt care for the idea of you going off to london with him youre going to london jude asked and decided to relax and have some toast trevor asked me to accompany him on a short business trip but it appears aidan would prefer i had sex with trevor here rather than there is that correct i dont want you having sex with him at all as its a tangle frustration pumped through him causing him to roar it as both women sat quietly staring at him and i dont want to know about it one way or the other then ill be sure to spare you the details she spoke coolly now which only rattled the sabers of his own temper mind your step mind your own she shot back my personal life particularly this area of it is no ones business but mine trevor and i understand the tangle youve referred to and as sensible people will be careful enough not to trip up in it eyes still frosty she rose im going to ring up brennas mother and ask about alice mae and ill talk to betsy clooney as well the details will be seen to before i go good day to you jude she added and kissed her sisterinlaw on the cheek before she flounced out the air hummed in the gallagher kitchen for several moments as jude casually nibbled her toast well what have you to say about it aidan demanded not a thing hah he stewed drummed his fingers scowled but youre thinking of saying something about it she decided to try the jam not really i think darcy covered it all there he jabbed an accusing finger youre on her side of course she smiled now so are you he shoved back from the table and began to pace in sympathy finn came out from under the table to pace with him she thinks she can handle this handle him the girl sees herself as sophisticated and worldly christ jude shes been sheltered all her life she hasnt had the time or opportunities to know jude set her toast aside aidan some are born knowing be that as it may shes never come up against a man like magee hes a slick one i think hes a good man an honest one but slick all the same i dont want him using my sister is that how you see it i cant see it and thats the problem but i know hes handsome and hes rich and however much darcys always joked about landing herself just that he could dazzle her and dazzled how can she see where shes going aidan jude said softly how can you i dont want her hurt i do shock simply robbed him of speech he stared at his wife laid a hand on the back of his chair and managed to find his voice how could you say such a thing how could you want darcy hurt if he can hurt her he matters aidan no mans ever really mattered to her theyve been well toys amusements diversions dont you want her to find someone who matters of course i do but i cant see it being magee annoyed he began to pace again not when both of them are thinking with their glands he shook his head trips to london barely know each other and its trips to london i walked into a smoky pub on a rainy night and there you were my life changed and i didnt even know who you were he stopped pacing love too huge to measure swelled in his heart a one in a million for us he sat reached across the table for her hands and fate played a part maybe its playing one now his eyes narrowed youre thinking this has something to do with the legend the last part of it i think theres one gallagher left one heart not yet touched or offered or given and i think its interestingno its fascinatingthat trevor magee is in ardmore as a writer she paused a moment because it was still thrilling to know she was a writer id have trouble believing its just coincidence the old family connection darcys a fitzgerald on your mothers side and cousin to maude trevors greatuncle was maudes one and only love they lost each other just as gwen and carrick lost each other thats just your imagination and your romantic side taking over jude frances is it she shrugged well have to wait and see wont we she wasnt waiting for anything alice mae was already on her way in and betsy had been delighted at the offer of two days work pleased with herself darcy breezed through the kitchen and straight out the back door it was a bit of a shock to step out and into the solid gray block walls and lumber bones of the breezeway that would connect the two structures already she thought there was some form to it recognizable even to her untutored eye men stood on scaffolding hammering or drilling or riveting how could she tell through all the noise someone a very optimistic someone to her mind was playing a radio all she could hear from it was a tinkle and squawk that might have been music she saw the way the roof would curve in a kind of arch the rafters thick to echo the feel of those that had held the pub for generations unexpectedly she felt a twinge and recognized it as pride gallaghers was the root and the theater a branch on the tree she walked through mindful of the cables and cords that snaked over the subflooring shed already spotted trevor up on the scaffolding platform at the far end where the breezeway widened his tool belt was slung at his waist and there was some clever power tool buzzing in his hand he wore tinted glasses as much for protection from flying wood and concrete dust she supposed as a shield against the mild sunlight he looked rough and ready and exactly right for her mood she stopped beneath him waiting aware that many of the men were looking at her rather than going safely about their business mick otoole sauntered by a bundle of rebar balanced over his shoulder youre distracting our crew pretty darcy i wont be but a minute hows it all going then mr otoole himself knows what he wants and how he wants it as im in agreement with him it couldnt be going better will it be wonderful it will a credit to ardmore watch your step here now darling lots to trip over hereabouts ive thought of that she murmured there was a great deal to trip over when it came to trevor magee when mick headed off she looked back up and saw it was trevor who waited now that was more like it a word with you mr magee she shouted up what can i do for you miss gallagher so he wouldnt trouble to come down that was fine she skimmed her hair back from her shoulder i need today and tomorrow to train a new parttime waitress but im at your disposal come thursday if that suits you anticipation curled in his gut but he merely nodded well leave thursday morning then ill pick you up at six thats a very early start why waste time for a beat they only watched each other why indeed she turned strolled back into the kitchen and when the door was closed did a quick victory dance chapter ten after considerable debate and weighing of the pros and cons darcy decided to be on time her reasons for breaking precedent were purely selfish and she didnt mind admitting it she wanted to enjoy every minute of her two days off shed packed light which hadnt been an easy feat for her and because of it the chore had taken her hours planning debating discarding shed raided her wish jar something she did only for the most important of events but she needed to buy something wonderful to commemorate the trip didnt she for two days shed worked like a mule to be certain her responsibilities at the pub were well covered in lieu of sleep shed given herself a manicure a pedicure and a facial to make certain she presented as polished an image as she could manage shed selected her lingerie with the canniness and foresight of a general preparing for battle trevor magee wouldnt know what hit himonce she allowed him to seduce her the idea had odd little nerves fluttering in her stomach and she wanted to be had to be calm cool cosmopolitan she had no intention of playing the culchiecountry bumpkinin london or in bed part of the problem was trevor was exactly as aidan had described him slick it didnt matter if he dressed in work clothes and sweated along with his crew or waded through the mud hauling supplies still beneath the sweat and dirt was a gloss that came from privilege education and wealth shed met other men from privilege the fact was shed honed the skill of recognizing and separating from the pack those trust fund babies on tour or holiday but a trust fund babe trevor was not and she thought never had been with all his wealth he worked and the power of both the rewards and the labor sat well on him that earned her respect and darcy gave her respect sparingly shed never known anyone quite like him and while that intrigued her it also made her wary added to it all layered through the observations and the interest was the not so simple fact that she wanted him shed never wanted a man with quite so much focus and intensity she wanted his hands on her his mouth on hers his body on hers in the few hours shed slept the night before shed dreamed of him strange confused dreams in them hed come to her on a white winged horse and together theyd flown over a sea as blue as sapphire over the damp green fields of home through pearly light toward a silver palace where trees had dripped with golden apples and silver pears and the music that rose into the air was enough to break the heart in the dream for that short misty time she was in love in a way shed never thought she could be had never been certain she wanted to be so completely blindly joyfully in love that nothing seemed to matter but those moments with him hed said only one thing to her as theyd flown through sunlight moonlight faerie light everything and more all she could say all she could feel as she turned her body to his laid her cheek upon his was you youre everything and more shed meant it with everything she had inside her all she would ever have would ever be and waking shed wished she could feel that again so much power of emotion but shed lost it in dreams and could only smile at her own fancies neither she nor trevor wanted fancies at six on the dot she carried her bag downstairs and her heart thumped with anticipation what would she see and do and taste over the next fortyeight hours everything the thought elated her and more she took one last scan of the pub tidy and scrubbed sinead betsy and alice mae should surely be able to handle what she often did alone shed drummed the routine into their heads and had left a written list as a backup satisfied she let herself out and promised not to give the pub a single thought until she stepped foot in it again it was the dot of six it pleased her to see trevor pull up to the curb as she walked out they were of a mind then she thought things would go smoother because of it it surprised her to see he was wearing a suit italian she imagined when he got out of the car to take her luggage blisteringly pricey she was sure but not a bit flashy the stone gray matched his eyes well and the shirt and tie were all of a hue so the look was smartly european power she thought again yes he wore it very well well now look at you deliberately she fingered his sleeve as he loaded her luggage into the boot arent you pretty this morning i have a meeting he closed the boot then went around to open her door the timings a little tight he got a whiff of her as she slid past him and wished the meeting and all its participants straight to hell she waited until he was in the drivers seat id think a man in your position could call his own time you do that and you bring one more thing into a meeting that usually bogs things up ego but ive noticed youve got one he swung away from the curb the tricks recognizing it ive arranged for a car and driver to meet us at heathrow hell take you to the house so you can settle in hell be at your disposal through the day if you want to sightsee or shop will he imagine that well thats considerate of you ill have more free time tomorrow but todays packed he glanced at her i should be done by six this evening we have dinner reservations at eight does that suit you perfectly good my assistant faxed over several points of interest i have the file in my briefcase you can take a look during the flight to help you plan what youd like to do today thats a lovely thought and ill do just that but you neednt worry that ill have trouble entertaining myself he glanced over she wore a trim jacket and slacks of slate blue and had matched them with a soft faintly shimmering blouse the color of roses drenched in cream the choice was more than stylish it was cleverly completely female no i dont imagine you will inexplicably miffed that she wouldnt be wandering aimlessly missing him waiting for him he fell into silence more like a business arrangement than a what the hell was it anyway an assignation he didnt care for the word but he didnt suppose romance fit the situation either neither of them was the starryeyed type they wanted what they wanted better to be up front and systematic about it but it irritated him nonetheless they arrived at waterfords airport on schedule and it was there darcy got her first taste of what a man who walked in wealth could command their luggage was whisked away and they were guided through security with a great deal of this way mr magee and i hope you enjoy your trip mr magee remembering the hassles and glitches in her recent travel to paris darcy reaffirmed her determination to travel first class or not to travel at all but even her imagining of top drawer took a bump when trevor led her out on the tarmac toward a sleek little plane is this yours the companys he told her taking her arm for the short trip up the steps i do a lot of traveling so its more convenient to have my own transportation she stepped inside and had to struggle not to gasp i bet it is the seats were done in rich navy leather and were sized generously crystal vases were tucked into silver holders on the creamcolored walls between the windows each held a dewy bouquet of fresh yellow rosebuds her feet sank into the carpet a uniformed flight attendant with a polite smile and flawless skin greeted her by name then asked if she would care for a mimosa before takeoff champagne for breakfast she thought just imagine that that would be lovely thank you coffee for me monica want a tour he asked darcy i would yes hoping she wasnt gawking darcy set down her purse galleys through here she peeked in and saw that the efficient monica already had coffee brewing and was popping the cork on a bottle of champagne the small space seemed to use every inch resourcefully and stainlesssteel surfaces gleamed cockpit trevor gestured through the already open door the man sitting at a panel of complicatedlooking controls swiveled in his chair ready when you are mr magee good morning miss gallagher you can look forward to a short but smooth flight into heathrow thank you do you fly this plane all by yourself with no copilot its a oneman operation he told her but i dont need a copilot when mr magees on board is that so do you fly then trevor occasionally give us ten minutes donald then clear with the tower yes sir we have a lot of interests in europe trevor began as he led darcy back through the main cabin we use this equipment primarily for the shortrange flights over here and for the longer flights we have larger equipment he opened a door inside was an office complete with what looked to be a trim antique desk a computer console a wall screen for viewing videos and a bed she caught a glimpse of the bath through a side door everything gleamed all the creature comforts and the business ones as well you do better with the second if you have the first celtics relatively young at six years but its growing and its profitable ah so the london business has to do with celtic records then for the most part yes if you need something and dont see it just ask she turned back to him i see everything i need he lifted a hand to toy with the ends of her hair good lets get started havent we already she murmured as they walked back to their seats darcy settled in accepted the glinting flute holding her mimosa and prepared to have the time of her life the pilot was a man of his word the flight was short and smooth as far as darcy was concerned she could have flown for hours and been thrilled shed made casual small talk until shed realized trevor was distracted about his upcoming meetings she imagined and left him to his planning while she looked over the list of suggestions from his assistant god yes she wanted to see it all of it hyde park and harrods buckingham palace and chelsea she wanted to experience the wild traffic of the streets and the grand shade of the great parks the trip through heathrow was hardly more complex than the airport at home money paves the way she thought as they slid through customs still she hadnt expected the car and driver hed arranged for her to be a limo and a chauffeur words stuttered into her throat and were ruthlessly swallowed down again until she could smile up at trevor easily are we dropping you at your meeting then no opposite directions ill see you this evening good luck with your work she started to take the drivers offered hand to slip into the limo as shed practiced doing in her mind smoothly gracefully as if shed done it all her life but trevor took her arm said her name and had her looking back up at him lips just curved then she was yanked up on her toes her hands clutching at his shoulders for balance her mouth gloriously assaulted the swift change of mood from coolheaded businessman to hotblooded lover was so swift so complete so erotic before the moan could slither from heart to throat to lips he released her after one smoldering look he nodded in what might have been satisfaction enjoy your day he told her and left her standing nearly swaying beside the discreetly blankeyed driver and the open limo door she managed to slide in the fact was her bones were so loose it felt as though she was pouring herself into the rarefied air inside the limo scented with roses and leather it took every ounce of will to click herself back to absorb and appreciate her first ride in a long quiet car she trailed her fingers along the seat buttersmooth and the color of storm clouds like his eyes just moments before she thought the driver seemed to be a full block away behind the smokedglass privacy screen determined to remember every detail darcy noted the television the crystal glasses the shimmer of lights along the roof and the window in it she relaxed to the romantic sweep of classical music already playing over the stereo and as she started to stretch out her legs and purr she finally spotted the slim box on the seat beside her it was wrapped in gold with a silver ribbon she snatched at it then wincing glanced toward the driver a woman of the world would hardly dive into a gift shed be so used to them as to nearly be bored chuckling to herself darcy opened the small envelope welcome to london trev doesnt miss a trick does he darcy said to herself well good for me assured that the driver wasnt paying attention she picked at the tape with her fingernail she didnt want to tear the paper wallowing in anticipation she tucked both the ribbon and the gift wrap carefully folded into her purse then took a breath held it opened the long velvet box oh mother of god she yelped it forgot about the driver about sophistication about everything but the outrageous sparkle currently dazzling her eyes gaping she held the bracelet up letting the glinting stones stream down like water it was slim and might have been delicate if not for all those bold colors surely that was emerald and ruby and sapphire and all framed by diamonds as brilliant as the sun never in her life had she touched anything so beautiful so fine so ridiculously expensive she really shouldnt accept it shed only just try it on see how it looked how it felt it looked gorgeous and felt even better as she turned her wrist watched it wink felt that almost liquid slide of gold over her skin she decided shed rather cut off her hand than give the bracelet back her conscience would just have to adjust she spent so much time admiring the bracelet she nearly missed the thrill of the drive through london when she snapped back she had to struggle with the urge to roll down the window and lean out to take in everything all at once what to see first she wondered what to do it was all so much to squeeze into two short days she would unpack her things quickly and dive straight in she began outlining her stops as she watched london sweep by when the limo stopped in front of a dignified town house she frowned and searched for the hotel no she remembered with a jolt trevor had said house not hotel the man lived three thousand miles away in new york city and had a house in london would wonders never cease composing herself she took the drivers hand when he came around to her door ill bring your bags straight in miss gallagher thank you very much she crossed over and started up the short set of steps between rigorously formal hedges hoping she looked as though she knew what she was doing the door opened before shed worked out whether she should knock or just go inside a tall slim man with a fringe of white hair bowed to her miss gallagher i hope your trip was pleasant im stiles mr magees butler were pleased to welcome you thank you she started to offer her hand stopped that probably wasnt done particularly with british butlers would you care to see your room or may we offer you some refreshment ah id like to see my room if thats convenient of course ill see to your luggage winthrup will show you upstairs winthrup moved forward with barely a sound a wisp of a woman in the same formal black as the butler her hair was a colorless ash quietly styled her eyes pale as water behind thick lenses good morning miss gallagher if youll follow me ill see you settled dont gawk you idiot trying desperately for casual darcy crossed the gleaming golden wood of the foyer walked under the magnificence of the central chandelier and started up the grandeur of the staircase she couldnt say it was like a palace it was too ruthlessly dignified for that like a museum she thought all polished and hushed and intimidating there was art on the walls but she didnt dare take time to study it the walls themselves must have been papered in silk so smooth and rich did they appear she had to curl her fingers to keep them from touching the housekeeper as she imagined winthrup was the housekeeper led the way down a corridor wainscoted in deep rich wood darcy wondered how many rooms there were how they were furnished what she would see from the windows then winthrup opened a deeply carved door onto luxury the bed was big as a lake its four posters spearing toward the deeply coved ceiling darcy didnt know what sort of rugs were spread over the polished floor but she could tell they were old and magnificent everythingchest of drawers bureaus mirrors tableswas polished to mirror gleams dozens of white roses bloomed out of a crystal vase that she imagined weighed ten pounds if it weighed an ounce draperies of deep forest green were tied back with gold tassels framing the glinting glass there was a fireplace fashioned out of white marble veined with rose and towering candlesticks flanked the mantel more flowers lilies this time in that same blinding white stood in the center a cozy arrangement plush chairs polished tables was set in a way that invited her to settle in the sitting room is to the right and the master bath to the left winthrup folded her thin hands would you like me to unpack for you now or would you prefer to rest a bit first i darcy feared she might swallow her tongue actually i no i dont need to rest thank you just the same ill be happy to show you around the house if you like do you think i might just wander about a bit of course mr magee hopes youll make yourself at home here youve only to push nine on the house phone to reach me and eight to reach stiles perhaps youd like to freshen up i would thank you very much on rubbery legs darcy started toward the bath the hell with it she thought turned back miss winthrup its a lovely room winthrups smile was as wispy as the rest of her but it managed to soften her face a little yes it is darcy walked into the bath deliberately shut her eyes and leaned back on the door she felt as though she were in a play or one of her own more creative dreams but she wasnt it was real she could feel her heart beating in her chest and little thrills of sheer pleasure dancing over her skin she sighed once then opened her eyes to simply grin at the bathroom they mustve taken out another room to make it so large she imagined more flowers graced the long counter between two oval sinks the tiles floor and walls were of a soft seafoam green so it seemed you were in some lovely underwater fantasy the tub with its wide ledge covered with lush ferny plants was surely big enough for three the shower was separate a room in itself she thought as she moved closer to investigate behind the waving glass were a half a dozen nozzles she imagined it was like bathing in a waterfall and nearly stripped down to the skin then and there to see if she was right more crystal was set about little bowls and dishes holding fragrant soaps or rose petals pretty bottles holding bath oils and bath salts and creams she sat on a padded bench at a separate counter obviously designed for milady and studied her own flushed and delighted face in the mirror youve arrived havent you throughout his first meeting and his second trevor kept darcy tucked away or nearly she had a baffling habit of popping out of the corner where he wanted her sliding out was more like it he mused sneakily sinuously sliding into his mind when it needed to be focused elsewhere he glanced at his watch again there were hours yet before he could afford to focus on her but when he did by god hed make sure the wait was worth it trev hmm when he realized he was scowling he smoothed out his features waved a hand in apology sorry nigel my mind wandered thats a new one nigel kelsey the head of the london arm of celtic records had a sharp eye and sharper ears hed been with trevor at oxford where theyd clicked when the time had come to expand his personal baby into the international arena trevor had put the responsibility into nigels trusted hands just shuffling items in my head lets flip shawn gallagher to the top of the list happy to nigel sat back in his chair he rarely used his desk thought of it primarily as a prop hed been earmarked to follow his father and his fathers father into law a fate that even now caused him to shudder he hadnt wanted to thumb his nose at family tradition precisely but he was much happier putting what education he had to use doing something entertaining celtic records was vastly entertaining even if his old friend did run a tight ship a tight ship and a profitable one nigel thought now a ship that visited such fascinating ports part of his responsibilities and he took them seriously included attending parties events entertaining the talent and doing it all on expense account im negotiating with him one on one trevor continued two on one if we count his wife and we should ive advised him to get an agent nigel seemed a bit surprised but trevor only shrugged i like him nigel and i intend to deal straight with him since he wont go through a representative you deal straight in any case trev im the one who doesnt mind slipping a card from the bottom of the deck now and again just to liven things up not with him instinct tells me weve got a prize here one that if left to his own pace will pay off for years i agree with you his works brilliant and very marketable theres more is there nigel puzzled again when trevor rose to wander the office it was a rare thing to see trevor restless to have the man let any restlessness show even to him i thought there might be when you scheduled this meeting in the middle of your other project he has a brother and a sister i want the three of them to record his stuff for the first release nigel frowned drummed his hand which was studded with rings must be some brother and sister believe me still trev you know it would be easier to market this package using an established artist im leaving it to you to find a way around that with a faint smile trevor turned back ive heard them i want you to come to ardmore for a couple of days you listen and if you think im wrong about this well talk again ardmore nigel winced then twisted the tiny gold hoop in his earlobe jesus trev whats an avowed urbanite like myself going to do in a barelyonthemap irish seaside village listen trevor said simply theres something about the gallaghers but before i push the point with them or with you i want you to see and hear for yourself i want an objective opinion and when hasnt your own been objective theres something about the gallaghers trevor said again something about ardmore the area unconsciously he fingered the silver disk resting under his shirt maybe its the goddamn air i dont know i want you to come over i want your take on it nigel lifted his hands let them fall youre the boss i suppose i should see what there is about this place thats caused you to sink so much time money and effort into your theater brainstorm it wasnt a brainstorm its a very solid business concept dont snort trevor warned anticipating him i never snort i do occasionally guffaw but ill resist good i have a new piece from shawn gallagher trevor walked over retrieved the sheet music from his briefcase take a look nigel only smiled rather hear it he said and gestured to the piano across the room all right but hes orchestrated it for guitar violin and flute ill get the idea nigel closed his eyes as trevor walked to the piano he himself couldnt play a note but he had an uncanny sense of music nonetheless and his antenna began to quiver as trevor played the opening bars quick nigel thought lively subtly sexy and fun yes trevor was right as always they had a gold mine in shawn gallagher and it wouldnt hurt to meet the man facetoface he supposed even if it did mean traveling to ireland god help him he listened nodding to himself then grinning when trevor sang the lyrics his friend had a strong voice and still an easy one but the words needed a female nigel recognized it at once ill have your hand ill have your heart ill have them all together for if you think ill settle for part prepare for stormy weather yes a womans song confident even arrogant and sexy he opened his eyes again and grinned as trevor played it out he wasnt an easy sell but his foot was tapping before the song was done the mans a fucking genius nigel declared simple straightforward lyrics in a tangle of complicated notes not everyone can sing that one and punch it no but i have someone in mind who can make arrangements for ardmore nigel nigel took a pull on the designer water that was never beyond arms reach if i must i must now is that the bulk of the business on our slate this afternoon the bulk yes why because id like to know as an old and trusted friend just whats crawling around under your skin youre nervy trev and its not usual for you he didnt like that it showed was going to make damn sure it didnt before he saw darcy again theres a woman son theres always a woman not like this one i brought her with me oh did you now thats a new one each word was stretched long and full of meaning and when do i get to have a look at her trevor sat again ordered himself to relax come to ardmore he said and directed the conversation back to business chapter eleven she wasnt quite sure how to play it and it did seem like being onstage should she be sitting in the splendor of the parlor having tea or a cocktail when trevor returned or would it be more casual and sophisticated if she were up in the sitting room passing the time with a book perhaps she should take a walk and not be there at all in the end not being sure of the lines or motivations of the character she appeared to be playing darcy prepared to dress for the evening she took her time about it and that was a luxury itself having buckets of time to loll in the bath to make use of the lovely scented creams that were set about in antique bottles better to be ready she decided as she smoothed the silky lotion on her legs and avoid any awkwardness of just how and where the two of them were going to dress for dinner sex as she saw it was the final act in todays play and she had to admit she was both eager for and nervous about the performance yes much wiser to meet him in the sophisticated mode wearing the little black dress she would indeed go down have a cocktail so when he came in she would be sitting in that almost terrifyingly formal parlor all sort of ladyofthemanorish winthrup would probably serve little canapsor did the butler do that well no matter she could offer him one as if she did such things every day that was just how to play the part when scented and polished she stepped out of the bath to the bedroom just as trevor stepped in from the hall her stomach did a shaky flip time to adlib she thought and put on her best smile well hello there i thought youd be another hour or more i finished up early today he kept his eyes on hers as he closed the door behind him and how was your day lovely thank you why couldnt she get her legs to move it would be far better if she could just stroll across the room i hope yours was successful it was worth the trip as he stepped forward she managed to shove herself away from the door moved to the little table where shed laid the bracelet i want to thank you for this its beautiful and extravagant which is nearly as important we both know i shouldnt accept it he closed the distance between them and taking the bracelet circled it around her wrist and we both know you will he fastened it with a quiet click that echoed in her head i suppose we do ive a hard time resisting the beautiful and extravagant why resist firmly possessively he laid his hands on her shoulders ran them down the arms of her robe i dont intend to it wasnt the way hed planned it hed imagined it all very civilized drinks then the sort of elegant dinner shed enjoy a quiet ride home then a smooth practiced seduction that would please them both but here she was in that long robe her skin warm and fragrant from her bath her eyes wary and watchful why resist his gaze held hers as he loosened the tie of her robe he watched the heat flicker in that deep deep blue heard the quick and quiet catch of her breath lowering his mouth to hers he captured that breath skimmed his hands under the thin material to trail his fingers up and down her sides now he murmured it surprised that he had to fight off a shudder at just the touch of his fingertips to her flesh well then she let her body have its way lifted her arms around him he meant to go slowly to savor to take them both up level by level but the moment her mouth answered his the instant her body pressed to his greed swallowed him it was as if hed been waiting his whole life to taste this to touch this to have this he jerked the robe off her shoulders and set his teeth on her she gave a muffled cry both pleasure and shock in that flash of heat she forgot all about role playing motivation consequences desperate for more she tugged at his jacket yanked and pulled until it was in a heap on the floor his mouth was savaging hers her hands dragging at his tie as they stumbled to the bed light going dim with evening poured through the windows and the busy sounds of london traffic swished and coughed on the street below the grand clock in the hall struck the hour of five then the only sound in the room were gasps and murmurs she rolled with him over the luxurious duvet sinking in sliding over her fingers fought with the buttons of his shirt and his pulled her robe aside the weight of him pushed her deep into the covers like sinking into clouds of silk she thought then he took her breast in his mouth and she didnt think at all fire and light and the sharp saber points of desire the wild unsteady roll of sheer lust it filled her and burned in the blood and pushed a raw cry of delight from her throat hurry she all but chanted it hurry hurry hurry shed die without him inside her frantically she struggled with the hook of his trousers his fingers shook the roar in his head was a thousand waves pounding on a thousand rocks all he knew was that to wait a moment longer would destroy him her hips arched toward him and he drove into her in one violent thrust their twin groans rippled the air and their eyes metshock mirroring shock for a heartbeat then two they stared at each other then it was all movement a frantic mating driven by hot blood flesh against flesh the ragged strain of quickened breath the low cry of a woman at peak bodies plunged together in a slick and sensuous dance she came again staggered that there could be so much so very much as her hands slid limply onto the rumpled covers she felt him fall with her and thought he said her name she lay still wrecked wonderfully wrecked with his face buried in her hair and his long lovely body pressing hers into the bed now she knew she thought just what happened when his control snapped and oh it was a wild and marvelous thing his heart still hammered she could feel it knocking against hers drifting on that gilded plateau of contentment she turned her head and skimmed her lips over his shoulder that one gesture had him opening his eyes struggling to clear his head again she seemed soft as water under him limp as melted wax and nothing like the frenzied woman whod urged him to hurry he knew hed have taken her fast and hard in any case hed never needed anything anyone the way hed needed darcy at that moment as if his very survival depended upon it a dangerous woman he thought and found he didnt give a damn he wanted her again and again dont go to sleep he murmured im not but her voice was thick and rough and at the sound of it his blood heated once more im just considerably relaxed she opened her eyes and pondered the plasterwork of scrolls and stars on the ceiling and enjoying the view late eighteenth century isnt that interesting amused she stretched under him like a cat then ran her hands over his back more for her pleasure than his would that be georgian or rococo i never can keep my historical periods straight it made him grin and lift his head to look down at her ill give you the full tour with a lesson later if you like but just now he began to move inside her again oh well now she murmured youre a healthy one arent you if you dont have your healthhe lowered his head bit her lipyou dont have anything he was a man of his word and took her to dinner french food served elegantly enough to soothe fussily enough to amuse with wine designed to turn golden on the tongue the surroundingsgilt mirrors quiet colors candlelight glowing in crystalsuited her trevor thought no one looking at the stunning woman in the sleek and simple black dress would imagine her waiting tables in an irish pub another skill of hers he decided a chameleons ability to alter her image at will the sassy barmaid the heartbreaking singer the sexy delight the breezy sophisticate and which he wondered was darcy gallagher at the heart he waited until she was sipping champagne with her elaborate dessert before he touched on business one of my meetings today involved you she glanced over momentarily distracted from her debate of whether eating every bite of that fancy and extraordinary concoction on her plate would be bourgeois me oh you mean the theater no though i had some dealings regarding that too she decided she could safely eat half of it without looking like a complete bumpkin and spooned up a glorious combination of cream and chocolate what other business might i be a part of celtic records he gauged his rhythm one more aspect of her was the businesswoman and he didnt underestimate that side of her she frowned a little lifted her glass for the recording of shawns music and the performance at the opening thats a family decision and a family enterprise i suppose youd call it i think well be willing to come to terms on that i hope you will casually he sampled a bite of her dessert but that isnt what i meant im speaking of you darcy specifically exclusively her pulse jumped so she set the champagne down again exclusively in what way exactly i want your voice ah she squashed the hard jolt of disappointment it had no place here she told herself is that why you brought me here trevor in part and that part is totally separate from what happened this evening when his hand covered hers she glanced down studied the way they fit then because that was too romantic a notion for comfort she looked back up at him naturally such matters must remain separate or theyre altogether a mess arent they you wouldnt be a man who usually pursues what would it be clients in this sort of way he drew back from her his eyes going hard as stone i dont use sex as a lever if thats what you mean being lovers has nothing whatsoever to do with any of our business dealings of course not and if we could only have one or the other which would it be that he said stiffly would be up to you i see she managed a faint smile thats good to know youll excuse me a moment wont you she needed to gather herself to give her head and heart a chance to settle leaving him frowning after her she walked to the ladies room where she could lean on the pretty tiled counter and get hold of herself what was wrong with her the man was offering her a onceinalifetime opportunity one that was hers to take or discard as she pleased why should it hurt why did it leave her feeling not just unsettled but unhappy as well somehow she had come to weave romantic notions around trevor magee without even being aware of doing so and those notions those imaginings had him caring for her caring for who she was with all her many flaws caring with no strings attached no outside interests connected just caring she thought and closing her eyes she lowered herself to sit on the padded stool in front of the mirror her own fault of course he stirred something in her that no one else ever had and hed come very close dangerously close to touching something so deep in her heart that she had trouble recognizing just what it was but she thought she could fall in love with him with very little effort and perhaps no encouragement at all then what steadying herself she looked in the mirror face the facts darcy a man like trevor didnt tie himself permanently to a woman of her background and limitations sure she could present herself well play the game skillfully but under it all she was and would forever be darcy gallagher of ardmore who worked the family pub another type of man she could twist around her finger and make him forget such mundane matters and hadnt she always planned to hadnt she hoped to find a fine wealthy man one day who would fall under her spell and give her a life full of luxury shed have been willing to fall in love or at least to have a great fondness for the man who fit the bill shed have wanted to respect him and enjoy him and would have given him all her affection and her loyalty in return that wasnt shameful but trevor wasnt a man who would see only a pleasing face hed just given her proof of that business was very much a part of what he wanted from her and a deal for mutual profit marched alongside the attraction passion she thought such as theyd found in each other would flame high and fizzle out she didnt have to be a romantic like jude to know that passion without love was shortlived so it was best to be sensible and to take as much of both parts he offered her as she pleased she rose squared her shoulders and went out to join him hed ordered coffee and was brooding into it he wasnt sure whether to be relieved or baffled that the sorrow he was certain had been in her eyes when shed risen wasnt there as she sat across from him again im not sure i made myself clear he began but she shook her head smiled easily no you did but i wanted a moment to think she picked up her spoon had another taste of dessert first tell me about celtic records you said on the plane the company is six years old thats right i had an interest in music traditional in particular my mothers fond of it is she shes fourth generation youd think shed been born in a crofters cottage in county mayo shes fiercely irish so you started the company for your mother no then he found himself fumbling frowning of course he had in a very real way why hadnt he realized that before for gods sake hed even named it for her partly i suppose i think thats a lovely thing and made her want to stroke his hair why does it befuddle you its business sos the pub but its family as well i like your celtic records more for knowing its both its more important to you and youll take more care of it because its both i prefer considering dealings with a company thats well cared for this one is and so are the artists we sign were based in new york but weve cracked the international market so we have an office here and well open one in dublin within the year we thought darcy almost never did he say when speaking of it she doubted it was modesty but more a keen sense and appreciation of teamwork it made her think of the pub again and she nodded what kind of arrangement are you looking for businesswise she added pleased when his eyes narrowed a standard recording contract well now i wouldnt know what that entails having no experience in the area she studied him over the rim of her champagne flute and went with impulse but it seems wise for me to engage an agent to discuss the matter with you if i decide it interests me to be frank trevor i dont know as i want to make a living singing but ill listen to your offer he should have left it at that every business instinct ordered him to simply nod and move on to some other topic but he leaned forward ill make you rich thats a particular ambition of mine she scooped up more dessert offered it to him and it may be in the end that ill let you help me achieve it he took her wrist youll have everything youve ever wanted a hell of a lot more than youve ever dreamed of and felt her pulse scramble christ you know how to make the mouth water but im not one to leap without looking relaxed again he nodded no youre not i like that about you i like damn near everything about you are you speaking to a potential client or to your lover he cupped the back of her neck and brought his mouth to hers lingering long enough to make a few heads turn clear enough id say that was crystal why dont you take me back and make love with me until neither of us can think about anything at all why dont i he agreed and signaled for the check in the morning he rose while she was sleeping he wanted to clear away the rest of his business as quickly as possible and spend the remainder of the day with her shopping he thought as he dressed shed enjoy that hed turn her loose in one of the boutiques and buy her whatever caught her fancy take her to tea at the ritz then seduce her into a private dinner at home if it made him a little uncomfortable even a little ashamed to realize that he was showing off trying to dazzle her with what he had at his disposal hed just have to live with it damn it he wanted another day with her two a week somewhere they could be alone without any distractions any interruptions any thought of business theyd burn each other out he supposed but jesus it would be a hell of a ride before they crashed on a whim he pulled one of the white roses from the vase scribbled a quick note and laid it on the pillow beside her then he found himself sitting on the side of the bed watching her that perfect face serene in sleep all that glorious hair tumbled from his own hand in the night the bracelet hed given her flashed and blinked on her wrist and he knew she wore nothing else but his blood didnt leap with lust rather it ran warm affection he told himself it was just affection running alongside the desire he felt for her he hadnt been glib when hed told her he liked almost everything about her she was a woman who attracted entertained challenged annoyed and amused he understood her materialistic streak and didnt blame her for it but for a moment just one foolish moment he wished theyd met and clicked just as they had without her knowing the generosity of his bank balance shed told him her mind right at the beginning she wanted money she wanted luxury and she was willing to slide into a union with the right man as long as he was willing and able to provide them he didnt intend to be taken for his money not now not ever even if he was willing to use it to entertain them both in the shortterm shrugging that off he leaned over to brush a kiss across her cheek then left her sleeping she didnt stir for more than an hour after hed gone then rolled over lazily the first thing she saw when she blinked her eyes open was the rose it made her smile and it made her yearn she reached for it stroking its petals as she sat up and read his note ill be done by two and pick you up im hoping youll put yourself in my hands for the rest of the afternoon trev shed certainly put herself in his hands the night before she thought now and contentedly settled back against the pillows what a lovely lovely way to wake she mused and stroked the rosebud against her cheek she considered wandering down for breakfast or being completely indulgent and ordering it up so she could have it in bed like royalty the second picture had such appeal that she reached for the phone when it rang she jerked back then laughed at herself she didnt think she was supposed to answer it so she climbed out of bed for her robe the knock on her door came as she was belting it yes come in excuse me miss gallagher but mr magees on the telephone and would like to speak with you of course thank you darcy picked up the rose again and feeling blissfully romantic and lazy lifted the receiver trevor hello ive just read your note and id be happy to put myself in your hands im on my way back now this minute its a while till two darcy i have to get back to ardmore right away mick otooles been injured on the job injured she leaped to her feet how is he all right what happened he took a fall hes in the hospital i just heard and i dont have all the details ill be ready to go when you get here hurry she hung up without another word dragged out her suitcase and began throwing clothes inside the trip back seemed hideously long darcy alternated between praying and listening to trevor as he gathered more details about the accident he was up on the scaffolding trevor told her one of the crew tripped as far as we can tell and mick was knocked off or slipped off he was unconscious when the ambulance came for him but alive her knuckles went white as she locked her hands together yes darcy he took her hands soothing them apart they think concussion and a broken arm theyll have to check for internal injuries internal injuries her stomach rolled then went to slippery knots that always sounds so dire so mysterious when her voice broke she shook her head no im not going to fall apart on you dont worry i didnt realize you were so close hes like family tears rushed into her eyes and were viciously willed away the closest thing to my own father brenna all of them they must be frantic i should be there you will be i want to go straight to the hospital can you arrange for a car to take me there well both go straight there oh i thought youd need to go to the job all right she pressed her fingers to her eyes took several breaths im scared im so awfully scared he put his arm around her and held her until they landed and he watched her gather herself steady herself on the drive from the airport her eyes were dry and calm her hands quiet in her lap by the time they arrived and walked down the corridor where they were directed she was completely composed mrs otoole mollie looked over rose from where she sat with all five of her daughters oh darcy there you areand had to cut your lovely trip short tell me how he is wont you she took mollies hands held fast and tried not to think that both maureen and mary kate were crying well now he took a bump theyre doing some tests on his head and so forth you know the man has a mighty strong head so were not going to worry about that of course not she gave mollies chilled hands a squeeze why dont i see about getting us all some fresh tea you just sit down now darling while i organize that for you brenna why dont you give me a hand with it and well get us all a nice hot cup bless you darcy that would be a godsend mr magee mollie worked up a tremulous smile its so kind of you to be here he met brennas eyes as she rose nodded then took mollies hand and led her back to a chair tell me what happened darcy demanded the minute they were out of earshot and how bad it is i didnt see it exactly because her voice felt rusty brenna cleared her throat it seems bobby fitzgerald lost his footing while he was hauling block up on the scaffold dad turned i think to steady him but they were both off their balance and the floor of it was a little slick from a spot of rain he just tumbled off im thinking the brace of block bobby was hauling up knocked him and he went over the safety bar god she stopped pressed her hands to her face i saw him fall i heard a shout and turned round and i saw him hit the ground he just lay there he just lay there darcy with his head bleeding she sniffled rubbed her fingers over her eyes it wasnt such a terrible long fall really but he landed so hard they stopped me from moving him i wasnt thinking and just wanted to turn him over but thank god cooler heads were there in case there were spinal or neck injuries poor bobby bobbys beside himself i just had shawn take him out for a walk around outside its going to be all right she took brennas shoulders well make it be all right im glad youre here i cant tell them how scared i am mary kates prone to hysteria in any case and maureens pregnant and alice maes so young patty can hold on and god knows ma can but i cant tell them how it was to see him hit the ground and how scared i am he wont wake up again of course he will when brenna broke darcy just gathered her in theyll let you see him soon ill wager then youll feel better over brennas head she watched trevor come down the hall he paused laid a hand on her shoulder ill see to the tea go sit with your family thanks for that lets go wash your face she said briskly to brenna then well have some tea and wait for the doctor im all right brenna scrubbed at her face as she drew back go be with ma ill go wash up and be right along back in the little waiting room darcy sat on the arm of mollies chair tea will be right along thats fine then mollie reached up to pat her knee then left her hand there for her own comfort as well thats a fine man trevor is to break off his business and come back because my micks hurt of course he came back mollie only shook her head not everyone would that he did says something about what kind of person he is and just now he sat here and he told me i wasnt to worry about anything but concentrating on helping mick get better hell see to all the hospital charges and doctors he says mickll get full pay even though hes off the job for a while he expects itll only be a bit of a while she continued then stopped when her voice trembled he expects mick to be back to work as both otooles are required to do the job right hes right of course tears this time of gratitude filled darcys throat how had he known just the right things to say to people he barely knew darcy got to her feet when trevor came to the doorway and leading only with her heart walked to him she cupped his face in her hands and kissed him soft and warm on the lips come sit with the family she told him and brought him in even as she resigned herself to waiting the doctor stepped in mrs otoole yes my husband mollie was on her feet her hand clenching alice maes as it was closest hes a tough one with a reassuring smile the doctor stepped over as brenna raced up let me tell you first hell be fine thank god mollie reached out to grip brennas shoulder thank god for that he has a concussion and a broken arm the bone he demonstrated putting his own hand on his forearm snapped rather than shattered and thats fortunate some of the lacerations were deep and theres considerable bruising at the ribs but no breaks there weve run tests and havent found any internal damage we want to keep him for a day or two of course is he awake he is yes and considerably alert he asked for youand a pint though you came first her voice broke in a laughing sob i damn well better then i can see him ill take you into recovery then the lot of you can have a minute with him once weve got him settled in a room he looks a bit fierce with the bruises and the cuts and i dont want you to be alarmed by it you dont raise five children without seeing plenty of bruises and cuts that you dont you wait here now she said turning to her family while i go see your father and when its your turn i dont want any weeping and wailing so get it all out of your system now and well all of us have a good cry if need be after were home again darcy waited until mollie walked away with the doctor before she turned to brenna all right how do we go about sneaking him in a pint of guinness chapter twelve darcy theres my girl youve come to spring me from this place havent you twentyfour hours after hed taken a hard tumble and landed for the most part on his head mick otoole looked pink and alert bruised and battered and just a little desperate darcy leaned over the bed rail and kissed his forehead fondly i have not youve one more day to go if alls as it should be in that rock you call a brain so ive brought you flowers one of his eyes was blackened there was a gouge in his cheek held together by a trio of butterfly bandages and the forehead shed kissed was a symphony of raw braises and rawer scrapes all in all it gave him the look darcy thought of a brawler whod come out on the wrong side of fists when his big hopeful smile faded immediately into a long putupon sigh she wanted to cuddle him theres nothing wrong with me head or the rest of me save this busted wing here and thats hardly enough to keep a man chained in hospital now is it the doctors think different but ive brought you something to cheer you up the flowers are very nice indeed but he said it with a pout very much like a twelveyearold who hadnt gotten his way they are yeah and right out of judes own garden the rest of its from somewhere else altogether slipping the flowers out of the bag she carried darcy set them aside and pulled out a plastic tumbler with a sealed lid its guinnessonly a half pint as thats all i could manage but itll have to do you youre a princess i am and expect to be treated as such after popping off the lid she passed the contraband to him then lowered the rail to sit on the side of the bed do you feel as well as you look im fit and fine i promise my arm pains me a bit but nothing to speak of he took his first sip then closed his eyes in pure pleasure it was sorry i was to hear you and trev rushed all the way back from london it was nothing but a false step and a bit of a tumble you scared us all to pieces affectionately she brushed at the hair on his brow and now i suppose youll have all your ladies fussing over you his eyes twinkled its hard to mind it as ive such pretty ladies though theyve been in and out of here since i got my senses back im ready to get back on the job but trev wont hear of it a week hes telling me minimum before i can so much as show me face and then only with the doctors sayso micks tone turned wheedling maybe you could have a word with him darling tell him how much better off id be working than lying about a mans bound to listen to a beautiful woman such as yourself you wont get round me mister michael otoole a weeks a short enough time now you rest and stop fussing about work the theater wont be built before youre back to it i dont like taking a wage while im flat on my back its right hes paying you as you were hurt on his job and he can well afford it doing so shows his character just as fretting over it shows yours that may be and ill admit its put mollies mind at rest even if she doesnt say so still his fingers worried the edge of the sheet hes a good man and a fair boss but i need to know hes got his moneys worth from me since when havent you given full shot for the pound the sooner youre healed through the sooner youll be working again and ill tell you my plumbing needs another look shed made that one up but saw it brightened him ill take a looksee the minute they let me on my feet again course if its urgent you can have brenna see to it itll wait for you and so will i thats fine then he settled back and the sparkle on her wrist caught his eye well now whats this he took her hand turned it so the bracelet shimmered thats quite the little bauble isnt it it is trevor gave it to me and she watched micks wicked smile did he now he did and i shouldnt have taken it but i decided not to refuse such a generous gesture why should you hes got his eye on you and has since you first came into view the man has fine taste if youre asking me and you my girl could hardly do better than with the likes of trevor magee it wont do to get those sorts of notions mr otoole its no more than a bit of a frolic for both of us with neither looking for seriousness is it mick questioned then seeing darcy set her chin as hed seen her set it all her life he let it lie well sure and well see about that wont we and to micks pleasure it was barely more than an hour after darcy left his bedside when trevor came to it he brought a pint of guinness with him and mick appreciated his boldness in not troubling to hide it just as hed admired the neatness with which darcy had delivered hers under cover now thats a man after me own heart oh did you want one too with an easy smile trevor passed the glass and sat i figured youd be feeling restless by now that i am if youd get me some pants id walk out of here with you tomorrow ive just had a word with your doctor and he says theyll release you in the morning well thats better than a jab in the eye with a sharp stick i was thinking i could be on the job straightaway in a kind of supervisory capacity no lifting he hurried on as trevor merely stared blandly no actual labor just what youd call keeping an eye on things in a week bloody hell man ill go mad in a week do you know what it is to be laid low this way and have a brood of hens clucking about you only in my cherished fantasies mick gave a short laugh and settled into his pint darcy left hardly an hour ago she loves you that feelings very mutual between us i happened to notice the trinket you gave her the wrist bauble it suits her it does indeed being bright and rich and shiny some see the girl and think now thats a flighty one only looking for fun and the easy way theyd be wrong i wouldnt disagree with you as her father and my good friend patrick gallagher is across the pond im taking it upon myself to say this to you in plain speech dont toy with that girl trevor shes not a bauble like that pretty bracelet you picked out of a glass case somewhere shes a big and seeking heart in her even if she doesnt like to let it show and for all she may tell you and herself for that matter that its all fun and games shell bruise like any other woman with rough handling i dont intend to handle her roughly his voice was cool now just a step away from aloof not the sort of man whos accustomed to being given orders mick thought or advice or even warnings about his behavior maybe the word i should use is careless and a man can be careless with a woman even without intending it especially if the woman expects it ill make a point of being careful whatever she expects mick nodded and again let it lie but he wondered just what trevor himself expected mick was right about one thing trevor wasnt a man who particularly cared for advice and certainly not when it pertained to a woman he knew what he was doing with darcy they were both clearsighted adults adults who had a very elemental attraction to each other mixed with it was simple affection and respect what more could anyone want from a relationship and a temporary one at that but micks words troubled him and followed him on the drive back to ardmore rather than head back to the job as hed intended he turned up tower hill hed yet to return to his ancestors gravesite or even to explore the ruins he could spare another half hour the round tower loomed over the village and could be seen from below from almost every vantage point he passed it often enough on his way to and from the cottage but had never followed the urge to take real time to study it this time he pulled to the shoulder of the narrow road and stepped out of the car and into the wind when he walked through the little gate he saw a scatter of tourists climbing over the hilly ground between the old stones and crosses over toward the roofless stone building that had been the church built in the name of the saint his first reaction surprised him as it was mild resentment that anyone should be there with their cameras and backpacks and guidebooks stupid he thought these were just the people he hoped to appeal to with his theater these and more who would come for the beaches when the summer spread warmth along the coast so he joined them picking his way down the slope to the church taking the time hed yet to allow himself to study the roman arcading the carving going weak from time and wind inside with the rubble and graves two ogham stones had been placed for safekeeping and how he wondered had those lines dug into stone been read as words a kind of morse code he imagined devised by ancients and left at crossroads for a traveler he heard a woman call out for her children in the flat accent that said states to him east coast north and seemed so out of place here did his voice have that same slightlyoutoftune sound to it here voices should lilt and flow and have old music under each word he stepped out again looking up now at the tower the old defense had its conical roof still attached and seemed even now as if it could withstand any attack what had they come for all the invaders romans vikings saxons normans britons what fascination did this simple little island hold for them that they would war and die to take it and turning he looked out and away and thought he saw part of the answer the village below was neat and pretty as a painting with the broad beach a sweep of sand glittering golden in the fitful sunlight the sea spread blue as summer shimmering in that same restless light foaming white at the edges the hills stretched back and back green and lush with patches of rich brown muted gold to complete the quilt of land just the shadow of dark mountain peaks rose behind them even while he watched the light changed shifted grew and he could see the shadows of clouds swim over the land as the sunlight beat through them the air smelled of grass fading flowers and sea he doubted it was the beauty of the country that brought those who wanted to land here but he was sure it was part of the reason they had fought to stay were a land that absorbs our invaders and makes them one of us trevor glanced around expecting to see an irish tourist or one of the locals behind him instead he looked into carricks wild blue eyes you get around with some surprise trevor saw that they were alone when only moments before there had been at least half a dozen people exploring the hill i prefer a bit of privacy carrick winked at him dont you its difficult for me to be private when you pop up at will ive been wanting to have a word with you how goes your theater then were on schedule ah you yanks are big on schedules i cant tell you how many come through here checking their watches and their maps and figuring out how to do this and that and the other all with staying on schedule youd think theyd toss such things aside when theyre about a flaming holiday but habits die hard in some with his hair blowing in the wind trevor tucked his hands in his pockets so you wanted to have a word with me about the american habit of clock watching just a bit of a conversational gambit if youre after seeing your uncles resting place again its this way carrick turned walking gracefully over the rough ground with his silver doublet sparkling john magee carrick began when trevor joined him by the marker beloved son and brother died a soldier far from home trevor felt an ache around his heart a kind of distant grief beloved son undoubtedly beloved brother is debatable youre thinking of your granda he came here rarely but he came did he aye to stand as you are with a scowl most often on his face and his thoughts dark and confused because it troubled him he closed his heart a deliberate click of a lock yes trevor murmured i can believe that he did nothing as i can remember that wasnt deliberate youre a deliberate man yourself in some ways carrick waited until trevors head lifted until their eyes met again but isnt it an interesting thing that when he whose seed started your father stood on this hill looked down at what was home he didnt see what you do not a lovely spot edged with magic and welcome he saw a trap and would have gnawed his leg off at the ankle to escape it carrick turned to study ardmore again his black hair streamed back like a cape perhaps in a way he did and hobbled with the loss of some part of himself he went to america if not for his doing that you wouldnt stand here today looking down and seeing what he couldnt wouldnt trevor corrected but youre right i wouldnt be here without him tell me who puts the flowers here on john magees grave after all this time i do carrick gestured to the little pot of wild fuchsia as maude no longer can and it was the one thing she asked of me never did she forget him and never did her love waver in all the years between his death and her own constancy is the finest of your mortal virtues not everyone can claim it no but those who do know a joy in it is your heart a constant one trevor magee trevor looked up again its not something ive given a lot of thought to thats shading close to a lie but well shift the question for you youve had a taste of fair darcy now do you think you can push back from the banquet and walk away whats between us is private hah your privacy means nothing to me three times a century ive waited for youyou im sure now and no other youre the last of it you stand there worrying about being taken for a fool which is only another kind of pride your grandas sort when youve only to take whats already been given your bloods hot for her your minds clouded with her but you stop short of exploring whats in your heart for her hot blood and a clouded mind have very little to do with the heart thats foolishness isnt the first step toward love the passion the second the longing and youre past the first step already on to the second and too stubborn to admit it ill wait impatience shot into his eyes and they seemed to burn but ive a bloody schedule of me own so make lively yank he snapped his fingers a kind of lightning shot and vanished it put him in a foul mood a rash and foul mood as if it wasnt irritating enough to have mick otoole handing him advice on his personal life hed been given a potful from someone who shouldnt even exist both mortal and mystic were pressuring him to take some sort of definitive step with darcy and hed be damned if hed be cornered that way his life was his own and so was hers to make a point of it he waved off the calls when he crossed the job site and went straight into the pubs kitchen door shawn glanced up from scrubbing pots hello trev youre late for lunch but ill fix you up if youre hungry no thanks darcy out there she just went up to her little palace ive fish stew still on the shawn trailed off as trevor was already climbing the stairs well i suppose hes not hungry for what i can serve him he didnt knock it was rude he knew it and got some perverse satisfaction from it just as he got satisfaction from seeing darcys surprise when she walked out of the bedroom with a little shopping bag in her hand sure youre at home arent you however mild the words there was the unmistakable whip of irritation through them he enjoyed it its sorry i am i cant entertain you at the moment but im just off to judes to take her the little stuffed lamb i bought for the baby his response was to stride to her fist her hair in his hand and drag her head back even as his mouth swooped down to crush hers shock stabbed into her fused with an instant and molten lust so it was like one slice from a burning sword she shoved at him first and meant it then gripped him hard and meant that as well he paid no attention to either reaction until he was good and finished and when he was he pulled her back and his eyes were steel bright is that enough for you she struggled to find her balance her wit as kisses go it was no damn it temper roughened his voice and at that her own eyes slitted is what that does to you what you know it does to me enough for you have i said differently no but even as he struggled with his straining temper he cupped her chin would you however set off he was she was sure his study of her was cool calculated and thorough a man with that measure of control was an irritant she thought and a challenge you can be sure youll be the first to know if im dissatisfied good and as a woman of my word im telling you now i dont appreciate you bursting into my home uninvited and manhandling me because some bugs crawled up your arse with a half laugh he shook his head stepped back point taken im sorry he bent down picked up the bag shed dropped and handed it to her i was just up on tower hill at my uncles grave she angled her head are you grieving trevor for someone who died long before you were born he opened his mouth to deny it but the truth simply slid out yes everything about her softened she reached out to touch his arm come sit down now and ill make you some tea no thanks he took her hand lifted it to his lips in an absent gesture that made something inside her stretch and yearn then he turned away and paced restlessly to the window to look out at the work in progress was he the invader here he wondered staking his claim or a son returning to dig in roots my grandfather wouldnt speak of this place and being a slavishly dutiful wife my grandmother wouldnt either as a result your curiosity was whetted yes exactly i thought about coming here for a long time on and off even made halfbaked plans a couple of times but i never seriously committed to it then the idea for the theater jumped into my head full blown as if id been building it there stage by stage for years isnt that the way it is sometimes with ideas she crossed to him looked out with him they simmer around without you really being aware of it until theyre cooked proper i suppose hardly aware of it he took her hand just held it since the deals done theres no harm in telling you id have paid more for the lease given you a higher percentage i had to have it well then theres no harm in telling you wed have taken less all around but we very much enjoyed the horse trading and winding up your man finkle this time he did laugh and most of the tension drained my greatuncle would have come here and my grandfather to gallaghers oh to be sure is it what theyd think of what youre doing here thats worrying you i dont worry what my grandfather would have thought not anymore there she thought that sore spot again this time she probed but gently was he so hard a man he hesitated but it seemed he was in the mood to speak of it what did you think of the house in london puzzled she shook her head it was very elegant fucking museum she blinked at that there was such undiluted anger in his voice well ill say the museum part of that statement occurred to me but it was lovely after he died my parents gave me clearance to change a few things in it things that hadnt been changed in thirty years opened it up a bit softened some edges but its still his place underneath rigid and formal as he was thats how my father was raised rigidly and without affection im sorry she stroked a hand in circles over his back it has to be sad hard and sad to have a father who doesnt show he loves you i never had that problem somehow through some miracle my father wasiscaring open and full of humor though his father wasnt he still doesnt speak of it much the way he was raised except to my mother and she to you darcy murmured because she knows youd need to understand it he wanted to make a family a life that was the opposite of the way hed been raised thats what he did they kept us in line my sister and me but we always knew they loved us i think it shows the beauty of the gift they gave you that you dont take it for granted no i dont he turned back to her odd he hadnt really expected her to understand nor had he expected to feel such relief that she did thats why i dont worry what my grandfather would think of what im doing here but i do think of how my parents will feel when its done then ill say this to my way of thinking theyll be proud irelands art is at its core and youre bringing more of it here along with it the practicality of jobs and revenue its a good thing youre doing and a credit to your father your mother and your heritage a nagging little weight fell off his shoulder thanks it matters more than i anticipated it was one of the things that hit me when i was standing up on the hill it matters what i do here and leave here and while i was coming to that conclusion i had a conversation with carrick her fingers jerked in his when he looked down he saw the surprise clearly on her face before she closed her mouth and made a quiet humming sound do you think im hallucinating no she paused then shook her head i dont no others whose sanity im sure of claim to have done the same weve broad minds around here but she knew the legend and it unnerved her enough that she took a step back and sat on the arm of a chair and what did you converse about a number of things my grandfather old maude and johnnie magee schedules virtues the theater you myself now she rubbed her suddenly damp hands on her trousers and what would that be about you know the legend probably better than i it takes three couples as i understand it falling in love accepting each other taking vows so its said and in the past year or so your two brothers have fallen in love accepted it and taken vows im aware of that as i was at their weddings then given the quickness of your mind i assume youve considered the fact that there are three gallaghers he took a step closer you look a little pale id appreciate it if youd get to the point youre dancing around all right direct hes pegged us as his third and final step her chest seemed to fill all at once with heat and pressure making her want to knock her fist against it to loosen it again but she kept her hands still and her eyes level that wouldnt sit well with you would it with you she was too flustered to catch the evasion im not the one having conversation with faerie princes am i and no i dont particularly care to have my fate and future dictated by anothers wants or needs neither do i neither he added will i she thought she understood now why hed told her of his grandfather to show her he had cold blood in him slowly she got to her feet i see what put you in such a rare mood the very idea of the remote possibility that i might be your fate and future set you right off didnt it the very thought that a man of your education and consequence should tumble heartfirst for a barmaid he was so genuinely baffled it took him a moment to answer where the hell did that come from who could blame you for being angry and frustrated when such a suggestion was made its a fortunate thing for both of us that love has nothing to do with the matter hed seen angry women before but he wasnt certain hed ever faced one who looked so capable of inflicting real physical harm to ward it off he held up his hands palms out in the first place what you do for a living has nothing to do with anything in the second youre hardly a barmaid though it wouldnt matter if you were i serve drinks in a pub so whats that if not a barmaid aidan runs the bar shawn runs the kitchen and you run the service trevor said patiently and i imagine if you wanted you could run the whole shotor any other pub in your country or mine but thats hardly an issue it happens to be of some particular issue with me but she yanked back her anger and let it vibrate on the end of its tether darcy i told you this because it concerns both of us because were lovers and its only right we both know where we stand now we do and were agreed we dont intend to let ourselves get tangled up in some ancient legend he took her hand again rubbing his thumb over the knuckles to soothe out the stiffness separate from thatentirely separate from thati like who you are i enjoy being with you and i want you in a way ive never wanted anyone else in the same way he finished she ordered herself to relax to accept even to be pleased but there was a hole somewhere inside her that wouldnt close up again all right separate from that i feel the same so theres no problem at all flashing a smile she rose to her toes and kissed him warmly then waved him toward the door now go on with you as ive got to be on my way will you come to the cottage tonight she shot him a look from under her lashes id be pleased to you can look for me around midnight and i wouldnt mind if you had a glass of wine poured and waiting later then he would have kissed her again but she was already shutting the door in his face on the other side of it she counted to ten three full times then exhaled so they were to be reasonable and sensible and do it all exactly the magee way were they he was too removed to tumble into legend or into love well by god shed have him begging on his knees for her before she was done with him hed promise her the world and everything in it and when he had well she might just take it that would teach the man not to shrug off the notion of loving darcy gallagher chapter thirteen all in all trevor found himself very satisfied by the way things were going the project was moving along on schedule the townspeople were supportive and interested never a day went by without at least some of them wandering by to watch the work make comments give suggestions or tell him some story or other about his relations hed met a few who were cousins in fact he had two of them employed as laborers with mick out of commission for the next few days hed have to spend more time at the site but he didnt mind it would keep his mind focused on what it needed to be focused on and give him less time to let it wander around darcy he felt hed straightened things out in that area as well both of them were too sensible to be influenced by legends or selfinterested faeries or dreams of a blue heart that beat steady and strong deep in the sea he had business to see to he reminded himself as he carried coffee up to his office in the cottage calls to make contracts to negotiate supplies to order he couldnt waste time thinking about what he did or didnt see did or didnt believe responsibilities wouldnt wait while he pondered just how much of irish myth was real and how much was imagined he touched the disk under his shirt real he thought as real as it gets but he was handling it he glanced at his watch and thought he might just catch his father at home in new york and stepping into the bedroom he jerked and spilled hot coffee over the back of his hand goddamn it oh theres no need to profane with a quiet cluck of her tongue gwen continued to ply her needle she sat in the chair in front of the tidy hearth her hair neatly bound back her face composed her hands quick and clever as she embroidered a white cloth youll want salve on that burn she told him its nothing what was a little discomfort compared to seeing ghosts much less to conversing with one id nearly convinced myself not to believe in you sure and you need to do what makes you most comfortable would you rather i let you be i dont know what id rather he set the coffee down on the table turned his desk chair around to face her and sitting he sucked absently at the sting on his hand i had dreams about you i told you that i didnt tell you i halfway believed id find you when i came here not you he corrected fumbling just enough to annoy himself someone the word alive seemed rude somehow real a woman her gaze when it lifted to his was gentle and full of understanding you thought perhaps youd find the woman youd dreamed of and that she would be for you maybe not that im looking particularly he added but maybe a man can fall in love with a dream if he lets himself its a simple matter with no effort no work no troubles and no real joy when it comes down to it you prefer working for something dont you its part of who you are i suppose so the woman you did meet is a great deal of effort and work and trouble tell me trevor does she bring you joy as well you mean darcy and who else have you been walking with gwen questioned of course im speaking of darcy gallagher a beautiful and complicated woman that with a voice like she trailed off shaking her head and lightly laughing i was going to say like an angel but theres little of the angels about that one no shes a voice like a woman full and rich and tempting to a man shes tempted you she could tempt the dead no offense none taken i wonder trevor dont you think shes what youre looking for im not looking for anything anyone we all look the lucky find her hands stilled lay on the cloth with bright patterns of thread the wise accept i was lucky but not wise could you not learn something from my mistake i dont love her maybe you do and maybe you dont gwen picked up her needle again but you havent opened your heart to the risk of it you guard that part of yourself so fierce trevor it may be that part of myself doesnt exist chewed off at the knee in ardmore he thought before i was even born that im just not capable of loving someone the way you mean thats foolishness i hurt another woman because i couldnt love her and i think hurt yourself in the process it puts doubts about yourself in your mind both of you i can promise will not only survive it but be better off for the experience once you stop thinking of your heart as a weapon instead of a gift youll find what youre looking for my heart isnt the priority here the theater is she made a sound that might have been agreement tis a grand thing to be able to build and build to last this cottage simple as it is has lasted lifetime and lifetime oh sure a few changes here another room there but the core of it remains as does the faerie raft beneath it with its silver towers and blue river you chose the cottage over the castle he pointed out i did aye i did for the wrong reasons but in spite of it i wont regret my children or the man who gave them to me perhaps carrick will never understand that part of my heart ive come to understand it would be wrong to ask him to do so hearts can merge and the people who hold them still stand as they are love accepts that it accepts everything he saw now what pattern she worked into the cloth it was the silver palace its towers bright its river blue as gemstones its trees heavy with golden fruit and on a bridge that spanned the water were two figures not yet finished herself trevor realized with her hands held out toward carricks youre lonely without him i have she brushed a finger gently over the threads that formed a silver doublet an emptiness in me a place that waits as i wait what happens to you if the spell isnt broken she lifted her head again her eyes dark and soft and quiet ill bide here and see him only in my heart for how long for as long as there is you have choices trevor magee as once i had you have only to make them its not the same he began but she faded away like mist its not the same he said again to the empty room though he turned the chair around it was some time before he picked up the phone and managed to get on with the business at hand he called his father first and that connection of voice to voice soothed his nerves with his rhythm back he fell into routine contacted nigel in london and his counterpart in los angeles he checked the time again noted it was closing in on midnight seven in new york he thought and called the ever reliable finkle at home notes were piled on his desk his computer up and running and the phone tucked on his shoulder with finkles voice droning through when he heard the sound of a car pulling in trevor shifted angled so he could see through the window and watched darcy walk toward the garden gate hed forgotten the wine she considered knocking but shed seen the light in his office window working are you with a sly glint in her eye she let herself in the front door she thought theyd soon put a stop to that and walked straight up the stairs she paused at the door to his office finding herself both irritated and pleased when he continued with his phone call and waved her in with a little finger crook irritated that he didnt appear to have been anxiously awaiting her and pleased because she imagined she would shortly have him panting like an eager pup ill need that report before new york closes tomorrow trevor scribbled something down nodded yeah well theyve got till end of day to accept the offer or its off the table yes thats exactly how i want you to put it next item im not satisfied with the bids on the dressier project make it clear that if our usual lumber supplier cant do better well look to alternate sources he glanced over absently took a sip of his coffee as darcy unbuttoned her coat then inhaled caffeine like airand choked on it the coat dropped to the floor and he saw she wore nothing beneath it but his bracelet high heels and a very feline smile perfect he managed jesus youre perfect as finkles voice buzzed in his ear he simply hung up got to his feet i take it business hours are over they are she looked around the room angled her head i dont see my glass of wine he discovered it was just possible to speak when a mans heart was in his throat i forgot it his breath already ragged he crossed to her ill get it later she tipped her head back to keep her eyes on his and saw what shed wanted to see desire raw as a fresh wound ive a powerful thirst later was all he could say before his mouth came down on hers he possessed with quick hard hands restless lips he took what shed offered gave her what shed wanted desperation was what shed wanted from him that jagged edge of need as dangerous as it was primitive shed come to him naked and shameless to lure the animal he was rough and his recklessness added a slick layer of excitement no control now nor the need for it so she lost herself in the wicked spell of her own brewing he shoved her against the wall feasting on her throat drugged on that sharply sexual taste of perfumed female flesh and his hands streaked over her bruised over her greedy for the curves the swells the secrets of woman hot wet vibrant his fingers slid over her into her driving her up even as he felt her body shudder felt the violence of the orgasm rip through her he looked into her eyes in the dark and clouded blue he thought he saw the flash of triumph he might have been able to pull back then to clear his head enough to find his finesse but she moved against him one lazy stretching arch and her arms twined around him like chains wrapped in velvet more she purred it give me more and take more as well right here she nipped her teeth into his lip right now if shed been a witch murmuring the darkest of incantations hed have been no less spellbound hed have sworn he caught the scent of hellfire as her mouth once again captured his then there was madness fevered and glorious in her own triumph she found it that wild pleasure the terrorlaced delight of having a man turn savage and allowing it craving it her blood beat as frantically as his her hands raced as urgent and as rough as those that raced over her she tore his shirt and reveled in the harsh sound of cotton rending at the seam and her teeth dug into his shoulder when he pushed her over the edge again a haze filled his vision thick and red her nails bit into his back glorious little points of pain his blood was a drumbeat a primitive tattoo in his head heart loins he plunged into her where they stood greedily swallowing her ragged cry each thrust was like another step on a thin wire stretched over both heaven and hell whichever way they fell it couldnt be stopped knowing it he dragged her head back kept his hand fisted in her hair his eyes on her face i want to see you he panted it out i want to see you feel me i cant feel anything but you trevor she tumbled off the wire clasping him against her on the fall and flying out with her he didnt give a damn where they landed he stayed where he was fighting for air for his sanity the press of his body kept her upright as he braced a hand on the wall for balance shed gone limp as he knew now she did after loving he told himself hed find the energy in just a minute to get them both into bed i cant stay like this she murmured against his shoulder i know just a second maybe we could just slide down to the floor here for a bit of a while i cant feel me legs anyway you make me dizzy trevor it made him laugh and he turned his head buried his face in her hair id say id carry you to bed but id never make it and it would ruin the image of manly prowess you make me weak darcy itd take quite a bit to spoil the image after this well in that case he slipped an arm behind her knees lifted her his hair was tousled his eyes sleepy and satisfied she toyed with the silver disk dangling from the chain closed her fingers around it she started to answer his grin then could only stare as her heart landed right at his feet what is it alarmed by the shock in her eyes and the quick paling of her cheeks he crossed quickly to the bed to set her down did i hurt you no oh jesus oh god holy mother of god just dizzy for a minute as i said im better now but i still have that powerful thirst i could dearly use that wine if you dont mind sure not quite convinced he skimmed his knuckles over her cheek just sit there ill be right back the minute he was out of the room she grabbed a bed pillow and pummeled it viciously with her fists damn it all to hell and back again shed gotten caught in a web of her own spinning the man was supposed to be bewitched by her intrigued frustrated satisfied stupefied and willing to be her slave before she was done and now shed kicked her own self in the ass and gone and fallen in love with him it wasnt supposed to be this way she pounded the pillow again then hugged it against her as her stomach took a deep diving dip how was she supposed to wrap the man around her finger when she was already wrapped around his it had been such a good plan too she would use her wiles her lures her charm her temper everything at her disposal then when he was caught as surely he would have been shed have been free to snip him loose or keep him there would have been time to decide which suited her best by then well this was gods punishment she supposed fates little joke shed been so certain she could keep her heart in check until she decided if she should love him or not now she had no choice at all for the first time in her life her heart wasnt her own and a terrifying sensation it was she bit her knuckles worrying over it what did she do now how could she think just now it had been all right when it was a kind of game it hadnt done more than nip at her temper to think that the manner of man trevor was wouldnt be serious about a woman such as herself now well it was a great deal more important and more infuriating because she thought as that temper began to bubble and burn away panic if the likes of him thought he could toss her aside just because he had a fancy education and property and money to burn he was very much mistaken in the matter the bastard she was in love with him so she would have him as soon as she figured out the best way to get him her head came up a shewolf prepared to bare fangs when she heard him coming up the stairs it took all her control and all her skill to bury that instinct force that temper back and greet him with a silky smile okay now he came to her held out a glass of white wine she took it sipped delicately never better she said and patted the bed beside her come sit by me darling and tell me all about your day her sugary tone had him wary but he sat tapped his glass against hers the end of it was the best part she laughed and walked her fingers up his thigh and who said it was over brenna wasnt the least bit pleased about being hauled off the job at nine in the morning shed argued cursed and sulked while darcy dragged her up the hill to the gallagher house through a drizzling rain that sent puffs of mist creeping behind them trevors a right to give me the boot for this he wont darcy took a firmer hold on brennas arm and youre entitled to a morning break arent you been on the job already since halfsix i need twenty minutes of your precious time you could have had it while i was working its a private matter and i could hardly ask jude to waddle her way down there could i in the wet at least tell me what this is about then im doing it all at once so youll just have to wait five more flaming minutes puffing a bitbrenna was small but it wasnt an easy matter to pull a reluctant woman of any size up that steep hilldarcy continued down the little walkway between judes wet flowers she didnt knock and as the door was never locked she hauled brenna inside where her work boots unwiped tracked mud down the hallway to the kitchen they looked so cozy there jude and aidan sharing breakfast at the old table and the big dog sprawled hopefully under it the smell of toast and tea and flowers hung in the air it gave darcy a little jolt in the center made her wonder why shed never before realized how satisfying such quiet moments could be how intimate they were good morning jude glanced over and in a credit to friendship said nothing about the mud do you want some breakfast no darcy said just as brenna moved forward to snag a piece of toast from the rack we didnt come to eat she continued aiming a lowering look at her friend i need a word with you jude in private go away aidan i havent finished my breakfast finish it at the pub neat and deft darcy slapped the remainder of his bacon on toast scooped the bit of egg left on his plate on top of it and held it out there now off with you this is womens business here a fine thing this is a fine thing for a man to be shoved from his own table out of his own house he may have grumbled but he got up and shrugged into his jacket females are rarely worth the trouble they take except this one he added and leaned down to kiss jude bill and coo later darcy ordered brenna only has a few minutes as it is you might as well go resigned now brenna got herself a cup brought it back to the table to enjoy some tea with her toast shes on a tear im going ill expect you to be on time he said to darcy he kissed jude again lingering over it as much to please himself as to annoy his sister he snapped his fingers at finn waiting while the dog happily scrambled out come along with me lad they dont want our kind here he strode out finn prancing behind him take a liedown aidan shouted then the door slammed you look a little tired brenna commented pursing her lips as she studied jude arent you sleeping well these nights the baby was feeling frisky last night jude ran her hands in slow circles over her belly thrilled at the impatient ripple under her palms kept me awake i dont mind really its a lovely feeling you need to nap when he naps brenna decided to have another piece of toast and began to load this one with jam thats what ive heard and do the same once he pops out as well sleep becomes a precious thing how are the childbirth classes going oh theyre fascinating wonderful terrifying the last one if you dont mind darcy interrupted ive something i need to discuss id hope my two closest friends in the world would have some interest brenna only rolled her eyes but jude tucked her tongue in her cheek folded her hands on the table of course were interested what is it its she found the words stuck in her throat hissing she grabbed brennas tea and gulped it down over her friends annoyed protest im in love with trevor christ jesus brenna snatched her cup back youve dragged me up here for that brenna jude spoke softly her eyes on darcys face she means it the girls always making a stage production out of but brenna trailed off getting a good look at darcy herself oh oh well then with a laugh she leaped to her feet and gave darcy a smacking kiss on the mouth congratulations i didnt win a bloody raffle disgusted she dropped into a chair why did it happen this way dismissing brenna as useless she appealed to jude without me having time to prepare or figure on it its like a punch in the face and i have to keep my balance here as ill not be knocked on my ass by any man youve knocked more than your share of them on theirs brenna pointed out seems youre due for some of the same i like him she took a huge bite of toast and jam i think he suits you why hold that thought jude lifted a ringer darcy does he make you happy how do i know she threw up her hands then pushed back from the table im feeling too many things at the moment to know if happy is one of them oh dont give me those smug marriedladies smiles i like his company ive never known a man i like being with so much as trevor just being with him id look forward to seeing him even without the sex and thats saying quite a bit as the sex is fantastic she hesitated for a moment then continued and last night after wed made love it just happened its like a slamming into you so you cant get your air proper and the blood drains right out of your head and your joints go weak ive never been so furious what business does he have making me fall in love with him before im damn good and ready and have decided its what i want oh hes a bounder all right brenna said cheerfully why the nerve of that man oh shut up i shouldve known youd take his part darcy brenna took her hand and though the humor still brightened her eyes there was an understanding in them that blew away darcys resentment hes what youve always wanted hes handsome and clever and rich thats part of the problem isnt it jude laid a hand over theirs formed a unit hes what youve always wanted or told yourself you did now that youve found him you wonder if its real and if it is will he believe it i didnt know it would be this way the tears wanted to come and here with friends she let them i thought it would be fun a lark and easy but its not ive always been able to tell whats going on inside a man but i cant with him hes a slick one trevor is and slippery god i love that about him that made her cry harder and reach for a napkin to wipe her face oh if he knew what a mess hed made out of me hed be so pleased about it you may be right but not jude added for the reasons you might think he has feelings for you they show he has feelings all right some of the bitterness came through now and she savored the taste of it on her tongue as she might a medicine that cured madness hes talked to carrick i knew it triumphant brenna slapped a hand on the table i knew youd be the third you knew didnt you jude logically it followed but jude was watching darcy again you havent seen carrick or gwen have you apparently neither of them has time to chat with the likes of me and she wasnt sure if she was relieved or annoyed by the fact however theyve time for magee he told me that carricks aiming toward the two of us and wanted me to knowmade it very clearthat hes no intention of falling in love with the legend hes not looking for love and vows of forever from me no indeed he wants me she muttered her eyes going dark narrowing sparking in bed and for his recording label ive accommodated him on the first to our mutual enjoyment and i may just accommodate him on the second but hes going to find darcy gallagher doesnt come cheap jude felt a twinge of apprehension what do you have in mind her eyes might have been wet but determination flashed through them ill have him crawling belly down before im done with him i dont suppose you considered meeting on equal ground hah darcy sat again if im to be miserable and confused and scared to the bone then by god hell be the same before im finished when hes blind in love with me ill get a ring on my finger before he gets his vision back and then jude murmured that part of the business was murky so darcy dismissed it with a shrug then the rest takes care of itself its the now i have to deal with chapter fourteen for darcy the now had already started and she didnt intend to fall behind back at the pub she went directly to the kitchen irritated that shawn wasnt in yet as he made better coffee than she she began to measure and brew once it was on she checked her appearance in the mirror shed hung by the door a little damp and windswept she decided perfect she poured a mugful gave her cheeks a quick slap to be sure her color was up then stepped back out into the thin rain she had to pick her way over rubble and debris skirting the thick block wall trevor wasnt up on the scaffold which pleased her she could hardly climb up herself and deliver the coffee still she paused for a moment looking up at the men who scrambled around with timber now which she could only suppose was for the roof if she concentrated she could almost see how it was to slope up into a gentle rise as if it had grown somehow out of gallaghers rather than been added on it was a clever design and clever of trevor she thought to have seen that in brennas drawing but hed be a man of vision one who could see the potential of things and had the skill to turn a supposing into reality oh she admired that it was just one more side of him shed found herself loving there was the side of him for his family as well the love he so obviously felt for his parents and the hurt not so obvious from his grandfathers lack of affection it touched her the loyalty and the vulnerability it made him so much more the man the bastard would make a simpering fool of her if she wasnt careful she could see where windows and doors would go from the rough openings in the dull gray block that block she knew would be faced with stone and the stone would weather until it was impossible to tell where the new began and the old left off a merging she thought as she began to walk again of tradition with change of gallagher and magee well the man might have vision but she wasnt ready for him to see just how complete she intended that merger to be she stepped through one of the openings there was activity inside the walls as well planking had already been set over the concrete shed watched them pour that first day pipes and wires and rough boards were poking out here and there and the din as more were drilled and set into the block was amazing she saw him now crouched down beside one of his crew eyeballing a pipe that jutted out of the wall he was covered with a fine gray dust that she supposed came from drilling into the block why that and the tool belt slung at his hips should have set her mouth to watering was just another part of her dilemma still she wasnt so dazzled she didnt know to bide her time and wait until he rose grunting in answer to something his man said and turned saw her she watched his eyes change and it was perfect that instant of awareness the connection that was like a hot spark flying dangerously it wouldnt have surprised her a bit to see it land and leave a burn mark in the floor at her feet delighted she stepped toward it and him i wanted a look at whats what before i got to work she smiled held out the mug and i thought you could use this to ward off the damp it only pleased her more that it was suspicion more than surprise that crossed his face thanks youre very welcome indeed i suppose im in the way here but she turned a little circle looking but its interesting and its moving along so fast its a good crew he knew at the first sip shed made the coffee it was good and strong but she didnt have the same touch as shawn suspicion grew just what he wondered did she want sometime when youre not so busy perhaps youd show me how itll be i can show you now can you that would be lovely well come through the pub there he pointed toward the back wall of the pub that was snugged now between the new block we wont cut through for a while yet you can see the levels are different weve sloped the breezeway down thatll give us more height without taking the roofline out of proportion the breezeway widens like an open fan i remember thats right so it becomes the lobby rather than having it a separate area what are all these pipes stabbing out here rest rooms either side of the lobby area brenna thinks we should use the gaelic for men and women the way you have in the pub i want dark wood planked for the doors he narrowed his eyes brought the image into his head under it all everything will be modern slick but what people will see is age what he saw among the work and supplies and equipment was the whole of it shining and complete bare floors he continued well match them to what you already have soft faded colors nothing bright or vivid well have some seating in the lobby but keep it small intimate benches i think well get some art for the walls but keep it spare and all of it celtic he glanced at her lifted his brow when he saw her staring at him what i suppose i thought youd go for the modern and slick outside as well as in would you she started to speak then shook her head not here she realized no not here not for this here you want duachais okay since i want it why dont you tell me what it is oh its gaelic for she waved her hand as she tried to find the right translation fortradition no not just that it has to do with a place most particularly and its roots and its lore with well with what and why it is his eyes narrowed focused say it again its duachais yeah thats it thats just exactly it youre very right about wanting that here and im glad of it and considerably surprised by it a bit anyway yes i shouldnt be because his perception unsettled her she moved away and into the theater yeah doors again two across he took her hand an absentminded gesture that neither of them noticed but others did the audience area three sections two aisles full house is two hundred and forty small again and intimate the stage is the star here i can see you there she said nothing only studied the empty space ahead of her he waited a beat are you afraid of performing ive performed all my life one way or another she thought no ive no stage fright if thats what you mean maybe i need to build that image in my head as youre building your theater and see if it stands as sturdy youre proud of what youve done and what youre doing i intend to be the same it wasnt why shed come out shed meant to surprise him to flirt with him to make certain he thought of her through the day wanted her through the day i like your theater trevor and ill be pleased to sing in it with my brothers as discussed as for the rest she moved her shoulders took his empty mugi need a bit more convincing well likely have a session tonight shed make sure of it why dont you have your supper here stay for it then after you can come into my parlor this time ill pour the wine rather than wait for his answer she slid her free hand into his hair lifted her mouth to his and with the promise of more should he care for it in her eyes she turned and walked away the minute she opened the kitchen door she smelled the baking apples cinnamon brown sugar shawn must have come in just behind her and had been busy since there was a pot already simmering on the stove and he was chopping whatever else he intended to put in it on the thick board he barely glanced at her you can put apple crumble as the sweet on the daily and mexican chile as well we have some fresh plaice for frying rather than spring into action she wandered to the refrigerator and got herself a bottle of ginger ale here she thought sipping it and eyeing her brother was a source that would be brutally honest and one she trusted completely what do you think of my voice she demanded i could do with hearing a good deal less of it its my singing voice im referring to you bonehead well thus far its cracked no glass that im aware of she considered heaving the bottle at him but she wasnt done with it im asking you a serious question and you could do me the courtesy of answering in kind because her tone had been stiff rather than hot as expected he lowered his knife and gave her his full attention the broody look she was wearing he was well accustomed to but not when there was real worry in her eyes youve a beautiful voice strong and true you know that as well as i do no one hears themselves as others do i like hearing you sing my music that she thought was the most simple and most perfect of answers her eyes warmed and rather than throw the bottle she set it aside to hug him whats all this now he rubbed a hand over her back patted when she sighed and rested her head on his shoulder what does it feel like shawn to have sold your music to know people will hear it people who dont know you is it grand in part aye in part its the grandest thing and its scary and befuddling all at the same time and still deep down it was what you always wanted it was keeping it deep down meant it didnt have to be scary and befuddling i like singing but not as my lifes ambition its just what we do when the mood strikes the gallagher way she drew back tell me this then now that you are selling your music does it take any of the joy out of it or make it seem like no more than a job i thought it might but no when i sit down and theres a tune in my head its just the tune as it always was he stroked a finger under her chin what is it darling tell me the trouble trevor wants to record me like a contract like a career he thinks my voice will sell there were a dozen things he could say jokes that any brother might spring to out of habit and that odd affection instead because he sensed she needed it he gave her the easy truth youll be wonderful and send us all mad with pride she let out a sound that ended in a shaky laugh but it wouldnt be like a session or a ceili it would be real youll travel and get rich which is what youve always wanted and itll come from whats inside you which is the only way itll make you happy she picked up the ginger ale again youre awfully smart all of a sudden ive always been smart you only admit it when i agree with you hmm she sipped again her mind working quickly now picking its way through obstacles and traps you and brenna are working together in a sort of way i mean you write the music but she pushes it shes the one who arranged for trevor to hear it shes in a way of being your business agent or partner or whatever you might call it shawns answer was a grunt as he picked up his knife and began chopping again she can get on her bossy side about it let me tell you that had darcy biting her lip does it cause problems between you none that wouldnt pass if shed mind her own but when he glanced up again and saw darcys face he laughed well for heavens sake why the worry im just winding you up a bit its true enough she pushes and i can dig in when she shoves too fast and too hard but i know its that she believes in me it matters nearly as much as it does that she loves me the pang inside her heart came hard and unwelcome the believing in could be as important as satisfying to some as a start anyway as a start she repeated in a murmur you cant finish until you start determined to believe it she took her apron off the hook and went into the pub leaving shawn frowning after her it was never hard to arrange for a session at gallaghers a word here a word there what better way was there after all to spend a rainy spring evening than with music and drink with strangers and friends by eight the pub was packed and pints were flowing brenna had already moved behind the bar to lend a hand and darcy felt she herself had served enough stew to make an ocean and trevor magee had yet to darken the door the devil take him she decided and had a table of tourists glancing around uneasily as she served their drinks with a smile that glittered sharp and bright as a blade if he couldnt be bothered to accept her invitation for supper music and sex what was the man made of stone ice steel she slammed empties on the counter and had aidans full attention mind the glassware darcy weve hardly one to spare with the crowd we have tonight bugger them she said under her breath two pints guinness one smittys half of harp and two brandy and gingers take a water to jude would you while the guinness is settling and see if you can talk her into having some stew her appetites been off the last day or so she wanted to snap just on principle but it wasnt possible to take a bite out of a man who looked so concerned over his wife instead she simply went back to the kitchen herself ladled out stew added a basket of bread and butter she carried them with water and a glass of ice to judes table now youre to eat darcy said as she set down the food else aidanll be worried shawn insulted and ill just be mad but i i mean it jude frances youve my niece or nephew to take care of and i wont have him or her as the case may be going hungry its just that she glanced around motioned darcy to lean down the last couple of days about five or so ive had this terrible craving i cant do anything about it cant seem to stop myself ice cream she whispered chocolate ice cream i swear ive eaten two gallons of it this week bought the market out of it darcy snorted out a laugh well whats wrong with that youre entitled its so clichd im not eating pickles with it or anything ridiculous but just the same i feel so stupid about it i havent been able to tell aidan do the crime pay the consequences darcy nudged the bowl closer besides thats no way to feed a baby you have a bit of shawns stew and for being such a sport and saving this seat for that cad magee ill buy your ice cream tomorrow struggling not to pout jude picked up her spoon chocolate and the cad just walked in did he pride and not a little slice of temper made her refuse to turn around its about bloody time whats he doing casually she picked up judes bottle of water and poured it hes scoping the way men do hunting for you id say ah bullseye god the way he looks at you its wonderful hot and proprietary with a little edge of aloofness hes got a man with him very polished and urban and attractive who looks amused and out of place without thinking jude ate a spoonful of stew they look like friends she went on the one laid a hand on trevs shoulder buddylike gestured toward the bar but trevs shaking his head giving it a nod in this direction his friends just got a load of you now and his eyebrows went straight up almost to hairline im surprised his tongue didnt fall out impressed darcy angled her head youre awfully good at this sort of business arent you psychologist writer they both observe im just much better thank god at writing about people than analyzing them so im looking forward to hearing the music tonight she went on raising her voice enough to signal darcy she could and wanted to be heard im glad i got a table before we were overrun wed just plant you in a chair behind the bar eat your stew now before it goes cold i really dontwell hello trevor prepared now darcy did turn offered a friendly smile arent you the lucky one judes got a table here im sure shed be glad to share with you were jammed tonight then she shifted that same smile to the man beside trevor and had the pleasure of seeing pure male appreciation in his eyes and good evening to you darcy gallagher jude gallagher nigel kelsey a friend of mine its nice to meet you trevor didnt tell me id be bombarded by beauties he took judes hand first kissed it smoothly then repeated the gesture with darcy youve brought us a charmer trevor have a seat here and tell me whats your pleasure to drink ive got to pick up an order at the bar thats overdue g and t for me nigel ordered ice and lemon yes thanks pint of harp trevor told her right away then and the stews good tonight if youre in the mood for it or if youre not jude muttered as darcy moved off so youre the american writer who married the publican nigel in his urban black sweater jacket and slacks took a stool and looked jude thought like a bohemian at a barn dance i came over as an american found out i was a writer youre from england she asked tagging his accent london born and bred trev was right about this place he added with a glance around its authentic a movie set damn near perfect we like to think so nigel doesnt mean to be patronizing trevor took the seat beside jude in the narrow booth hes just an ass i meant it as a compliment english pubs certainly in the city tend to be a bit more reserved than those you find in ireland and rarely have barmaids with faces like film stars he swiveled to take another look at darcy i think im in love a complete ass youre not eating trevor said to jude is darcy wrong about tonights stew no guilty jude took another spoonful its wonderful its just im not really hungry i had a late mmmm cravings when she flushed trevor laughed for my sister all three times it was fig newtons for breakfast she ate truckloads chocolate ice cream at teatime gallons jude shot a wary glance toward aidan i havent made a full confession yet aidans afraid ill waste away she put a hand on her belly as if here we are now gin and tonic and a harp darcy set them down will you have a meal with us then well have the stew trevor said before nigel could order will you sing later i might with a saucy wink she sauntered off i might have wanted a look at the menu nigel complained youre coming to the ladys rescue here we eat the same thing and that way we can each take a portion of her stew and save her god bless you jude said with feeling and passed trevor the basket of bread their bowls had barely been served when music started just a fiddle and pennywhistle at first from a couple of the people crammed around the table at the front the table itself was loaded with pints and glasses ashtrays and packs of cigarettes conversation didnt stop with the music but it lowered it was darcy trevor noted who worked the table taking away the empties the overflowing ashtrays and replacing them with fresh an old man with a squeeze box gave her a little pat on the bottom in much the same way an adult pats a baby then tapping his foot picked up the tune and filled it out thats brian fitzgerald on the fiddle jude told them were cousins of some sort and thats young connor on the pennywhistle and matt magee likely a cousin of yours trevor on the little accordion the young woman with the guitar is patty riley and i dont know the other woman the other fiddler i dont think shes local or i would nigel nodded sampled his stew do you get many musicians in for an informal who arent local all the time gallaghers has a reputation with its sessions formal and informal she looked on trevor with warm affection when he casually spooned some of her stew into his bowl then nigels id name the baby after you for this but aidan would be suspicious its not a hardship shawns a genius i thought trev was exaggerating the culinary skills of our newest artist happily now nigel dug into the stew again i shouldve known better hes never wrong it was the laugh that caught nigel first warm female sexy he glanced over toward it and watched as darcy laid a hand on the old mans shoulder counted off the time with her toe then caught the tune with her voice as i was going over the farfamed kerry mountains i met with captain farrell and his money he was counting he laid his spoon down focused and shut out the background noise i first produced me pistol and then produced me rapier saying stand and deliver for you are my bold deceiver it was a bright jumpy song with bouncy lyrics nothing that put great demands on a voice but for its quickness but it took no more than the first verse for him to know he looked at trevor nodded no youre never wrong there were reels jigs waltzes and ballads with or without voices joining in when shawn finally came out of the kitchen nigel got his first look at the three gallaghers together excellent genes there he murmured and jude beamed arent they beautiful and listen she added when they began to sing of the bold fenian men despite her enjoyment of her family she caught the look that passed between nigel and trevor these she thought were men who had something to say to each other and wouldnt while she could hear well she owed them so when the song was over she patted trevors arm im going for a quiet cup of tea in the kitchen and then slip out the back door and home thanks for the company and the rescue lovely to meet you nigel enjoy your stay with us she started to scoot out couldnt manage it then was grateful once again as trevor somehow got her smoothly to her feet now following impulse she kissed his cheek good night as the fiddlers had gone into a duel nigel had only to wait until jude was two steps away before she was out of earshot theyre a gold mine that may be but aidan wont give up the pub and neither will shawn trevor nursed his single pint theyll do the performance here and the recording thats for family and for gallaghers but the long term no you didnt mention darcy im working on her her loyaltys here too and with her brothers but she has a taste for the rich life i just have to convince her she can have both he drummed his fingers watching as one of the fiddlers passed her the instrument instead of his empty pint then rose to refill it himself while she picked up the tune with a face like that a voice like that and christ listen to her play she can have anything she wants i know the fact that it didnt entirely please him had trevor setting down his glass and so believe me does she no naive irish lass huh still ive never known you to fail when your minds set youll sign her trev nigel lit one of his dwindling pack of players eyed trevor through the smoke what else are you looking for from her too much for comfort trevor thought entirely too much i havent decided if you decide to keep it strictly business i wouldnt mind he cut himself off when trevors eyes scalpelsharp met his i think well just leave that unsaid ill just go to the bar and order another g and t good idea i think so as we havent snarled over a girl since first term at oxford and you won that one anyway nigel rose nodded toward trevors glass another pint no thanks ill just keep my head clear and nigel make this one your last will you youll be driving back to the cottage on your own i see you always were a lucky bastard luck as far as trevor could see was only part of what he would need to handle darcy gallagher he waited for her in what she liked to call her parlor and waited restlessly among her pretty things the scent of her seemed to be everywhere a subtle reminder that kept him on edge he didnt want a reminder he wanted her everything in her rooms was feminine not the flouncy sort but the sleek slippery pillows he had no idea shed made herself were tossed artistically over the couch a tall slim vase held tall slim flowers with bold red heads there was a painting on the wall of a mermaid wild wet hair of gleaming black raining down her back and naked breasts as she surfaced in a triumphant arch of body from a blue sea it was stunning sensual and somehow innocent it was simply and rather beautifully rendered anyone seeing it would note the resemblance he was sure in the shape of the face the full curve of lips he wondered when darcy had posed for it and immediately wanted to strangle the artist that he realized was a serious problem every bit as serious as this unrelenting desire for her he detested jealousy and possessiveness in relationships they werent just deadly werent just weak they were unproductive he needed to step back clear himself out of this sexual haze hed been in ever since hed seen her at the damn window then she opened the door and that haze simply engulfed him did you send nigel off to home all by himself then she closed the door behind her leaned back against it hes a big boy she reached down flipped the lock i hope you told him not to wait up trevor stepped to her youve been on your feet all night that i have and theyre letting me know it why dont i get you off them he scooped her up and into his arms chuckling she nuzzled his neck well what do you know thats better already sweetheart you aint seen nothing yet chapter fifteen coffee a man couldnt be expected to survive on three hours sleep without coffee sex might satisfy food might fuel love might sustain but without coffee what was the point especially at fivethirty in the morning hed showered pulled on his jeans but he couldnt go another step without the true blood of life coffee he said again directly against darcys ear as she snuggled into her pillow please tell me where it is mm she shifted turned lazily hooked an arm around his neck too early its never too early for coffee or too late darcy im begging you just tell me where you keep it she opened her eyes then and the light was still dim enough to keep her floating on memories of the night which saved him from wrath you need a shave she lifted her other hand rubbed it over his cheek ah you look so rough and male and dangerous come back to bed sex with a beautiful woman coffee it was one of lifes most difficult choices the man who could have both was a king but first things first he slid his hands under the sheets under her warm soft body and hauled her up out of bed you can show me where it is it took her a moment to realize he was carting her into the kitchen trevor im bareassed naked here are you he glanced down let his gaze roam imagine that coffee darcy and the world is yours she sniffed huffed promises like that are kept as often as pigs fly she gestured to a cupboard then squealed when he unceremoniously set her warm and naked ass down on the counter bastard i dont see it men dont see anything thats under their noses she shifted muttering curses and pushed a couple of tins aside there if itd been a snake it wouldve bitten you between the eyes and now i suppose youll be wanting me to make it for you it was such a lovely thought hopeful he laid his palms on either side of her nipped and nuzzled her sulky mouth would ya if he hadnt been so bloody handsome with his hair shiny and damp from his shower his face darkened with stubble those wonderful gray eyes so sleepy shed have beaned him with the can oh move aside and let me go get my robe why she slitted her eyes instead because im cold oh he nodded reasonable ill get it he plucked her off the counter brushed a kiss over her forehead then went to find her robe yawning hugely darcy filled the kettle got out the pot and filter she was starting to shiver as she measured out the coffee when trevor came back with her robe he studied the paraphernalia as she bundled herself into the robe ill have to buy you an automatic one i dont make coffee often enough for it to be worthwhile i start my day with tea most usually thats just sick ah such a weakness its nice to find one there we just wait for the kettle now she reached up to get him a mug and looked so pretty doing it rising on her toes shaking back her tumbled hair that he was dizzy with just dizzy he told himself just dizzy from the picture she made but dont think im making you breakfast he had to touch her just touch so he slipped his arms around her pressing his lips to the side of her neck as he brought her back against him youre so mean her heart jumped then beat thickly the gesture was so simple so warm so full of the sweetness of intimacy that frantic sex could never achieve she squeezed her eyes shut and was careful very careful to keep her voice light well now arent you affectionate of a morning he wasnt not as a rule hed have puzzled over it if it hadnt felt so good to just hold her any woman makes me coffee i shower her with affection if she makes me breakfast im her slave the waitresses in new york city must fight for your table she laid her hands over the ones hed linked around her waist just for a moment she wanted that illusion of quiet settled love myself im not in the market for a slave but youre welcome to whatever you can forage he settled for toast since she didnt seem to have much else and leaned against the counter while it browned and she poured boiling water over the waiting grounds god he breathed deep how does anyone live without the smell of that in the morning he gave her a pitying look tea you yanks drink so much of it you dont know it doesnt taste near as good as it smells blasphemy theres a deli two blocks from where i live now they make coffee that brings tears of gratitude to a mans eye you miss that since it did smell seductive she got down a mug for herself the delis the hustlebustle she opened the refrigerator and got out her little carton of cream what else do you miss about new york the toast popped bagels bagels she got out butter and jam as well then just stood holding them and staring at him a man of your resources and what you miss about new york is coffee and bagels right at this moment id pay a hundred dollars for a fresh bagel no offense to your irish soda bread but really well thats a wonder he started to make some joke but the glorious scent that filled the kitchen had his mind clicking in it was he decided too good an opening to pass up new yorks got more to offer than coffee and bagelsthough they shouldnt be lightly dismissed he put the toast on the plate she offered him restaurants theater artand for the materialistic anything and everything that can be bought youd love it because im materialistic because if you know what you want its next to impossible not to find it there thanks he accepted the mug with deep and sincere gratitude its one of the places youd go if you signed with celtic and so she thought the door closes on intimacy and opens to business there was no point in regretting it and why would i go to new york the same reason youd go to dublin london chicago la sydney wherever concerts media exposure she added cream and sugar to her own brew its a lot to promise when you dont know how ill record or perform or stand up to the kind of life that would make i do know its my business to know youve a lot of businesses trevor and ill wager youre good at each and every one but its this particular one that concerns me i take your word on this and make this change i change everything its a lot for me to risk because you like the sound of my voice she held up a hand before he could speak youd risk as well i understand that youd be making an investment in me but thats what you do isnt it you make investments and if one doesnt pay off another does so its no great loss a disappointment an annoyance but not your life point taken he said after a moment get dressed i beg your pardon get dressed i think i have a way to settle your mind on part of this he glanced at the kitchen clock make it fast will you youve your nerve dont you ordering me about this way and at six in the morning at that he started to ask what the hell the time had to do with it then wisely concluded that arguing would only force her to dig in her heels sorry would you come with me it wont take long and it does go to your point your very valid point clever arent you well ill go because im up and about anyway but keep in mind im not on your payroll and i dont jump when you snap she turned and stalked back to the bedroom satisfied trevor finished his breakfast for the second time that morning trevor roused someone out of sleep in this case the results werent as cozy bloody fucking hell was nigels response if your ladys kicked you out of bed at this godforsaken hour take the sofa im not budging and im not sharing i dont want to get in the bed i want you to get out of it darcys downstairs one of the eyes nigel had firmly shut popped open does that mean youre sharing remind me to punch you later right now get up get dressed and make yourself presentable no ones presentable at jesus sixthirty in the morning im pressed for time nigel trevor turned and started out five minutes at least put the bloody coffee on nigel shouted im not making it this time darcy said firmly the minute trevor came down the steps she had her arms folded over her breasts and a steely look in her eye shed already made it known in no uncertain terms that she hadnt appreciated trevor rushing her along no problem he snagged her hand and pulled her with him toward the kitchen do you want some tea this time i wont be placated by a cup of tea you barely gave me time to put on my lipstick you dont need it since he hadnt yet put the kettle on he had to assume the hissing sound came from her and not from boiling water oh its ever like a man to say something so stupid and think its a compliment he got the kettle going then turned back to her you are he said very deliberately the most beautiful woman ive ever seen and ive seen a considerable number of beautiful women she only huffed and sat at the table flattery isnt going to help you it surprised them both when he walked to her cupped her face in his hands lifted it you take my breath away darcy thats not flattery thats fact her heart fluttered there was no help for it and no way to stop the emotion from swirling into her eyes trevor she murmured it drawing him to her then again with her lips against his and it was there suddenly like light the love and the longing the wishes yet unsaid for an instant for the time it takes a needy heart to beat she felt him answer it and her world shimmered like a jewel music she swore she heard it the romance of harpsong the celebration of pipes the lusty beat of drums the sound she made her mouth warm on his was a kind of song a single note of joy sorry to interrupt nigel said dryly from the doorway but you did tell me to hurry it up the light fractured wavered trevor drew back his hands still framing her face his eyes still on hers then he stepped away and the music died yeah something was echoing in his head in his heart but he couldnt get hold of it he rubbed a hand over his shirt as beneath it the silver disk seemed abruptly hot against his heart behind him the kettle shrilled one long scream of frustration trevor turned and shut it off with a restrained anger that made no sense to him good morning darcy nigel thought it was like stepping into raw nerves but he kept his polished and pleasant expression in place can i offer you some coffee once its done no thanks all the same but ive had some already after my rude awakening this morning ah deciding to make the best of it nigel sat across from her at the table when our trevor gets in a mood no one is safe hes a tidal wave is he now christ yes nigel lit his first cigarette of the day you get swept along or you drown of course its one of the ways he gets things done when he wants and as he wants enjoying herself now darcy leaned forward tell me more hes a singleminded individual and detours only rarelywhen he deems it worth his while ruthless some would say and they wouldnt be wrong he paused blew out smoke but hes a boy who loves his mother shut up nigel trevor ordered when darcy laughed not until ive had my coffee oh and dare you cross him in such a way he loves me too nigel sent trevor a glittering look as he brooded by the stove who wouldnt im growing fond of you myself and what more should i know of this ruthless individual who loves his mother hes got a brain like a bladebright and sharp and a loyal if stubborn heart a generous man trevor but never one to be taken advantage of he admires efficiency honesty and creativity in all things and his way with the ladies is known far and wide thatll do annoyed but unruffled trevor set a mug in front of nigel oh but im sure hes just getting started darcy protested and the topic is greatly fascinating to me ive got one that should be more fascinating to you nigel heads up the london branch of celtic records however irritating he might be on a personal level hes unerringly astute on a professional one true nigel took a sip too true you heard darcy sing last night in a pub without mikes filters orchestration rehearsal in what we could call the most informal of venues what was your impression shes very good were not negotiating here nigel trevor said not diddling terms tell her what you thought straight out all right nigel replied once in a while in my profession you stumble across a jewel a diamondno in your case well use sapphire because it goes with your eyes a rare brilliant undiscovered jewel thats what i heard at gallaghers last night id love to put that jewel in the proper setting ill leave it to you to explain what that setting might be i have to get to the site im already late trevor picked up his keys from the counter where nigel had tossed them the night before ill leave the car for you she could only stare blindly at the keys thanks but ill just walk back itll clear my head and id prefer it suit yourself but he leaned down rested his hands on her shoulders i have to go its not a problem come have lunch at the pub since you had to make do with such a skimpy breakfast if theres time he kissed her lightly before turning to nigel come down and have a look at the site later the walk will do your city legs good thanks very much as trevor left nigel rose to top off his coffee sure you wont have a cup darcy no im fine thanks he poured out sat again smiled so he stopped when darcy held up a hand please i have a question would you have said what you did just now if i wasnt sleeping with trevor be honest she continued as his eyes flickered i wont tell him your answer you have my word on that but the truth here is important to me the truth then it would have been easier and suited me more comfortably to be able to tell you what i just did if you werent sleeping with trevor id have preferred it as well but here we are i hope youll take this as truth as well im not sleeping with trevor so hell offer me a big contract understood nigel paused considered is having a personal relationship with him whats stopping you from agreeing to a professional one i dont know he wouldnt make a habit of having a personal relationship with his artists would he its not his style no its not interesting nigel mused no fascinating unless he missed his guess this was a woman in love but ive never known him to be involved with anyone he hoped to sign for the label id have to say all bets are off in this case no she thought it was a wager still the biggest of her life if i signed with celtic what would be expected of me nigels grin was all charm oh trevor he expects everything and he gets it she relaxed enough to chuckle give me the high points then and the lows as well youll deal with directors producers musicians marketing consultants assistants its not just your voice we want but the package and everyone will have ideas or demands for presenting that package however my impression is that youre a smart woman and selfaware so youd know the package is already as perfect as it can get meaning if i was toad ugly or couldnt string two coherent sentences together youd find ways to remake the package or use the flaws youd be amazed at what a clever publicity campaign can do with flaws regardless the work youll do will be hard the hours long and not all the choices will go your way youll be tired annoyed frustrated baffled stressed and are you temperamental me she deliberately fluttered her lashes of course i am add blowups sulks and rages thenand thats just in the first recording session darcy rested her chin on her fist i like you nigel thats mutual so im going to tell you thiswhich if i didnt like you id leave out if you and trevor continue as you are people will talk not all of them kindly some will snipe and scratch and mutter that the only reason you got a contract is because youre shagging the boss theyll make sure you feel that in dozens of nasty petty ways it wont be easy on you or him they wont let him know unless theyre very very stupid and the petty and jealous are rarely stupid you can cry on his shoulder of course her head snapped up her eyes kindled i dont cry on any mans shoulder i bet you dont he said quietly but if it comes down to it darcy i hope youll use mine she was glad shed chosen to walk back to the village there were so many thoughts buzzing around in her head how long it would take to separate them consider each one she didnt know she only knew that it had to be done she asked herself what she would do if there was nothing between herself and trevor but the offer the answer came quicker than she expected shed take it of course it would be a grand adventure and a chance for more and if she failed there was no shame in it better if she succeeded there was the lush life shed always imagined and all because she could sing wasnt that astounding the work nigel had spoken of didnt worry her overmuch she wasnt afraid of working hard the travel was something shed always dreamed of the niggle came from the fact that she had no driving ambition to perform but perhaps that was to the good without that force and need mightnt she enjoy it more shed have money to lavish on herself her family her friends oh shed have no problem at all with the money but it all circled back there was something between herself and trevor and on her part it was more vital than anything had been in her life she had to make him love her it was so irritating not to know if she was making progress there the man was much too selfcontained for her peace of mind with her mouth set in a pout she tugged a fuchsia blossom from the hedge and tore it to pieces as she walked down the narrow road why was it when it finally happened shed lost her heart to a man who wasnt dazzled with her who wasnt eager as a puppy to please who didnt promise her the world on a silver platter even if those who had done that most often hadnt had the platter much less the world at their disposal she probably wouldnt have fallen in love with him if hed been or done any of those things but that was beside the point she was in love with him so why couldnt he just love her back so everything could be lovely damned perverse individual when hed kissed her there in the kitchen of faerie hill cottage hadnt he felt it hadnt he known her heart was spilling right out of her and into his hands oh she hated that she couldnt stop it hated more that the first time the only time shed wanted a man to see inside her he just wasnt looking so shed have to deal with that she tossed the remains of the tattered blossom away watching it whip like confetti in the brisk wind on the hill she had plenty of tools at her disposal to employ sooner or later shed box him right in damned if she wouldnt before she was done shed be rich famous and married as she came around the bend the sun flashed into her eyes like a beacon sharp and white and direct she raised a hand to shield them blinking and saw through the glare the glint of silver good morning to you darcy the fair slowly with her heart stuttering she lowered her hand it hadnt been the sun at all that had beamed at her it was filtered soft through layered stacks of clouds that turned the sky the color of trevors eyes it was magic that shone out at her and the man standing on the side of the road under the looming spear of the round tower owned it im told you frequent saint declans well oh im here and there depending and its rare for you to wander to that hill im here and there as well depending his eyes flashed with humor as bright as the doublet he wore since heres where you are and so am i will you walk with me the iron gate opened as he spoke though he didnt touch it with his hand men are the same faerie or mortal they must show off pleased when he frowned she breezed by him and through the opening i wondered if youd ever have cause to seek me out i gave you more credit than you deserved there he thought when she turned her head to glare at him point for point i was certain a woman of your talents would have conquered any man she took aim at but youve yet to land the magee hes not a fish and who put the idea in his head that he was obliged to fall in love with me so hed get his back up about it straight off too much yank practicality and not enough irish romance in him thats his problem disgusted because darcy was right about his own miscalculation he strode over the rough ground i dont understand the man if his blood didnt leap the minute he saw you im a jackrabbit you shouldve been able to bring him to the mark by this time he stopped and his eyes burned into hers you want him dont you if i didnt hed never have touched me and has he touched only your body has he reached your heart she turned looking down to where the village lay isnt your magic strong enough to see into my heart i want the words from you ive learned with pain the power of words the ones i have are for him not for you theyll be spoken when i choose not when you demand in the name of finn i knew id have trouble with you he pondered a moment rubbing his chin then with a sly smile he raised his arms high the air shivered rippled like water at a stones toss shapes formed behind it shadows that spread and speared up and took on color and life the gentle voice of the sea became a roar a thousand sounds beating against each other look now carrick ordered but she was already staring eyes wide at the buildings and streets and people where her village had been new york city sweet mary she had already stepped back half afraid she would stumble and fall into that vast crowded wonderful world such a place you could have it the best of it shops full of treasures store windows filled with glittering jewels sleek clothes raced by in front of her eyes elegant restaurants white tablecloths exotic flowers the shimmer of candlelight the glint of wine in crystal luxurious quarters polished wood and thick carpets a fluid curve of stairs a wide wide window that looked out over trees gone to flame with fall its trevors penthouse it could be yours carrick watched the awe the pleasure the desire run over her face he has more his familys getaway in a place called the hamptons a villa in italy on the sea a pretty piedaterre in paris the town house in london a house of brilliant white wood and sparkling glass with the blue water close another in soft pale yellow with a red tile roof tucked onto a soaring cliff over yet another blue sea the charm of old stone and iron rails over the streets of paris and the dignified brick home she remembered from london they all flashed by made her head spin then they were gone in the blink of an eye and there was only ardmore sitting cozily under the layered grayedged clouds you could have it all of it for with some women theyve only to want to have i cant think giving in to her shaky legs she sat on the ground my head aches from it what do you want watching her carrick reached for his pouch and turning it over poured a flood of sparkling blue stones onto the ground i offered them to gwen but she turned from them and from me would you she shook her head but not in denial in sheer confusion he gave you jewels and you wear them i she ran her fingers over the bracelet on her wrist yes but he looked at you and found you beautiful i know it the brilliance of the stones made her eyes tear it was the shine of them she told herself it wasnt her heart breaking but beauty doesnt last if thats all that holds him what happens when it fades am i only to be wanted for what can be seen it would be enough if she wasnt in love enough to have only that if the man was anyone but trevor hes heard your voice and promised you fame wealth and a kind of immortality what more is there what more have you ever dreamed of i dont know oh she wanted to weep why should she want to weep for having seen wonders you have the power you have the choice and here is a gift for you he plucked up one of the stones and taking her hand laid it warm in the cup of her palm on this you can wish not three wishes as so many of the stories go but one only your hearts desire is in your hand be it fortune you will live in wealth vanity and your beauty will fade never fame and the world will know you love the man you want most is yours always and ever he stepped back from her and if her eyes had been clear she might have seen compassion in his choose well darcy the fair for what you choose you live with and he was gone and the jewels save the one in her hand bloomed to flowers she saw now they covered a grave and the name carved into the stone was john magee she lay her head against it and wept now for both of them chapter sixteen darcy intended to go straight through the pub and upstairs so she could make herself presentable but aidan was already there inventorying stock he took one look at her set down his clipboard what happened nothing its nothing i had myself a little jag is all she started through but he simply moved in front of her put his arms around her pressed his lips to her hair there darling tell me whats the matter his greatest fear was that trevor had hurt her in some way and then hed have to kill a man whod become a friend oh aidan dont start me up again but she held on and held tight its just a mood youre a moody one no question but one thing youre not darcy is a blubberer whats made you cry me mostly i think it felt so good to be held by one who had never let her down i have so much in my head and it seemed the only way to let some of it out was with tears he braced himself for the worst magee hasnt done anything he hasnt no and that she thought was part of the problem hed done nothing but be what he was what she wanted aidan tell me something when you went traveling all those years ago saw all those things all those places was it wonderful it was some was grand some bloody awful but altogether it was wonderful he stroked a hand through her hair remembering i guess you could say i had a lot in my head as well back then and rambling was my way of getting some of it out but you came back she drew away then studying his face of all the places youve been and seen you came back here heres home the truth is he dabbed a stray tear from her cheek with his thumb i didnt think i would not when i set out i thought well heres aidan gallagher off to see the world and find his place in it all the while my place was right here where i started but i had to go away to come back ma and dad they arent coming back her eyes filled again though shed have sworn she had already cried herself dry sometimes i miss them so much i can hardly stand it its not every day or like that but just in the once and a while it hits me that theyre thousands of miles away in boston impatient with herself she scrubbed her hands over her face to dry it i know theyve come back for the weddings and theyll come to see your baby when its born but its not the same its not i miss them too she nodded hearing him say it helped i know theyre happy and thats a comfort every time they ring or write theyre full of news and excitement about the gallaghers pub theyve built way over in boston were an international franchise now aidan said and made her laugh a little next well be planting one in turkey or god knows she let out a little sigh theyre happy there and i know ill go over and see them one day but it makes me think that if i went away i might not come back either as much as i want to go to see places and do things aidan i dont want to lose whats here its not a matter of losing but of changing you wont know what changes till you go youve been needing to go since you could stand on your own feet i was the same its shawn whos planted here and never had a question about it sometimes i wish i were like him she looked up sharply and if you ever tell him i said such a thing ill swear youre a liar he laughed tugged her hair there thats better theres more sliding a hand into her pocket she fingered the stone she carried there i have to decide if trevor has it right and i should sign his contract and have him make me a singer you are a singer its different you know it it is are you asking my opinion id like to weigh it in youd be brilliant i dont say that because im your brother i have traveled and in traveling had the opportunity to hear a lot of voices yours shines darcy and always has i could do it she said quietly i believe i could and not make a mess of it more and better i think id like it attention she said with a glint in her eye is food and drink to me youd have a banquet this way wouldnt you i would trevor had me go up and talk to his man this morning nigel from london he didnt paint a picture that was all rose and gilt and i appreciated that it would be hard work you know how to work hard and how to dance around the task when youve had enough which is almost as important another brick of worry tumbled off her shoulder i wouldnt have to dance if you werent such a slave driver and i have a feeling trevors cut from the same cloth hell push me and i wont always like it it sounds as if youve decided i suppose i have she waited a moment and discovered she felt relief instead of excitement the excitement she thought would come i havent quite put it all in its place as yet and im not ready to tell trevor i prefer letting him dangle a bit longer and perhaps nudging him toward sweetening the pot theres my girl wheeling a deals the gallagher way theres more still holding her breath she took the stone from her pocket held it out it wasnt surprise she saw in his eyes so much as acknowledgment then a kind of resignation i knew youd be the third i didnt want to think about it why he looked at her then eye to eye my girl he murmured the force of love was so fierce it nearly dropped her oh aidan youll make me cry again we cant have that to give them both time to compose he got two bottles of water from under the bar so you went up to old maudes grave no tower hill she took the water drank deeply when she realized her throat was dustdry there are flowers blooming over john magee now i was hardly surprised to see him carrick i mean still my heart shook she pressed her fist to it and in the fist she held the stone its a wonder isnt it he looks sharp carrick does and bold but behind his eyes is sorrow love is such a tangle do you love trevor because it seemed hot against her heart she lowered the stone yes its not what i thought it would be its not soft and easy and it sure as hell doesnt make me feel like a queen theres been a change in me since the minute i looked out my window and saw him there might not have been anyone else there for a space of time and so i should have known it was already too late to stop it he knew that feeling very well and the stuttering nerves that went with it and would you if you could i think i would stop it or slow it or something until i could get my breath steady or the man could catch up with me he keeps himself one step back its a cold step and a deliberate one i understand it as ive taken it often enough myself he wants me she said it musingly then caught aidans wince oh dont go male and brotherly on me now when youve been doing so well i am male and your brother he shifted and now he drank deep as well but go on theres passion and love would be bland without it theres a caring that stops it from being nothing but heat but that step the chill in it stops it all just short of trust she decided and acceptance one of you has to take the step forward instead of back i want it to be him there was a trace of her old arrogance in her tone it worried aidan as much as it amused him she opened her fingers letting the stone rest on her palm where like a heart it pulsed its blue light carrick showed me things amazing things i could have them he said ive only to wish for it riches and excitement fame and glory love and beauty to wish for it but only one wish one choice what do you want all of it she laughed but there was something brittle in the sound that broke his heart im selfish and greedy and want all i want everything i can snatch up and hold then i want to go back and get more why cant i want the simple and the ordinary and the quiet aidan why cant i be content with easy dreams youre so hard on yourself mavourneen harder than anyone else can be some people want the simple and the ordinary and the quiet it doesnt make those who want the complicated and extraordinary and the exciting greedy or selfish wantings wanting whatever the dream struck she stared at him what a thought she managed at last i never looked at it that way study on it a while he brushed a fingertip over the stone then closed her hand around it and dont rush your wish that id already concluded for myself she slipped it back into her pocket where it couldnt tempt her carrick may be in a fired hurry but im inclined to take my time she pressed a kiss to each of aidans cheeks you were just what i needed just when i needed you she did give it time her talk with aidan had settled her and made her able to enjoy the time as the days passed into a week she even found herself amused that neither she nor trevor brought up the potential business end of their relationship he was she thought as canny a negotiator as she was one of them would break first she didnt intend for it to be her work on the theater progressed in a kind of stage by stage that she found more interesting than she would ever have believed a change was happening right outside her window a monumental change that had its seeds in a dream and was so much more than bricks and mortar she wanted it for him that she supposed was the nature of love that you could want so intensely your lovers dream to come true now that most of the roof was on she missed seeing trevor out her window he was inside the shell of the building as often as not as the noise was as terrible as ever she rarely kept her windows open on the off chance of hearing his voice with summer the beaches drew people to ardmore and so the pub work kept her mind occupied and for the first time she began to see just what the theater would mean to home it wasnt only the villagers and the neighbors talking of it now but those who visited she could stop for a moment in the crush of a lunch shift look around at the packed tables and bar hear the voices and imagine what it would be like the following summer and she could wonder where she would be as both she and trevor appreciated the distance from work most nights she went to the cottage it became her habit to walk whenever weather allowed though he never failed to offer his car she liked the quiet that slid over the air after midnight and the balm of the breeze and rush of starlight odd but she wasnt sure shed really appreciated it before shed understood she wouldnt be there forever the softness that came from the sea and the waves that were a constant hum and lap in the night when the moon was bright she liked it best that alone time where she could see the cliffs throw shadows whenever she reached tower hill she stopped if the wind was pushing the clouds the spear of the tower seemed to sway and the stones old and new beneath it stood silent and still flowers bloomed yet on the grave of johnnie magee but carrick if he was there chose not to show himself she walked on the road narrowed and the scatter of lights in ardmore were lost behind her there was the scent now of fields and grass and growing things then the glow out of the shadowed dark that was the lights in the cottage on the faerie hill he was waiting for her and that she thought with a delicious thrill was just how she liked it as always her heart grew lighter and she had to force herself not to rush to the gate he called out to her the minute she stepped inside back in the kitchen now wasnt that homey she thought amused at both of them the little woman home from work and the man in the kitchen it was a bit like playing house she supposed and tried not to worry that the house and the game wasnt for either of them in the long run he was at the stove which amused her he could cook as hed demonstrated at that first breakfast but he wasnt one to make a habit of it want some soup he stirred at the little pot sniffed its canned but its food i was stuck on the phone all night and missed dinner thanks no i managed to get some of shawns lasagna which i can promise tasted better than that will if youd called id have brought you some didnt think of it he turned to get a bowl out of the cupboard one look at her and he wanted to grab her youre later than usual he said keeping his tone casual as she set a bag on the counter i wasnt sure youd make it tonight we were busier than usual i shouldnt say usual she corrected and rolled the ache from her shoulders weve been packed every night this week aidan wants shawn to take on some help in the kitchen and youd think aidan had brought his manhood into question such a ruckus they were still going at it when i left aidans going to need another man at the bar well i wont be the one to say so as hell have the same reaction as shawn im not having my head bit off she got the kettle to fill as trevor leaned back against the counter spooning up soup where he stood ill have some tea to keep you company since youre eating you might want to have whats in the bag with your tinned soup what is it she only smiled and turned on the tap trevor set down his bowl peeked in the bag when his hand darted in like an eager boys into a pond after a prize frog she laughed bagels well we couldnt have you pining could we delighted with his reaction she carried the kettle to the stove shawn made them lest you think ive been bakingand believe me youre better off i havent he wasnt pleased with the first batch or youd have had them a couple of days ago but hes well satisfied with these so i think youll enjoy them trevor only stood there the plasticwrapped bread in his hand staring at her as she turned on the burner under the kettle it was ridiculous insane but something was stirring inside him warm fluid lovely in defense he struggled with a joke a full dozen too i guess i owe you twelve hundred dollars she glanced back her face blank for a moment then it filled with humor a hundred a piece i forgot about that damn i suppose ill have to split it with shawn she patted his cheek then reached for the tea well no charge this time i thought youd enjoy a little bit of home thank you his voice was so serious she glanced back saw his face his mouth was serious as well and his eyes were dark and fixed on her her pulse scrambled so she covered it with a shrug youre very welcome but its just a bit of bread after all no it wasnt shed thought of it without even realizing how much the small gesture would mean shed thought of him he set the bag down stepped to her turned her and laid his mouth on hers soft lush long and deep that something that stirred inside him swelled he drew back half believing hed see what it was what it meant in her face but her eyes were clouded deep blue smoke blurring whatever was behind them well she was sinking sinking without meaning to have stepped into the bog i cant wait to see what happens after you taste but he silenced her another kiss luxurious and tender she was trembling he realized and had trembled against him before but it was different for both of them somehow different the crackle of power that always snapped between them was only a low humming now steady and true the blood that always raced ran thick almost lazy trevor his name circled in her head slipped through her lips trevor he reached behind her switched off the burner then lifted her into his arms i want to make love with you and saying it he knew it would be the first time she pressed her lips to the side of his throat as he carried her out it was like sliding into a dream she thought one she hadnt known she had pooled inside her being granted a wish she hadnt known slept in her heart she felt treasured when he carried her up the stairs the romance of it made her heart ache music drifted through her head harps and flutes both low and sweet he stopped looked at her and she thought he must hear it as well such moments were made for magic the bedroom windows were open so the wind danced through the curtains and brought with it all the damp and mysterious scents of night the moon shimmered through in silver dust he sat her on the bed then moved around the room to light the candles that had been set out for practicality and never used their flames swayed and tossed soft shadows a softer fragrance from the tall bottle on the table by the bed he took one of the flowers she had picked from the cottage garden and put there he handed it to her then he sat beside her lifted her into his lap and held her the way she curled into him as if shed been waiting made him wonder how they had missed this step why they had both rushed to reach the peak time after time night after night without once lingering over the journey this time he promised himself this time when he touched a hand to her cheek she lifted her face lifted her mouth to meet his time spun out lost importance in this new and sumptuous mating of lips the love hidden inside her heart poured into it without shame or fear and still continued to rise inside her as if from a well that never ran dry here was the compassion neither thought they needed the tenderness both had shrugged aside and all the patience theyd forgotten he pressed his lips to the center of her palm her hands were elegant he thought silky of texture they might have belonged to a princess in a castle no there was too much strength in them for a princess a queen he decided kissing her fingers one by one who knew how to rule he brushed his lips over the inside of her wrist and felt her blood beat there music whispered on the wind as he laid her back on the pillows her arms came up her fingers skimming over his face into his hair as gentle as his had been her eyes werent clouded now but clear theres magic tonight she said and drew him down to her they touched as if it was the first time as if there had been no others before or would be no others after innocence reaching for intimacy for that night at least she knew it was true and gave herself to it to him through the glow of candlelight and moonbeams they gave to each other he tasted and she whispered she stroked and he murmured sounds of pleasure twined together without rush they undressed each other and savored the magic his skin was tones darker than hers had he noticed that before had he paid enough attention to how like silk she was or how passion the gradual glorious build of it gave that lovely white skin a flush of rose the taste of her there just at the underside of her breast nothing else had that delicacy of flavor he thought he could live on that alone for the rest of his life and when his tongue slid over her and she shivered he was sure of it even when warmth simmered toward heat when breaths became gasps and murmurs moans there was no hurry she crested on a long gentle wave her body flowing up to his she felt golden rich with sensation each one somehow separate and shining even as they merged together love made her selfless nudged her to give back the glory she rose over him slid down to him her lips warm and tender her hands skimmed over him tough muscles that quivered at her lazy strokes smooth skin that delighted her now she thought now before greed could sneak back and steal this time from them she clasped his hands with hers and took him into her slowly and silkily with urgency only a pulsebeat away he filled she surrounded the light danced over her skin her hair into her eyes bewitching him he remembered the painting of the mermaid with her face that gorgeous arch of body lovely tumble of hair she belonged to him now fact and fantasy hed have followed her if shed asked into the sea into the heart of it her eyes closed her head tipped back her body bowed nothing hed ever seen was more beautiful than that moment when she lost herself the shiver ran down her and into him he swore he could feel it feel her in every cell he came up to meet her wrapping his arms around her pressing his lips to the hollow of her throat and it was there holding each other that they let go of everything else and sank under the surface and toward the heart together in the dark wrapped around him her mind sliding toward sleep darcy closed a hand over the silver disk that lay on his heart she assumed his irishloving mother had given it to him and that he wore it touched her what does it say she murmured because the words were faded and unclear to her but when he told her she was already drifting so his voice floated like out of a dream forever love later when they slept he dreamed a dream of blue water shot through with sunlight like bright jewels tipped by white waves that spewed drops like tears beneath the surface where silence should have reigned was music a celebration of sound that quickened the pulse and fed the spirit he went toward it searching shadows and light for the source the golden sand beneath his feet was littered with gemstones as if some carelessly generous hand had strewn them like bread crumbs a silver palace rose up into the blue light its towers glinting and a banquet of flowers spread at its feet the music swelled seduced became female a womans voice raised in song a sirens call that was irresistible he found her beside the silver palace sitting on a hill of rich blue that pulsed like a heart there she sat and sang and smiled at him in a beckoning way her hair dark as midnight flowed around her teased the milky skin of her breasts her eyes blue as the hill laughed he wanted her more than he wanted to live the wanting made him feel weak and the weakness infuriated him still he couldnt stop himself from going to her darcy have you come for me then trevor her voice wove spells magic threads winding even when she spoke what will you give me what do you want she only laughed again shook her head its for you to figure out she reached out a hand coyly inviting him to join her jewels sparkled at her wrist little points of brilliant fire what will you give me frustration beat through his blood more of these he said touching the gems at her wrist as many as you want if thats what you want she held her arm out turning it so the stones shot fire well i cant say i mind having such things but its not enough what else have you got ill take you to all the places you want to see she pouted at that and picked up a glittering comb to run it through her flowing hair is that all temper snaked up hissed in his throat ill make you rich famous put the damn world at your feet now she yawned clothes he snapped servants houses the envy and admiration of everyone who sees you everything you could ask for its not enough he saw that this time when she spoke her eyes wept cant you see its not enough what then he reached for her intending to pull her up to make her answer but before his hands could touch he slipped stumbled and was falling the voice that followed him wasnt darcys but gwens until you know and give it wont be done until you do it wont begin he shot out of sleep like a man at the edge of drowning heart thundering breath raw and even then awake aware he heard the faintest whisper look at what you already have give whats only yours to give christ shaken he got out of bed darcy shifted closer to the warmth hed left and slept on he started toward the bathroom for water then yanked on his jeans instead and went downstairs three am he thought when he saw the clock perfect he got down the bottle of whiskey and poured a stiff three fingers into a glass what the hell was wrong with him but he knew and knocked back the whiskey hissed at the heat set down the glass he was in love with her with a half laugh he pressed his fingers to his eyes fell in love over bagels he decided hed been doing fine until then he thought holding his own attraction affection interest sex those were all safe and sound those were all controllable then she brings him a bagful of baked goods and hes gone jokes on you magee he thought youve been on your way since the first minute the last slide just took you by surprise hell of a slide too he hadnt thought he had it in him after sylvia when hed done everything he could to be in love had planned it orchestrated it and failed so miserably at it hed been sure he simply wasnt capable of that kind of emotion toward a woman it had worried him dismayed him angered him then hed accepted it as likely for the best if a man lacked something it was only logical efficient even to compensate for it elsewhere work his parents his sister the theater it had been enough nearly enough hed convinced himself of it and convinced himself that he could want darcy have darcy care for darcy without it ever being more than that now without plan without effort it was she was everything part of him was thrilled he wasnt incapable of love but there was just enough fear snaking through that thrill to remind him to be cautious be careful he went to the back door opened it to cool his head with air gone damp and misty he needed a clear head to deal with darcy magic shed said there was magic tonight he believed that and was beginning to accept that there had been magic all along in her in this place maybe it was fate and maybe it was luck hed have to work out if that luck was good or bad loving darcy wasnt going to be a smooth and easy road then again hed never really wanted the smooth and easy he didnt want what his grandparents hadthe chill formality of their marriage with no passion with no humor or affection thered never be anything like chilly formality with a woman like darcy he wanted her and would figure out how to keep her he didnt doubt that it was just a matter of calculating what to offer how to offer and when to offer what she wouldnt be able to resist the last echo of the dream drifted back to him give whats only yours to give he closed the words out shut the door hed had enough of magic for one night chapter seventeen the morning was misty darcy woke to light gray with rolling fog and the bed empty beside her there was nothing new in either the fog would burn off before long if it was meant to and as far as she could tell trevor was always up before dawn the man was a robot when it came to such matters she rolled over wishing he was there to cuddle up against and knowing that because he wasnt she wouldnt sleep for wondering what he was up to she supposed neither of them had gotten a reasonable nights sleep since theyd become lovers but running on sexual energy seemed to be working she felt wonderful she rose to take her robe from the hook in the closet she had clothes in there as well and other things she deemed necessary for basic living throughout the cottage it was a kind of living together they were doing she knew and had been all summer though neither of them mentioned it in fact they took great pains to avoid the subject as if it were politics or religion he had a few things in her rooms over the pub for the times he stayed there and though it was a first for her this having her things on a mans shelf and his on hers it had been a casual process this shifting of items from place to place and melding of homes and lifestyles casual she thought as she walked into the bath to turn on the shower because thats how they treated the entire business between them yet there had been nothing casual in what had happened the night before the scope of it was she stepped under the spray closing her eyes tilting back her head it was beyond anything shed experienced before anything shed known two people could create between them it had to have been the same for him he couldnt have touched that way been touched by her that way unless he felt something deep and something true lovemaking dreamily she circled soap over her wet skin while the steam rose and closed her in she hadnt understood what that meant before trevor not what it could mean vulnerability shed never realized that being vulnerable to someone else could be beautiful safe and warm and lovely just as knowing that for that stretch of time in that soft world hed been vulnerable as well here at last was a man she could open herself to completely could promise herself to and trust and love and cherish they would spend their lives together going wherever fate took them grabbing hold of what life offered and making more from it through rushed days or quiet nights in solitude or crowds making children building homes she would make her mark beside him and open all the doors shed always longed to pass through it was possible to have everything after all she thought all you needed first was love he heard her singing of it when he stepped into the bedroom of love and longing it made him ache he stood while her voice slipped through the door she hadnt quite closed and twined around him he waited until her song ended until he saw her moving around the room through the narrow opening hed spent part of his wakeful night deciding just what to do about her he gave the door a quick knock with his knuckle eased it open shed already wrapped a towel around herself and was slathering on the cream she kept in a little white pot he thought it smelled like warm apricots and it never failed to whet his appetite her hair was wet and curled and wild as it was in the painting she had in her room it reminded him uncomfortably of his dream i brought you some tea thats lovely thanks she took the cup smiling at him her eyes were still dreamy from her song i thought maybe youd gone on to work already im glad you didnt she moved closer to touch her mouth to his she felt soft everywhere from wishing hed take her back to bed to make love again as they had in the night i was about to come up and wake you wanting her clouded his brain just as the steam clouded the bath so he stepped out kept the door open you beat me to it she sipped the hot tea as the air in the bedroom shivered in and chilled her and what did you have in mind for after youd waked me a man with a singledigit iq and no libido would have caught the invitation stay on track trevor warned himself a walk a walk yeah he moved across the room to sit on the edge of the bed he didnt intend to touch her and lose focus but that didnt mean he couldnt watch her dress and torture himself you usually walk down to the village anyway so well take a walk then ill drive you down she was pink and warm and fragrant from her shower naked but for a towel and the man wanted to go tramping around in the mist a woman with less confidence darcy thought would wonder if shed misplaced her sex appeal during the night it didnt mean she couldnt be miffed dont you have to work prepared to pout she turned to the closet i can take the morning micks coming in to keep an eye on things between him and brenna i can spare a couple hours the fact was he could have spared days even weeks it would have been more sensible to return to new york handle the business he had there up front rather than long distance but he watched darcy slither into underwear and knew he wasnt going anywhere in the near future not alone mr otoole should be at home yet recuperating ive had me fill of women fluttering around me person day and night trevors very passable mimic of micks disgust had a smile tugging at darcys lips nonetheless you want to try to keep him down be my guest me i dont have the heart well she pondered over a shirt as long as he doesnt overdo its not that hes old but hes not as young as he was either and being a man hell want to do more than he should meaning men show off of course they do she shot an amused and female look over her shoulder indulgent and insulting dont you probably but brenna isnt liable to let him overdo she doesnt flutter she just watches him like a shewolf watches a pup i think he likes it men also like being pampered by a woman they just have to pretend it annoys them as if having two brothers i didnt know that already ill lure him into the kitchen for a hot meal and some pampering and tell him how strong and handsome he is she did up the buttons of the shirt he likes the flattery as well holding her trousers by one finger her shirttail skimming her thighs she turned and as i can attest youre a man as well wouldnt you like some of the same i might be persuaded to fix you a meal downstairs in the cozy kitchen and tell you youre strong and handsome adams temptation for an apple was nothing compared to darcys smile but there were priorities i had a bagel he grinned at her it was great then im pleased baffled but pleased she stepped into her trousers slipped on her shoes just let me fix my hair and face and ill be right with you whats wrong with your hair its wet for one thing its damp out so it wont matter impatient now he rose to take her hand if i let you go into that bathroom you wont come out for an hour trevor exasperated she tugged to try to free her hand as he pulled her down the steps im only half done here you look beautiful moving quickly he grabbed her jacket you always do then ignoring her protests he bundled her into it whats your hurry but she decided to be mollified with the compliment and let him have his way that she liked to think was a fine giveandtake in a relationship letting a man have his way when it didnt really matter one way or the other it wasnt particularly damp out not to her way of thinking the fog was thin a lovely filter on the air that turned ordinary shapes into fanciful ones bright colors in the cottage garden were softly muted the hills beyond wonderfully mysterious already she could see some breaks in the clouds hopeful little patches of quiet blue among the gray the world was so hushed they might have been alone in it all the warmth and intimacy of the night before flowed back into her when he took her hand as they walked they went over the field circling and for a time she was silent lost in the romance where are we heading saint declans a chill ran up her spine nerves superstitions anticipation she couldnt be sure if id known we were going by old maudes grave idve brought some flowers there are always flowers on her grave magic flowers she thought put to grow there by powers beyond the mortal in the distance through the thinning fog the stone ruin stood like something waiting she shivered cold no i but she didnt mind when he released her hand to tuck his arm around her its an odd place to come on a misty morning too early for tourists its a great spot terrific view if the fog lifts too early for tourists she agreed but not for faeries in such a place who knew what was sleeping under a hillock of grass or in the shadow of a stone are you looking for carrick no though he wondered i wanted to come here with you he passed the well and its crosses moved with her into the ancient roofless church where maude lay the rough stones that marked ancient dead tilted up through ground and haze in contrast flowers swept lovingly over maudes and thrived they dont pick her flowers hmm the people who come here trevor said tourists and students and the locals who walk this way they dont pick her flowers it would be disrespectful people dont always give respect but they seem to here this is holy ground yes he still had his arm around her leaned down almost absently to press a kiss to her damp hair and the thrill moved through her fast and bright alone in the world on holy ground she realized the morning after theyd loved each other and in a way had discovered each other hed brought her here to the cliff above sea and village in the mist and the magic to tell her he loved her she closed her eyes trembled a little from the soaring joy of it of course nothing could be more perfect he wanted such a place to tell her his heart to ask her to be his wife what could be more romantic more dramatic more quietly right fogs lifting he murmured together standing on the windy hill they watched the veil tear gently and the sun shimmer through silveredged to touch the air with its pearly light far below was the village that was home and the sea that guarded it swam slowly clear as if hands had drawn open a filmy curtain the beauty of it what she saw with her eyes what she saw with her heart brought tears stinging home she thought yes aidan was right this would always be home no matter where she traveled with the man beside her her love for it filled her as gently as the sunlight that brushed through the clouds it looks perfect from here she said quietly like something from out of a storybook i forget that when im down in it going from day to day doing whats needed to be done swamped with emotions she rested her head on trevors shoulder i used to wonder why maude chose to rest here away from family and friends and most of all away from her johnnie but this is why this was the place for her and shes not away from her johnnie at all she never was that kind of loves a miracle he wanted one for himself and meant to make it happen loves always miraculous tell me tell me quickly she thought so i can tell you back it seems to be the order of the day around here now she thought and wondered if a body could die of sheer happiness it is beautiful and full of charm and drama but there are other places in the world darcy she frowned puzzled then almost instantly smiled again of course he thought he needed to prepare her to explain how he had to travel for his work before he asked her to go with him ive always wanted to see those other places she could ease the path for him another giveandtake she thought nearly giddy in a relationship to go and see and do just recently i came to realize that wanting that doesnt mean i dont love and appreciate what i have here wanting to go just means coming back you can see all those other places he drew her away his hands on her shoulders his gaze intent she had the sudden thought that here now finally she was going to be offered her hearts desire and the only man shed ever loved would propose to her when her hair was wet and her face naked damn the foolishness of it made her laugh and reach for him he loved her just as she was and that was a wonder oh trevor itll be work but exciting work satisfying fulfilling lucrative of course but i the romantic haze parted much as the fog over the sea and let the last part of his statement swim clearly into her mind lucrative very the sooner you sign the sooner we can get started on the groundwork but you have to take the step darcy make the decision the step she touched a hand to her temple as if dizzy then turned away how could she take any step when she had no balance she thought she had no balance at all who would after being struck by such a blow it was the contract he spoke of not love not marriage but business sweet god what a fool she was what romantic fantasies shed woven and how completely shed stripped herself of defenses and the worst of it was he didnt even know weve come here is it to talk of contracts step one he thought get her signed sturdily connected to him hed show her the world and all the things she wanted once she had a taste of them hed offer her a feast anything and everything shed ever wanted i want you to have what youre looking for i want to be a part of getting it for you celtic records will nurture you and build your career i intend to see to it personally see to you the package she tried to swallow the bitterness but it stuck in her throat when she looked back at him all shed ever wanted was standing right here with his hair blowing in the breeze and his eyes too cool for her to reach out and touch him thats how nigel put it so youll see personally to the package and keep you happy i can promise that cold now she angled her head how much do you judge it takes to keep me happy to start on signing he named a figure that would have taken her breath away if she hadnt felt so cold so bloody cold instead she met the offer with a cynical lift of her brow and how much of that may i ask is for the talent and how much is because im sleeping with you his eyes fired quickly and went hard as stone i dont pay women to sleep with me thats insulting to both of us youre right finally the pain ate through the ice and made her weak im sorry for that it was badly put others will say it though nigel warned me of that he hadnt thought of it it only showed how tangled up he was in her that he hadnt thought of it youll know better what else matters she walked away from him back to maudes grave but found no comfort in the flowers or the magic or the dead its easier for you trevor you have the armor of your position and your power and your name ill come into this without any of that is that whats stopping you he went to her turned her back are you afraid of words spoken by jealous idiots youre stronger than that darcy not afraid no but aware the business is separate from our private life but he was merging them knew it you have a gift and i can help you use it whats between us otherwise is no ones concern but our own and if whats between us begins to fade if one or the other of us should decide its time to move on there or away what then it would kill him even the thought of it stabbed his heart it wont affect the business side maybe we should have a separate contract saying so she meant it sarcastically even cruelly and was stunned when he only nodded all right well then well she let out a shaky breath and walked over to look down at ardmore once again so that was how things were done in his world contracts and agreements and sensible negotiations fine she could handle that would handle that but just let him try to walk away from her down the road let him try and hed find his legs across the room from the rest of him he knew nothing of wrath all right magee draw up your papers ring your solicitors strike up the band whatever needs doing she didnt turn back but whirled and her smile glittered hard and gorgeous ill sign my name youll get your voice youll get the whole flaming package god help you god help us both she added silently relief came to him in a wave he had her and was on his way to keeping her you wont regret it i dont intend to her eyes were sharp enough to cut glass when he took her hands again leaned toward her no you dont i dont seal business arrangements with kisses point taken solemnly he shook her hand business concluded for the moment so now he wanted a woman a lover fine then shed give him his moneys worth there as well deliberately she ran her hands up from hips to ribs over chest onto shoulders sliding her body into his provocative taunting she nipped retreated nipped until she tasted frustrated desire until she saw the flash of it heat his eyes to smoke then only then she tipped her head back and let him take they feasted on each other with none of the tender patience of the night this was passion and passion only with its greed and fire and demands while her soul wept from the loss she rejoiced he wanted her would want her again and again this she would see to as long as she held this power she held him and with it witchlike she would bind him touch me she tore her mouth from his to use her teeth in little cat bites on his neck put your hands on me he hadnt meant to the time and the place were all wrong but heat was pumping out of her into him burning off control scorching sense his hands rough and possessive filled themselves with her but when he was on the point of losing all reason of dragging her down to the wild grass she pulled back the wind caught her hair and swirled it as if in water the sun shot into her eyes and sparkled there for an instant her beauty was cruel later she said and lifted a hand loverlike to stroke his cheek you can have me as later ill have you fury spurted into his throat but he didnt know if it was for himself or for her thats a dangerous game darcy and what fun are they if theyre not youll have what you want from me on both counts be content that here youve had my word on the first and a fine taste of the second he was just raw enough to risk asking what do you want from me her lashes lowered a shield against grief didnt you bring me up here because youd figured that out for yourself already i guess i did he murmured well then she was smiling again when she held out a hand wed best go back as the mornings wasting and i never did finish my tea cheerfully she gave his hand a little squeeze as they walked lets just see if you can keep up with me you blind thickheaded bastard and will you be willing to share your bagels with me he ordered himself to match her mood i could probably be persuaded to share neither of them looked back as they walked away or saw the air ripple and shred fools carrick muttered scowling from his perch atop the stone well stubborn bonebrained fools and just my luck to be stuck with them one step away from happiness and they spring back as if it were bared fangs he leaped off his seat landing an inch above the ground in the next instant he was sitting crosslegged by maudes grave im telling you old friend ive just no clear understanding of mortals maybe they are just in heat and im wrong about them brooding now he stuck his chin on his fist the hell i am he decided but it didnt lighten his mood theyre stupid in love with each other and there i think lies the problem neither of them knows how to handle stupidity afraid of it is what they are afraid to give in to senselessness and let love rule he sighed a little then waved his wrist and took a bite of the golden apple that appeared youd say i was the same and youd be right enough magees set on the same path i took promise her this offer her that vow to give her the world as the worlds safe when youve plenty of it to spare but youve only one heart after all and giving that is a more difficult deal i didnt look inside my gwen and he doesnt look inside his darcy he thinks its sense but its nothing but fear he gestured toward the headstone with the apple as if the old woman sat there listening perhaps she did and shes no better when it comes to it as different from my quiet modest gwen as sun from moon but the same in this aspect she wants him to offer his heart but will she just bloody say so for finns sake no she wont femaleswho can figure them he sighed then munched his bright apple contemplated hed nearly lost patience had been on the edge of springing out of the air to order them both to get on with it they were in love admit it and be done but that was beyond what was permitted the choices the timing the steps of their dance together had to be theirs his contribution carrick decidedhe didnt care for the word interferencecould be only minor he had done what he could do now he had to wait as he had waited three centuries already his fate his happiness at times he thought his very life depended on the hearts of these two mortals hed dealt with the other pairs of them youd have thought hed have learned enough to know how to hurry these last two along but all hed learned was that love was a jewel with too many facets to count strength and weakness running side by side through it and that no one could give or take it with any less than an open hand he lay back on the grass and with his mind sketched gwens beloved face in the clouds i ache for you heart body mind i would give all thats in my power to give to touch you again to breathe your scent to hear your voice i swear to you when you come back to me at last its love ill pour at your feet the grandeur and humility of it and the flowers that bloom from that will never die he closed his eyes and weary with waiting vanished into sleep the effort of being cheerful and sexy and witty left darcy near to exhaustion by the time trevor drove her down to the pub but determined to play it all out she walked around the back with him so she could make happy noises about the progress of the work she realized that temper had her overplaying it when trevor narrowed his eyes at her so she beat a hasty retreat giving him a warm but brief kiss she made it as far as the kitchen door when brenna shoved in behind her whats the matter brenna asked immediately theyd known each other since birth understood each others moods often better than they understood their own come upstairs can you such was the nature of their friendship that darcy didnt have to wait for an answer she went up fast shedding her brightness and cheer as she might have shed clothes ive a headache the brutal pounding sent her straight to the bathroom cupboard for aspirin she chased it with water drinking the whole glass down their eyes met in the mirror brenna knew that sleek and shiny look hid some deep hurt what did he do how marvelous it was to have a friend who simply knew where the blame lay even before the offense was cited he offered me a fortune a small one i suppose by his standards but hefty enough by mine enough to set me on the way to where im going and in fine style and im taking it she tossed her head and the edgy defiance worried her friend im signing his recording contract thats grand darcy truly it is if its what you want ive always wanted more than i have and now im about to get it i wouldnt sign if it didnt suit me i promise you im doing it for me first i havent lost my head so much to do otherwise then im pleased for you and proud already she laid a hand on darcys shoulder rubbed at the tension now tell me how he hurt you i thought he was going to ask me to marry him i thought he would tell me he loved me and wanted me to belong to him can you imagine that i can and now brenna hurt as well perfectly sure and his visions not so sharp as yours he hasnt a clue she gripped the sides of the sink breathed slow and deep im not going to cry he wont get tears out of me come sit down and tell me when she did and when she had brenna held her hand all sympathy she said bastard thanks for that i hate that its partly my fault oh thats a bitter pill but i set myself up for it no mistake there spinning romantic fantasies in the shower like some fluffbrained girl why shouldnt you you love him i do the cad and ill make him pay for it before were done what are you going to do trap him of course blind him with lust confuse him with my many moods toy with him all the things im best at when it comes to men i wont say you arent skilled in that area brenna said carefully but if you go this way and win it wont be enough for you ill make it enough manys the relationship that has its seeds in sex lust and love arent so far apart maybe not in the flaming dictionary but darcy when one partys in lust and the other in love theyre distant as moons and between those places is so much room to be hurt i cant hurt any more than i did this morning at saint declans well and i survived she stepped to the window out there she thought trevor was building his dream but hed needed some of what was hers for it well she could build her own and take some of his of him ill risk the rest i can make him need me brenna needs the step between wanting and loving itll be enough for me she shook her head before brenna could speak crossed back i have to try of course you do hadnt she brenna thought didnt everyone who knew what love was and longing but at the moment i need to vent out this foul mood shawnll be coming along shortly ill just go down and torment him until i feel better if thats the case ill get back on the job and out of harms way chapter eighteen a storm hovered over the village marching down from the northeast to camp on the border as an army digs in for a siege the rising winds and splattering rain that were its leading edge chased people from the beaches and brought a nasty chill the sky thick and bruised and ominous had even the locals glancing upward with apprehension had you ever seen that green tint to the clouds edges before had you ever tasted air that had such a flavor of mean in it she would hit they said and hit hard those whod been through such things before checked their stock of candles and lamp oil and batteries supplies were laid in and children ordered to stay close to home boats were secured in their docks as ardmore prepared for the coming battle but when the door of the pub burst open judes face was bright as sunbeams it came excitement had her barely able to speak above a whisper that didnt carry over the voices to where aidan was busy at the taps it was darcy who saw her standing there with her boundback hair damp with raindrops her cheeks flushed pink and the book clutched to her breast like a beloved child darcy dumped her tray immediately and unceremoniously on a table where four baffled french students stared at the toasted sandwiches piles of slaw and chips they hadnt ordered and began consulting their phrase books is it the book yours thrilled darcy tried to pry it out of judes grip no i have to show it to

lovely oh turn it over aidan jude might have danced if the baby hadnt been weighing so heavy that parts not important it is to me everyone can look at this and see what fine taste i have in wives but he did turn it over and let out an ah of delight jewels of the sun and other irish legends jude frances gallagher the title ran across the top and her name across the bottom of a brilliantly colored illustration depicting a man in silver and a woman with pale hair riding across a bold blue sky on a winged white horse its beautiful he murmured jude frances its beautiful it really is isnt it she didnt mind the tears that slid down her cheeks they felt wonderful and right and well deserved i cant stop looking at it touching it i thought i knew how much it meant i wasnt even close im so proud of you he lowered his head to press his lips to her forehead you have to give this one to me so i can sit and read every word start now with the dedication when he opened it began reading the flyleaf she turned the pages herself no you can read that later read this now indulging her he began to read then his eyes changed darkened lifted to hers the look that passed between them was strong and vibrant this time when he kissed her he took her mouth a ghra was all he said when he lifted his head laid his cheek against her hair my love take jude back in the snug darcy murmured she shouldnt be on her feet so long take some time with her ill see to the bar here thanks just let me settle her in get her some tea emotions still swirled in his eyes as he handed darcy the book have a care with it ignoring customers darcy opened the book and read what aidan had for aidan who showed me my own heart and gave me his with him i learned there is no magic more potent than love may i see it eyes drenched darcy looked across the bar at trevor because she was unable to speak she handed the book to him and immediately started the first layer on a pair of guinnesses its gorgeous of course it is its judes saying nothing he walked behind the bar set the book on a shelf out of harms way then took out his handkerchief thanks she sniffled dried her eyes sentiment looks lovely on you it doesnt get the work done its aidans turn to be sentimental now ill take mine later she tucked the handkerchief in her pocketjust in case isnt it wonderful she did a little step dance then beamed at the next customer who came to the bar to order my sisters a famous author and this is her book she snatched it back off the shelf itll be in bookshops in just a couple of weeks now you should buy it as soon as you can now what can i get you darcy are you ever picking up these orders or do i have to serve as well as cook obviously putupon shawn came through the kitchen door carrying a loaded tray look you peabrain she turned and all but shoved the book under his nose its judes he set the tray on the bar with a clatter and made a grab for the book one drop of chip fat on this and youre a dead man i know how to be careful he took the book as if it were fragile china brenna has to see he announced and was back out the door like a shot theyll grubby it up between them wait and see she turned back a little shocked to see trevor exchanging pints hed drawn himself for payment well look at himself manning the bar i can handle it until aidans back if you want to serve those lunch orders before theyre cold do you know how to build a guinness ive watched enough of them constructed some people watch brain surgery doesnt mean they should be handed a knife but she picked up the tray were grateful for the help no problem it gave him a chance to watch her work and to think for the last few days shed kept him balancing on a keen and delicious edge in bed she was a siren and out of it a tease she was tireless energetic capricious and fascinating and somehow through it all he would have said heartless something had been off he decided between them since the night theyd made slow and gentle love he couldnt pinpoint the change only knew the change was there he saw it when he caught the cold and steady gleam of calculation in her eyes then again she was a woman who made no secret of her calculations he accepted that and in many ways admired her lack of artifice but the darcy hed just seen hadnt been calculating or capricious or selfinterested shed been thrilled excited and sentimental enough to cry over judes accomplishment her brothers pride it was odd to think that in all the weeks hed known her hed only seen her shed a tear over someone elses pleasure where she loved she was both vulnerable and generous he wanted that vulnerability that generosity he wanted that love and though he knew it was wrong he wanted her to shed a tear over him it was time he thought to push her a little closer he waited until the shift was over until aidan left to take jude home shes worn out darcy stood in the doorway watching them drive off the short distance to the house such excitement hell persuade her to lie down a bit oh the winds kicking closing her eyes she let it batter her reveled in it the storm will hit full before nightfall then were in for it youd best batten down your hatches magee for theres a gale coming im heading back to the cottage shortly anyway ive got work there to deal with youre getting wet feels good after all the crowd in here today but she closed the door on the wind and spitting rain and locked it ill wager you ten pounds to your five that youll be working by candlelight this night thats a sucker bet im no sucker pity i can always use an extra five she began to gather empties from the tables well be packed tonight people like company when the worlds wild come back if you can for well have music to chase the jitters away i will can you let that go a minute i want to talk to you twisted me arm with pleasure she sat at one of the tables put up her feet on the chair beside her days like this you wish you had three arms and twice as many feet looking forward to serving your last pint not as much as shed expected but she nodded who wouldnt be every time i pick up the phone and dial room service itll be a personal celebration you can count on doing a lot of celebrating he sat across from her time he thought to up the stakes and play the next card theyre faxing me the draft of your contract today i expect to have it when i get back to the cottage her stomach jittered excitement anticipation nerves thats quick work most of its standard youll want to look it over take it to your lawyer solicitor he corrected any questions changes well discuss fair enough i have to go to new york for a couple days she was grateful she was sitting down with her feet up as her knees went soft as jelly do you you havent mentioned it im mentioning it now having just decided come with me yes a very good thing she was sitting down she stayed stretched out as every muscle of her body tensed come with you to new york city you can sign the final papers there on his turf well celebrate he wanted her to meet his family see his home his life the business wont take that long ill show you the city and give her a taste of what he could offer her trevor and new york the thrill of being with him in a place shed seen in dreams and illusions i cant think of anything id enjoy more thats the truth then ill make the arrangements i cant trevor i cant go with you now why its high season you saw how it is in the pub with barely enough hands to go around i cant leave aidan and shawn short that way during summer season its not right damn it he didnt want her to be responsible to be sensible now you can get someone to fill in for you its only a few days i could and that would ease part of the problem but i cant leave here now however much it appeals judes due any day she needs her family as does aidan what kind of a sister would i be to go dancing off at such a moment i thought she had another week at least men she mustered up a smirk babies come when they please and first babies are the most willful so im told its lovely to think about going off with you now but i couldnt bear the guilt of it well take the concorde itll cut the traveling time down to negligible the concorde she rose walked behind the bar for a ginger ale like a movie star she thought jetting off wherever you pleased whenever the mood struck and arriving almost before youd left dear god shed love it he knew she would i cant im sorry she was right and he knew it still he wanted to push there was an urgency inside him to put things back on an even keel no that was a lie to put things back he thought disgusted with himself to his advantage youre right its bad timing i can tell you i wish it wasnt a trip on the concorde and a whirl through new york city any other time id already be packing my bag she would no matter what it cost be cheerful be casual be the sophisticated woman he would understand so then when do you go go for a moment he was completely foolishly blank hed never intended to go without her boxed yourself in magee he realized and took a swig from her bottle when she brought it back to the table ill get the draft contract to you first and if youve got no problem with it have my people put the final together couple of days that way i can do what i have to do there and bring the papers back with me thats efficient yeah he set the bottle down it tasted foul my middle name let me know when youve made your plans she trailed a finger over the back of his hand ill give you a bon voyage that will hold you until your welcome back she was not cooperating trevor decided the woman was not following the rules here he brooded at his office table staring out into the stormtossed night when he should have been working why hadnt she asked him to postpone his trip a few days even a couple of weeks it would have provided the perfect opportunity to give in to her to show her he was willing to make concessions to keep her happy and why the hell hadnt he looked before hed leaped any moron would have known she wasnt able to leave home just now which only proved that love made a man less than a moron that was pathetic the lightning that shattered the sky in one blinding streak perfectly suited his mood edgy electric why hadnt he come clean with her well not clean trevor mused just more direct it would have been simpler and more productive to have told her he wanted to take her to new york winding business through it certainly but that would have put a different tone on the whole thing hed clutched before the first swing he admitted then boxed himself in when he started the whole conversation by announcing he was going now he either went without her or made excuses he hated making excuses thunder rumbled like laughter whipped by the howling wind and rain danced a frantic jig against his window the trouble was he didnt know how to play it and he always knew how to play it how to find the most constructive route through a problem to the solution but there were more obstacles more wrong turns in love than hed ever imagined still hed never come up against a wall he couldnt scale break through or tunnel under this wasnt going to be the first he needed to let the problem simmer to brew a bit until the solution came to him the best way to do that was to concentrate on something else he started with the faxes that had come in throughout the day since hed already read over the draft of darcys contract he put that in a folder the one thing that was clear he thought was this angle she was a hell of a find for celtic records and celtic would nurture her neither of them had to worry about this part of their relationship he wanted his parents to hear that voice a tape recording why hadnt he thought of that before hed get her voice on tape before he headed back to new york that would at least partly introduce the woman he loved to his family he would take the papers down to her at the pub once hed cleaned off his desk go over them with her answer her questions she was bound to have questions then hed tell her he needed a tape satisfied with the idea trevor set the folder down and turned to his other paperwork he thought about going downstairs and making more coffee foraging for a meal he didnt want to eat alone and that annoyed him it had never bothered him before the fact was he wanted to chuck even the idea of work and go down to the pub where there were people where there was darcy despite the risk of the storm he ran his email instead he knew he should shut the computer down but he had to do something to keep busy to stop himself from leaving the cottage for the pub it gave him perverse satisfaction to imagine her watching the door wondering if and when hed come through it he didnt care how stupid that made him it was the damn principle of the thing the business inquiries came first as was his habit he answered them printed out or saved what he wanted a record of then shifted over to personal posts one from his mother gave him his first smile in hours you dont call you dont write well not often enough i think ive convinced your father that what we need is a nice trip to ireland its taken very little convincing actually he misses you as much as i do and i think he wants to get his fingerprints on the theater i hope its progressing wellam sure it is under your hand hes already started shuffling work and schedules though he doesnt think i know it im doing the same if all goes well well come next month once our plans are finalized ill let you know all i assume youre well as you havent said otherwise and busy because you always are i hope youre taking some time for yourself you were working much too hard before you left punishing yourself because of sylvia i wont say any more on that as i can see youre getting that irritated look in your eye no i lied ill say one thing more give yourself a break trevor no one not even you can live up to your standards there im done i love you prepare for an invasion mom did he have an irritated look in his eye he studied the faint reflection of his face in the window and decided yes probably it was comforting and disconcerting to be understood quite that well he hit reply nag nag nag that he knew would make her laugh hurry and come over so you can nag me in person i miss that yes the theaters going well though we had to knock off early today hell of a storm blowing through im going to have to shut down in a minute i thought youd like to know ive chosen the name for it im calling it duachais its gaelic well you probably know that but i had to look up the spelling it means the roots of a place the traditions of it a very clever woman told me thats what i wanted in the theater she was right of course a name like thats going to give publicity nightmares no need to worry im taking time for myself its impossible to do otherwise here you just have to look to be well sucked into looking some more im about to sign darcy gallagher to a recording contract with celtic shes an amazing talent wait until you hear her give me a year and her voice her name her face will be everywhere its a hell of a face shes got ambition talent energy temperament brains and charm this is no shy colleen youll like her im in love with her is it supposed to make me feel like an idiot he stopped stared at his last line he hadnt meant to type that with a shake of his head he started to delete lightning burst like a bomb throwing hot blue light into the room he saw the thin crack snake down the window glass then thunder blasted in one eardeafening roar and the lights went out shit it was his first thought once his heart stopped screaming in his ears that one had probably fried his computer his own fault he knew better since the screen was as black as the rest of the world indicating his battery backup had failed he swore again and fumbled for the flashlight that hed set next to the machine he switched it on got nothing what the hell was this he wondered and gave it an irritated shake hed checked it before hed started to work and the beam had flashed on strong and bright more annoyed than concerned he got up felt his way to the spare bed worked up to the little table beside it and the matches and candles that were always there the next slash of lightning had him jolting spilling half the matches out of the box and cursing himself get a grip he muttered and nearly shuddered at the sound of his own voice coming out of the dark its not your first storm or your first blackout but there was something different here something that if hed wanted to be fanciful hed have called deliberate about the wind and rain and fierceness of it all as if the savagery was personal that was so ridiculous he laughed as he struck the match the little flame made him feel more in control he touched it to the wick of the candle a little breath of relief escaped as he picked up the candle intending to carry it with him to light more and in the next wild spurt of lightning he saw her carricks temper is up the candle flame shook as his hand jerked he had to be satisfied that he didnt drop it and set the cottage on fire storms often make people uneasy gwen smiled at him gently its nothing to be ashamed of he knows it too you can be sure of that and is indulging himself in a little tantrum just at the moment steadier trevor set the candle down it seems excessive hes a dramatic sort my carrick and hes suffering trevor waiting wears on the soul and when you can nearly see the end of the waiting its harder still i wonder could i ask you a question of a personal nature he shook his head it was all too strange and somehow eerily ordinary this talking to a ghost in a little cottage on a stormravaged night why not i hope it doesnt offend you but i cant help wondering what it is that stops you from telling the woman you love whats in your heart its not as simple as that i know thats your thinking a thread of urgency ran through her voice now though her hands stayed quiet and still folded together at her waist i want to know why it cant be just that simple if you dont lay groundwork you make mistakes the more important it is the more important not to make mistakes groundwork she asked confused and that would be what exactly with darcy its showing her what she can have the kind of life she could live by that youre meaning all the grand things the riches and wonders yes thats right once she sees he broke off seriously alarmed when the floor shook under his feet but before he could move gwen held up a hand i beg your pardon ive a temper of my own she kept her hand up closed her eyes when she opened them again they were dark and vibrant and what did carrick offer me but the same in his way jewels and riches a palace for a home and immortality can you not see the mistake in that a mistake that cost us both three times a hundred years darcys not like you oh trevor look closer why is it you can stand on the same ground and still not see each other she lowered her hand well this nights work isnt done youll go down to the village now theres a need for you there darcy panic pushed him forward is she all right oh aye shes fine and well but theres a need for you tis a night for wonders trevor magee go on now and be part of them he didnt hesitate shed hardly faded away when he was snatching up the candle to light his way out of the house and into the storm chapter nineteen the air was alive and angry it slapped and bit rain like thin needles of glass jabbed at his clothes and stabbed at exposed skin nasty marbles of hail beat down on grass battered the flowers and turned the ground into treachery and still the lightning slashed ripping open the sky so thunder could charge through in snarling bellows trevor was breathless and drenched before he got to the car the rational part of his mind warned him it was insane to venture out on such a night more sensible to wait out the storm than to drive into the snapping teeth of it but he was already turning the key in the ignition the wind howled like a banshee tore at the hedgerows so that bits of bloom and leaf flew past like crazed insects hed have sworn it had fists and fingers his headlights made twin slashes through the wall of rain spotlighting the full fury of it he fought the car down the road that was rapidly turning into a ditch of mud and when he shuddered around a bend the sky exploded etching the jagged burst of light on his eyes the freight train of thunder roared after it under it all quiet as grief was the sound of a womans desperate weeping he stomped on the gas fishtailed sickly around the next curve in the distance he saw a sprinkling of lights that was ardmore candle and lamplight in the houses some would have generators he realized the pub did darcy was fine tucked inside warm dry safe there was no reason to drive like a madman when there was nothing wrong but the sense of urgency the brutal need to hurry stayed with him with his hands clamped to the wheel he skidded around the turn at tower hill and his car stopped dead what the hell is this frantic infuriated he twisted the key pumped impatiently at the gas but all he got in return was a faint and mocking click swearing he punched open the glove compartment snatched out the flashlight he kept there and felt only grim satisfaction when the beam shot on with its next violent gust the wind nearly swept him off his feet as he climbed out of the car it seemed to want to pitting himself against it he fought his way to the gate muscled it open while the rain slashed and the hail pummeled he would just cut through save time the boggy ground sucked at his feet slowed him to a jog when he wanted needed to run flat out the stones of the dead speared up like teeth out of a kneehigh layer of fog that lay nowhere else carrick trevor thought in disgust and fury pulling out all the stops lightning burst again seemed to glow blue over the grave of the longdead john magee flowers trevor skidded to a halt panting and stared down at the carpet of flowers blooming like a rainbow the grass was bent and flattened by the force of the storm but those fragile petals were open and perfect the wind that shoved against him only fluttered them gently and no cold finger of fog touched them magic he thought then looked out toward the sea where he could see the whitetipped walls of waves rear and crash magic wasnt always bright and pretty tonight it was full of wrath he turned from the grave and rushed on he skidded slithering down the hill he rapped hard into the trunk of a tree that seemed to rise up out of nowhere pain pounded in his shoulder racing to match the pounding of his heart every time he lost his balance should have tumbled over the stony ground to the road below he managed to gain it again later he would think that that alone had been a miracle on solid ground once more he ran feet pounding against the wet footpath around yet one more turn he could see the pub now the warm welcoming glow of light against the window lungs burning he focused on that then something drew his gaze over and up a whisper under the wind a weeping he saw in the top window of the gallagher house a woman pale hair glowing against the dark green eyes watching him that was wrong he thought and she was gone as soon as he thought it against the glass was the faintest of light and no movement behind it wrong something was wrong so he turned away from the pub and pushed through the wind to the door of the house he shoved it open letting in wild wind and wilder rain before he could call out he saw jude sitting at the top of the stairs her face was sheet white her hair a tangle and the nightgown she wore damp with sweat thank god oh thank god i cant get down she let out a little gasp clutched her belly the baby the babys coming ruthlessly he shut down panic though he took the stairs two at a time to reach her grip her hand she squeezed it hard enough to grind bone breathe in and out come on look at me and breathe yes okay yes her eyes clung to his wide glazed with the pain that ripped through her as the contraction crested god oh god its huge i know i know honey keep breathing youre coming down the other side now yes its passing but i never expected its all so fast even as her breath gushed out in relief from the absence of that wicked pain she lifted a shaky hand to push at her hair i was having tea in bed i talked to aidan and told him i was going to bed and then the power went out and it all started at once well get you to the hospital everythings fine trevor its too late i wont make it panic wanted to flood back but he dammed it up before it could touch her this business usually takes a while how far apart are the contractions i havent timed the last few the phones are out i couldnt call the pub or the doctor i thought if i could get downstairs but i couldnt before they were close two minutes and now theyre coming faster and harder jesus sweet jesus christ did your water break yes its not supposed to happen so fast all the classes all the books it should take hours get aidan please get oh oh god here it comes he helped her through it voice calm and bracing as his mind raced much too close much too hard hed seen the process three times and that was enough to know jude was right she would never make the hospital lets get you into bed put your arms around my neck thats the way i need aidan she wanted badly to weep just to scream out with sobs i know im going to go get him you stay calm jude you just hold on he laid her in bed glanced around quickly shed managed to light several candles that would have to do when the next one comes breathe through it ill be right back ill be all right she lay her head back where hed propped pillows had to be everything in the world depended on it women used to do this all the time without doctors and hospitals she did her best to smile only damn it none of them were me hurry he didnt want to think how many contractions shed go through alone how frightened shed looked lying there alone in bed with only candles for light he didnt want to think of what could go wrong he sprinted back into the storm the wind had changed and was at his back pushing him faster shoving as if it too urged him to hurry still it seemed hed run miles before his hand closed over the knob of gallaghers pub he burst into the warmth the music and laughter darcy spun around beaming well now look what the storms blown in she got no farther than that before the look in his eye registered what is it are you hurt he shook his head gripped her shoulder while he turned to aidan its jude jude trevor had never seen the blood drain as completely as quickly from a mans face before what is it even as he asked aidan was throwing the passthrough up bulleting through the babys coming now ring the doctor aidan shouted and was out the door now trevor repeated to darcy its coming now theres no time for the doctor and the phones are out in any case oh mother of god then she bit back the spurt of fear lets hurry then jack jack brennanman the bar someone tell shawn and brenna tim riley will you go for mollie otoole shell know what to do leaving her jacket on the hook in her rush she scurried out into the rain how did you find her she was shouting but her voice was all but swept away by the wind drowned under the crashing of the waves against the seawall i was coming down the house was dark i thought something might be wrong no no i mean how is she is she holding up she was alone trevor would never forget the way shed looked or that hed had to leave her she was scared in pain fear skidded down darcys spine shes a tough one our jude frances shell come through it as for the rest of us well just have to figure out what to do darcy shoved at the hair plastered to her face as she rushed into the house you dont have to come up it must be hard on a man im coming jude sat up in bed her hands clutched in aidans as she panted his eyes were wild but his voice was crooning thats the way darling thats just fine nearly over now nearly done she collapsed back her face running with sweat theyre getting stronger shes having it here aidan got to his feet but kept his hand gripped on judes she says shes having it here she cant be having a baby here ive told her but she wont listen of course she can have it here darcy spoke cheerfully over the sick dread in her throat if aidan panicked she knew the desperate would become the impossible and wont that be cozy such a night youve picked jude frances for bringing the next gallagher into the world its a wild one as she spoke she moved to the side of the bed dried judes face with a corner of the sheet what to do what was she supposed to do god she couldnt think no she had to think now then you went to all those classes why dont you tell us what we should do first to be some help in this whole business i dont know it isnt supposed to be like this god im so thirsty ill get you some water ice trevor took a step forward she can have ice chips aidan shed probably be more comfortable if you got into bed behind her helped support her back shes better off sitting up a little i was my sisters backup coach during all three of her labors of course he thought that had been something of a lark all happening in a nice clean and cheerful birthing suite with his brotherinlaw manning the post and a doctor and nursemidwife in attendance there darcy smiled brightly a man with experience just what we need ill get you a cool damp cloth darling then some of those ice chips jude let out a gasp one hand flailing in the air grasping for darcys arm now its coming now no not yet plan priorities order trevor told himself and bracing flipped back the sheet its crowning he put everything out of his mind but what needed to be done dont push yet jude blow through it breathe aidan thats it darling pant he wrapped an arm around her ran his hand in circles on her rockhard belly hold on to it now and pant and youll slide right over the pain over it my ass with the contraction at its vicious peak jude reached back got a fistful of his hair and had his eyes bugging out what the hell do you know about it what the bloody hell do you know you jerk you can do better than that darcy urged and wondered if judes fingers would dig right down to the bone on her arm theres much better names to call him at such a time idiot moron ape bastard she shouted when the pain spiked all of those and more my darling he murmured still stroking im all of those and more there there its passing now if you could just let go of me hair and leave me what you havent torn out by the roots lets get busy time trevor thought was getting short he heard the crash of the front door the thunder of feet on the stairs and was grateful theyd have more hands shawn he shot out orders the minute shawn and brenna ran in the room get a fire going in here we need it warm brenna go down and get some ice chip some for jude to chew on find some good sharp scissors and cord darcy fresh sheets and towels while they scattered trevor looked down at jude im going to wash up my sister liked music during delivery said it soothed her we were going to have music playing trevor nodded sing he ordered aidan before he walked out of the room they worked smoothly together and fast within ten minutes the fire was blazing filling the room with light and heat outside the storm was screaming in a kind of wild triumph but there in that room voices were raised in song in bed jude leaned back against aidan trying to catch the breath the contractions robbed her of every ounce of will was focused on the child who was determined to be born such focus and purpose left no room for modesty she could only be grateful that trevor knelt at her feet between her updrawn knees i have to push i have to hold on a minute that was for himself bracing room you have to stop when i tell you so i can turn the baby the head and shoulders hed watched it he reminded himself fascinated by the process he could do it okay on the next contraction push and when i say stop pant and blow he wiped the sweat off his forehead with his forearm he took a breath let it out its starting i have to push he told her just as lightning flashed a million wild jewels of light and to trevors shock the baby shot out a slick bullet into his hands and already wailing wow he stared foolishly at the wriggling furious life that he held she was in a hurry its a girl he managed and looked up but his eyes met darcys and watched for the third time as she wept jude rocking aidan pressed his face against his wifes hair look at her just look shes beautiful i want words strangling in her throat jude held out her arms when trevor laid the baby over her belly and her hands touched her for the first time she laughed shes perfect isnt she perfect she already has hair look at her such lovely dark hair and a voice to match shawn came around the bed bent to brush a kiss over judes cheek shes your nose jude frances does she think youre right turning her head she met aidans mouth with hers thank you he managed no more than her name before he laid his head on her shoulder what do we call her darcy turned the cloth shed dampened again dabbed at judes face she wanted to collapse beside the bed lay her head on it and weep and laugh not yet she ordered herself not yet what name did you finally choose for her shes ailish jude stopped counting her daughters fingerslook how tiny how perfectto look down at trevor whats your mothers name trevor what he hadnt moved and now shook his head as if to clear it my mother shes carolyn her name is ailish carolyn gallagher and youll all be her godparents for a little while no one noticed the storm had gone silent it was the oddest sensation to find his legs weak when he went downstairs he felt full of energy of light so much so that he thought he could run ten miles without being winded but his legs were weak as water brenna and shawn were already back in the kitchen and had a glass of whiskey poured for him without a word he took it knocked it back thats fine but now youll have to have another brenna did the honors and poured with a generous hand for a toast to ailish carolyn gallagher they clinked glasses and he drank again forgetting his usual caution in the spirit of the event some night that it is shawn slapped his back god bless you trevor you were a champion no offense to trev but ill give jude the prize tonight i hope im half as sturdy when my time comes trevor raised his glass then caught the sparkling look that ran between them are you pregnant we just announced it tonight at the pub which is why ive tea in my glass instead of whiskey but you neednt worry as im not due till february and well be done with all but the fancy work on the theater we should have ours at home as well brenna it was lovely this way thats fine well do just that as soon as you figure out how to give birth either way trevor said congratulations he touched his glass to hers again and shawns just do me a favor and try not to work as fast as your sisterinlaw managing the whole business in under two hours is just a little too nervewracking with the loveliest of endings you did a fine job that you did shawn agreed now wed best get over to the pub spread the word if youre up for it come and join the celebration i can promise you wont buy another drink in gallaghers in your lifetime to trevors numb shock shawn took him by the shoulders and kissed him with great enthusiasm god bless you lets be off brenna trevor stood alone in the kitchen and laughed its a happy night darcy said as she stepped in shawn kissed me right on the mouth well then i cant be outdone by my own brother she leaped sent him staggering back and kissed him hard and long there now that should do it but the humor faded out of her eyes as they went soft as she laid her hand on his cheek youre a hero no dont shake your head at me we mightve fumbled through that without you but i dont like thinking of it you kept your head i wanted to run screaming me too she blinked at that hopped down is that the truth you looked so competent so calm laying down orders then taking charge like you delivered babies as a hobby every saturday i was terrified then youre even more of a hero it wasnt heroics it was stark terror and now he could admit it it was nothing like my sister all i had to do with her was be there hold her hand listen to her curse my brotherinlaw maybe breathe with her and theres doctors and monitors and stuff he said running down this was jesus this was primitive it was fantastic he finished off the rest of his whiskey nothing was the way it shouldve been the storm the power jude sprinting through labor like that nothing was the way it shouldve been yet it was all exactly right like it was meant all of us together this way in this house she touched a hand to his arm yes it was exactly right i feel i was part of a miracle tonight the baby our ailish she looked healthy didnt she she looked perfect dont worry youre right of course bellowing like that on the way out and already nursing what could be better and judes just glowing so lets have ourselves a toast to our perfect little miracle he eyed the whiskey bottle ive already had two with brenna and shawn and your point would be she asked as she got another glass and poured nothing dont know what i was thinking to our miracle then the newest gallagher slainte she brought the glass to her lips tipped her head back and swallowed in a way that made him feel obliged to do the same im going to make the new mother some tea then tidy up will you be at the pub ill wait for you here that would be lovely she turned to put the kettle on spied the pot staying warm under a cozy shawns beat me to this as well as to kisses sit down and take a load off she suggested as she arranged cups on a tray miracles aside delivering babies is an exhausting business youre telling me he started to sit when she went out then felt guilty he should go up make sure see if anything else was needed besides he couldnt sit he was too full of that brilliant wash of energy then he heard the front door open and darcys voice cheerfully greeting mollie otoole thank you jesus trevor thought fervently and for the first time in his life was thrilled to pass the reins of control into the hands of another hed wandered around the kitchen glanced out the dark window and was just thinking about making coffee if he could find it when aidan came in all but dancing theres the man of the hour this time trevor was braced but still didnt manage to evade the hearty kiss thats three for three he muttered im getting used to it hows jude shes glowing sitting up in bed pretty as you please and drinking tea while darcy cuddles the baby darcy kicked me out of the room aidan said as he got yet another glass said i was to come down here and drink like a new father so she could start her aunties privilege and spoil the baby auntie try as he might he couldnt visualize darcy as auntie mollie otooles fussing around and says shes staying the night theyve already got ailish dressed up in a little sleeping gown with lace on it she looks he trailed off just leaned forward and laid his palms on the counter christ christ what this does to a man my souls shaking i swear to you i never knew there was more to feel than ive already felt that i could love like this in a heartbeats time there she is not an hour old and id kill for her die for her when i think i might have missed them if fate hadnt opened the door for me trevor said nothing could say nothing ill owe you all of my life for this one night no i will if one day youre blessed with a child of your own youll know just how much is owed aidan shook himself turned back any more he thought and hed embarrass the man beyond redemption the irish are sentimental sorts lets have a drink here so i can get my legs back under me trevor figured that if the toasting kept up at this pace he would not only lose his legs hed fall on his face but he raised his glass with aidan to the new mother and then to the child by the time aidan went back up and darcy came back down he felt that he was watching a revolving door through the deep amber haze of jamesons and that seemed perfectly fine it only took one look at his face at the cheerful and decidedly sloppy grin that was as endearing as a boys the tousled hair and the loose body stretched out in the chair to clue her in since the look of him had her wanting to cuddle him just as shed cuddled her niece she walked over and patted his cheek sure and youre on your way to being pissfaced arent you darling i never drink more than two you lose focus of course you do and thats a fine and upstanding rule just begging to be broken on such a night it wouldve been rude not to toast the baby unforgivably are we toasting the baby again there was just enough sweet hope in his tone to make her chuckle i think its time we made our way over to the pub then well see about that lets get you to your feet you can lean on me i can stand up vaguely insulted he pushed back from the table the minute he was upright the room took one slow rather lovely spin whoa he put a hand out im all right just finding my balance well let me know when youve located it she glanced toward the bottle winced at the level she hadnt realized how much theyd gotten into the poor man between them weve abused you sorely and after all your heroics too gently she slipped an arm around his waist well go over and get you a meal i bet youd like something hot in your belly you ive already got you there and in my head every damn place aidan kissed me so its your turn well get to that by and by with her arm around his waist and his tucked companionably around her shoulders they staggered down the hall lets go see the baby im crazy about babies he tried to steer toward the steps as they passed but she kept him heading for the door are you now well what a revelation we will go see her in the morning ailish is sleeping now like an angel and god knows jude needs some rest she managed to open the door lead him out the fresh air swept over him like a wave made him sway man what a night i warn you if you pass out im letting you drop where you fall but even as she threatened she tightened her grip im not going to pass out i feel great the stars were out thousands of them sparkling winking gleaming against a sky of black glass there might never have been a storm listen you can hear the music from the pub he stopped bringing her closer to his side whats that song i know that one he concentrated until it swam clear in his mind then to darcys surprise and delight he began to sing standing in the sea breeze and starlight she joined him on the chorus adding harmony her eyes they shined like diamonds i thought her the queen of the land and her hair hung over her shoulders tied up with a black velvet band he grinned down at her shifting until he could get both arms around her it always makes me think of you under the present circumstances ill take that as a compliment i didnt know you could sing trevor magee and in such a fine strong voice what other surprises have you in store for me well get to that by and by so she laughed wiggled free enough to get him walking again ill count on it chapter twenty most of it was a blur faces voices movement he lost track of how many pints had been pushed into his hands how many times his back had been slapped he remembered being kissed repeatedly many had shed tears he was mortally afraid one of them had been himself thered been singinghe was pretty sure hed done a solo dancinghe vaguely remembered rounding the floor with his chief electrician a burly man with a tattoo at one point he thought hed made a speech sometime during the chaos darcy had pulled him into the kitchen poured some soup into him or stuck his head in the bowl he wasnt quite sure which but he recalled trying to wrestle her to the floor which wouldnt have been such a bad idea if shawn hadnt been in the room at the time and if he hadnt lost the bout to a woman he outweighed by a good fifty pounds jesus christ hed been stinking drunk it wasnt that hed never been drunk before hed gone to college for gods sake he knew how to get drunk and party if he wanted to the thing was this one had snuck up on him and he didnt enjoy being quite so hazy on the details of his behavior there was however one little item that came through clear waterfordcrystal clear darcy guiding him up to bed him stumbling and yes still singing an embarrassingly schmaltzy rendition of rose of tralee during which he stopped long enough to inform darcy that his mothers aunts cousins daughter had been the chicago rose in something once he was prone he made a suggestion that was so uncharacteristically lewd he imagined another woman would have kicked him back down the stairs but darcy had only laughed and remarked that men in his condition werent nearly as good at it as they thought they were and he should go on to sleep hed obliged her and saved himself what would have been certain humiliation by passing out but he was awake now in the full dark with approximately half the sand of ardmore bay in his mouth and the full cast of riverdance steptoeing inside his head he lay there hoping for oblivion when his wish wasnt granted he imagined the pleasure of sawing off his head and setting it aside to cure while the rest of him got some sleep but to do that hed need to find a damn saw wouldnt he deciding a bucket of aspirin was probably wiser he eased himself up every inch was a punishment but he managed to bite back a groan and keep at it until he could sit on the side of the bed through bleary eyes he stared at the glowing dial of the bedside clock three fortyfive well it just got better and better gingerly he turned his head and saw that darcy slept on peaceful and perfect bitter resentment mixed with the sand in his mouth how could the woman just sleep when a man was dying beside her had she no sensibility no compassion no goddamn hangover he had to fight the urge to give her one rude shove so misery could have company he gained his feet grinding his teeth when the room swam sickly his stomach suited up joined the other branches of his body in mutiny and churned queasily never again he vowed never again would he drink himself drunk he didnt care if he delivered triplets in a tornado the thought of that made him want to smile the wonder of holding that small raging life in his hands but all he could manage was a grimace as he hobbled toward the bathroom without thinking he switched the light on then heard the high whine that was his own gasping scream blind tortured he slapped at the switch came perilously close to whimpering when the blessed dark descended again he could only stand his back braced against the wall and try to get his breath back trevor darcys voice was low her hand gentle as she laid it on his arm are you all right oh im just dandy thanks and you the words ground out of a throat currently lined with heavygauge sandpaper ah poor darling well if you didnt have a head after last night you wouldnt be human come on then lie back down and let darcy fix you up perversely now that she was awake and prepared to soothe annoyance added to the ugly mix brewing inside him you and your horde of sadists fixed me up already oh it was terrible im so ashamed hed have narrowed his eyes into a glare but there was too much blood in them to risk it are you laughing of course i am she tugged his arm drawing him back into the bedroom but thats neither here nor there here we go now thats the way sit yourself down she was entirely too good at it he thought just how many drunken men had she tucked back into bed the morning after it was a vile thought an unworthy thought but even knowing that he couldnt stop it from taking root had a lot of practice at this something in his tone slapped but she shrugged it off because he was suffering you cant run a pub and not have the occasional experience with someone whos overindulged you need a bit of the cure is all if you think youre going to get more whiskey into me youre crazy no no ive something better than hair of the dog just rest yourself she fluffed pillows behind him gentle and efficient as a nurse itll take me a minute i should have made some up last night but with all the excitement i didnt think of it i just want a goddamn aspirin preferably one the size of pluto i know she touched her lips to his throbbing head ill be right back what game was this he wondered why was she being so nice so sweet hed awakened her at four in the morning and snarled at her why wasnt she snarling back why wasnt she suffering any effects of last nights celebration suspicious he forced himself to get up again and with his jaw clenched managed to tug on jeans he found her in the kitchen and once his abused eyes adjusted to the laser beam of light saw she was mixing ingredients in a jar you stayed sober she stopped what she was doing glanced back at him oh the man looked as raw and rough as they came and still managed to be handsome i did yes why it was clear even before we got to the pub that you were going to be drunk enough for both of us and you were entitled darling why dont you sit down theres no need to pay the piper any more than his due your head must be big as the moon this morning i dont make a habit of getting drunk he said it with some dignity but because he felt decidedly queasy he retreated to the living room to sit on the arm of a chair im sure you dont which was why she supposed he wasnt just feeling sick this morning but insulted as well it was adorable but it was a night for exceptions and you were having such a grand time too it was surely the best party weve had around here since shawn and brennas wedding and that went on all day and half the night she came out her robe flowing around her legs carrying some dark and suspiciouslooking liquid in a glass we had so much to celebrate after all jude and the baby then the theater what about the theater the naming of it oh that likely washed away in the beer didnt it you announced the naming of the theater duachais i was never so pleased trevor and those in the pub which by the time we closed was everyone and their brother were just as delighted its a fine name the right name and it means something to all of us here it annoyed him that he couldnt get a handle on the moment that hed announced it when he hadnt been in control where was the dignity in that you thought of it i told you the word you put it in the right place here now wash the aspirin down with this and youll be right as rain in no time what is it gallaghers fix a little potion passed down in my family come on now theres a good lad he scowled at her plucked the aspirin out of her outstretched hand then the glass she looked gorgeous rested perfect with her hair loose and glossy her eyes clear and amused her lips slightly curved in what might have been sympathy he wanted desperately to lay his aching head on her lovely breasts and die quietly i dont like it oh now its not such a bad taste all in all no with nothing else available he drank glared i dont like the whole deal this need he thought as she patiently waited for him to drink the rest it was too big too sharp even now when he felt as vile as a man could and still live he was all but eaten up with need for her it was humiliating thanks he shoved the glass back at her youre very welcome a little twist of temper snaked through her but she cut it off reminding herself he deserved a bit of patience and pampering hed brought her niece into the world and for that she would owe him for a lifetime hed named his theater from a word shed given him that was an honor she wouldnt slight by snapping at him when he was laid low so she sucked it in and prepared to spoil him a bit ill tell you what you need now and thats a good hot breakfast to set you right and your coffee so ill be your loving mother and see to it for you she started back toward the kitchen stopped shook her head for heavens sake wheres my mind speaking of mothers yours called to the pub last night what my mother it was when you were outside serenading the duffys on their way home shawn spoke with her and she said just to give you a message hed gotten to his feet nothings wrong no not at all shawn said she sounded very pleased and happy and added a congratulations for ailish in any case she said to tell you yes of course its supposed to and that she couldnt be more delighted she asked that you call her back today so you can tell her all about it supposed to what all about what i couldnt say she moved back into the kitchen her voice carrying through the opening i dont know what shes he broke off staggered and braced himself with a hand to the back of a chair im in love with her is it supposed to make me feel like an idiot but he hadnt sent that post hed been about to delete that part when the power had gone out the laptop had died he had never hit send it wasnt possible for her to have gotten a message hed never sent then he rubbed his hands over his face hadnt he already learned the impossible was almost the ordinary here now what his mother was delighted that he felt like an idiot that was good he decided pacing restlessly now because he was feeling more like one every minute the woman in the next room was making him weak and senseless and stupid and part of him was thrilled knowing he could be weakly and senselessly and stupidly in love that worried him he stopped to stare at the painting of the mermaid and felt his temper strain and who was he in love with who the hell was she really how much of her was the siren depicted here and how much the affectionate woman fixing breakfast maybe it was all a spell some sort of selfserving magic woven over him that had taken his own emotions out of his control to satisfy someone elsessomething elses needs maybe she knew it duachais the lore of a place he thought grimly darcy knew the lore of this place gwen had been offered jewels from the sun and moon and sea and had refused them what had darcy said when hed asked her if she would trade her pride for jewels that shed find a way to keep both hed lay odds on it she had kept this painting hadnt she kept it hung it on her wall long after shed shown the artist the door ive no breakfast meats up here darcy said as she came out so ill have to go down and pilfer from shawn would you like bacon or sausage or have you room for both did you sleep with him it was out stinging the air before he could stop it what the artist the one who painted this trevor turned faced his own senseless outrage did you sleep with him she took a moment to try to think over the wild beat of blood in her head youre trying my patience trevor and im not known for it to begin with so ill only say thats none of your concern of course it wasnt the hell it isnt was he in love with you did you enjoy that being that fantasy for him before you sent him on his way she wouldnt let it hurt it wouldnt be permitted so she concentrated on the bright fury in trevors eyes and let her own rise to meet it thats a fine opinion you have of me and not so far from the mark ive had men and make no excuses for it ive taken what suited me and so what he jabbed his hands into his pockets and what suits you darcy you did for a time but we seem to be at the end of that take yourself off trevor before each of us says something that makes it impossible for us to deal with one another again deal she was a cool one wasnt she cool and composed while he wanted to rage theres always the deal isnt there contracts and payments and benefits you keep your eyes on the prize she went white her eyes a blazing blue in contrast get out get out of my house i dont take a man to my bed who looks at me and sees a whore her words slapped him back to sense and to shame i never meant that i never thought that didnt you get out you bastard she began to shake and before you go ill tell you this jude painted that for me for my birthday she whirled around strode into the bedroom darcy wait he managed to block the door before it slammed in his face im sorry listen that was as far as he got before whatever she threw shattered against the door an inch from his face jesus i said get out of my house she wasnt pale now she was flushed with rage and already grabbing for a pretty china trinket box he had an instant to decideadvance or retreat an instant too long as the box bounced smartly off his shoulder before he could reach her im sorry he said again gripping her arms before she could select the next missile i was out of line completely wrong no excuse please listen to me let go of me trevor throw anything you want but then listen to me please she was vibrating like a bow sharply plucked why should i no reason listen anyway all right but let me go and step back i dont want you touching me now his hands flexed on her arms a jerk of reaction then he nodded released her hed deserved that he told himself that and worse because he was afraid she intended to give him worse to turn him out of her life he was prepared to beg ive never been jealous before believe me i dont like it any more than you do its contemptible youve had women before me do i throw them in your face and cheapen you that way no hed cut deep he realized and they were both bleeding i had no right and no reason i wasnt thinking about the painting really my feelings for you are out of control so im out of control her eyes shocked stared back at his when he stroked her hair they make me stupid her heart began to thud ive thought of no man but you since we met is that enough for you it should be he dropped his hand but its not he paced away back away plans and schedules were out of the picture now he decided it was time to act i need something more than that from you and im willing to give you whatever you want the rapid beating of her heart skipped in a quick stab of pain what do you mean i want lets say exclusive rights for that for you he added turning back to her you can name it ive got an apartment in new york if it doesnt suit you well find another personally and through the company i have several homes in a number of countries if you like i can buy property here build a house to your specifications whatever travelings required between us i assume youd want a base here i see her voice was quiet her eyes lowered thats considerate of you and would i also have access to bank accounts credit cards that sort of thing his hands went back in his pockets balled into fists of course and for all this she traced a finger over the bracelet shed worn since hed first clasped it on her wrist that shed loved first for its beauty and then simply because hed given it to her i would in turn keep myself only for you thats one way of putting it but i he never saw it coming the little belleek vase smacked dead between his eyes through the stars wheeling in front of him he saw her face pale again rigid with outrage you lowlying sonofatoad whats the difference between a whore and a mistress but the type of payment mistress with shock he touched his forehead stared at the blood on his fingers then he was dodging crockery who saidcut it out you miserable worm you badger she sent all the pretty things shed collected over the years crashing i wouldnt have you on the silver platter you were born on so take all your fancy houses and your bank drafts and your credit line and stuff them choke on them tears spoiled her aim but the ricochets and flying debris were awesome trevor blocked the lamp shed yanked out of the wall stepped on glass swore i dont want a mistress go to hell it was the best she had left and knowing it she snatched up a small carved box and ran out with it for gods sake he had to sit down on the bed to pick the glass out of his feet he had the hideous notion she might be getting a knife or some other sharp implement then his head snapped up when he heard the door slam darcy damn it leaping up leaving blood smeared on the floor he rushed after her he supposed he could have handled it all with less finesse if hed been a gibbering ape he streaked down the stairs swore again when he heard the boom of the pub door crashing shut for christs sake here they were neither of them dressed and where does she take the crisis but outside a sensible man would run in the opposite direction trevor bolted through the kitchen after her she let the box fly as she ran and closed her fist tight on the stone shed kept inside it wishes be damned she thought in fury love be damned trevor be damned she was throwing it and all it meant into the sea shed have no part of it now no part of hopes and dreams and promises if loving meant burying everything she was for a man who had such contempt for her she would have no part of that either hair flying she raced along the seawall under a sky softening toward dawn she didnt hear her own sobbing over the pulse and pump of the sea nor trevors call and the sudden frantic plea in it she stumbled onto the beach would have fallen if he hadnt caught her darcy wait dont his arms shook as they wrapped around her hed thought shed meant to plunge into the water she turned on him like a wildcat kicking scratching biting in shock as much as defense he pulled her down to the sand where he could lie on top of her and hold her still a hangover he discovered was nothing compared to the pain inflicted by darcy gallagher in a temper easy he panted it out just take it easy ill kill you first chance i believe it he looked down at her her face was streaked with tears and they continued to fall though her eyes were burning with fury here he thought was the first time hed seen her weep for herself and hed caused it i deserve it for fumbling this so badly darcy i wasnt asking you to be my mistresswhich is a ridiculous term and completely unsuitable when applied to you i was trying to ask you to marry me he knocked the breath out of her as surely as if hed rammed his elbow into her belly what i was asking you to marry me marry as in husband and wife rings on our fingers till death do us part thats the one he risked a smile darcy i will you get off me youre hurting me sorry he rolled aside helped her up if i could just start over oh no lets pick up where you left off when you were offering me houses and bank accounts thats how you chose to propose to the likes of me her voice was like sugar with each crystal honed like a razor ah you think id marry you for what you have for what you can give me she shoved him back two full steps you think you can buy me like one of your companies but youve said i dont care what ive said any moron would see it was just talk if they took the time to listen to look ill tell you what you can do with your fine houses and your big accounts magee you can burn them to the ground for all i care ill buy the fucking torch and light it you made it clear i made nothing clear as nothing was clear to me but now i will id have taken you with nothing now ill take you not at all she turned flung back her arm it was blind instinct that made him grab her pry her fingers open what is this its mine given to me by carrick sapphire she jerked away from him as her voice began to hitch again the heart of the sea i could wish on it he told me one wish only for my hearts desire but i didnt use it and never will do you know why no dont cry any more i cant stand it do you know why her voice rose thick with tears no i dont know why i wanted you to love me without it that was my wish so how could i use it and have it come true magic he thought hed worried about magic and shed held it in her hand hed offered her things and shed wanted him enough to have thrown the fortune hed let himself believe she desired most back into the heart of the sea i did love you without it i do he took her hand again closed her fingers over the stone dont throw it away dont throw us away because ive been stupid i swear to you ive never handled anything as badly as ive handled this let me fix it im tired she closed her eyes and turned to face the sea im just so tired a long time agoit seems like a long timewhen i told you i couldnt fall in love i meant it i believed it there was no one there was never any magic with anyone else she stared down at the gem in her hand i didnt use it you didnt have to you just had to be i havent been the same since i met you i tried to compensate for that stay in control stay focused i didnt come here looking for you darcy looking for this thats what i told myself i was wrong and i knew it somehow ive always been looking for you always been looking for this do you think im so hard so small of heart that i cant love where there isnt gain i think there are countless parts to you every time i see a new one im more in love with you i wanted you to belong to me and it was easier to believe i could hold on to you by offering you things through the weariness was just enough shame to make her honest thats what i wanted once before you whatever either of us wanted once doesnt count now no nothing had to count but this if they wished it so she turned to him do you mean it i mean it then so will i more than anything right now i want you to look at me and tell me you love me she shivered in the wind crossed her arms over her breasts gazed out to sea it was the moment she thought when her life changed when dreams trembled when spells were cast and broken damn it darcy his impatient voice shattered her romantic images do you want me to crawl she looked at him then the beginnings of amusement lighting eyes still damp from tears yes he opened his mouth was on the verge of dropping literally and metaphorically to his knees and that he decided would just put the cap on everything else hed suffered that morning no damned if i will her heart simply soared after one wild laugh she threw herself into his arms there now theres the arrogant bastard i love she pressed her lips to his warm and welcoming theres my hearts desire say it once he murmured against her mouth without swearing at me i love you just exactly as you are she drew back made a sympathetic sound oh no look at that youre bleeding tell me about it well ill bandage you up in a bit of a while but i want you to ask me again and ask me proper here between the moon and the sun and the sea before the light breaks through to morning theres magic here trevor and i want our slice of it he felt it as she did the trembling edge of power just held in check he had no ring to give her no symbol to seal the moment then he remembered the silver disk and slipped the chain over his head over hers she remembered the words that had come as in a dream forever love a charm he said a promise marry me darcy make a life with me make a home and children with me i will and gladly here she pressed the stone into his hand a charm and a promise you humble me no never that she brushed her fingers over his cheek id take you trevor prince or pauper but loving me youll understand im pleased youre more in line with the prince youre perfect for me i am indeed she sighed laid her head on his shoulder when he drew her close do you hear it she murmured over the beat of the sea yeah i hear it music full of joy and celebration the lilt of pipes the herald of trumpets look darcy he touched her hair over the water she turned her head stayed in the circle of his arms and watched as the sun broke through in the east shimmered its light over the sea turning the sky to the polished glow of seashells the white horse flew with a flash of wing on his back rode carrick his silver doublet aglint his dark hair swirling in his arms her head on his heart rode his lady her eyes of misty green bright with love up they rose a triumphant sweep of motion over green hills shimmering with dew and in their wake left a rainbow that glimmered like jewels theyre together at last darcy whispered and happily now ever after the spells broken that one is this one he turned her face back to his its just getting started can you handle ever after darcy that i can trevor magee she kissed him sealed the vow i can handle it and you while the sun strengthened they walked away from the sea the music drifted into the hush of dawn under a rainbow that arched from beginnings to ever afters the end
