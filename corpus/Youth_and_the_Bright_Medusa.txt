reprinted from the authors first book of stories entitled the troll garden published in coming aphrodite i don hedger had lived for four years on the top floor of an old house on the south side of washington square and nobody had ever disturbed him he occupied one big room with no outside exposure except on the north where he had built in a manypaned studio window that looked upon a court and upon the roofs and walls of other buildings his room was very cheerless since he never got a ray of direct sunlight the south corners were always in shadow in one of the corners was a clothes closet built against the partition in another a wide divan serving as a seat by day and a bed by night in the front corner the one farther from the window was a sink and a table with two gas burners where he sometimes cooked his food there too in the perpetual dusk was the dogs bed and often a bone or two for his comfort the dog was a boston bull terrier and hedger explained his surly disposition by the fact that he had been bred to the point where it told on his nerves his name was caesar iii and he had taken prizes at very exclusive dog shows when he and his master went out to prowl about university place or to promenade along west street caesar iii was invariably fresh and shining his pink skin showed through his mottled coat which glistened as if it had just been rubbed with olive oil and he wore a brassstudded collar bought at the smartest saddlers hedger as often as not was hunched up in an old striped blanket coat with a shapeless felt hat pulled over his bushy hair wearing black shoes that had become grey or brown ones that had become black and he never put on gloves unless the day was biting cold early in may hedger learned that he was to have a new neighbour in the rear apartment two rooms one large and one small that faced the west his studio was shut off from the larger of these rooms by double doors which though they were fairly tight left him a good deal at the mercy of the occupant the rooms had been leased long before he came there by a trained nurse who considered herself knowing in old furniture she went to auction sales and bought up mahogany and dirty brass and stored it away here where she meant to live when she retired from nursing meanwhile she sublet her rooms with their precious furniture to young people who came to new york to write or to paint who proposed to live by the sweat of the brow rather than of the hand and who desired artistic surroundings when hedger first moved in these rooms were occupied by a young man who tried to write plays and who kept on trying until a week ago when the nurse had put him out for unpaid rent a few days after the playwright left hedger heard an ominous murmur of voices through the bolted double doors the ladylike intonation of the nurse doubtless exhibiting her treasures and another voice also a womans but very different young fresh unguarded confident all the same it would be very annoying to have a woman in there the only bathroom on the floor was at the top of the stairs in the front hall and he would always be running into her as he came or went from his bath he would have to be more careful to see that caesar didnt leave bones about the hall too and she might object when he cooked steak and onions on his gas burner as soon as the talking ceased and the women left he forgot them he was absorbed in a study of paradise fish at the aquarium staring out at people through the glass and green water of their tank it was a highly gratifying idea the incommunicability of one stratum of animal life with another though hedger pretended it was only an experiment in unusual lighting when he heard trunks knocking against the sides of the narrow hall then he realized that she was moving in at once toward noon groans and deep gasps and the creaking of ropes made him aware that a piano was arriving after the tramp of the movers died away down the stairs somebody touched off a few scales and chords on the instrument and then there was peace presently he heard her lock her door and go down the hall humming something going out to lunch probably he stuck his brushes in a can of turpentine and put on his hat not stopping to wash his hands caesar was smelling along the crack under the bolted doors his bony tail stuck out hard as a hickory withe and the hair was standing up about his elegant collar hedger encouraged him come along caesar youll soon get used to a new smell in the hall stood an enormous trunk behind the ladder that led to the roof just opposite hedgers door the dog flew at it with a growl of hurt amazement they went down three flights of stairs and out into the brilliant may afternoon behind the square hedger and his dog descended into a basement oyster house where there were no tablecloths on the tables and no handles on the coffee cups and the floor was covered with sawdust and caesar was always welcome not that he needed any such precautionary flooring all the carpets of persia would have been safe for him hedger ordered steak and onions absentmindedly not realizing why he had an apprehension that this dish might be less readily at hand hereafter while he ate caesar sat beside his chair gravely disturbing the sawdust with his tail after lunch hedger strolled about the square for the dogs health and watched the stages pull out that was almost the very last summer of the old horse stages on fifth avenue the fountain had but lately begun operations for the season and was throwing up a mist of rainbow water which now and then blew south and sprayed a bunch of italian babies that were being supported on the outer rim by older very little older brothers and sisters plump robins were hopping about on the soil the grass was newly cut and blindingly green looking up the avenue through the arch one could see the young poplars with their bright sticky leaves and the brevoort glistening in its spring coat of paint and shining horses and carriages occasionally an automobile misshapen and sullen like an ugly threat in a stream of things that were bright and beautiful and alive while caesar and his master were standing by the fountain a girl approached them crossing the square hedger noticed her because she wore a lavender cloth suit and carried in her arms a big bunch of fresh lilacs he saw that she was young and handsome beautiful in fact with a splendid figure and good action she too paused by the fountain and looked back through the arch up the avenue she smiled rather patronizingly as she looked and at the same time seemed delighted her slowly curving upper lip and halfclosed eyes seemed to say youre gay youre exciting you are quite the right sort of thing but youre none too fine for me in the moment she tarried caesar stealthily approached her and sniffed at the hem of her lavender skirt then when she went south like an arrow he ran back to his master and lifted a face full of emotion and alarm his lower lip twitching under his sharp white teeth and his hazel eyes pointed with a very definite discovery he stood thus motionless while hedger watched the lavender girl go up the steps and through the door of the house in which he lived youre right my boy its she she might be worse looking you know when they mounted to the studio the new lodgers door at the back of the hall was a little ajar and hedger caught the warm perfume of lilacs just brought in out of the sun he was used to the musty smell of the old hall carpet the nurselessee had once knocked at his studio door and complained that caesar must be somewhat responsible for the particular flavour of that mustiness and hedger had never spoken to her since he was used to the old smell and he preferred it to that of the lilacs and so did his companion whose nose was so much more discriminating hedger shut his door vehemently and fell to work most young men who dwell in obscure studios in new york have had a beginning come out of something have somewhere a home town a family a paternal roof but don hedger had no such background he was a foundling and had grown up in a school for homeless boys where booklearning was a negligible part of the curriculum when he was sixteen a catholic priest took him to greensburg pennsylvania to keep house for him the priest did something to fill in the large gaps in the boys education taught him to like don quixote and the golden legend and encouraged him to mess with paints and crayons in his room up under the slope of the mansard when don wanted to go to new york to study at the art league the priest got him a night job as packer in one of the big department stores since then hedger had taken care of himself that was his only responsibility he was singularly unencumbered had no family duties no social ties no obligations toward any one but his landlord since he travelled light he had travelled rather far he had got over a good deal of the earths surface in spite of the fact that he never in his life had more than three hundred dollars ahead at any one time and he had already outlived a succession of convictions and revelations about his art though he was now but twentysix years old he had twice been on the verge of becoming a marketable product once through some studies of new york streets he did for a magazine and once through a collection of pastels he brought home from new mexico which remington then at the height of his popularity happened to see and generously tried to push but on both occasions hedger decided that this was something he didnt wish to carry further simply the old thing over again and got nowhere so he took enquiring dealers experiments in a later manner that made them put him out of the shop when he ran short of money he could always get any amount of commercial work he was an expert draughtsman and worked with lightning speed the rest of his time he spent in groping his way from one kind of painting into another or travelling about without luggage like a tramp and he was chiefly occupied with getting rid of ideas he had once thought very fine hedgers circumstances since he had moved to washington square were affluent compared to anything he had ever known before he was now able to pay advance rent and turn the key on his studio when he went away for four months at a stretch it didnt occur to him to wish to be richer than this to be sure he did without a great many things other people think necessary but he didnt miss them because he had never had them he belonged to no clubs visited no houses had no studio friends and he ate his dinner alone in some decent little restaurant even on christmas and new years for days together he talked to nobody but his dog and the janitress and the lame oysterman after he shut the door and settled down to his paradise fish on that first tuesday in may hedger forgot all about his new neighbour when the light failed he took caesar out for a walk on the way home he did his marketing on west houston street with a oneeyed italian woman who always cheated him after he had cooked his beans and scallopini and drunk half a bottle of chianti he put his dishes in the sink and went up on the roof to smoke he was the only person in the house who ever went to the roof and he had a secret understanding with the janitress about it he was to have the privilege of the roof as she said if he opened the heavy trapdoor on sunny days to air out the upper hall and was watchful to close it when rain threatened mrs foley was fat and dirty and hated to climb stairs besides the roof was reached by a perpendicular iron ladder definitely inaccessible to a woman of her bulk and the iron door at the top of it was too heavy for any but hedgers strong arm to lift hedger was not above medium height but he practised with weights and dumbbells and in the shoulders he was as strong as a gorilla so hedger had the roof to himself he and caesar often slept up there on hot nights rolled in blankets he had brought home from arizona he mounted with caesar under his left arm the dog had never learned to climb a perpendicular ladder and never did he feel so much his masters greatness and his own dependence upon him as when he crept under his arm for this perilous ascent up there was even gravel to scratch in and a dog could do whatever he liked so long as he did not bark it was a kind of heaven which no one was strong enough to reach but his great paintsmelling master on this blue may night there was a slender girlish looking young moon in the west playing with a whole company of silver stars now and then one of them darted away from the group and shot off into the gauzy blue with a soft little trail of light like laughter hedger and his dog were delighted when a star did this they were quite lost in watching the glittering game when they were suddenly diverted by a sound not from the stars though it was music it was not the prologue to pagliacci which rose ever and anon on hot evenings from an italian tenement on thompson street with the gasps of the corpulent baritone who got behind it nor was it the hurdygurdy man who often played at the corner in the balmy twilight no this was a womans voice singing the tempestuous overlapping phrases of signor puccini then comparatively new in the world but already so popular that even hedger recognized his unmistakable gusts of breath he looked about over the roofs all was blue and still with the wellbuilt chimneys that were never used now standing up dark and mournful he moved softly toward the yellow quadrangle where the gas from the hall shone up through the halflifted trapdoor oh yes it came up through the hole like a strong draught a big beautiful voice and it sounded rather like a professionals a piano had arrived in the morning hedger remembered this might be a very great nuisance it would be pleasant enough to listen to if you could turn it on and off as you wished but you couldnt caesar with the gas light shining on his collar and his ugly but sensitive face panted and looked up for information hedger put down a reassuring hand i dont know we cant tell yet it may not be so bad he stayed on the roof until all was still below and finally descended with quite a new feeling about his neighbour her voice like her figure inspired respect if one did not choose to call it admiration her door was shut the transom was dark nothing remained of her but the obtrusive trunk unrightfully taking up room in the narrow hall ii for two days hedger didnt see her he was painting eight hours a day just then and only went out to hunt for food he noticed that she practised scales and exercises for about an hour in the morning then she locked her door went humming down the hall and left him in peace he heard her getting her coffee ready at about the same time he got his earlier still she passed his room on her way to her bath in the evening she sometimes sang but on the whole she didnt bother him when he was working well he did not notice anything much the morning paper lay before his door until he reached out for his milk bottle then he kicked the sheet inside and it lay on the floor until evening sometimes he read it and sometimes he did not he forgot there was anything of importance going on in the world outside of his third floor studio nobody had ever taught him that he ought to be interested in other people in the pittsburgh steel strike in the fresh air fund in the scandal about the babies hospital a grey wolf living in a wyoming canyon would hardly have been less concerned about these things than was don hedger one morning he was coming out of the bathroom at the front end of the hall having just given caesar his bath and rubbed him into a glow with a heavy towel before the door lying in wait for him as it were stood a tall figure in a flowing blue silk dressing gown that fell away from her marble arms in her hands she carried various accessories of the bath i wish she said distinctly standing in his way i wish you wouldnt wash your dog in the tub i never heard of such a thing ive found his hair in the tub and ive smelled a doggy smell and now ive caught you at it its an outrage hedger was badly frightened she was so tall and positive and was fairly blazing with beauty and anger he stood blinking holding on to his sponge and dogsoap feeling that he ought to bow very low to her but what he actually said was nobody has ever objected before i always wash the tub and anyhow hes cleaner than most people cleaner than me her eyebrows went up her white arms and neck and her fragrant person seemed to scream at him like a band of outraged nymphs something flashed through his mind about a man who was turned into a dog or was pursued by dogs because he unwittingly intruded upon the bath of beauty no i didnt mean that he muttered turning scarlet under the bluish stubble of his muscular jaws but i know hes cleaner than i am that i dont doubt her voice sounded like a soft shivering of crystal and with a smile of pity she drew the folds of her voluminous blue robe close about her and allowed the wretched man to pass even caesar was frightened he darted like a streak down the hall through the door and to his own bed in the corner among the bones hedger stood still in the doorway listening to indignant sniffs and coughs and a great swishing of water about the sides of the tub he had washed it but as he had washed it with caesars sponge it was quite possible that a few bristles remained the dog was shedding now the playwright had never objected nor had the jovial illustrator who occupied the front apartment but he as he admitted was usually pyeeyed when he wasnt in buffalo he went home to buffalo sometimes to rest his nerves it had never occurred to hedger that any one would mind using the tub after caesar but then he had never seen a beautiful girl caparisoned for the bath before as soon as he beheld her standing there he realized the unfitness of it for that matter she ought not to step into a tub that any other mortal had bathed in the illustrator was sloppy and left cigarette ends on the moulding all morning as he worked he was gnawed by a spiteful desire to get back at her it rankled that he had been so vanquished by her disdain when he heard her locking her door to go out for lunch he stepped quickly into the hall in his messy painting coat and addressed her i dont wish to be exigent miss he had certain grand words that he used upon occasion but if this is your trunk its rather in the way here oh very well she exclaimed carelessly dropping her keys into her handbag ill have it moved when i can get a man to do it and she went down the hall with her free roving stride her name hedger discovered from her letters which the postman left on the table in the lower hall was eden bower iii in the closet that was built against the partition separating his room from miss bowers hedger kept all his wearing apparel some of it on hooks and hangers some of it on the floor when he opened his closet door nowadays little dustcoloured insects flew out on downy wing and he suspected that a brood of moths were hatching in his winter overcoat mrs foley the janitress told him to bring down all his heavy clothes and she would give them a beating and hang them in the court the closet was in such disorder that he shunned the encounter but one hot afternoon he set himself to the task first he threw out a pile of forgotten laundry and tied it up in a sheet the bundle stood as high as his middle when he had knotted the corners then he got his shoes and overshoes together when he took his overcoat from its place against the partition a long ray of yellow light shot across the dark enclosure a knot hole evidently in the high wainscoating of the west room he had never noticed it before and without realizing what he was doing he stooped and squinted through it yonder in a pool of sunlight stood his new neighbour wholly unclad doing exercises of some sort before a long gilt mirror hedger did not happen to think how unpardonable it was of him to watch her nudity was not improper to any one who had worked so much from the figure and he continued to look simply because he had never seen a womans body so beautiful as this one positively glorious in action as she swung her arms and changed from one pivot of motion to another muscular energy seemed to flow through her from her toes to her fingertips the soft flush of exercise and the gold of afternoon sun played over her flesh together enveloped her in a luminous mist which as she turned and twisted made now an arm now a shoulder now a thigh dissolve in pure light and instantly recover its outline with the next gesture hedgers fingers curved as if he were holding a crayon mentally he was doing the whole figure in a single running line and the charcoal seemed to explode in his hand at the point where the energy of each gesture was discharged into the whirling disc of light from a foot or shoulder from the upthrust chin or the lifted breasts he could not have told whether he watched her for six minutes or sixteen when her gymnastics were over she paused to catch up a lock of hair that had come down and examined with solicitude a little reddish mole that grew under her left armpit then with her hand on her hip she walked unconcernedly across the room and disappeared through the door into her bedchamber disappeared don hedger was crouching on his knees staring at the golden shower which poured in through the west windows at the lake of gold sleeping on the faded turkish carpet the spot was enchanted a vision out of alexandria out of the remote pagan past had bathed itself there in helianthine fire when he crawled out of his closet he stood blinking at the grey sheet stuffed with laundry not knowing what had happened to him he felt a little sick as he contemplated the bundle everything here was different he hated the disorder of the place the grey prison light his old shoes and himself and all his slovenly habits the black calico curtains that ran on wires over his big window were white with dust there were three greasy frying pans in the sink and the sink itself he felt desperate he couldnt stand this another minute he took up an armful of winter clothes and ran down four flights into the basement mrs foley he began i want my room cleaned this afternoon thoroughly cleaned can you get a woman for me right away is it company youre having the fat dirty janitress enquired mrs foley was the widow of a useful tammany man and she owned real estate in flatbush she was huge and soft as a feather bed her face and arms were permanently coated with dust grained like wood where the sweat had trickled yes company thats it well this is a queer time of the day to be asking for a cleaning woman its likely i can get you old lizzie if shes not drunk ill send willy round to see willy the son of fourteen roused from the stupor and stain of his fifth box of cigarettes by the gleam of a quarter went out in five minutes he returned with old lizzie she smelling strong of spirits and wearing several jackets which she had put on one over the other and a number of skirts long and short which made her resemble an animated dishclout she had of course to borrow her equipment from mrs foley and toiled up the long flights dragging mop and pail and broom she told hedger to be of good cheer for he had got the right woman for the job and showed him a great leather strap she wore about her wrist to prevent dislocation of tendons she swished about the place scattering dust and splashing soapsuds while he watched her in nervous despair he stood over lizzie and made her scour the sink directing her roughly then paid her and got rid of her shutting the door on his failure he hurried off with his dog to lose himself among the stevedores and dock labourers on west street a strange chapter began for don hedger day after day at that hour in the afternoon the hour before his neighbour dressed for dinner he crouched down in his closet to watch her go through her mysterious exercises it did not occur to him that his conduct was detestable there was nothing shy or retreating about this unclad girl a bold body studying itself quite coolly and evidently well pleased with itself doing all this for a purpose hedger scarcely regarded his action as conduct at all it was something that had happened to him more than once he went out and tried to stay away for the whole afternoon but at about five oclock he was sure to find himself among his old shoes in the dark the pull of that aperture was stronger than his will and he had always considered his will the strongest thing about him when she threw herself upon the divan and lay resting he still stared holding his breath his nerves were so on edge that a sudden noise made him start and brought out the sweat on his forehead the dog would come and tug at his sleeve knowing that something was wrong with his master if he attempted a mournful whine those strong hands closed about his throat when hedger came slinking out of his closet he sat down on the edge of the couch sat for hours without moving he was not painting at all now this thing whatever it was drank him up as ideas had sometimes done and he sank into a stupor of idleness as deep and dark as the stupor of work he could not understand it he was no boy he had worked from models for years and a womans body was no mystery to him yet now he did nothing but sit and think about one he slept very little and with the first light of morning he awoke as completely possessed by this woman as if he had been with her all the night before the unconscious operations of life went on in him only to perpetuate this excitement his brain held but one image now vibrated burned with it it was a heathenish feeling without friendliness almost without tenderness women had come and gone in hedgers life not having had a mother to begin with his relations with them whether amorous or friendly had been casual he got on well with janitresses and washwomen with indians and with the peasant women of foreign countries he had friends among the silkskirt factory girls who came to eat their lunch in washington square and he sometimes took a model for a day in the country he felt an unreasoning antipathy toward the welldressed women he saw coming out of big shops or driving in the park if on his way to the art museum he noticed a pretty girl standing on the steps of one of the houses on upper fifth avenue he frowned at her and went by with his shoulders hunched up as if he were cold he had never known such girls or heard them talk or seen the inside of the houses in which they lived but he believed them all to be artificial and in an aesthetic sense perverted he saw them enslaved by desire of merchandise and manufactured articles effective only in making life complicated and insincere and in embroidering it with ugly and meaningless trivialities they were enough he thought to make one almost forget woman as she existed in art in thought and in the universe he had no desire to know the woman who had for the time at least so broken up his life no curiosity about her everyday personality he shunned any revelation of it and he listened for miss bowers coming and going not to encounter but to avoid her he wished that the girl who wore shirtwaists and got letters from chicago would keep out of his way that she did not exist with her he had naught to make but in a room full of sun before an old mirror on a little enchanted rug of sleeping colours he had seen a woman who emerged naked through a door and disappeared naked he thought of that body as never having been clad or as having worn the stuffs and dyes of all the centuries but his own and for him she had no geographical associations unless with crete or alexandria or veroneses venice she was the immortal conception the perennial theme the first break in hedgers lethargy occurred one afternoon when two young men came to take eden bower out to dine they went into her music room laughed and talked for a few minutes and then took her away with them they were gone a long while but he did not go out for food himself he waited for them to come back at last he heard them coming down the hall gayer and more talkative than when they left one of them sat down at the piano and they all began to sing this hedger found absolutely unendurable he snatched up his hat and went running down the stairs caesar leaped beside him hoping that old times were coming back they had supper in the oystermans basement and then sat down in front of their own doorway the moon stood full over the square a thing of regal glory but hedger did not see the moon he was looking murderously for men presently two wearing straw hats and white trousers and carrying canes came down the steps from his house he rose and dogged them across the square they were laughing and seemed very much elated about something as one stopped to light a cigarette hedger caught from the other dont you think she has a beautiful talent his companion threw away his match she has a beautiful figure they both ran to catch the stage hedger went back to his studio the light was shining from her transom for the first time he violated her privacy at night and peered through that fatal aperture she was sitting fully dressed in the window smoking a cigarette and looking out over the housetops he watched her until she rose looked about her with a disdainful crafty smile and turned out the light the next morning when miss bower went out hedger followed her her white skirt gleamed ahead of him as she sauntered about the square she sat down behind the garibaldi statue and opened a music book she carried she turned the leaves carelessly and several times glanced in his direction he was on the point of going over to her when she rose quickly and looked up at the sky a flock of pigeons had risen from somewhere in the crowded italian quarter to the south and were wheeling rapidly up through the morning air soaring and dropping scattering and coming together now grey now white as silver as they caught or intercepted the sunlight she put up her hand to shade her eyes and followed them with a kind of defiant delight in her face hedger came and stood beside her youve surely seen them before oh yes she replied still looking up i see them every day from my windows they always come home about five oclock where do they live i dont know probably some italian raises them for the market they were here long before i came and ive been here four years in that same gloomy room why didnt you take mine when it was vacant it isnt gloomy thats the best light for painting oh is it i dont know anything about painting id like to see your pictures sometime you have such a lot in there dont they get dusty piled up against the wall like that not very id be glad to show them to you is your name really eden bower ive seen your letters on the table well its the name im going to sing under my fathers name is bowers but my friend mr jones a chicago newspaper man who writes about music told me to drop the s hes crazy about my voice miss bower didnt usually tell the whole story about anything her first name when she lived in huntington illinois was edna but mr jones had persuaded her to change it to one which he felt would be worthy of her future she was quick to take suggestions though she told him she didnt see what was the matter with edna she explained to hedger that she was going to paris to study she was waiting in new york for chicago friends who were to take her over but who had been detained did you study in paris she asked no ive never been in paris but i was in the south of france all last summer studying with c hes the biggest man among the moderns at least i think so miss bower sat down and made room for him on the bench do tell me about it i expected to be there by this time and i cant wait to find out what its like hedger began to relate how he had seen some of this frenchmans work in an exhibition and deciding at once that this was the man for him he had taken a boat for marseilles the next week going over steerage he proceeded at once to the little town on the coast where his painter lived and presented himself the man never took pupils but because hedger had come so far he let him stay hedger lived at the masters house and every day they went out together to paint sometimes on the blazing rocks down by the sea they wrapped themselves in light woollen blankets and didnt feel the heat being there and working with c was being in paradise hedger concluded he learned more in three months than in all his life before eden bower laughed youre a funny fellow didnt you do anything but work are the women very beautiful did you have awfully good things to eat and drink hedger said some of the women were fine looking especially one girl who went about selling fish and lobsters about the food there was nothing remarkable except the ripe figs he liked those they drank sour wine and used goatbutter which was strong and full of hair as it was churned in a goat skin but dont they have parties or banquets arent there any fine hotels down there yes but they are all closed in summer and the country people are poor its a beautiful country though how beautiful she persisted if you want to go in ill show you some sketches and youll see miss bower rose all right i wont go to my fencing lesson this morning do you fence here comes your dog you cant move but hes after you he always makes a face at me when i meet him in the hall and shows his nasty little teeth as if he wanted to bite me in the studio hedger got out his sketches but to miss bower whose favourite pictures were christ before pilate and a redhaired magdalen of henner these landscapes were not at all beautiful and they gave her no idea of any country whatsoever she was careful not to commit herself however her vocal teacher had already convinced her that she had a great deal to learn about many things why dont we go out to lunch somewhere hedger asked and began to dust his fingers with a handkerchief which he got out of sight as swiftly as possible all right the brevoort she said carelessly i think thats a good place and they have good wine i dont care for cocktails hedger felt his chin uneasily im afraid i havent shaved this morning if you could wait for me in the square it wont take me ten minutes left alone he found a clean collar and handkerchief brushed his coat and blacked his shoes and last of all dug up ten dollars from the bottom of an old copper kettle he had brought from spain his winter hat was of such a complexion that the brevoort hall boy winked at the porter as he took it and placed it on the rack in a row of fresh straw ones iv that afternoon eden bower was lying on the couch in her music room her face turned to the window watching the pigeons reclining thus she could see none of the neighbouring roofs only the sky itself and the birds that crossed and recrossed her field of vision white as scraps of paper blowing in the wind she was thinking that she was young and handsome and had had a good lunch that a very easygoing lighthearted city lay in the streets below her and she was wondering why she found this queer painter chap with his lean bluish cheeks and heavy black eyebrows more interesting than the smart young men she met at her teachers studio eden bower was at twenty very much the same person that we all know her to be at forty except that she knew a great deal less but one thing she knew that she was to be eden bower she was like some one standing before a great show window full of beautiful and costly things deciding which she will order she understands that they will not all be delivered immediately but one by one they will arrive at her door she already knew some of the many things that were to happen to her for instance that the chicago millionaire who was going to take her abroad with his sister as chaperone would eventually press his claim in quite another manner he was the most circumspect of bachelors afraid of everything obvious even of women who were too flagrantly handsome he was a nervous collector of pictures and furniture a nervous patron of music and a nervous host very cautious about his health and about any course of conduct that might make him ridiculous but she knew that he would at last throw all his precautions to the winds people like eden bower are inexplicable her father sold farming machinery in huntington illinois and she had grown up with no acquaintances or experiences outside of that prairie town yet from her earliest childhood she had not one conviction or opinion in common with the people about her the only people she knew before she was out of short dresses she had made up her mind that she was going to be an actress that she would live far away in great cities that she would be much admired by men and would have everything she wanted when she was thirteen and was already singing and reciting for church entertainments she read in some illustrated magazine a long article about the late czar of russia then just come to the throne or about to come to it after that lying in the hammock on the front porch on summer evenings or sitting through a long sermon in the family pew she amused herself by trying to make up her mind whether she would or would not be the czars mistress when she played in his capital now edna had met this fascinating word only in the novels of ouida her hardworked little mother kept a long row of them in the upstairs storeroom behind the linen chest in huntington women who bore that relation to men were called by a very different name and their lot was not an enviable one of all the shabby and poor they were the shabbiest but then edna had never lived in huntington not even before she began to find books like sapho and mademoiselle de maupin secretly sold in paper covers throughout illinois it was as if she had come into huntington into the bowers family on one of the trains that puffed over the marshes behind their back fence all day long and was waiting for another train to take her out as she grew older and handsomer she had many beaux but these smalltown boys didnt interest her if a lad kissed her when he brought her home from a dance she was indulgent and she rather liked it but if he pressed her further she slipped away from him laughing after she began to sing in chicago she was consistently discreet she stayed as a guest in rich peoples houses and she knew that she was being watched like a rabbit in a laboratory covered up in bed with the lights out she thought her own thoughts and laughed this summer in new york was her first taste of freedom the chicago capitalist after all his arrangements were made for sailing had been compelled to go to mexico to look after oil interests his sister knew an excellent singing master in new york why should not a discreet wellbalanced girl like miss bower spend the summer there studying quietly the capitalist suggested that his sister might enjoy a summer on long island he would rent the griffiths place for her with all the servants and eden could stay there but his sister met this proposal with a cold stare so it fell out that between selfishness and greed eden got a summer all her own which really did a great deal toward making her an artist and whatever else she was afterward to become she had time to look about to watch without being watched to select diamonds in one window and furs in another to select shoulders and moustaches in the big hotels where she went to lunch she had the easy freedom of obscurity and the consciousness of power she enjoyed both she was in no hurry while eden bower watched the pigeons don hedger sat on the other side of the bolted doors looking into a pool of dark turpentine at his idle brushes wondering why a woman could do this to him he too was sure of his future and knew that he was a chosen man he could not know of course that he was merely the first to fall under a fascination which was to be disastrous to a few men and pleasantly stimulating to many thousands each of these two young people sensed the future but not completely don hedger knew that nothing much would ever happen to him eden bower understood that to her a great deal would happen but she did not guess that her neighbour would have more tempestuous adventures sitting in his dark studio than she would find in all the capitals of europe or in all the latitude of conduct she was prepared to permit herself v one sunday morning eden was crossing the square with a spruce young man in a white flannel suit and a panama hat they had been breakfasting at the brevoort and he was coaxing her to let him come up to her rooms and sing for an hour no ive got to write letters you must run along now i see a friend of mine over there and i want to ask him about something before i go up that fellow with the dog where did you pick him up the young man glanced toward the seat under a sycamore where hedger was reading the morning paper oh hes an old friend from the west said eden easily i wont introduce you because he doesnt like people hes a recluse goodbye i cant be sure about tuesday ill go with you if i have time after my lesson she nodded left him and went over to the seat littered with newspapers the young man went up the avenue without looking back well what are you going to do today shampoo this animal all morning eden enquired teasingly hedger made room for her on the seat no at twelve oclock im going out to coney island one of my models is going up in a balloon this afternoon ive often promised to go and see her and now im going eden asked if models usually did such stunts no hedger told her but molly welch added to her earnings in that way i believe he added she likes the excitement of it shes got a good deal of spirit thats why i like to paint her so many models have flaccid bodies and she hasnt eh is she the one who comes to see you i cant help hearing her she talks so loud yes she has a rough voice but shes a fine girl i dont suppose youd be interested in going i dont know eden sat tracing patterns on the asphalt with the end of her parasol is it any fun i got up feeling id like to do something different today its the first sunday ive not had to sing in church i had that engagement for breakfast at the brevoort but it wasnt very exciting that chap cant talk about anything but himself hedger warmed a little if youve never been to coney island you ought to go its nice to see all the people tailors and bartenders and prizefighters with their best girls and all sorts of folks taking a holiday eden looked sidewise at him so one ought to be interested in people of that kind ought one he was certainly a funny fellow yet he was never somehow tiresome she had seen a good deal of him lately but she kept wanting to know him better to find out what made him different from men like the one she had just left whether he really was as different as he seemed ill go with you she said at last if youll leave that at home she pointed to caesars flickering ears with her sunshade but hes half the fun youd like to hear him bark at the waves when they come in no i wouldnt hes jealous and disagreeable if he sees you talking to any one else look at him now of course if you make a face at him he knows what that means and he makes a worse face he likes molly welch and shell be disappointed if i dont bring him eden said decidedly that he couldnt take both of them so at twelve oclock when she and hedger got on the boat at desbrosses street caesar was lying on his pallet with a bone eden enjoyed the boatride it was the first time she had been on the water and she felt as if she were embarking for france the light warm breeze and the plunge of the waves made her very wide awake and she liked crowds of any kind they went to the balcony of a big noisy restaurant and had a shore dinner with tall steins of beer hedger had got a big advance from his advertising firm since he first lunched with miss bower ten days ago and he was ready for anything after dinner they went to the tent behind the bathing beach where the tops of two balloons bulged out over the canvas a redfaced man in a linen suit stood in front of the tent shouting in a hoarse voice and telling the people that if the crowd was good for five dollars more a beautiful young woman would risk her life for their entertainment four little boys in dirty red uniforms ran about taking contributions in their pillbox hats one of the balloons was bobbing up and down in its tether and people were shoving forward to get nearer the tent is it dangerous as he pretends eden asked molly says its simple enough if nothing goes wrong with the balloon then it would be all over i suppose wouldnt you like to go up with her i of course not im not fond of taking foolish risks eden sniffed i shouldnt think sensible risks would be very much fun hedger did not answer for just then every one began to shove the other way and shout look out there she goes and a band of six pieces commenced playing furiously as the balloon rose from its tent enclosure they saw a girl in green tights standing in the basket holding carelessly to one of the ropes with one hand and with the other waving to the spectators a long rope trailed behind to keep the balloon from blowing out to sea as it soared the figure in green tights in the basket diminished to a mere spot and the balloon itself in the brilliant light looked like a big silvergrey bat with its wings folded when it began to sink the girl stepped through the hole in the basket to a trapeze that hung below and gracefully descended through the air holding to the rod with both hands keeping her body taut and her feet close together the crowd which had grown very large by this time cheered vociferously the men took off their hats and waved little boys shouted and fat old women shining with the heat and a beer lunch murmured admiring comments upon the balloonists figure beautiful legs she has thats so hedger whispered not many girls would look well in that position then for some reason he blushed a slow dark painful crimson the balloon descended slowly a little way from the tent and the redfaced man in the linen suit caught molly welch before her feet touched the ground and pulled her to one side the band struck up blue bell by way of welcome and one of the sweaty pages ran forward and presented the balloonist with a large bouquet of artificial flowers she smiled and thanked him and ran back across the sand to the tent cant we go inside and see her eden asked you can explain to the door man i want to meet her edging forward she herself addressed the man in the linen suit and slipped something from her purse into his hand they found molly seated before a trunk that had a mirror in the lid and a makeup outfit spread upon the tray she was wiping the cold cream and powder from her neck with a discarded chemise hello don she said cordially brought a friend eden liked her she had an easy friendly manner and there was something boyish and devilmaycare about her yes its fun im mad about it she said in reply to edens questions i always want to let go when i come down on the bar you dont feel your weight at all as you would on a stationary trapeze the big drum boomed outside and the publicity man began shouting to newly arrived boatloads miss welch took a last pull at her cigarette now youll have to get out don i change for the next act this time i go up in a black evening dress and lose the skirt in the basket before i start down yes go along said eden wait for me outside the door ill stay and help her dress hedger waited and waited while women of every build bumped into him and begged his pardon and the red pages ran about holding out their caps for coins and the people ate and perspired and shifted parasols against the sun when the band began to play a twostep all the bathers ran up out of the surf to watch the ascent the second balloon bumped and rose and the crowd began shouting to the girl in a black evening dress who stood leaning against the ropes and smiling its a new girl they called it aint the countess this time youre a peach girlie the balloonist acknowledged these compliments bowing and looking down over the sea of upturned faces but hedger was determined she should not see him and he darted behind the tentfly he was suddenly dripping with cold sweat his mouth was full of the bitter taste of anger and his tongue felt stiff behind his teeth molly welch in a shirtwaist and a white tamoshanter cap slipped out from the tent under his arm and laughed up in his face shes a crazy one you brought along shell get what she wants oh ill settle with you all right hedger brought out with difficulty its not my fault donnie i couldnt do anything with her she bought me off whats the matter with you are you soft on her shes safe enough its as easy as rolling off a log if you keep cool molly welch was rather excited herself and she was chewing gum at a high speed as she stood beside him looking up at the floating silver cone now watch she exclaimed suddenly shes coming down on the bar i advised her to cut that out but you see she does it firstrate and she got rid of the skirt too those black tights show off her legs very well she keeps her feet together like i told her and makes a good line along the back see the light on those silver slippers that was a good idea i had come along to meet her dont be a grouch shes done it fine molly tweaked his elbow and then left him standing like a stump while she ran down the beach with the crowd though hedger was sulking his eye could not help seeing the low blue welter of the sea the arrested bathers standing in the surf their arms and legs stained red by the dropping sun all shading their eyes and gazing upward at the slowly falling silver star molly welch and the manager caught eden under the arms and lifted her aside a red page dashed up with a bouquet and the band struck up blue bell eden laughed and bowed took mollys arm and ran up the sand in her black tights and silver slippers dodging the friendly old women and the gallant sports who wanted to offer their homage on the spot when she emerged from the tent dressed in her own clothes that part of the beach was almost deserted she stepped to her companions side and said carelessly hadnt we better try to catch this boat i hope youre not sore at me really it was lots of fun hedger looked at his watch yes we have fifteen minutes to get to the boat he said politely as they walked toward the pier one of the pages ran up panting lady youre carrying off the bouquet he said aggrievedly eden stopped and looked at the bunch of spotty cotton roses in her hand of course i want them for a souvenir you gave them to me yourself i give em to you for looks but you cant take em away they belong to the show oh you always use the same bunch sure we do there aint too much money in this business she laughed and tossed them back to him why are you angry she asked hedger i wouldnt have done it if id been with some fellows but i thought you were the sort who wouldnt mind molly didnt for a minute think you would what possessed you to do such a fool thing he asked roughly i dont know when i saw her coming down i wanted to try it it looked exciting didnt i hold myself as well as she did hedger shrugged his shoulders but in his heart he forgave her the return boat was not crowded though the boats that passed them going out were packed to the rails the sun was setting boys and girls sat on the long benches with their arms about each other singing eden felt a strong wish to propitiate her companion to be alone with him she had been curiously wrought up by her balloon trip it was a lark but not very satisfying unless one came back to something after the flight she wanted to be admired and adored though eden said nothing and sat with her arms limp on the rail in front of her looking languidly at the rising silhouette of the city and the bright path of the sun hedger felt a strange drawing near to her if he but brushed her white skirt with his knee there was an instant communication between them such as there had never been before they did not talk at all but when they went over the gangplank she took his arm and kept her shoulder close to his he felt as if they were enveloped in a highly charged atmosphere an invisible network of subtle almost painful sensibility they had somehow taken hold of each other an hour later they were dining in the back garden of a little french hotel on ninth street long since passed away it was cool and leafy there and the mosquitoes were not very numerous a party of south americans at another table were drinking champagne and eden murmured that she thought she would like some if it were not too expensive perhaps it will make me think i am in the balloon again that was a very nice feeling youve forgiven me havent you hedger gave her a quick straight look from under his black eyebrows and something went over her that was like a chill except that it was warm and feathery she drank most of the wine her companion was indifferent to it he was talking more to her tonight than he had ever done before she asked him about a new picture she had seen in his room a queer thing full of stiff supplicating female figures its indian isnt it yes i call it rain spirits or maybe indian rain in the southwest where ive been a good deal the indian traditions make women have to do with the rainfall they were supposed to control it somehow and to be able to find springs and make moisture come out of the earth you see im trying to learn to paint what people think and feel to get away from all that photographic stuff when i look at you i dont see what a camera would see do i how can i tell well if i should paint you i could make you understand what i see for the second time that day hedger crimsoned unexpectedly and his eyes fell and steadily contemplated a dish of little radishes that particular picture i got from a story a mexican priest told me he said he found it in an old manuscript book in a monastery down there written by some spanish missionary who got his stories from the aztecs this one he called the forty lovers of the queen and it was more or less about rainmaking arent you going to tell it to me eden asked hedger fumbled among the radishes i dont know if its the proper kind of story to tell a girl she smiled oh forget about that ive been balloon riding today i like to hear you talk her low voice was flattering she had seemed like clay in his hands ever since they got on the boat to come home he leaned back in his chair forgot his food and looking at her intently began to tell his story the theme of which he somehow felt was dangerous tonight the tale began he said somewhere in ancient mexico and concerned the daughter of a king the birth of this princess was preceded by unusual portents three times her mother dreamed that she was delivered of serpents which betokened that the child she carried would have power with the rain gods the serpent was the symbol of water the princess grew up dedicated to the gods and wise men taught her the rainmaking mysteries she was with difficulty restrained from men and was guarded at all times for it was the law of the thunder that she be maiden until her marriage in the years of her adolescence rain was abundant with her people the oldest man could not remember such fertility when the princess had counted eighteen summers her father went to drive out a war party that harried his borders on the north and troubled his prosperity the king destroyed the invaders and brought home many prisoners among the prisoners was a young chief taller than any of his captors of such strength and ferocity that the kings people came a days journey to look at him when the princess beheld his great stature and saw that his arms and breast were covered with the figures of wild animals bitten into the skin and coloured she begged his life from her father she desired that he should practise his art upon her and prick upon her skin the signs of rain and lightning and thunder and stain the wounds with herbjuices as they were upon his own body for many days upon the roof of the kings house the princess submitted herself to the bone needle and the women with her marvelled at her fortitude but the princess was without shame before the captive and it came about that he threw from him his needles and his stains and fell upon the princess to violate her honour and her women ran down from the roof screaming to call the guard which stood at the gateway of the kings house and none stayed to protect their mistress when the guard came the captive was thrown into bonds and he was gelded and his tongue was torn out and he was given for a slave to the rain princess the country of the aztecs to the east was tormented by thirst and their king hearing much of the rainmaking arts of the princess sent an embassy to her father with presents and an offer of marriage so the princess went from her father to be the queen of the aztecs and she took with her the captive who served her in everything with entire fidelity and slept upon a mat before her door the king gave his bride a fortress on the outskirts of the city whither she retired to entreat the rain gods this fortress was called the queens house and on the night of the new moon the queen came to it from the palace but when the moon waxed and grew toward the round because the god of thunder had had his will of her then the queen returned to the king drought abated in the country and rain fell abundantly by reason of the queens power with the stars when the queen went to her own house she took with her no servant but the captive and he slept outside her door and brought her food after she had fasted the queen had a jewel of great value a turquoise that had fallen from the sun and had the image of the sun upon it and when she desired a young man whom she had seen in the army or among the slaves she sent the captive to him with the jewel for a sign that he should come to her secretly at the queens house upon business concerning the welfare of all and some after she had talked with them she sent away with rewards and some she took into her chamber and kept them by her for one night or two afterward she called the captive and bade him conduct the youth by the secret way he had come underneath the chambers of the fortress but for the going away of the queens lovers the captive took out the bar that was beneath a stone in the floor of the passage and put in its stead a rushreed and the youth stepped upon it and fell through into a cavern that was the bed of an underground river and whatever was thrown into it was not seen again in this service nor in any other did the captive fail the queen but when the queen sent for the captain of the archers she detained him four days in her chamber calling often for food and wine and was greatly content with him on the fourth day she went to the captive outside her door and said tomorrow take this man up by the sure way by which the king comes and let him live in the queens door were arrows purple and white when she desired the king to come to her publicly with his guard she sent him a white arrow but when she sent the purple he came secretly and covered himself with his mantle to be hidden from the stone gods at the gate on the fifth night that the queen was with her lover the captive took a purple arrow to the king and the king came secretly and found them together he killed the captain with his own hand but the queen he brought to public trial the captive when he was put to the question told on his fingers forty men that he had let through the underground passage into the river the captive and the queen were put to death by fire both on the same day and afterward there was scarcity of rain eden bower sat shivering a little as she listened hedger was not trying to please her she thought but to antagonize and frighten her by his brutal story she had often told herself that his lean bigboned lower jaw was like his bulldogs but tonight his face made caesars most savage and determined expression seem an affectation now she was looking at the man he really was nobodys eyes had ever defied her like this they were searching her and seeing everything all she had concealed from livingston and from the millionaire and his friends and from the newspaper men he was testing her trying her out and she was more ill at ease than she wished to show thats quite a thrilling story she said at last rising and winding her scarf about her throat it must be getting late almost every one has gone they walked down the avenue like people who have quarrelled or who wish to get rid of each other hedger did not take her arm at the street crossings and they did not linger in the square at her door he tried none of the old devices of the livingston boys he stood like a post having forgotten to take off his hat gave her a harsh threatening glance muttered goodnight and shut his own door noisily there was no question of sleep for eden bower her brain was working like a machine that would never stop after she undressed she tried to calm her nerves by smoking a cigarette lying on the divan by the open window but she grew wider and wider awake combating the challenge that had flamed all evening in hedgers eyes the balloon had been one kind of excitement the wine another but the thing that had roused her as a blow rouses a proud man was the doubt the contempt the sneering hostility with which the painter had looked at her when he told his savage story crowds and balloons were all very well she reflected but womans chief adventure is man with a mind over active and a sense of life over strong she wanted to walk across the roofs in the starlight to sail over the sea and face at once a world of which she had never been afraid hedger must be asleep his dog had stopped sniffing under the double doors eden put on her wrapper and slippers and stole softly down the hall over the old carpet one loose board creaked just as she reached the ladder the trapdoor was open as always on hot nights when she stepped out on the roof she drew a long breath and walked across it looking up at the sky her foot touched something soft she heard a low growl and on the instant caesars sharp little teeth caught her ankle and waited his breath was like steam on her leg nobody had ever intruded upon his roof before and he panted for the movement or the word that would let him spring his jaw instead hedgers hand seized his throat wait a minute ill settle with him he said grimly he dragged the dog toward the manhole and disappeared when he came back he found eden standing over by the dark chimney looking away in an offended attitude i caned him unmercifully he panted of course you didnt hear anything he never whines when i beat him he didnt nip you did he i dont know whether he broke the skin or not she answered aggrievedly still looking off into the west if i were one of your friends in white pants id strike a match to find whether you were hurt though i know you are not and then id see your ankle wouldnt i i suppose so he shook his head and stood with his hands in the pockets of his old painting jacket im not up to such boytricks if you want the place to yourself ill clear out there are plenty of places where i can spend the night whats left of it but if you stay here and i stay here he shrugged his shoulders eden did not stir and she made no reply her head drooped slightly as if she were considering but the moment he put his arms about her they began to talk both at once as people do in an opera the instant avowal brought out a flood of trivial admissions hedger confessed his crime was reproached and forgiven and now eden knew what it was in his look that she had found so disturbing of late standing against the black chimney with the sky behind and blue shadows before they looked like one of hedgers own paintings of that period two figures one white and one dark and nothing whatever distinguishable about them but that they were male and female the faces were lost the contours blurred in shadow but the figures were a man and a woman and that was their whole concern and their mysterious beauty it was the rhythm in which they moved at last along the roof and down into the dark hole he first drawing her gently after him she came down very slowly the excitement and bravado and uncertainty of that long day and night seemed all at once to tell upon her when his feet were on the carpet and he reached up to lift her down she twined her arms about his neck as after a long separation and turned her face to him and her lips with their perfume of youth and passion one saturday afternoon hedger was sitting in the window of edens music room they had been watching the pigeons come wheeling over the roofs from their unknown feeding grounds why said eden suddenly dont we fix those big doors into your studio so they will open then if i want you i wont have to go through the hall that illustrator is loafing about a good deal of late ill open them if you wish the bolt is on your side isnt there one on yours too no i believe a man lived there for years before i came in and the nurse used to have these rooms herself naturally the lock was on the ladys side eden laughed and began to examine the bolt its all stuck up with paint looking about her eye lighted upon a bronze buddah which was one of the nurses treasures taking him by his head she struck the bolt a blow with his squatting posteriors the two doors creaked sagged and swung weakly inward a little way as if they were too old for such escapades eden tossed the heavy idol into a stuffed chair thats better she exclaimed exultantly so the bolts are always on the ladys side what a lot society takes for granted hedger laughed sprang up and caught her arms roughly whoever takes you for granted did anybody ever everybody does thats why im here you are the only one who knows anything about me now ill have to dress if were going out for dinner he lingered keeping his hold on her but i wont always be the only one eden bower i wont be the last no i suppose not she said carelessly but what does that matter you are the first as a long despairing whine broke in the warm stillness they drew apart caesar lying on his bed in the dark corner had lifted his head at this invasion of sunlight and realized that the side of his room was broken open and his whole world shattered by change there stood his master and this woman laughing at him the woman was pulling the long black hair of this mightiest of men who bowed his head and permitted it vi in time they quarrelled of course and about an abstraction as young people often do as mature people almost never do eden came in late one afternoon she had been with some of her musical friends to lunch at burton ives studio and she began telling hedger about its splendours he listened a moment and then threw down his brushes i know exactly what its like he said impatiently a very good departmentstore conception of a studio its one of the show places well its gorgeous and he said i could bring you to see him the boys tell me hes awfully kind about giving people a lift and you might get something out of it hedger started up and pushed his canvas out of the way what could i possibly get from burton ives hes almost the worst painter in the world the stupidest i mean eden was annoyed burton ives had been very nice to her and had begged her to sit for him you must admit that hes a very successful one she said coldly of course he is anybody can be successful who will do that sort of thing i wouldnt paint his pictures for all the money in new york well i saw a lot of them and i think they are beautiful hedger bowed stiffly whats the use of being a great painter if nobody knows about you eden went on persuasively why dont you paint the kind of pictures people can understand and then after youre successful do whatever you like as i look at it said hedger brusquely i am successful eden glanced about well i dont see any evidences of it she said biting her lip he has a japanese servant and a wine cellar and keeps a riding horse hedger melted a little my dear i have the most expensive luxury in the world and i am much more extravagant than burton ives for i work to please nobody but myself you mean you could make money and dont that you dont try to get a public exactly a public only wants what has been done over and over im painting for painters who havent been born what would you do if i brought mr ives down here to see your things well for gods sake dont before he left id probably tell him what i thought of him eden rose i give you up you know very well theres only one kind of success thats real yes but its not the kind you mean so youve been thinking me a scrub painter who needs a helping hand from some fashionable studio man what the devil have you had anything to do with me for then theres no use talking to you said eden walking slowly toward the door ive been trying to pull wires for you all afternoon and this is what it comes to she had expected that the tidings of a prospective call from the great man would be received very differently and had been thinking as she came home in the stage how as with a magic wand she might gild hedgers future float him out of his dark hole on a tide of prosperity see his name in the papers and his pictures in the windows on fifth avenue hedger mechanically snapped the midsummer leash on caesars collar and they ran downstairs and hurried through sullivan street off toward the river he wanted to be among rough honest people to get down where the big drays bumped over stone paving blocks and the men wore corduroy trowsers and kept their shirts open at the neck he stopped for a drink in one of the sagging barrooms on the water front he had never in his life been so deeply wounded he did not know he could be so hurt he had told this girl all his secrets on the roof in these warm heavy summer nights with her hands locked in his he had been able to explain all his misty ideas about an unborn art the world was waiting for had been able to explain them better than he had ever done to himself and she had looked away to the chattels of this uptown studio and coveted them for him to her he was only an unsuccessful burton ives then why as he had put it to her did she take up with him young beautiful talented as she was why had she wasted herself on a scrub pity hardly she wasnt sentimental there was no explaining her but in this passion that had seemed so fearless and so fated to be his own position now looked to him ridiculous a poor dauber without money or fame it was her caprice to load him with favours hedger ground his teeth so loud that his dog trotting beside him heard him and looked up while they were having supper at the oystermans he planned his escape whenever he saw her again everything he had told her that he should never have told any one would come back to him ideas he had never whispered even to the painter whom he worshipped and had gone all the way to france to see to her they must seem his apology for not having horses and a valet or merely the puerile boastfulness of a weak man yet if she slipped the bolt tonight and came through the doors and said oh weak man i belong to you what could he do that was the danger he would catch the train out to long beach tonight and tomorrow he would go on to the north end of long island where an old friend of his had a summer studio among the sand dunes he would stay until things came right in his mind and she could find a smart painter or take her punishment when he went home edens room was dark she was dining out somewhere he threw his things into a holdall he had carried about the world with him strapped up some colours and canvases and ran downstairs vii five days later hedger was a restless passenger on a dirty crowded sunday train coming back to town of course he saw now how unreasonable he had been in expecting a huntington girl to know anything about pictures here was a whole continent full of people who knew nothing about pictures and he didnt hold it against them what had such things to do with him and eden bower when he lay out on the dunes watching the moon come up out of the sea it had seemed to him that there was no wonder in the world like the wonder of eden bower he was going back to her because she was older than art because she was the most overwhelming thing that had ever come into his life he had written her yesterday begging her to be at home this evening telling her that he was contrite and wretched enough now that he was on his way to her his stronger feeling unaccountably changed to a mood that was playful and tender he wanted to share everything with her even the most trivial things he wanted to tell her about the people on the train coming back tired from their holiday with bunches of wilted flowers and dirty daisies to tell her that the fishman to whom she had often sent him for lobsters was among the passengers disguised in a silk shirt and a spotted tie and how his wife looked exactly like a fish even to her eyes on which cataracts were forming he could tell her too that he hadnt as much as unstrapped his canvases that ought to convince her in those days passengers from long island came into new york by ferry hedger had to be quick about getting his dog out of the express car in order to catch the first boat the east river and the bridges and the city to the west were burning in the conflagration of the sunset there was that great homecoming reach of evening in the air the car changes from thirtyfourth street were too many and too perplexing for the first time in his life hedger took a hansom cab for washington square caesar sat bolt upright on the worn leather cushion beside him and they jogged off looking down on the rest of the world it was twilight when they drove down lower fifth avenue into the square and through the arch behind them were the two long rows of pale violet lights that used to bloom so beautifully against the grey stone and asphalt here and yonder about the square hung globes that shed a radiance not unlike the blue mists of evening emerging softly when daylight died as the stars emerged in the thin blue sky under them the sharp shadows of the trees fell on the cracked pavement and the sleeping grass the first stars and the first lights were growing silver against the gradual darkening when hedger paid his driver and went into the house which thank god was still there on the hall table lay his letter of yesterday unopened he went upstairs with every sort of fear and every sort of hope clutching at his heart it was as if tigers were tearing him why was there no gas burning in the top hall he found matches and the gas bracket he knocked but got no answer nobody was there before his own door were exactly five bottles of milk standing in a row the milkboy had taken spiteful pleasure in thus reminding him that he forgot to stop his order hedger went down to the basement it too was dark the janitress was taking her evening airing on the basement steps she sat waving a palmleaf fan majestically her dirty calico dress open at the neck she told him at once that there had been changes miss bowers room was to let again and the piano would go tomorrow yes she left yesterday she sailed for europe with friends from chicago they arrived on friday heralded by many telegrams very rich people they were said to be though the man had refused to pay the nurse a months rent in lieu of notice which would have been only right as the young lady had agreed to take the rooms until october mrs foley had observed too that he didnt overpay her or willy for their trouble and a great deal of trouble they had been put to certainly yes the young lady was very pleasant but the nurse said there were rings on the mahogany table where she had put tumblers and wine glasses it was just as well she was gone the chicago man was uppish in his ways but not much to look at she supposed he had poor health for there was nothing to him inside his clothes hedger went slowly up the stairs never had they seemed so long or his legs so heavy the upper floor was emptiness and silence he unlocked his room lit the gas and opened the windows when he went to put his coat in the closet he found hanging among his clothes a pale fleshtinted dressing gown he had liked to see her wear with a perfume oh a perfume that was still eden bower he shut the door behind him and there in the dark for a moment he lost his manliness it was when he held this garment to him that he found a letter in the pocket the note was written with a lead pencil in haste she was sorry that he was angry but she still didnt know just what she had done she had thought mr ives would be useful to him she guessed he was too proud she wanted awfully to see him again but fate came knocking at her door after he had left her she believed in fate she would never forget him and she knew he would become the greatest painter in the world now she must pack she hoped he wouldnt mind her leaving the dressing gown somehow she could never wear it again after hedger read this standing under the gas he went back into the closet and knelt down before the wall the knot hole had been plugged up with a ball of wet paper the same blue notepaper on which her letter was written he was hard hit tonight he had to bear the loneliness of a whole lifetime knowing himself so well he could hardly believe that such a thing had ever happened to him that such a woman had lain happy and contented in his arms and now it was over he turned out the light and sat down on his painters stool before the big window caesar on the floor beside him rested his head on his masters knee we must leave hedger thus sitting in his tank with his dog looking up at the stars coming aphrodite this legend in electric lights over the lexington opera house had long announced the return of eden bower to new york after years of spectacular success in paris she came at last under the management of an american opera company but bringing her own chef dorchestre one bright december afternoon eden bower was going down fifth avenue in her car on the way to her broker in williams street her thoughts were entirely upon stocks cerro de pasco and how much she should buy of it when she suddenly looked up and realized that she was skirting washington square she had not seen the place since she rolled out of it in an oldfashioned fourwheeler to seek her fortune eighteen years ago arrкtez alphonse attendez moi she called and opened the door before he could reach it the children who were streaking over the asphalt on roller skates saw a lady in a long fur coat and short highheeled shoes alight from a french car and pace slowly about the square holding her muff to her chin this spot at least had changed very little she reflected the same trees the same fountain the white arch and over yonder garibaldi drawing the sword for freedom there just opposite her was the old red brick house yes that is the place she was thinking i can smell the carpets now and the dog what was his name that grubby bathroom at the end of the hall and that dreadful hedger still there was something about him you know she glanced up and blinked against the sun from somewhere in the crowded quarter south of the square a flock of pigeons rose wheeling quickly upward into the brilliant blue sky she threw back her head pressed her muff closer to her chin and watched them with a smile of amazement and delight so they still rose out of all that dirt and noise and squalor fleet and silvery just as they used to rise that summer when she was twenty and went up in a balloon on coney island alphonse opened the door and tucked her robes about her all the way down town her mind wandered from cerro de pasco and she kept smiling and looking up at the sky when she had finished her business with the broker she asked him to look in the telephone book for the address of m gaston jules the picture dealer and slipped the paper on which he wrote it into her glove it was five oclock when she reached the french galleries as they were called on entering she gave the attendant her card asking him to take it to m jules the dealer appeared very promptly and begged her to come into his private office where he pushed a great chair toward his desk for her and signalled his secretary to leave the room how good your lighting is in here she observed glancing about i met you at simons studio didnt i oh no i never forget anybody who interests me she threw her muff on his writing table and sank into the deep chair i have come to you for some information thats not in my line do you know anything about an american painter named hedger he took the seat opposite her don hedger but certainly there are some very interesting things of his in an exhibition at vs if you would care to she held up her hand no no ive no time to go to exhibitions is he a man of any importance certainly he is one of the first men among the moderns that is to say among the very moderns he is always coming up with something different he often exhibits in paris you must have seen no i tell you i dont go to exhibitions has he had great success that is what i want to know m jules pulled at his short grey moustache but madame there are many kinds of success he began cautiously madame gave a dry laugh yes so he used to say we once quarrelled on that issue and how would you define his particular kind m jules grew thoughtful he is a great name with all the young men and he is decidedly an influence in art but one cant definitely place a man who is original erratic and who is changing all the time she cut him short is he much talked about at home in paris i mean thanks thats all i want to know she rose and began buttoning her coat one doesnt like to have been an utter fool even at twenty mais non m jules handed her her muff with a quick sympathetic glance he followed her out through the carpeted showroom now closed to the public and draped in cheesecloth and put her into her car with words appreciative of the honour she had done him in calling leaning back in the cushions eden bower closed her eyes and her face as the street lamps flashed their ugly orange light upon it became hard and settled like a plaster cast so a sail that has been filled by a strong breeze behaves when the wind suddenly dies tomorrow night the wind would blow again and this mask would be the golden face of aphrodite but a big career takes its toll even with the best of luck the diamond mine i i first became aware that cressida garnet was on board when i saw young men with cameras going up to the boat deck in that exposed spot she was goodnaturedly posing for them amid fluttering lavender scarfs wearing a most unseaworthy hat her broad vigorous face wreathed in smiles she was too much an american not to believe in publicity all advertising was good if it was good for breakfast foods it was good for prime donna especially for a prima donna who would never be any younger and who had just announced her intention of marrying a fourth time only a few days before when i was lunching with some friends at sherrys i had seen jerome brown come in with several younger men looking so pleased and prosperous that i exclaimed upon it his affairs some one explained are looking up hes going to marry cressida garnet nobody believed it at first but since she confirms it hes getting all sorts of credit that womans a diamond mine if there was ever a man who needed a diamond mine at hand immediately convenient it was jerome brown but as an old friend of cressida garnet i was sorry to hear that mining operations were to be begun again i had been away from new york and had not seen cressida for a year now i paused on the gangplank to note how very like herself she still was and with what undiminished zeal she went about even the most trifling things that pertained to her profession from that distance i could recognize her carrying smile and even what in columbus we used to call the garnet look at the foot of the stairway leading up to the boat deck stood two of the factors in cressidas destiny one of them was her sister miss julia a woman of fifty with a relaxed mournful face an ageing skin that browned slowly like meerchaum and the unmistakable look by which one knew a garnet beside her pointedly ignoring her smoking a cigarette while he ran over the passenger list with supercilious almond eyes stood a youth in a pink shirt and a green plush hat holding a french bulldog on the leash this was horace cressidas only son he at any rate had not the garnet look he was rich and ruddy indolent and insolent with soft oval cheeks and the blooming complexion of twentytwo there was the beginning of a silky shadow on his upper lip he seemed like a ripe fruit grown out of a rich soil oriental his mother called his peculiar lusciousness his aunts restless and aggrieved glance kept flecking him from the side but the two were as motionless as the bouledogue standing there on his bench legs and surveying his travelling basket with loathing they were waiting in constrained immobility for cressida to descend and reanimate them will them to do or to be something forward by the rail i saw the stooped eager back for which i was unconsciously looking miletus poppas the greek jew cressidas accompanist and shadow we were all there i thought with a smile except jerome brown the first member of cressidas party with whom i had speech was mr poppas when we were two hours out i came upon him in the act of dropping overboard a steamer cushion made of american flags cressida never sailed i think that one of these vivid comforts of travel did not reach her at the dock poppas recognized me just as the striped object left his hand he was standing with his arm still extended over the rail his fingers contemptuously sprung back lest we forget he said with a shrug does madame cressida know we are to have the pleasure of your company for this voyage he spoke deliberate grammatical english he despised the american rendering of the language but there was an indescribably foreign quality in his voice a something muted and though he aspirated his ths with such conscientious thoroughness there was always the thud of a d in them poppas stood before me in a short tightly buttoned grey coat and cap exactly the colour of his greyish skin and hair and waxed moustache a monocle on a very wide black ribbon dangled over his chest as to his age i could not offer a conjecture in the twelve years i had known his thin lupine face behind cressidas shoulder it had not changed i was used to his cold supercilious manner to his alarming deepset eyes very close together in colour a yellowish green and always gleaming with something like defeated fury as if he were actually on the point of having it out with you or with the world at last i asked him if cressida had engagements in london quite so the manchester festival some concerts at queens hall and the opera at covent garden a rather special production of the operas of mozart that she can still do quite well which is not at all of course what we might have expected and only goes to show that our madame cressida is now as always a charming exception to rules poppas tone about his client was consistently patronizing and he was always trying to draw one into a conspiracy of two based on a mutual understanding of her shortcomings i approached him on the one subject i could think of which was more personal than his usefulness to cressida and asked him whether he still suffered from facial neuralgia as much as he had done in former years and whether he was therefore dreading london where the climate used to be so bad for him and is still he caught me up and is still for me to go to london is martyrdom chиre madame in new york it is bad enough but in london it is the auto da fй nothing less my nervous system is exotic in any country washed by the atlantic ocean and it shivers like a little hairless dog from mexico it never relaxes i think i have told you about my favourite city in the middle of asia la sainte asie where the rainfall is absolutely nil and you are protected on every side by hundreds of metres of warm dry sand i was there when i was a child once and it is still my intention to retire there when i have finished with all this i would be there now nowow his voice rose querulously if madame cressida did not imagine that she needs me and her fancies you know he flourished his hands one gives in to them in humouring her caprices you and i have already played some together we were approaching cressidas deck chairs ranged under the open windows of her stateroom she was already recumbent swathed in lavender scarfs and wearing purple orchids doubtless from jerome brown at her left horace had settled down to a french novel and julia garnet at her right was complainingly regarding the grey horizon on seeing me cressida struggled under her furlined robes and got to her feet which was more than horace or miss julia managed to do miss julia as i could have foretold was not pleased all the garnets had an awkward manner with me whether it was that i reminded them of things they wished to forget or whether they thought i esteemed cressida too highly and the rest of them too lightly i do not know but my appearance upon their scene always put them greatly on their dignity after horace had offered me his chair and miss julia had said doubtfully that she thought i was looking rather better than when she last saw me cressida took my arm and walked me off toward the stern do you know carrie i half wondered whether i shouldnt find you here or in london because you always turn up at critical moments in my life she pressed my arm confidentially and i felt that she was once more wrought up to a new purpose i told her that i had heard some rumour of her engagement its quite true and its all that it should be she reassured me ill tell you about it later and youll see that its a real solution they are against me of course all except horace he has been such a comfort horaces support such as it was could always be had in exchange for his mothers signature i suspected the pale may day had turned bleak and chilly and we sat down by an open hatchway which emitted warm air from somewhere below at this close range i studied cressidas face and felt reassured of her unabated vitality the old force of will was still there and with it her characteristic optimism the old hope of a solution you have been in columbus lately she was saying no you neednt tell me about it with a sigh why is it caroline that there is so little of my life i would be willing to live over again so little that i can even think of without depression yet ive really not such a bad conscience it may mean that i still belong to the future more than to the past do you think my assent was not warm enough to fix her attention and she went on thoughtfully of course it was a bleak country and a bleak period but ive sometimes wondered whether the bleakness may not have been in me too for it has certainly followed me there that is no way to talk she drew herself up from a momentary attitude of dejection sea air always lets me down at first thats why its so good for me in the end i think julia always lets you down too i said bluntly but perhaps that depression works out in the same way cressida laughed julia is rather more depressing than georgie isnt she but it was julias turn i cant come alone and theyve grown to expect it they havent either of them much else to expect at this point the deck steward approached us with a blue envelope a wireless for you madame garnet cressida put out her hand with impatience thanked him graciously and with every indication of pleasure tore open the blue envelope its from jerome brown she said with some confusion as she folded the paper small and tucked it between the buttons of her closefitting gown something he forgot to tell me how long shall you be in london good i want you to meet him we shall probably be married there as soon as my engagements are over she rose now i must write some letters keep two places at your table so that i can slip away from my party and dine with you sometimes i walked with her toward her chair in which mr poppas was now reclining he indicated his readiness to rise but she shook her head and entered the door of her deck suite as she passed him his eye went over her with assurance until it rested upon the folded bit of blue paper in her corsage he must have seen the original rectangle in the stewards hand having found it again he dropped back between horace and miss julia whom i think he disliked no more than he did the rest of the world he liked julia quite as well as he liked me and he liked me quite as well as he liked any of the women to whom he would be fitfully agreeable upon the voyage once or twice during each crossing he did his best and made himself very charming indeed to keep his hand in for the same reason that he kept a dummy keyboard in his stateroom somewhere down in the bowels of the boat he practised all the small economies paid the minimum rate and never took a deck chair because as horace was usually in the cardroom he could sit in horaces the three of them lay staring at the swell which was steadily growing heavier both men had covered themselves with rugs after dutifully bundling up miss julia as i walked back and forth on the deck i was struck by their various degrees of inexpressiveness opaque brown eyes almondshaped and only half open wolfish green eyes closeset and always doing something with a crooked gleam boring in this direction or in that watery grey eyes like the thick edges of broken skylight glass i would have given a great deal to know what was going on behind each pair of them these three were sitting there in a row because they were all woven into the pattern of one large and rather splendid life each had a bond and each had a grievance if they could have their will what would they do with the generous credulous creature who nourished them i wondered how deep a humiliation would each egotism exact they would scarcely have harmed her in fortune or in person though i think miss julia looked forward to the day when cressida would break and could be mourned over but the fire at which she warmed herself the little secret hope the illusion ridiculous or sublime which kept her going that they would have stamped out on the instant with the whole garnet pack behind them to make extinction sure all except perhaps miletus poppas he was a vulture of the vulture race and he had the beak of one but i always felt that if ever he had her thus at his mercy if ever he came upon the softness that was hidden under so much hardness the warm credulity under a life so dated and scheduled and reported and generally exposed he would hold his hand and spare the weather grew steadily rougher miss julia at last plucked poppas by the sleeve and indicated that she wished to be released from her wrappings when she disappeared there seemed to be every reason to hope that she might be off the scene for awhile as cressida said if she had not brought julia she would have had to bring georgie or some other garnet cressidas family was like that of the unpopular prince of wales of whom when he died some wag wrote if it had been his brother better him than another if it had been his sister no one would have missed her miss julia was dampening enough but miss georgie was aggressive and intrusive she was out to prove to the world and more especially to ohio that all the garnets were as like cressida as two peas both sisters were clubwomen social service workers and directors in musical societies and they were continually travelling up and down the middle west to preside at meetings or to deliver addresses they reminded one of two sombre bumping electrics rolling about with no visible means of locomotion always running out of power and lying beached in some inconvenient spot until they received a check or a suggestion from cressy i was only too well acquainted with the strained anxious expression that the sight of their handwriting brought to cressidas face when she ran over her morning mail at breakfast she usually put their letters by to read when she was feeling up to it and hastened to open others which might possibly contain something gracious or pleasant sometimes these family unburdenings lay about unread for several days any other letters would have got themselves lost but these bulky epistles never properly fitted to their envelopes seemed immune to mischance and unfailingly disgorged to cressida long explanations as to why her sisters had to do and to have certain things precisely upon her account and because she was so much a public personage the truth was that all the garnets and particularly her two sisters were consumed by an habitual bilious unenterprising envy of cressy they never forgot that no matter what she did for them or how far she dragged them about the world with her she would never take one of them to live with her in her tenth street house in new york they thought that was the thing they most wanted but what they wanted in the last analysis was to be cressida for twenty years she had been plunged in struggle fighting for her life at first then for a beginning for growth and at last for eminence and perfection fighting in the dark and afterward in the light which with her bad preparation and with her uninspired youth already behind her took even more courage during those twenty years the garnets had been comfortable and indolent and vastly selfsatisfied and now they expected cressida to make them equal sharers in the finer rewards of her struggle when her brother buchanan told me he thought cressida ought to make herself one of them he stated the converse of what he meant they coveted the qualities which had made her success as well as the benefits which came from it more than her furs or her fame or her fortune they wanted her personal effectiveness her brighter glow and stronger will to live sometimes i have heard cressida say looking up from a bunch of those sloppily written letters sometimes i get discouraged for several days the rough weather kept miss julia cloistered in cressidas deck suite with the maid luisa who confided to me that the signorina garnet was dificile after dinner i usually found cressida unincumbered as horace was always in the cardroom and mr poppas either nursed his neuralgia or went through the exercise of making himself interesting to some one of the young women on board one evening the third night out when the sea was comparatively quiet and the sky was full of broken black clouds silvered by the moon at their ragged edges cressida talked to me about jerome brown i had known each of her former husbands the first one charley wilton horaces father was my cousin he was organist in a church in columbus and cressida married him when she was nineteen he died of tuberculosis two years after horace was born cressida nursed him through a long illness and made the living besides her courage during the three years of her first marriage was fine enough to foreshadow her future to any discerning eye and it had made me feel that she deserved any number of chances at marital happiness there had of course been a particular reason for each subsequent experiment and a sufficiently alluring promise of success her motives in the case of jerome brown seemed to me more vague and less convincing than those which she had explained to me on former occasions its nothing hasty she assured me its been coming on for several years he has never pushed me but he was always there some one to count on even when i used to meet him at the whitings while i was still singing at the metropolitan i always felt that he was different from the others that if i were in straits of any kind i could call on him you cant know what that feeling means to me carrie if you look back youll see its something ive never had i admitted that in so far as i knew she had never been much addicted to leaning on people ive never had any one to lean on she said with a short laugh then she went on quite seriously somehow my relations with people always become business relations in the end i suppose its because except for a sort of professional personality which ive had to get just as ive had to get so many other things ive not very much thats personal to give people ive had to give too much else ive had to try too hard for people who wouldnt try at all which i put in firmly has done them no good and has robbed the people who really cared about you by making me grubby you mean by making you anxious and distracted so much of the time empty she nodded mournfully yes i know you used to warn me well theres not one of my brothers and sisters who does not feel that i carried off the family success just as i might have carried off the family silver if thered been any they take the view that there were just so many prizes in the bag i reached in and took them so there were none left for the others at my age thats a dismal truth to waken up to cressida reached for my hand and held it a moment as if she needed courage to face the facts in her case when one remembers ones first success how one hoped to go home like a christmas tree full of presents how much one learns in a lifetime that year when horace was a baby and charley was dying and i was touring the west with the williams band it was my feeling about my own people that made me go at all why i didnt drop myself into one of those muddy rivers or turn on the gas in one of those dirty hotel rooms i dont know to this day at twentytwo you must hope for something more than to be able to bury your husband decently and what i hoped for was to make my family happy it was the same afterward in germany a young woman must live for human people horace wasnt enough i might have had lovers of course i suppose you will say it would have been better if i had though there seemed no need for me to say anything i murmured that i thought there were more likely to be limits to the rapacity of a lover than to that of a discontented and envious family well cressida gathered herself up once i got out from under it all didnt i and perhaps in a milder way such a release can come again you were the first person i told when i ran away with charley and for a long while you were the only one who knew about blasius bouchalka that time at least i shook the garnets i wasnt distracted or empty that time i was all there yes i echoed her that time you were all there its the greatest possible satisfaction to remember it but even that she sighed was nothing but lawyers and accounts in the end and a hurt a hurt that has lasted i wonder what is the matter with me the matter with cressida was that more than any woman i have ever known she appealed to the acquisitive instinct in men but this was not easily said even in the brutal frankness of a long friendship we would probably have gone further into the bouchalka chapter of her life had not horace appeared and nervously asked us if we did not wish to take a turn before we went inside i pleaded indolence but cressida rose and disappeared with him later i came upon them standing at the stern above the huddled steerage deck which was by this time bathed in moonlight under an almost clear sky down there on the silvery floor little hillocks were scattered about under quilts and shawls family units presumably male female and young here and there a black shawl sat alone nodding they crouched submissively under the moonlight as if it were a spell in one of those hillocks a baby was crying but the sound was faint and thin a slender protest which aroused no response everything was so still that i could hear snatches of the low talk between my friends cressidas voice was deep and entreating she was remonstrating with horace about his losses at bridge begging him to keep away from the cardroom but what else is there to do on a trip like this my lady he expostulated tossing his spark of a cigaretteend overboard what is there now to do oh horace she murmured how can you be so if i were twentytwo and a boy with some one to back me horace drew his shoulders together and buttoned his topcoat oh ive not your energy mother dear we make no secret of that i am as i am i didnt ask to be born into this charming world to this gallant speech cressida made no answer she stood with her hand on the rail and her head bent forward as if she had lost herself in thought the ends of her scarf lifted by the breeze fluttered upward almost transparent in the argent light presently she turned away as if she had been alone and were leaving only the night sea behind her and walked slowly forward a strong solitary figure on the white deck the smokelike scarf twisting and climbing and falling back upon itself in the light over her head she reached the door of her stateroom and disappeared yes she was a garnet but she was also cressida and she had done what she had done ii my first recollections of cressida garnet have to do with the columbus public schools a little girl with sunny brown hair and eager bright eyes looking anxiously at the teacher and reciting the names and dates of the presidents james buchanan abraham lincoln etc her family came from north carolina and they had that to feel superior about before they had cressy the garnet look indeed though based upon a strong family resemblance was nothing more than the restless preoccupied expression of an inflamed sense of importance the father was a democrat in the sense that other men were doctors or lawyers he scratched up some sort of poor living for his family behind office windows inscribed with the words real estate insurance investments but it was his political faith that in a republican community gave him his feeling of eminence and originality the garnet children were all in school then scattered along from the first grade to the ninth in almost any room of our school building you might chance to enter you saw the selfconscious little face of one or another of them they were restrained uncomfortable children not frankly boastful but insinuating and somehow forever demanding special consideration and holding grudges against teachers and classmates who did not show it them all but cressida who was naturally as sunny and open as a may morning it was no wonder that cressy ran away with young charley wilton who hadnt a shabby thing about him except his health he was her first music teacher the choirmaster of the church in which she sang charley was very handsome the romantic son of an old impoverished family he had refused to go into a good business with his uncles and had gone abroad to study music when that was an extravagant and picturesque thing for an ohio boy to do his letters home were handed round among the members of his own family and of other families equally conservative indeed charley and what his mother called his music were the romantic expression of a considerable group of people young cousins and old aunts and quietdwelling neighbours allied by the amity of several generations nobody was properly married in our part of columbus unless charley wilton and no other played the wedding march the old ladies of the first church used to say that he hovered over the keys like a spirit at nineteen cressida was beautiful enough to turn a much harder head than the pale ethereal one charley wilton bent above the organ that the chapter which began so gracefully ran on into such a stretch of grim hard prose was simply cressidas relentless bad luck in her undertakings in whatever she could lay hold of with her two hands she was successful but whatever happened to her was almost sure to be bad her family her husbands her son would have crushed any other woman i have ever known cressida lived more than most of us for others and what she seemed to promote among her beneficiaries was indolence and envy and discord even dishonesty and turpitude her sisters were fond of saying at club luncheons that cressida had remained untouched by the breath of scandal which was not strictly true there were captious people who objected to her long and close association with miletus poppas her second husband ransome mcchord the foreign representative of the great mcchord harvester company whom she married in germany had so persistently objected to poppas that she was eventually forced to choose between them any one who knew her well could easily understand why she chose poppas while her actual self was the least changed the least modified by experience that it would be possible to imagine there had been professionally two cressida garnets the big handsome girl already a popular favourite of the concert stage who took with her to germany the raw material of a great voice and the accomplished artist who came back the singer that returned was largely the work of miletus poppas cressida had at least known what she needed hunted for it found it and held fast to it after experimenting with a score of teachers and accompanists she settled down to work her problem out with poppas other coaches came and went she was always trying new ones but poppas survived them all cressida was not musically intelligent she never became so who does not remember the countless rehearsals which were necessary before she first sang isolde in berlin the disgust of the conductor the sullenness of the tenor the rages of the blonde teufelin boiling with the impatience of youth and genius who sang her brangaena everything but her driving power cressida had to get from the outside poppas was in his way quite as incomplete as his pupil he possessed a great many valuable things for which there is no market intuitions discrimination imagination a whole twilight world of intentions and shadowy beginnings which were dark to cressida i remember that when trilby was published she fell into a fright and said such books ought to be prohibited by law which gave me an intimation of what their relationship had actually become poppas was indispensable to her he was like a book in which she had written down more about herself than she could possibly remember and it was information that she might need at any moment he was the one person who knew her absolutely and who saw into the bottom of her grief an artists saddest secrets are those that have to do with his artistry poppas knew all the simple things that were so desperately hard for cressida all the difficult things in which she could count on herself her stupidities and inconsistencies the chiaroscuro of the voice itself and what could be expected from the mind somewhat mismated with it he knew where she was sound and where she was mended with him she could share the depressing knowledge of what a wretchedly faulty thing any productive faculty is but if poppas was necessary to her career she was his career by the time cressida left the metropolitan opera company poppas was a rich man he had always received a retaining fee and a percentage of her salary and he was a man of simple habits her liberality with poppas was one of the weapons that horace and the garnets used against cressida and it was a point in the argument by which they justified to themselves their rapacity whatever they didnt get they told themselves poppas would what they got therefore they were only saving from poppas the greek ached a good deal at the general pillage and cressidas conciliatory methods with her family made him sarcastic and spiteful but he had to make terms somehow with the garnets and horace and with the husband if there happened to be one he sometimes reminded them when they fell to wrangling that they must not after all overturn the boat under them and that it would be better to stop just before they drove her wild than just after as he was the only one among them who understood the sources of her fortune and they knew it he was able when it came to a general setto to proclaim sanctuary for the goose that laid the golden eggs that poppas had caused the break between cressida and mcchord was another stick her sisters held over her they pretended to understand perfectly and were always explaining what they termed her separation but they let cressida know that it cast a shadow over her family and took a good deal of living down a beautiful soundness of body a seemingly exhaustless vitality and a certain squareness of character as well as of mind gave cressida garnet earning powers that were exceptional even in her lavishly rewarded profession managers chose her over the heads of singers much more gifted because she was so sane so conscientious and above all because she was so sure her efficiency was like a beacon to lightly anchored men and in the intervals between her marriages she had as many suitors as penelope whatever else they saw in her at first her competency so impressed and delighted them that they gradually lost sight of everything else her sterling character was the subject of her story once as she said she very nearly escaped her destiny with blasius bouchalka she became almost another woman but not quite her principles or his lack of them drove those two apart in the end it was of bouchalka that we talked upon that last voyage i ever made with cressida garnet and not of jerome brown she remembered the bohemian kindly and since it was the passage in her life to which she most often reverted it is the one i shall relate here iii late one afternoon in the winter of cressida and i were walking in central park after the first heavy storm of the year the snow had been falling thickly all the night before and all day until about four oclock then the air grew much warmer and the sky cleared overhead it was a soft rainy blue and to the west a smoky gold all around the horizon everything became misty and silvery even the big brutal buildings looked like pale violet watercolours on a silver ground under the elm trees along the mall the air was purple as wisterias the sheepfield toward broadway was smooth and white with a thin gold wash over it at five oclock the carriage came for us but cressida sent the driver home to the tenth street house with the message that she would dine uptown and that horace and mr poppas were not to wait for her as the horses trotted away we turned up the mall i wont go indoors this evening for any one cressida declared not while the sky is like that now we will go back to the laurel wood they are so black over the snow that i could cry for joy i dont know when ive felt so carefree as i feel tonight country winter country stars they always make me think of charley wilton she was singing twice a week sometimes oftener at the metropolitan that season quite at the floodtide of her powers and so enmeshed in operatic routine that to be walking in the park at an unaccustomed hour unattended by one of the men of her entourage seemed adventurous as we strolled along the little paths among the snow banks and the bronze laurel bushes she kept going back to my poor young cousin dead so long things happen out of season thats the worst of living it was untimely for both of us and yet she sighed softly since he had to die im not sorry there was one beautifully happy year though we were so poor and it gave him something it would have been too hard if hed had to miss everything i remember her simplicity which never changed any more than winter or ohio change yes she went on i always feel very tenderly about charley i believe id do the same thing right over again even knowing all that had to come after if i were nineteen tonight id rather go sleighriding with charley wilton than anything else ive ever done we walked until the procession of carriages on the driveway getting people home to dinner grew thin and then we went slowly toward the seventh avenue gate still talking of charley wilton we decided to dine at a place not far away where the only access from the street was a narrow door like a hole in the wall between a tobacconists and a flower shop cressida deluded herself into believing that her incognito was more successful in such nondescript places she was wearing a long sable coat and a deep fur hat hung with red cherries which she had brought from russia her walk had given her a fine colour and she looked so much a personage that no disguise could have been wholly effective the diningrooms frescoed with conventional italian scenes were built round a court the orchestra was playing as we entered and selected our table it was not a bad orchestra and we were no sooner seated than the first violin began to speak to assert itself as if it were suddenly done with mediocrity we have been recognized cressida said complacently what a good tone he has quite unusual what does he look like she sat with her back to the musicians the violinist was standing directing his men with his head and with the beak of his violin he was a tall gaunt young man bigboned and rugged in skintight clothes his high forehead had a kind of luminous pallour and his hair was jet black and somewhat stringy his manner was excited and dramatic at the end of the number he acknowledged the applause and cressida looked at him graciously over her shoulder he swept her with a brilliant glance and bowed again then i noticed his red lips and thick black eyebrows he looks as if he were poor or in trouble cressida said see how short his sleeves are and how he mops his face as if the least thing upset him this is a hard winter for musicians the violinist rummaged among some music piled on a chair turning over the sheets with flurried rapidity as if he were searching for a lost article of which he was in desperate need presently he placed some sheets upon the piano and began vehemently to explain something to the pianist the pianist stared at the music doubtfully he was a plump old man with a rosy bald crown and his shiny linen and neat tie made him look as if he were on his way to a party the violinist bent over him suggesting rhythms with his shoulders and running his bony finger up and down the pages when he stepped back to his place i noticed that the other players sat at ease without raising their instruments he is going to try something unusual i commented it looks as if it might be manuscript it was something at all events that neither of us had heard before though it was very much in the manner of the later russian composers who were just beginning to be heard in new york the young man made a brilliant dash of it despite a lagging scrambling accompaniment by the conservative pianist this time we both applauded him vigorously and again as he bowed he swept us with his eye the usual repertory of restaurant music followed varied by a charming bit from massenets manon then little known in this country after we paid our check cressida took out one of her visiting cards and wrote across the top of it we thank you for the unusual music and the pleasure your playing has given us she folded the card in the middle and asked the waiter to give it to the director of the orchestra pausing at the door while the porter dashed out to call a cab we saw in the wall mirror a pair of wild black eyes following us quite despairingly from behind the palms at the other end of the room cressida observed as we went out that the young man was probably having a hard struggle he never got those clothes here surely they were probably made by a country tailor in some little town in austria he seemed wild enough to grab at anything and was trying to make himself heard above the dishes poor fellow there are so many like him i wish i could help them all i didnt quite have the courage to send him money his smile when he bowed to us was not that of one who would take it do you think no i admitted it wasnt he seemed to be pleading for recognition i dont think it was money he wanted a week later i came upon some curiouslooking manuscript songs on the piano in cressidas music room the text was in some slavic tongue with a french translation written underneath both the handwriting and the musical script were done in a manner experienced even distinguished i was looking at them when cressida came in oh yes she exclaimed i meant to ask you to try them over poppas thinks they are very interesting they are from that young violinist you remember the one we noticed in the restaurant that evening he sent them with such a nice letter his name is blasius bouchalka boъkalka a bohemian i sat down at the piano and busied myself with the manuscript while cressida dashed off necessary notes and wrote checks in a large square checkbook six to a page i supposed her immersed in sumptuary preoccupations when she suddenly looked over her shoulder and said yes that legend sarka is the most interesting run it through a few times and ill try it over with you there was another dans les ombres des fфrets tristes which i thought quite as beautiful they were fine songs very individual and each had that spontaneity which makes a song seem inevitable and once for all done the accompaniments were difficult but not unnecessarily so they were free from fatuous ingenuity and fine writing i wish hed indicated his tempi a little more clearly i remarked as i finished sarka for the third time it matters because he really has something to say an orchestral accompaniment would be better i should think yes he sent the orchestral arrangement poppas has it it works out beautifully so much colour in the instrumentation the english horn comes in so effectively there she rose and indicated the passage just right with the voice ive asked him to come next sunday so please be here if you can i want to know what you think of him cressida was always at home to her friends on sunday afternoon unless she was billed for the evening concert at the opera house in which case we were sufficiently advised by the daily press bouchalka must have been told to come early for when i arrived on sunday at four he and cressida had the musicroom quite to themselves and were standing by the piano in earnest conversation in a few moments they were separated by other early comers and i led bouchalka across the hall to the drawingroom the guests as they came in glanced at him curiously he wore a dark blue suit soft and rather baggy with a short coat and a high doublebreasted vest with two rows of buttons coming up to the loops of his black tie this costume was even more foreignlooking than his skintight dress clothes but it was more becoming he spoke hurried elliptical english and very good french all his sympathies were french rather than german the czecks lean to the one culture or to the other i found him a fierce a transfixing talker his brilliant eyes his gaunt hands his white deeplylined forehead all entered into his speech i asked him whether he had not recognized madame garnet at once when we entered the restaurant that evening more than a week ago mais certainement i hear her twice when she sings in the afternoon and sometimes at night for the last act i have a friend who buys a ticket for the first part and he comes out and gives to me his passback check and i return for the last act that is convenient if i am broke he explained the trick with amusement but without embarrassment as if it were a shift that we might any of us be put to i told him that i admired his skill with the violin but his songs much more he threw out his red underlip and frowned oh i have no instrument the violin i play from necessity the flute the piano as it happens for three years now i write all the time and it spoils the hand for violin when the maid brought him his tea he took both muffins and cakes and told me that he was very hungry he had to lunch and dine at the place where he played and he got very tired of the food but since his black eyebrows nearly met in an acute angle but since before i eat at a bakery with the slender brown roach on the pie i guess i better let alone well enough he paused to drink his tea as he tasted one of the cakes his face lit with sudden animation and he gazed across the hall after the maid with the tray she was now holding it before the aged and ossified cellist of the hempfstangle quartette des gвteaux he murmured feelingly ou estce quelle peut trouver de tels gвteaux ici в new york i explained to him that madame garnet had an accomplished cook who made them an austrian i thought he shook his head austrichienne je ne pense pas cressida was approaching with the new spanish soprano mme bartolas who was all black velvet and long black feathers with a lace veil over her rich pallour and even a little black patch on her chin i beckoned them tell me cressida isnt ruzenka an austrian she looked surprised no a bohemian though i got her in vienna bouchalkas expression and the remnant of a cake in his long fingers gave her the connection she laughed you like them of course they are of your own country you shall have more of them she nodded and went away to greet a guest who had just come in a few moments later horace then a beautiful lad in eton clothes brought another cup of tea and a plate of cakes for bouchalka we sat down in a corner and talked about his songs he was neither boastful nor deprecatory he knew exactly in what respects they were excellent i decided as i watched his face that he must be under thirty the deep lines in his forehead probably came there from his habit of frowning densely when he struggled to express himself and suddenly elevating his coalblack eyebrows when his ideas cleared his teeth were white very irregular and interesting the corrective methods of modern dentistry would have taken away half his good looks his mouth would have been much less attractive for any rearranging of those long narrow overcrowded teeth along with his frown and his way of thrusting out his lip they contributed somehow to the engaging impetuousness of his conversation as we talked about his songs his manner changed before that he had seemed responsive and easily pleased now he grew abstracted as if i had taken away his pleasant afternoon and wakened him to his miseries he moved restlessly in his clothes when i mentioned puccini he held his head in his hands why is it they like that always and always a little oh yes very nice but so much always the same thing why he pierced me with the despairing glance which had followed us out of the restaurant i asked him whether he had sent any of his songs to the publishers and named one whom i knew to be discriminating he shrugged his shoulders they not want bohemian songs they not want my music even the street cars will not stop for me here like for other people every time i wait on the corner until somebody else make a signal to the car and then it stop but not for me most people cannot become utterly poor whatever happens they can right themselves a little but one felt that bouchalka was the sort of person who might actually starve or blow his brains out something very important had been left out either of his makeup or of his education something that we are not accustomed to miss in people gradually the parlour was filled with little groups of friends and i took bouchalka back to the musicroom where cressida was surrounded by her guests feathered women with large sleeves and hats young men of no importance in frock coats with shining hair and the smile which is intended to say so many flattering things but which really expresses little more than a desire to get on the older men were standing about waiting for a word а deux with the hostess to these people bouchalka had nothing to say he stood stiffly at the outer edge of the circle watching cressida with intent impatient eyes until under the pretext of showing him a score she drew him into the alcove at the back end of the long room where she kept her musical library the bookcases ran from the floor to the ceiling there was a table and a readinglamp and a window seat looking upon the little walled garden two persons could be quite withdrawn there and yet be a part of the general friendly scene cressida took a score from the shelf and sat down with bouchalka upon the window seat the book open between them though neither of them looked at it again they fell to talking with great earnestness at last the bohemian pulled out a large yellowing silver watch held it up before him and stared at it a moment as if it were an object of horror he sprang up bent over cressidas hand and murmured something dashed into the hall and out of the front door without waiting for the maid to open it he had worn no overcoat apparently it was then seven oclock he would surely be late at his post in the uptown restaurant i hoped he would have wit enough to take the elevated after supper cressida told me his story his parents both poor musicians the mother a singer died while he was yet a baby and he was left to the care of an arbitrary uncle who resolved to make a priest of him he was put into a monastery school and kept there the organist and choirdirector fortunately for blasius was an excellent musician a man who had begun his career brilliantly but who had met with crushing sorrows and disappointments in the world he devoted himself to his talented pupil and was the only teacher the young man ever had at twentyone when he was ready for the novitiate blasius felt that the call of life was too strong for him and he ran away out into a world of which he knew nothing he tramped southward to vienna begging and playing his fiddle from town to town in vienna he fell in with a gipsy band which was being recruited for a paris restaurant and went with them to paris he played in cafйs and in cheap theatres did transcribing for a music publisher tried to get pupils for four years he was the mouse and hunger was the cat she kept him on the jump when he got work he did not understand why when he lost a job he did not understand why during the time when most of us acquire a practical sense get a halfunconscious knowledge of hard facts and market values he had been shut away from the world fed like the pigeons in the belltower of his monastery bouchalka had now been in new york a year and for all he knew about it cressida said he might have landed the day before yesterday several weeks went by and as bouchalka did not reappear on tenth street cressida and i went once more to the place where he had played only to find another violinist leading the orchestra we summoned the proprietor a swissitalian polite and solicitous he told us the gentleman was not playing there any more was playing somewhere else but he had forgotten where we insisted upon talking to the old pianist who at last reluctantly admitted that the bohemian had been dismissed he had arrived very late one sunday night three weeks ago and had hot words with the proprietor he had been late before and had been warned he was a very talented fellow but wild and not to be depended upon the old man gave us the address of a french boardinghouse on seventh avenue where bouchalka used to room we drove there at once but the woman who kept the place said that he had gone away two weeks before leaving no address as he never got letters another bohemian who did engraving on glass had a room with her and when he came home perhaps he could tell where bouchalka was for they were friends it took us several days to run bouchalka down but when we did find him cressida promptly busied herself in his behalf she sang his sarka with the metropolitan opera orchestra at a sunday night concert she got him a position with the symphony orchestra and persuaded the conservative hempfstangle quartette to play one of his chamber compositions from manuscript she aroused the interest of a publisher in his work and introduced him to people who were helpful to him by the new year bouchalka was fairly on his feet he had proper clothes now and cressidas friends found him attractive he was usually at her house on sunday afternoons so usually indeed that poppas began pointedly to absent himself when other guests arrived the bohemian and his patroness were always found at the critical point of discussion at the piano by the fire in the alcove at the end of the room both of them interested and animated he was invariably respectful and admiring deferring to her in every tone and gesture and she was perceptibly pleased and flattered as if all this were new to her and she were tasting the sweetness of a first success one wild day in march cressida burst tempestuously into my apartment and threw herself down declaring that she had just come from the most trying rehearsal she had ever lived through when i tried to question her about it she replied absently and continued to shiver and crouch by the fire suddenly she rose walked to the window and stood looking out over the square glittering with ice and rain and strewn with the wrecks of umbrellas when she turned again she approached me with determination i shall have to ask you to go with me she said firmly that crazy bouchalka has gone and got a pleurisy or something it may be pneumonia there is an epidemic of it just now ive sent dr brooks to him but i can never tell anything from what a doctor says ive got to see bouchalka and his nurse and what sort of place hes in ive been rehearsing all day and im singing tomorrow night i cant have so much on my mind can you come with me it will save time in the end i put on my furs and we went down to cressidas carriage waiting below she gave the driver a number on seventh avenue and then began feeling her throat with the alarmed expression which meant that she was not going to talk we drove in silence to the address and by this time it was growing dark the french landlady was a cordial comfortable person who took cressida in at a glance and seemed much impressed cressidas incognito was never successful her black gown was inconspicuous enough but over it she wore a dark purple velvet carriage coat lined with fur and furred at the cuffs and collar the frenchwomans eye ran over it delightedly and scrutinized the veil which only halfconcealed the wellknown face behind it she insisted upon conducting us up to the fourth floor herself running ahead of us and turning up the gas jets in the dark mustysmelling halls i suspect that she tarried outside the door after we sent the nurse for her walk we found the sick man in a great walnut bed a relic of the better days which this lodging house must have seen the grimy red plush carpet the red velvet chairs with broken springs the double giltframed mirror above the mantel had all been respectable substantial contributions to comfort in their time the fireplace was now empty and grateless and an illsmelling gas stove burned in its sooty recess under the cracked marble the huge arched windows were hung with heavy red curtains pinned together and lightly stirred by the wind which rattled the loose frames i was examining these things while cressida bent over bouchalka her carriage cloak she threw over the foot of his bed either from a protective impulse or because there was no place else to put it after she had greeted him and seated herself the sick man reached down and drew the cloak up over him looking at it with weak childish pleasure and stroking the velvet with his long fingers couleur de gloire couleur des reines i heard him murmur he thrust the sleeve under his chin and closed his eyes his loud rapid breathing was the only sound in the room if cressida brushed back his hair or touched his hand he looked up long enough to give her a smile of utter adoration naive and uninquiring as if he were smiling at a dream or a miracle the nurse was gone for an hour and we sat quietly cressida with her eyes fixed on bouchalka and i absorbed in the strange atmosphere of the house which seemed to seep in under the door and through the walls occasionally we heard a call for de leau chaude and the heavy trot of a serving woman on the stairs on the floor below somebody was struggling with schuberts marche militaire on a coarsetoned upright piano sometimes when a door was opened one could hear a parrot screaming voilа voilа tonnerre the house was built before as one could tell from windows and mouldings and the walls were thick the sounds were not disturbing and bouchalka was probably used to them when the nurse returned and we rose to go bouchalka still lay with his cheek on her cloak and cressida left it it seems to please him she murmured as we went down the stairs i can go home without a wrap its not far i had of course to give her my furs as i was not singing donna anna tomorrow evening and she was after this i was not surprised by any devout attitude in which i happened to find the bohemian when i entered cressidas musicroom unannounced or by any radiance on her face when she rose from the windowseat in the alcove and came down the room to greet me bouchalka was of course very often at the opera now on almost any night when cressida sang one could see his narrow black head high above the temples and rather constrained behind the ears peering from some part of the house i used to wonder what he thought of cressida as an artist but probably he did not think seriously at all a great voice a handsome woman a great prestige all added together made a great artist the common synonym for success her success and the material evidences of it quite blinded him i could never draw from him anything adequate about anna straka cressidas slavic rival and this perhaps meant that he considered comparison disloyal all the while that cressida was singing reliably and satisfying the management straka was singing uncertainly and making history her voice was primarily defective and her immediate vocal method was bad cressida was always living up to her contract delivering the whole order in good condition while the slav was sometimes almost voiceless sometimes inspired she put you off with a hope a promise time after time but she was quite as likely to put you off with a revelation with an interpretation that was inimitable unrepeatable bouchalka was not a reflective person he had his own idea of what a great prima donna should be like and he took it for granted that mme garnet corresponded to his conception the curious thing was that he managed to impress his idea upon cressida herself she began to see herself as he saw her to try to be like the notion of her that he carried somewhere in that pointed head of his she was exalted quite beyond herself things that had been chilled under the grind came to life in her that winter with the breath of bouchalkas adoration then if ever in her life she heard the bird sing on the branch outside her window and she wished she were younger lovelier freer she wished there were no poppas no horace no garnets she longed to be only the bewitching creature bouchalka imagined her one april day when we were driving in the park cressida superb in a greenandprimrose costume hurried over from paris turned to me smiling and said do you know this is the first spring i havent dreaded its the first one ive ever really had perhaps people never have more than one whether it comes early or late she told me that she was overwhelmingly in love our visit to bouchalka when he was ill had of course been reported and the men about the opera house had made of it the only story they have the wit to invent they could no more change the pattern of that story than the spider could change the design of its web but being as she said in love suggested to cressida only one plan of action to have the tenth street house done over to put more money into her brothers business send horace to school raise poppas percentage and then with a clear conscience be married in the church of the ascension she went through this program with her usual thoroughness she was married in june and sailed immediately with her husband poppas was to join them in vienna in august when she would begin to work again from her letters i gathered that all was going well even beyond her hopes when they returned in october both cressida and blasius seemed changed for the better she was perceptibly freshened and renewed she attacked her work at once with more vigour and more ease did not drive herself so relentlessly a little carelessness became her wonderfully bouchalka was less gaunt and much less flighty and perverse his frank pleasure in the comfort and order of his wifes establishment was ingratiating even if it was a little amusing cressida had the sewingroom at the top of the house made over into a study for him when i went up there to see him i usually found him sitting before the fire or walking about with his hands in his coat pockets admiring his new possessions he explained the ingenious arrangement of his study to me a dozen times with cressidas friends and guests bouchalka assumed nothing for himself his deportment amounted to a quiet unobtrusive appreciation of her and of his good fortune he was proud to owe his wife so much cressidas sunday afternoons were more popular than ever since she herself had so much more heart for them bouchalkas picturesque presence stimulated her graciousness and charm one still found them conversing together as eagerly as in the days when they saw each other but seldom consequently their guests were never bored we felt as if the tenth street house had a pleasant climate quite its own in the spring when the metropolitan company went on tour cressidas husband accompanied her and afterward they again sailed for genoa during the second winter people began to say that bouchalka was becoming too thoroughly domesticated and that since he was growing heavier in body he was less attractive i noticed his increasing reluctance to stir abroad nobody could say that he was wild now he seemed to dread leaving the house even for an evening why should he go out he said when he had everything he wanted at home he published very little one was given to understand that he was writing an opera he lived in the tenth street house like a tropical plant under glass nowhere in new york could he get such cookery as ruzenkas ruzenka little rose had like her mistress bloomed afresh now that she had a man and a compatriot to cook for her invention was tireless and she took things with a high hand in the kitchen confident of a perfect appreciation she was a plump fair blueeyed girl giggly and easily flattered with teeth like cream she was passionately domestic and her mind was full of homely stories and proverbs and superstitions which she somehow worked into her cookery she and bouchalka had between them a whole literature of traditions about sauces and fish and pastry the cellar was full of the wines he liked and ruzenka always knew what wines to serve with the dinner blasius monastery had been famous for good living that winter was a very cold one and i think the even temperature of the house enslaved bouchalka imagine it he once said to me when i dropped in during a blinding snowstorm and found him reading before the fire to be warm all the time every day it is like aladdin in paris i have had weeks together when i was not warm once when i did not have a bath once like the cats in the street the nights were a misery people have terrible dreams when they are so cold here i waken up in the night so warm i do not know what it means her door is open and i turn on my light i cannot believe in myself until i see that she is there i began to think that bouchalkas wildness had been the desperation which the tamest animals exhibit when they are tortured or terrorized naturally luxurious he had suffered more than most men under the pinch of penury those first beautiful compositions full of the folkmusic of his own country had been wrung out of him by homesickness and heartache i wondered whether he could compose only under the spur of hunger and loneliness and whether his talent might not subside with his despair some such apprehension must have troubled cressida though his gratitude would have been propitiatory to a more exacting taskmaster she had always liked to make people happy and he was the first one who had accepted her bounty without sourness when he did not accompany her upon her spring tour cressida said it was because travelling interfered with composition but i felt that she was deeply disappointed blasius or blavzej as his wife had with difficulty learned to call him was not showy or extravagant he hated hotels even the best of them cressida had always fought for the hearthstone and the fireside and the humour of destiny is sometimes to give us too much of what we desire i believe she would have preferred even enthusiasm about other women to his utter oisivetй it was his old fire not his docility that had won her during the third season after her marriage cressida had only twentyfive performances at the metropolitan and she was singing out of town a great deal her husband did not bestir himself to accompany her but he attended very faithfully to her correspondence and to her business at home he had no ambitious schemes to increase her fortune and he carried out her directions exactly nevertheless cressida faced her concert tours somewhat grimly and she seldom talked now about their plans for the future the crisis in this growing estrangement came about by accident one of those chance occurrences that affect our lives more than years of ordered effort and it came in an inverted form of a situation old to comedy cressida had been on the road for several weeks singing in minneapolis cleveland st paul then up into canada and back to boston from boston she was to go directly to chicago coming down on the five oclock train and taking the eleven over the lake shore for the west by her schedule she would have time to change cars comfortably at the grand central station on the journey down from boston she was seized with a great desire to see blasius she decided against her custom one might say against her principles to risk a performance with the chicago orchestra without rehearsal to stay the night in new york and go west by the afternoon train the next day she telegraphed chicago but she did not telegraph blasius because she wished the old fallacy of affection to surprise him she could take it for granted that at eleven on a cold winter night he would be in the tenth street house and nowhere else in new york she sent poppas paler than usual with accusing scorn and her trunks on to chicago and with only her travelling bag and a sense of being very audacious in her behaviour and still very much in love she took a cab for tenth street since it was her intention to disturb blasius as little as possible and to delight him as much as possible she let herself in with her latchkey and went directly to his room she did not find him there indeed she found him where he should not have been at all there must have been a trying scene ruzenka was sent away in the morning and the other two maids as well by eight oclock cressida and bouchalka had the house to themselves nobody had any breakfast cressida took the afternoon train to keep her engagement with theodore thomas and to think over the situation blasius was left in the tenth street house with only the furnace mans wife to look after him his explanation of his conduct was that he had been drinking too much his digression he swore was casual it had never occurred before and he could only appeal to his wifes magnanimity but it was on the whole easier for cressida to be firm than to be yielding and she knew herself too well to attempt a readjustment she had never made shabby compromises and it was too late for her to begin when she returned to new york she went to a hotel and she never saw bouchalka alone again since he admitted her charge the legal formalities were conducted so quietly that the granting of her divorce was announced in the morning papers before her friends knew that there was the least likelihood of one cressidas concert tours had interrupted the hospitalities of the house while the lawyers were arranging matters bouchalka came to see me he was remorseful and miserable enough and i think his perplexity was quite sincere if there had been an intrigue with a woman of her own class an infatuation an affair he said he could understand but anything so venial and accidental he shook his head slowly back and forth he assured me that he was not at all himself on that fateful evening and that when he recovered himself he would have sent ruzenka away making proper provision for her of course it was an ugly thing but ugly things sometimes happened in ones life and one had to put them away and forget them he could have overlooked any accident that might have occurred when his wife was on the road with poppas for example i cut him short and he bent his head to my reproof i know he said such things are different with her but when have i said that i am noble as she is never but i have appreciated and i have adored about me say what you like but if you say that in this there was any mйprise to my wife that is not true i have lost all my place here i came in from the streets but i understand her and all the fine things in her better than any of you here if that accident had not been she would have lived happy with me for years as for me i have never believed in this happiness i was not born under a good star how did it come by accident it goes by accident she tried to give good fortune to an unfortunate man un miserable that was her mistake it cannot be done in this world the lucky should marry the lucky bouchalka stopped and lit a cigarette he sat sunk in my chair as if he never meant to get up again his large hands now so much plumper than when i first knew him hung limp when he had consumed his cigarette he turned to me again i too have tried have i so much as written one note to a lady since she first put out her hand to help me some of the artists who sing my compositions have been quite willing to plague my wife a little if i make the least sign with the espaсola for instance i have had to be very stern farouche she is so very playful i have never given my wife the slightest annoyance of this kind since i married her i have not kissed the cheek of one lady then one night i am bored and drink too much champagne and i become a fool what does it matter did my wife marry the fool of me no she married me with my mind and my feelings all here as i am today but she is getting a divorce from the fool of me which she would never see anyhow the stupidity which excuse me is the thing she will not overlook even in her memory of me she will be harsh his view of his conduct and its consequences was fatalistic he was meant to have just so much misery every day of his life for three years it had been withheld had been piling up somewhere underground overhead now the accumulation burst over him he had come to pay his respects to me he said to declare his undying gratitude to madame garnet and to bid me farewell he took up his hat and cane and kissed my hand i have never seen him since cressida made a settlement upon him but even poppas tortured by envy and curiosity never discovered how much it was it was very little she told me pour des gвteaux she added with a smile that was not unforgiving she could not bear to think of his being in want when so little could make him comfortable he went back to his own village in bohemia he wrote her that the old monk his teacher was still alive and that from the windows of his room in the town he could see the pigeons flying forth from and back to the monastery belltower all day long he sent her a song with his own words about those pigeons quite a lovely thing he was the bell tower and les colombes were his memories of her iv jerome brown proved on the whole the worst of cressidas husbands and with the possible exception of her eldest brother buchanan garnet he was the most rapacious of the men with whom she had had to do it was one thing to gratify every wish of a cakeloving fellow like bouchalka but quite another to stand behind a financier and brown would be a financier or nothing after her marriage with him cressida grew rapidly older for the first time in her life she wanted to go abroad and live to get jerome brown away from the scene of his unsuccessful but undiscouraged activities but brown was not a man who could be amused and kept out of mischief in continental hotels he had to be a figure if only a mark in wall street nothing else would gratify his peculiar vanity the deeper he went in the more affectionately he told cressida that now all her cares and anxieties were over to try to get related facts out of his optimism was like trying to find framework in a feather bed all cressida knew was that she was perpetually investing to save investments when she told me she had put a mortgage on the tenth street house her eyes filled with tears why is it i have never cared about money except to make people happy with it and it has been the curse of my life it has spoiled all my relations with people fortunately she added irrelevantly drying her eyes jerome and poppas get along well jerome could have got along with anybody that is a promoters business his warm hand his flushed face his bright eye and his newest funny story poppas had no weapons that could do execution with a man like that though browns ventures never came home there was nothing openly disastrous until the outbreak of the revolution in mexico jeopardized his interests there then cressida went to england where she could always raise money from a faithful public for a winter concert tour when she sailed her friends knew that her husbands affairs were in a bad way but we did not know how bad until after cressidas death cressida garnet as all the world knows was lost on the titanic poppas and horace who had been travelling with her were sent on a week earlier and came as safely to port as if they had never stepped out of their london hotel but cressida had waited for the first trip of the sea monster she still believed that all advertising was good and she went down on the road between the old world and the new she had been ill and when the collision occurred she was in her stateroom a modest one somewhere down in the boat for she was travelling economically apparently she never left her cabin she was not seen on the decks and none of the survivors brought any word of her on monday when the wireless messages were coming from the carpathia with the names of the passengers who had been saved i went with so many hundred others down to the white star offices there i saw cressidas motor her redoubtable initials on the door with four men sitting in the limousine jerome brown stripped of the promoters joviality and looking flabby and old sat behind with buchanan garnet who had come on from ohio i had not seen him for years he was now an old man but he was still conscious of being in the public eye and sat turning a cigar about in his face with that foolish look of importance which cressidas achievement had stamped upon all the garnets poppas was in front with horace he was gnawing the finger of his chamois glove as it rested on the top of his cane his head was sunk his shoulders drawn together he looked as old as jewry i watched them wondering whether cressida would come back to them if she could after the last names were posted the four men settled back into the powerful car one of the best made and the chauffeur backed off i saw him dash away the tears from his face with the back of his driving glove he was an irish boy and had been devoted to cressida when the will was read henry gilbert the lawyer an old friend of her early youth and i were named executors a nice job we had of it most of her large fortune had been converted into stocks that were almost worthless the marketable property realized only a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to defeat the bequest of fifty thousand dollars to poppas jerome brown and her family contested the will they brought cressidas letters into court to prove that the will did not represent her intentions often expressed in writing through many years to provide well for them such letters they were the writing of a tired overdriven woman promising money sending money herewith asking for an acknowledgment of the draft sent last month etc in the letters to jerome brown she begged for information about his affairs and entreated him to go with her to some foreign city where they could live quietly and where she could rest if they were careful there would be enough for all neither brown nor her brothers and sisters had any sense of shame about these letters it seemed never to occur to them that this golden stream whether it rushed or whether it trickled came out of the industry out of the mortal body of a woman they regarded her as a natural source of wealth a copper vein a diamond mine henry gilbert is a good lawyer himself and he employed an able man to defend the will we determined that in this crisis we would stand by poppas believing it would be cressidas wish out of the lot of them he was the only one who had helped her to make one penny of the money that had brought her so much misery he was at least more deserving than the others we saw to it that poppas got his fifty thousand and he actually departed at last for his city in la sainte asie where it never rains and where he will never again have to hold a hot water bottle to his face the rest of the property was fought for to a finish poppas out of the way horace and brown and the garnets quarrelled over her personal effects they went from floor to floor of the tenth street house the will provided that cressidas jewels and furs and gowns were to go to her sisters georgie and julia wrangled over them down to the last moleskin they were deeply disappointed that some of the muffs and stoles which they remembered as very large proved when exhumed from storage and exhibited beside furs of a modern cut to be ridiculously scant a year ago the sisters were still reasoning with each other about pearls and opals and emeralds i wrote poppas some account of these horrors as during the court proceedings we had become rather better friends than of old his reply arrived only a few days ago a photograph of himself upon a camel under which is written traulich und treu ists nur in der tiefe falsch und feig ist was dort oben sich freut his reply and the memories it awakens memories which have followed poppas into the middle of asia seemingly prompted this informal narration a gold slipper marshall mckann followed his wife and her friend mrs post down the aisle and up the steps to the stage of the carnegie music hall with an illconcealed feeling of grievance heaven knew he never went to concerts and to be mounted upon the stage in this fashion as if he were a highbrow from sewickley or some unfortunate with a musical wife was ludicrous a man went to concerts when he was courting while he was a junior partner when he became a person of substance he stopped that sort of nonsense his wife too was a sensible person the daughter of an old pittsburgh family as solid and wellrooted as the mckanns she would never have bothered him about this concert had not the meddlesome mrs post arrived to pay her a visit mrs post was an old school friend of mrs mckann and because she lived in cincinnati she was always keeping up with the world and talking about things in which no one else was interested music among them she was an aggressive lady with weighty opinions and a deep voice like a jovial bassoon she had arrived only last night and at dinner she brought it out that she could on no account miss kitty ayrshires recital it was she said the sort of thing no one could afford to miss when mckann went into town in the morning he found that every seat in the musichall was sold he telephoned his wife to that effect and thinking he had settled the matter made his reservation on the train for new york he was unable to get a drawingroom because this same kitty ayrshire had taken the last one he had not intended going to new york until the following week but he preferred to be absent during mrs posts incumbency in the middle of the morning when he was deep in his correspondence his wife called him up to say the enterprising mrs post had telephoned some musical friends in sewickley and had found that two hundred foldingchairs were to be placed on the stage of the concerthall behind the piano and that they would be on sale at noon would he please get seats in the front row mckann asked if they would not excuse him since he was going over to new york on the late train would be tired and would not have time to dress etc no not at all it would be foolish for two women to trail up to the stage unattended mrs posts husband always accompanied her to concerts and she expected that much attention from her host he neednt dress and he could take a taxi from the concerthall to the east liberty station the outcome of it all was that though his bag was at the station here was mckann in the worst possible humour facing the large audience to which he was well known and sitting among a lot of music students and excitable old maids only the desperately zealous or the morbidly curious would endure two hours in those wooden chairs and he sat in the front row of this hectic body somehow made a party to a transaction for which he had the utmost contempt when mckann had been in paris kitty ayrshire was singing at the comique and he wouldnt go to hear her even there where one found so little that was better to do she was too much talked about too much advertised always being thrust in an americans face as if she were something to be proud of perfumes and petticoats and cutlets were named for her some one had pointed kitty out to him one afternoon when she was driving in the bois with a french composer old enough he judged to be her father who was said to be infatuated carried away by her mckann was told that this was one of the historic passions of old age he had looked at her on that occasion but she was so befrilled and befeathered that he caught nothing but a graceful outline and a small dark head above a white ostrich boa he had noted with disgust however the stooped shoulders and white imperial of the silkhatted man beside her and the senescent line of his back mckann described to his wife this unpleasing picture only last night while he was undressing when he was making every possible effort to avert this concert party but bessie only looked superior and said she wished to hear kitty ayrshire sing and that her private life was something in which she had no interest well here he was hot and uncomfortable in a chair much too small for him with a row of blinding footlights glaring in his eyes suddenly the door at his right elbow opened their seats were at one end of the front row he had thought they would be less conspicuous there than in the centre and he had not foreseen that the singer would walk over him every time she came upon the stage her velvet train brushed against his trousers as she passed him the applause which greeted her was neither overwhelming nor prolonged her conservative audience did not know exactly how to accept her toilette they were accustomed to dignified concert gowns like those which pittsburgh matrons in those days wore at their daughters comingout teas kittys gown that evening was really quite outrageous the repartйe of a conscienceless parisian designer who took her hint that she wished something that would be entirely novel in the states today after we have all of us even in the uttermost provinces been educated by baskt and the various ballets russes we would accept such a gown without distrust but then it was a little disconcerting even to the welldisposed it was constructed of a yard or two of green velvet a reviling shrieking green which would have made a fright of any woman who had not inextinguishable beauty and it was made without armholes a device to which we were then so unaccustomed that it was nothing less than alarming the velvet skirt split back from a transparent goldlace petticoat gold stockings gold slippers the narrow train was apparently looped to both ankles and it kept curling about her feet like a serpents tail turning up its gold lining as if it were squirming over on its back it was not we felt a costume in which to sing mozart and handel and beethoven kitty sensed the chill in the air and it amused her she liked to be thought a brilliant artist by other artists but by the world at large she liked to be thought a daring creature she had every reason to believe from experience and from example that to shock the great crowd was the surest way to get its money and to make her name a household word nobody ever became a household word of being an artist surely and you were not a thoroughly paying proposition until your name meant something on the sidewalk and in the barbershop kitty studied her audience with an appraising eye she liked the stimulus of this disapprobation as she faced this hardshelled public she felt keen and interested she knew that she would give such a recital as cannot often be heard for money she nodded gaily to the young man at the piano fell into an attitude of seriousness and began the group of beethoven and mozart songs though mckann would not have admitted it there were really a great many people in the concerthall who knew what the prodigal daughter of their country was singing and how well she was doing it they thawed gradually under the beauty of her voice and the subtlety of her interpretation she had sung seldom in concert then and they had supposed her very dependent upon the accessories of the opera clean singing finished artistry were not what they expected from her they began to feel even the wayward charm of her personality mckann who stared coldly up at the balconies during her first song during the second glanced cautiously at the green apparition before him he was vexed with her for having retained a dйbutante figure he comfortably classed all singers especially operatic singers as fat dutchwomen or shifty sadies and kitty would not fit into his clever generalization she displayed under his nose the only kind of figure he considered worth looking at that of a very young girl supple and sinuous and quicksilverish thin eager shoulders polished white arms that were nowhere too fat and nowhere too thin mckann found it agreeable to look at kitty but when he saw that the authoritative mrs post red as a turkeycock with opinions she was bursting to impart was studying and appraising the singer through her lorgnette he gazed indifferently out into the house again he felt for his watch but his wife touched him warningly with her elbow which he noticed was not at all like kittys when miss ayrshire finished her first group of songs her audience expressed its approval positively but guardedly she smiled bewitchingly upon the people in front glanced up at the balconies and then turned to the company huddled on the stage behind her after her gay and careless bows she retreated toward the stage door as she passed mckann she again brushed lightly against him and this time she paused long enough to glance down at him and murmur pardon in the moment her bright curious eyes rested upon him mckann seemed to see himself as if she were holding a mirror up before him he beheld himself a heavy solid figure unsuitably clad for the time and place with a florid square face wellvisored with good living and sane opinions an inexpressive countenance not a rock face exactly but a kind of pressedbrickandcement face a business face upon which years and feelings had made no mark in which cocktails might eventually blast out a few hollows he had never seen himself so distinctly in his shavingglass as he did in that instant when kitty ayrshires liquid eye held him when her bright inquiring glance roamed over his person after her prehensile train curled over his boot and she was gone his wife turned to him and said in the tone of approbation one uses when an infant manifests its groping intelligence very gracious of her im sure mrs post nodded oracularly mckann grunted kitty began her second number a group of romantic german songs which were altogether more her affair than her first number when she turned once to acknowledge the applause behind her she caught mckann in the act of yawning behind his hand he of course wore no gloves and he thought she frowned a little this did not embarrass him it somehow made him feel important when she retired after the second part of the program she again looked him over curiously as she passed and she took marked precaution that her dress did not touch him mrs post and his wife again commented upon her consideration the final number was made up of modern french songs which kitty sang enchantingly and at last her frigid public was thoroughly aroused while she was coming back again and again to smile and curtsy mckann whispered to his wife that if there were to be encores he had better make a dash for his train not at all put in mrs post kitty is going on the same train she sings in faust at the opera tomorrow night so shell take no chances mckann once more told himself how sorry he felt for post at last miss ayrshire returned escorted by her accompanist and gave the people what she of course knew they wanted the most popular aria from the french opera of which the titlerфle had become synonymous with her name an opera written for her and to her and round about her by the veteran french composer who adored her the last and not the palest flash of his creative fire this brought her audience all the way they clamoured for more of it but she was not to be coerced she had been unyielding through storms to which this was a summer breeze she came on once more shrugged her shoulders blew them a kiss and was gone her last smile was for that uncomfortable part of her audience seated behind her and she looked with recognition at mckann and his ladies as she nodded good night to the wooden chairs mckann hurried his charges into the foyer by the nearest exit and put them into his motor then he went over to the schenley to have a glass of beer and a rarebit before traintime he had not he admitted to himself been so much bored as he pretended the minx herself was well enough but it was absurd in his fellowtownsmen to look owlish and uplifted about her he had no rooted dislike for pretty women he even didnt deny that gay girls had their place in the world but they ought to be kept in their place he was born a presbyterian just as he was born a mckann he sat in his pew in the first church every sunday and he never missed a presbytery meeting when he was in town his religion was not very spiritual certainly but it was substantial and concrete made up of good hard convictions and opinions it had something to do with citizenship with whom one ought to marry with the coal business in which his own name was powerful with the republican party and with all majorities and established precedents he was hostile to fads to enthusiasms to individualism to all changes except in mining machinery and in methods of transportation his equanimity restored by his lunch at the schenley mckann lit a big cigar got into his taxi and bowled off through the sleet there was not a sound to be heard or a light to be seen the ice glittered on the pavement and on the naked trees no restless feet were abroad at eleven oclock the rows of small comfortable houses looked as empty of the troublesome bubble of life as the allegheny cemetery itself suddenly the cab stopped and mckann thrust his head out of the window a woman was standing in the middle of the street addressing his driver in a tone of excitement over against the curb a lone electric stood despondent in the storm the young woman her cloak blowing about her turned from the driver to mckann himself speaking rapidly and somewhat incoherently could you not be so kind as to help us it is mees ayrshire the singer the juice is gone out and we cannot move we must get to the station mademoiselle cannot miss the train she sings tomorrow night in new york it is very important could you not take us to the station at east liberty mckann opened the door thats all right but youll have to hurry its eleventen now youve only got fifteen minutes to make the train tell her to come along the maid drew back and looked up at him in amazement but the handluggage to carry and mademoiselle to walk the street is like glass mckann threw away his cigar and followed her he stood silent by the door of the derelict while the maid explained that she had found help the driver had gone off somewhere to telephone for a car miss ayrshire seemed not at all apprehensive she had not doubted that a rescuer would be forthcoming she moved deliberately out of a whirl of skirts she thrust one furtopped shoe mckann saw the flash of the gold stocking above it and alighted so kind of you so fortunate for us she murmured one hand she placed upon his sleeve and in the other she carried an armful of roses that had been sent up to the concert stage the petals showered upon the sooty sleety pavement as she picked her way along they would be lying there tomorrow morning and the children in those houses would wonder if there had been a funeral the maid followed with two leather bags as soon as he had lifted kitty into his cab she exclaimed my jewelcase i have forgotten it it is on the back seat please i am so careless he dashed back ran his hand along the cushions and discovered a small leather bag when he returned he found the maid and the luggage bestowed on the front seat and a place left for him on the back seat beside kitty and her flowers shall we be taking you far out of your way she asked sweetly i havent an idea where the station is im not even sure about the name cйline thinks it is east liberty but i think it is west liberty an odd name anyway it is a bohemian quarter perhaps a district where the law relaxes a trifle mckann replied grimly that he didnt think the name referred to that kind of liberty so much the better sighed kitty i am a californian thats the only part of america i know very well and out there when we called a place liberty hill or liberty hollow well we meant it you will excuse me if im uncommunicative wont you i must not talk in this raw air my throat is sensitive after a long program she lay back in her corner and closed her eyes when the cab rolled down the incline at east liberty station the new york express was whistling in a porter opened the door mckann sprang out gave him a claim check and his pullman ticket and told him to get his bag at the checkstand and rush it on that train miss ayrshire having gathered up her flowers put out her hand to take his arm why its you she exclaimed as she saw his face in the light what a coincidence she made no further move to alight but sat smiling as if she had just seated herself in a drawingroom and were ready for talk and a cup of tea mckann caught her arm you must hurry miss ayrshire if you mean to catch that train it stops here only a moment can you run can i run she laughed try me as they raced through the tunnel and up the inside stairway mckann admitted that he had never before made a dash with feet so quick and sure stepping out beside him the whitefurred boots chased each other like lambs at play the gold stockings flashed like the spokes of a bicycle wheel in the sun they reached the door of miss ayrshires stateroom just as the train began to pull out mckann was ashamed of the way he was panting for kittys breathing was as soft and regular as when she was reclining on the back seat of his taxi it had somehow run in his head that all these stage women were a poor lot physically unsound overfed creatures like canaries that are kept in a cage and stuffed with songrestorer he retreated to escape her thanks good night pleasant journey pleasant dreams with a friendly nod in kittys direction he closed the door behind him he was somewhat surprised to find his own bag his pullman ticket in the strap on the seat just outside kittys door but there was nothing strange about it he had got the last section left on the train no next the drawingroom every other berth in the car was made up he was just starting to look for the porter when the door of the stateroom opened and kitty ayrshire came out she seated herself carelessly in the front seat beside his bag please talk to me a little she said coaxingly im always wakeful after i sing and i have to hunt some one to talk to cйline and i get so tired of each other we can speak very low and we shall not disturb any one she crossed her feet and rested her elbow on his gladstone though she still wore her gold slippers and stockings she did not he thanked heaven have on her concert gown but a very demure black velvet with some sort of pearl trimming about the neck wasnt it funny she proceeded that it happened to be you who picked me up i wanted a word with you anyway mckann smiled in a way that meant he wasnt being taken in did you we are not very old acquaintances no perhaps not but you disapproved tonight and i thought i was singing very well you are very critical in such matters he had been standing but now he sat down my dear young lady i am not critical at all i know nothing about such matters and care less she said for him well then we know where we are in so far as that is concerned what did displease you my gown perhaps it may seem a little outrй here but its the sort of thing all the imaginative designers abroad are doing you like the english sort of concert gown better about gowns said mckann i know even less than about music if i looked uncomfortable it was probably because i was uncomfortable the seats were bad and the lights were annoying kitty looked up with solicitude i was sorry they sold those seats i dont like to make people uncomfortable in any way did the lights give you a headache they are very trying they burn ones eyes out in the end i believe she paused and waved the porter away with a smile as he came toward them halfclad pittsburghers were tramping up and down the aisle casting sidelong glances at mckann and his companion how much better they look with all their clothes on she murmured then turning directly to mckann again i saw you were not well seated but i felt something quite hostile and personal you were displeased with me doubtless many people are but i seldom get an opportunity to question them it would be nice if you took the trouble to tell me why you were displeased she spoke frankly pleasantly without a shadow of challenge or hauteur she did not seem to be angling for compliments mckann settled himself in his seat he thought he would try her out she had come for it and he would let her have it he found however that it was harder to formulate the grounds of his disapproval than he would have supposed now that he sat face to face with her now that she was leaning against his bag he had no wish to hurt her im a hardheaded business man he said evasively and i dont much believe in any of you fluffyruffles people i have a sort of natural distrust of them all the men more than the women she looked thoughtful artists you mean drawing her words slowly what is your business coal i dont feel any natural distrust of business men and i know ever so many i dont know any coalmen but i think i could become very much interested in coal am i largerminded than you mckann laughed i dont think you know when you are interested or when you are not i dont believe you know what it feels like to be really interested there is so much fake about your profession its an affectation on both sides i know a great many of the people who went to hear you tonight and i know that most of them neither know nor care anything about music they imagine they do because its supposed to be the proper thing kitty sat upright and looked interested she was certainly a lovely creature the only one of her tribe he had ever seen that he would cross the street to see again those were remarkable eyes she had curious penetrating restless somewhat impudent but not at all dulled by selfconceit but isnt that so in everything she cried how many of your clerks are honest because of a fine individual sense of honour they are honest because it is the accepted rule of good conduct in business do you know she looked at him squarely i thought you would have something quite definite to say to me but this is funnypaper stuff the sort of objection id expect from your officeboy then you dont think it silly for a lot of people to get together and pretend to enjoy something they know nothing about of course i think it silly but thats the way god made audiences dont people go to church in exactly the same way if there were a spiritualpressure testmachine at the door i suspect not many of you would get to your pews how do you know i go to church she shrugged her shoulders oh people with these old readymade opinions usually go to church but you cant evade me like that she tapped the edge of his seat with the toe of her gold slipper you sat there all evening glaring at me as if you could eat me alive now i give you a chance to state your objections and you merely criticize my audience what is it is it merely that you happen to dislike my personality in that case of course i wont press you no mckann frowned i perhaps dislike your professional personality as i told you i have a natural distrust of your variety natural i wonder kitty murmured i dont see why you should naturally dislike singers any more than i naturally dislike coalmen i dont classify people by their occupations doubtless i should find some coalmen repulsive and you may find some singers so but i have reason to believe that at least im one of the less repellent i dont doubt it mckann laughed and youre a shrewd woman to boot but you are all of you according to my standards light people youre brilliant some of you but youve no depth kitty seemed to assent with a dive of her girlish head well its a merit in some things to be heavy and in others to be light some things are meant to go deep and others to go high do you want all the women in the world to be profound you are all he went on steadily watching her with indulgence fed on hectic emotions you are pampered you dont help to carry the burdens of the world you are selfindulgent and appetent yes i am she assented with a candour which he did not expect not all artists are but i am why not if i could once get a convincing statement as to why i should not be selfindulgent i might change my ways as for the burdens of the world kitty rested her chin on her clasped hands and looked thoughtful one should give pleasure to others my dear sir granting that the great majority of people cant enjoy anything very keenly youll admit that i give pleasure to many more people than you do one should help others who are less fortunate at present i am supporting just eight people besides those i hire there was never another family in california that had so many cripples and hardluckers as that into which i had the honour to be born the only ones who could take care of themselves were ruined by the san francisco earthquake some time ago one should make personal sacrifices i do i give money and time and effort to talented students oh i give something much more than that something that you probably have never given to any one i give to the really gifted ones my wish my desire my light if i have any and that mr worldly wiseman is like giving ones blood its the kind of thing you prudent people never give that is what was in the box of precious ointment kitty threw off her fervour with a slight gesture as if it were a scarf and leaned back tucking her slipper up on the edge of his seat if you saw the houses i keep up she sighed and the people i employ and the motorcars i run and after all ive only this to do it with she indicated her slender person which marshall could almost have broken in two with his bare hands she was he thought very much like any other charming woman except that she was more so her familiarity was natural and simple she was at ease because she was not afraid of him or of herself or of certain halfclad acquaintances of his who had been wandering up and down the car oftener than was necessary well he was not afraid either kitty put her arms over her head and sighed again feeling the smooth part in her black hair her head was small capable of great agitation like a birds or of great resignation like a nuns i cant see why i shouldnt be selfindulgent when i indulge others i cant understand your equivocal scheme of ethics now i can understand count tolstoys perfectly i had a long talk with him once about his book what is art as nearly as i could get it he believes that we are a race who can exist only by gratifying appetites the appetites are evil and the existence they carry on is evil we were always sad he says without knowing why even in the stone age in some miraculous way a divine ideal was disclosed to us directly at variance with our appetites it gave us a new craving which we could only satisfy by starving all the other hungers in us happiness lies in ceasing to be and to cause being because the thing revealed to us is dearer than any existence our appetites can ever get for us i can understand that its something one often feels in art it is even the subject of the greatest of all operas which because i can never hope to sing it i love more than all the others kitty pulled herself up perhaps you agree with tolstoy she added languidly no i think hes a crank said mckann cheerfully what do you mean by a crank i mean an extremist kitty laughed weighty word youll always have a world full of people who keep to the golden mean why bother yourself about me and tolstoy i dont except when you bother me poor man its true this isnt your fault still you did provoke it by glaring at me why did you go to the concert i was dragged i might have known she chuckled and shook her head no you dont give me any good reasons your morality seems to me the compromise of cowardice apologetic and sneaking when righteousness becomes alive and burning you hate it as much as you do beauty you want a little of each in your life perhaps adulterated sterilized with the sting taken out its true enough they are both fearsome things when they get loose in the world they dont often mckann hated tall talk my views on women he said slowly are simple doubtless kitty responded dryly but are they consistent do you apply them to your stenographers as well as to me i take it for granted you have unmarried stenographers their position economically is the same as mine mckann studied the toe of her shoe with a woman everything comes back to one thing his manner was judicial she laughed indulgently so we are getting down to brass tacks eh i have beaten you in argument and now you are leading trumps she put her hands behind her head and her lips parted in a halfyawn does everything come back to one thing i wish i knew its more than likely that under the same conditions i should have been very like your stenographers if they are good ones whatever i was i would have been a good one i think people are very much alike you are more different than any one i have met for some time but i know that there are a great many more at home like you and even you i believe there is a real creature down under these custommade prejudices that save you the trouble of thinking if you and i were shipwrecked on a desert island i have no doubt that we would come to a simple and natural understanding im neither a coward nor a shirk you would find if you had to undertake any enterprise of danger or difficulty with a woman that there are several qualifications quite as important as the one to which you doubtless refer mckann felt nervously for his watchchain of course he brought out i am not laying down any generalizations his brows wrinkled oh arent you murmured kitty then i totally misunderstood but remember holding up a finger it is you not i who are afraid to pursue this subject further now ill tell you something she leaned forward and clasped her slim white hands about her velvet knee i am as much a victim of these ineradicable prejudices as you your stenographer seems to you a better sort well she does to me just because her life is presumably greyer than mine she seems better my mind tells me that dulness and a mediocre order of ability and poverty are not in themselves admirable things yet in my heart i always feel that the saleswomen in shops and the working girls in factories are more meritorious than i many of them with my opportunities would be more selfish than i am some of them with their own opportunities are more selfish yet i make this sentimental genuflection before the nun and the charwoman tell me havent you any weakness isnt there any foolish natural thing that unbends you a trifle and makes you feel gay i like to go fishing to see how many fish you can catch no i like the woods and the weather i like to play a fish and work hard for him i like the pussywillows and the cold and the sky whether its blue or grey night coming on every thing about it he spoke devoutly and kitty watched him through halfclosed eyes and you like to feel that there are lightminded girls like me who only care about the inside of shops and theatres and hotels eh you amuse me you and your fish but i mustnt keep you any longer havent i given you every opportunity to state your case against me i thought you would have more to say for yourself do you know i believe its not a case you have at all but a grudge i believe you are envious that youd like to be a tenor and a perfect ladykiller she rose smiling and paused with her hand on the door of her stateroom anyhow thank you for a pleasant evening and by the way dream of me tonight and not of either of those ladies who sat beside you it does not matter much whom we live with in this world but it matters a great deal whom we dream of she noticed his bricky flush you are very naive after all but oh so cautious you are naturally afraid of everything new just as i naturally want to try everything new people new religions new miseries even if only there were more new things if only you were really new i might learn something im like the queen of sheba im not above learning but you my friend would be afraid to try a new shaving soap it isnt gravitation that holds the world in place its the lazy obese cowardice of the people on it all the same taking his hand and smiling encouragingly im going to haunt you a little adios when kitty entered her stateroom cйline in her dressinggown was nodding by the window mademoiselle found the fat gentleman interesting she asked it is nearly one negatively interesting his kind always say the same thing if i could find one really intelligent man who held his views i should adopt them monsieur did not look like an original murmured cйline as she began to take down her ladys hair mckann slept heavily as usual and the porter had to shake him in the morning he sat up in his berth and after composing his hair with his fingers began to hunt about for his clothes as he put up the windowblind some bright object in the little hammock over his bed caught the sunlight and glittered he stared and picked up a delicately turned gold slipper minx hussy he ejaculated all that tall talk probably got it from some man who hangs about learned it off like a parrot did she poke this in here herself last night or did she send that sneakfaced frenchwoman i like her nerve he wondered whether he might have been breathing audibly when the intruder thrust her head between his curtains he was conscious that he did not look a prince charming in his sleep he dressed as fast as he could and when he was ready to go to the washroom glared at the slipper if the porter should start to make up his berth in his absence he caught the slipper wrapped it in his pajama jacket and thrust it into his bag he escaped from the train without seeing his tormentor again later mckann threw the slipper into the wastebasket in his room at the knickerbocker but the chambermaid seeing that it was new and mateless thought there must be a mistake and placed it in his clothescloset he found it there when he returned from the theatre that evening considerably mellowed by food and drink and cheerful company he took the slipper in his hand and decided to keep it as a reminder that absurd things could happen to people of the most clocklike deportment when he got back to pittsburgh he stuck it in a lockbox in his vault safe from prying clerks mckann has been ill for five years now poor fellow he still goes to the office because it is the only place that interests him but his partners do most of the work and his clerks find him sadly changed morbid they call his state of mind he has had the pinetrees in his yard cut down because they remind him of cemeteries on sundays or holidays when the office is empty and he takes his will or his insurancepolicies out of his lockbox he often puts the tarnished gold slipper on his desk and looks at it somehow it suggests life to his tired mind as his pinetrees suggested death life and youth when he drops over some day his executors will be puzzled by the slipper as for kitty ayrshire she has played so many jokes practical and impractical since then that she has long ago forgotten the night when she threw away a slipper to be a thorn in the side of a just man scandal kitty ayrshire had a cold a persistent inflammation of the vocal cords which defied the throat specialist week after week her name was posted at the opera and week after week it was canceled and the name of one of her rivals was substituted for nearly two months she had been deprived of everything she liked even of the people she liked and had been shut up until she had come to hate the glass windows between her and the world and the wintry stretch of the park they looked out upon she was losing a great deal of money and what was worse she was losing life days of which she wanted to make the utmost were slipping by and nights which were to have crowned the days nights of incalculable possibilities were being stolen from her by women for whom she had no great affection at first she had been courageous but the strain of prolonged uncertainty was telling on her and her nervous condition did not improve her larynx every morning miles creedon looked down her throat only to put her off with evasions to pronounce improvement that apparently never got her anywhere to say that tomorrow he might be able to promise something definite her illness of course gave rise to rumours rumours that she had lost her voice that at some time last summer she must have lost her discretion kitty herself was frightened by the way in which this cold hung on she had had many sharp illnesses in her life but always before this she had rallied quickly was she beginning to lose her resiliency was she by any cursed chance facing a bleak time when she would have to cherish herself she protested as she wandered about her sunny manywindowed rooms on the tenth floor that if she was going to have to live frugally she wouldnt live at all she wouldnt live on any terms but the very generous ones she had always known she wasnt going to hoard her vitality it must be there when she wanted it be ready for any strain she chose to put upon it let her play fast and loose with it and then if necessary she would be ill for a while and pay the piper but be systematically prudent and parsimonious she would not when she attempted to deliver all this to doctor creedon he merely put his finger on her lips and said they would discuss these things when she could talk without injuring her throat he allowed her to see no one except the director of the opera who did not shine in conversation and was not apt to set kitty going the director was a glum fellow indeed but during this calamitous time he had tried to be soothing and he agreed with creedon that she must not risk a premature appearance kitty was tormented by a suspicion that he was secretly backing the little spanish woman who had sung many of her parts since she had been ill he furthered the girls interests because his wife had a very special consideration for her and madame had that consideration because but that was too long and too dreary a story to follow out in ones mind kitty felt a tonsilitis disgust for operahouse politics which when she was in health she rather enjoyed being no mean strategist herself the worst of being ill was that it made so many things and people look base she was always afraid of being disillusioned she wished to believe that everything for sale in vanity fair was worth the advertised price when she ceased to believe in these delights she told herself her pulling power would decline and she would go to pieces in some way the chill of her disillusionment would quiver through the long black line which reached from the boxoffice down to seventh avenue on nights when she sang they shivered there in the rain and cold all those people because they loved to believe in her inextinguishable zest she was no prouder of what she drew in the boxes than she was of that long oscillating tail little fellows in thin coats italians frenchmen southamericans japanese when she had been cloistered like a trappist for six weeks with nothing from the outside world but notes and flowers and disquieting morning papers kitty told miles creedon that she could not endure complete isolation any longer i simply cannot live through the evenings they have become horrors to me every night is the last night of a condemned man i do nothing but cry and that makes my throat worse miles creedon handsomest of his profession was better looking with some invalids than with others his athletic figure his red cheeks and splendid teeth always had a cheering effect upon this particular patient who hated anything weak or broken what can i do my dear what do you wish shall i come and hold your lovely hand from eight to ten you have only to suggest it would you do that even no caro mio i take far too much of your time as it is for an age now you have been the only man in the world to me and you have been charming but the world is big and i am missing it let some one come tonight some one interesting but not too interesting pierce tevis for instance he is just back from paris tell the nurse i may see him for an hour tonight kitty finished pleadingly and put her fingers on the doctors sleeve he looked down at them and smiled whimsically like other people he was weak to kitty ayrshire he would do for her things that he would do for no one else would break any engagement desert a dinnertable leaving an empty place and an offended hostess to sit all evening in kittys dressingroom spraying her throat and calming her nerves using every expedient to get her through a performance he had studied her voice like a singing master knew all of its idiosyncracies and the emotional and nervous perturbations which affected it when it was permissible sometimes when it was not permissible he indulged her caprices on this sunny morning her wan disconsolate face moved him yes you may see tevis this evening if you will assure me that you will not shed one tear for twentyfour hours i may depend on your word he rose and stood before the deep couch on which his patient reclined her arch look seemed to say on what could you depend more creedon smiled and shook his head if i find you worse tomorrow he crossed to the writingtable and began to separate a bunch of tiny flamecoloured rosebuds may i selecting one he sat down on the chair from which he had lately risen and leaned forward while kitty pinched the thorns from the stem and arranged the flower in his buttonhole thank you i like to wear one of yours now i must be off to the hospital ive a nasty little operation to do this morning im glad its not you shall i telephone tevis about this evening kitty hesitated her eyes ran rapidly about seeking a likely pretext creedon laughed oh i see youve already asked him to come you were so sure of me two hours in bed after lunch with all the windows open remember read something diverting but not exciting some homely british author nothing abandonnй and dont make faces at me until tomorrow when her charming doctor had disappeared through the doorway kitty fell back on her cushions and closed her eyes her mockingbird excited by the sunlight was singing in his big gilt cage and a white lilactree that had come that morning was giving out its faint sweetness in the warm room but kitty looked paler and wearier than when the doctor was with her even with him she rose to her part just a little couldnt help it and he took his share of her vivacity and sparkle like every one else he believed that his presence was soothing to her but he admired and whoever admired blew on the flame however lightly the mockingbird was in great form this morning he had the best birdvoice she had ever heard and kitty wished there were some way to note down his improvisations but his intervals were not expressible in any scale she knew parker white had brought him to her from ojo caliente in new mexico where he had been trained in the pine forests by an old mexican and an illtempered lame masterbird half thrush that taught young birds to sing this morning in his song there were flashes of silvery southern springtime they opened inviting roads of memory in half an hour he had sung his disconsolate mistress to sleep that evening kitty sat curled up on the deep couch before the fire awaiting pierce tevis her costume was folds upon folds of diaphanous white over equally diaphanous rose with a line of white fur about her neck her beautiful arms were bare her tiny chinese slippers were embroidered so richly that they resembled the painted porcelain of old vases she looked like a sultans youngest newest bride a beautiful little toywoman sitting at one end of the long room which composed about her which in the soft light seemed happily arranged for her there were flowers everywhere rosetrees camelliabushes red and white the first forced hyacinths of the season a feathery mimosatree tall enough to stand under the long front of kittys study was all windows at one end was the fireplace before which she sat at the other end back in a lighted alcove hung a big warm sympathetic interior by lucien simon a group of kittys friends having tea in the painters salon in paris the room in the picture was flooded with early lamplight and one could feel the grey chill winter twilight in the paris streets outside there stood the cavalierlike old composer who had done much for kitty in his most characteristic attitude before the hearth mme simon sat at the teatable b the historian and h the philologist stood in animated discussion behind the piano while mme h was tying on the bonnet of her lovely little daughter marcel durand the physicist sat alone in a corner his startling blackandwhite profile lowered broodingly his cold hands locked over his sharp knee a genial redbearded sculptor stood over him about to touch him on the shoulder and waken him from his dream this painting made as it were another room so that kittys study on central park west seemed to open into that charming french interior into one of the most highly harmonized and richly associated rooms in paris there her friends sat or stood about men distinguished women at once plain and beautiful with their furs and bonnets their clothes that were so distinctly not smart all held together by the warm lamplight by an indescribable atmosphere of graceful and gracious human living pierce tevis after he had entered noiselessly and greeted kitty stood before her fire and looked over her shoulder at this picture its nice that you have them there together now that they are scattered god knows where fighting to preserve just that but your own room too is charming he added at last taking his eyes from the canvas kitty shrugged her shoulders bah i can help to feed the lamp but i cant supply the dear things it shines upon well tonight it shines upon you and me and we arent so bad tevis stepped forward and took her hand affectionately youve been over a rough bit of road im so sorry its left you looking very lovely though has it been very hard to get on she brushed his hand gratefully against her cheek and nodded awfully dismal everything has been shut out from me but gossip that always gets in often i dont mind but this time i have people do tell such lies about me of course we do thats part of our fun one of the many pleasures you give us it only shows how hard up we are for interesting public personages for a royal family for romantic fiction if you will but i never hear any stories that wound me and im very sensitive about you im gossiped about rather more than the others am i not i believe heaven send that the day when you are not gossiped about is far distant do you want to bite off your nose to spite your pretty face you are the sort of person who makes myths you cant turn around without making one thats your singular good luck a whole staff of publicity men working day and night couldnt do for you what you do for yourself there is an affinity between you and the popular imagination i suppose so said kitty and sighed all the same im getting almost as tired of the person im supposed to be as of the person i really am i wish you would invent a new kitty ayrshire for me pierce cant i do something revolutionary marry for instance tevis rose in alarm whatever you do dont try to change your legend you have now the one that gives the greatest satisfaction to the greatest number of people dont disappoint your public the popular imagination to which you make such a direct appeal for some reason wished you to have a son so it has given you one ive heard a dozen versions of the story but it is always a son never by any chance a daughter your public gives you what is best for you let well enough alone kitty yawned and dropped back on her cushions he still persists does he in spite of never being visible oh but he has been seen by ever so many people let me think a moment he sank into an attitude of meditative ease the best description i ever had of him was from a friend of my mother an elderly woman thoroughly truthful and matteroffact she has seen him often he is kept in russia in st petersburg that was he is about eight years old and of marvellous beauty he is always that in every version my old friend has seen him being driven in his sledge on the nevskii prospekt on winter afternoons black horses with silver bells and a giant in uniform on the seat beside the driver he is always attended by this giant who is responsible to the grand duke paul for the boy this lady can produce no evidence beyond his beauty and his splendid furs and the fact that all the americans in petrograd know he is your son kitty laughed mournfully if the grand duke paul had a son any old rag of a son the province of moscow couldnt contain him he may for aught i know actually pretend to have a son it would be very like him she looked at her fingertips and her rings disapprovingly for a moment do you know ive been thinking that i would rather like to lay hands on that youngster i believe hed be interesting im bored with the world tevis looked up and said quickly would you like him really of course i should she said indignantly but then i like other things too and one has to choose when one has only two or three things to choose from life is hard when one has many it is harder still no on the whole i dont mind that story its rather pretty except for the grand duke but not all of them are pretty well none of them are very ugly at least i never heard but one that troubled me and that was long ago she looked interested that is what i want to know how do the ugly ones get started how did that one get going and what was it about is it too dreadful to repeat no its not especially dreadful merely rather shabby if you really wish to know and wont be vexed i can tell you exactly how it got going for i took the trouble to find out but its a long story and you really had nothing whatever to do with it then who did have to do with it tell me i should like to know exactly how even one of them originated will you be comfortable and quiet and not get into a rage and let me look at you as much as i please kitty nodded and tevis sat watching her indolently while he debated how much of his story he ought not to tell her kitty liked being looked at by intelligent persons she knew exactly how good looking she was and she knew too that pretty as she was some of those rather sallow women in the simon painting had a kind of beauty which she would never have this knowledge tevis was thinking this important realization contributed more to her loveliness than any other thing about her more than her smooth ivory skin or her changing grey eyes the delicate forehead above them or even the dazzling smile which was gradually becoming too bright and too intentional out in the world at least here by her own fire she still had for her friends a smile less electric than the one she flashed from stages she could still be in short intime a quality which few artists keep which few ever had kitty broke in on her friends meditations you may smoke i had rather you did i hate to deprive people of things they like no thanks may i have those chocolates on the teatable they are quite as bad for me may you no i suppose not he settled himself by the fire with the candy beside him and began in the agreeable voice which always soothed his listener as i said it was a long while ago when you first came back to this country and were singing at the manhattan i dropped in at the metropolitan one evening to hear something new they were trying out it was an off night no pullers in the cast and nobody in the boxes but governesses and poor relations at the end of the first act two people entered one of the boxes in the second tier the man was siegmund stein the departmentstore millionaire and the girl so the men about me in the omnibus box began to whisper was kitty ayrshire i didnt know you then but i was unwilling to believe that you were with stein i could not contradict them at that time however for the resemblance if it was merely a resemblance was absolute and all the world knew that you were not singing at the manhattan that night the girls hair was dressed just as you then wore yours moreover her head was small and restless like yours and she had your colouring your eyes your chin she carried herself with the critical indifference one might expect in an artist who had come for a look at a new production that was clearly doomed to failure she applauded lightly she made comments to stein when comments were natural enough i thought as i studied her face with the glass that her nose was a trifle thinner than yours a prettier nose my dear kitty but stupider and more inflexible all the same i was troubled until i saw her laugh and then i knew she was a counterfeit i had never seen you laugh but i knew that you would not laugh like that it was not boisterous indeed it was consciously refined mirthless meaningless in short it was not the laugh of one whom our friends in there pointing to the simon painting would honour with their affection and admiration kitty rose on her elbow and burst out indignantly so you would really have been hoodwinked except for that you may be sure that no woman no intelligent woman would have been why do we ever take the trouble to look like anything for any of you i could count on my four fingers she held them up and shook them at him the men ive known who had the least perception of what any woman really looked like and they were all dressmakers even painters glancing back in the direction of the simon picture never get more than one type through their thick heads they try to make all women look like some wife or mistress you are all the same you never see our real faces what you do see is some cheap conception of prettiness you got from a coloured supplement when you were adolescents its too discouraging id rather take vows and veil my face for ever from such abominable eyes in the kingdom of the blind any petticoat is a queen kitty thumped the cushion with her elbow well i cant do anything about it go on with your story arent you furious kitty and i thought i was so shrewd ive quite forgotten where i was anyhow i was not the only man fooled after the last curtain i met villard the press man of that management in the lobby and asked him whether kitty ayrshire was in the house he said he thought so stein had telephoned for a box and said he was bringing one of the artists from the other company villard had been too busy about the new production to go to the box but he was quite sure the woman was ayrshire whom he had met in paris not long after that i met dan leland a classmate of mine at the harvard club hes a journalist and he used to keep such eccentric hours that i had not run across him for a long time we got to talking about modern french music and discovered that we both had a very lively interest in kitty ayrshire could you tell me dan asked abruptly why with pretty much all the known world to choose her friends from this young woman should flit about with siegmund stein it prejudices people against her hes a most objectionable person have you i asked seen her with him yourself yes he had seen her driving with stein and some of the men on his paper had seen her dining with him at rather queer places down town stein was always hanging about the manhattan on nights when kitty sang i told dan that i suspected a masquerade that interested him and he said he thought he would look into the matter in short we both agreed to look into it finally we got the story though dan could never use it could never even hint at it because stein carries heavy advertising in his paper to make you see the point i must give you a little history of siegmund stein any one who has seen him never forgets him he is one of the most hideous men in new york but its not at all the common sort of ugliness that comes from overeating and automobiles he isnt one of the fat horrors he has one of those rigid horselike faces that never tell anything a long nose flattened as if it had been tied down a scornful chin long white teeth flat cheeks yellow as a mongolians tiny black eyes with puffy lids and no lashes dingy deadlooking hair looks as if it were glued on stein came here a beggar from somewhere in austria he began by working on the machines in old rosenthals garment factory he became a speeder a foreman a salesman worked his way ahead steadily until the hour when he rented an old dwellinghouse on seventh avenue and began to make misses and juniors coats i believe he was the first manufacturer to specialize in those particular articles dozens of garment manufacturers have come along the same road but stein is like none of the rest of them he is and always was a personality while he was still at the machine a hideous underfed little whippersnapper he was already a youth of manycoloured ambitions deeply concerned about his dress his associates his recreations he haunted the old astor library and the metropolitan museum learned something about pictures and porcelains took singing lessons though he had a voice like a crows when he sat down to his baked apple and doughnut in a basement lunchroom he would prop a book up before him and address his food with as much leisure and ceremony as if he were dining at his club he held himself at a distance from his fellowworkmen and somehow always managed to impress them with his superiority he had inordinate vanity and there are many stories about his foppishness after his first promotion in rosenthals factory he bought a new overcoat a few days later one of the men at the machines which stein had just quitted appeared in a coat exactly like it stein could not discharge him but he gave his own coat to a newly arrived russian boy and got another he was already magnificent after he began to make headway with misses and juniors cloaks he became a collector etchings china old musical instruments he had a dancing master and engaged a beautiful brazilian widow she was said to be a secret agent for some south american republic to teach him spanish he cultivated the society of the unknown great poets actors musicians he entertained them sumptuously and they regarded him as a deep mysterious jew who had the secret of gold which they had not his business associates thought him a man of taste and culture a patron of the arts a credit to the garment trade one of steins many ambitions was to be thought a success with women he got considerable notoriety in the garment world by his attentions to an emotional actress who is now quite forgotten but who had her little hour of expectation then there was a dancer then just after gorkys visit here a russian anarchist woman after that the coatmakers and shirtwaistmakers began to whisper that steins great success was with kitty ayrshire it is the hardest thing in the world to disprove such a story as dan leland and i discovered we managed to worry down the girls address through a taxicab driver who got next to steins chauffeur she had an apartment in a decentenough house on waverly place nobody ever came to see her but stein her sisters and a little italian girl from whom we got the story the counterfeits name was ruby mohr she worked in a shirtwaist factory and this italian girl margarita was her chum stein came to the factory when he was hunting for living models for his new department store he looked the girls over and picked ruby out from several hundred he had her call at his office after business hours tried her out in cloaks and evening gowns and offered her a position she never however appeared as a model in the sixth avenue store her likeness to the newly arrived prima donna suggested to stein another act in the play he was always putting on he gave two of her sisters positions as saleswomen but ruby he established in an apartment on waverly place to the outside world stein became more mysterious in his behaviour than ever he dropped his bohemian friends no more suppers and theatreparties whenever kitty sang he was in his box at the manhattan usually alone but not always sometimes he took two or three good customers large buyers from st louis or kansas city his coat factory is still the biggest earner of his properties ive seen him there with these buyers and they carried themselves as if they were being let in on something took possession of the box with a proprietory air smiled and applauded and looked wise as if each and every one of them were friends of kitty ayrshire while they buzzed and trained their fieldglasses on the prima donna stein was impassive and silent i dont imagine he even told many lies he is the most insinuating cuss anyhow he probably dropped his voice or lifted his eyebrows when he invited them and let their own eager imaginations do the rest but what tales they took back to their provincial capitals sometimes before they left new york they were lucky enough to see kitty dining with their clever garment man at some restaurant her back to the curious crowd her face half concealed by a veil or a fur collar those people are like children nothing that is true or probable interests them they want the old gaudy lies told always in the same way siegmund stein and kitty ayrshire a story like that once launched is repeated unchallenged for years among new york factory sports in st paul st jo sioux city council bluffs there used to be clothing stores where a photograph of kitty ayrshire hung in the fittingroom or over the proprietors desk this girl impersonated you successfully to the lower manufacturing world of new york for two seasons i doubt if it could have been put across anywhere else in the world except in this city which pays you so magnificently and believes of you what it likes then you went over to the metropolitan stopped living in hotels took this apartment and began to know people stein discontinued his pantomime at the right moment withdrew his patronage ruby of course did not go back to shirtwaists a business friend of steins took her over and she dropped out of sight last winter one cold snowy night i saw her once again she was going into a saloon hotel with a toughlooking young fellow she had been drinking she was shabby and her blue shoes left stains in the slush but she still looked amazingly convincingly like a battered hardened kitty ayrshire as i saw her going up the brassedged stairs i said to myself never mind that kitty rose quickly took an impatient step to the hearth and thrust one shining porcelain slipper out to the fire the girl doesnt interest me there is nothing i can do about her and of course she never looked like me at all but what did stein do without me stein oh he chose a new rфle he married with great magnificence married a miss mandelbaum a california heiress her people have a line of department stores along the pacific coast the steins now inhabit a great house on fifth avenue that used to belong to people of a very different sort to old newyorkers its an historic house kitty laughed and sat down on the end of her couch nearest her guest sat upright without cushions i imagine i know more about that house than you do let me tell you how i made the sequel to your story it has to do with peppo amoretti you may remember that i brought peppo to this country and brought him in too the year the war broke out when it wasnt easy to get boys who hadnt done military service out of italy i had taken him to munich to have some singing lessons after the war came on we had to get from munich to naples in order to sail at all we were told that we could take only hand luggage on the railways but i took nine trunks and peppo i dressed peppo in knickerbockers made him brush his curls down over his ears like doughnuts and carry a little violincase it took us eleven days to reach naples i got my trunks through purely by personal persuasion once at naples i had a frightful time getting peppo on the boat i declared him as handluggage he was so travelworn and so crushed by his absurd appearance that he did not look like much else one inspector had a sense of humour and passed him at that but the other was inflexible i had to be very dramatic peppo was frightened and there is no fight in him anyhow per me tutto e indifferente signorina he kept whimpering why should i go without it i have lost it which i screamed not the hattrunk no no mia voce it is gone since ravenna he thought he had lost his voice somewhere along the way at last i told the inspector that i couldnt live without peppo and that i would throw myself into the bay i took him into my confidence of course when i found i had to play on that string i wished i hadnt made the boy such a spectacle but ridiculous as he was i managed to make the inspector believe that i had kidnapped him and that he was indispensable to my happiness i found that incorruptible official like most people willing to aid one so utterly depraved i could never have got that boy out for any proper reasonable purpose such as giving him a job or sending him to school well its a queer world but i must cut all that and get to the steins that first winter peppo had no chance at the opera there was an iron ring about him and my interest in him only made it all the more difficult weve become a nest of intrigues down there worse than the scala peppo had to scratch along just any way one evening he came to me and said he could get an engagement to sing for the grand rich steins but the condition was that i should sing with him they would pay oh anything and the fact that i had sung a private engagement with him would give him other engagements of the same sort as you know i never sing private engagements but to help the boy along i consented on the night of the party peppo and i went to the house together in a taxi my car was ailing at the hour when the music was about to begin the host and hostess appeared at my dressingroom upstairs isnt he wonderful your description was most inadequate i never encountered such restrained frozen sculptured vanity my hostess struck me as extremely good natured and jolly though somewhat intimate in her manner her reassuring pats and smiles puzzled me at the time i remember when i didnt know that she had anything in particular to be largeminded and charitable about her husband made known his willingness to conduct me to the musicroom and we ceremoniously descended a staircase blooming like the hanginggardens of babylon from there i had my first glimpse of the company they were strange people the women glittered like christmastrees when we were halfway down the stairs the buzz of conversation stopped so suddenly that some foolish remark i happened to be making rang out like oratory every face was lifted toward us my host and i completed our descent and went the length of the drawingroom through a silence which somewhat awed me i couldnt help wishing that one could ever get that kind of attention in a concerthall in the musicroom stein insisted upon arranging things for me i must say that he was neither awkward nor stupid not so wooden as most rich men who rent singers i was properly affable one has under such circumstances to be either gracious or pouty either you have to stand and sulk like an oldfashioned german singer who wants the piano moved about for her like a teawagon and the lights turned up and the lights turned down or you have to be a trifle forced like a dйbutante trying to make good the fixed attention of my audience affected me i was aware of unusual interest of a thoroughly enlisted public when however my host at last left me i felt the tension relax to such an extent that i wondered whether by any chance he and not i was the object of so much curiosity but at any rate their cordiality pleased me so well that after peppo and i had finished our numbers i sang an encore or two and i stayed through peppos performance because i felt that they liked to look at me i had asked not to be presented to people but mrs stein of course brought up a few friends the throng began closing in upon me glowing faces bore down from every direction and i realized that among people of such unscrupulous cordiality i must look out for myself i ran through the drawingroom and fled up the stairway which was thronged with old testament characters as i passed them they all looked at me with delighted cherishing eyes as if i had at last come back to my native hamlet at the top of the stairway a young man who looked like a camel with its hair parted on the side stopped me seized my hands and said he must present himself as he was such an old friend of siegmunds bachelor days i said yes how interesting the atmosphere was somehow so thick and personal that i felt uncomfortable when i reached my dressingroom mrs stein followed me to say that i would of course come down to supper as a special table had been prepared for me i replied that it was not my custom but here it is different with us you must feel perfect freedom siegmund will never forgive me if you do not stay after supper our car will take you home she was overpowering she had the manner of an intimate and indulgent friend of long standing she seemed to have come to make me a visit i could only get rid of her by telling her that i must see peppo at once if she would be good enough to send him to me she did not come back and i began to fear that i would actually be dragged down to supper it was as if i had been kidnapped i felt like gulliver among the giants these people were all too well too much what they were no chill of manner could hold them off i was defenseless i must get away i ran to the top of the staircase and looked down there was that fool peppo beleaguered by a bevy of fair women they were simply looting him and he was grinning like an idiot i gathered up my train ran down and made a dash at him yanked him out of that circle of rich contours and dragged him by a limp cuff up the stairs after me i told him that i must escape from that house at once if he could get to the telephone well and good but if he couldnt get past so many deepbreathing ladies then he must break out of the front door and hunt me a cab on foot i felt as if i were about to be immured within a harem he had scarcely dashed off when the host called my name several times outside the door then he knocked and walked in uninvited i told him that i would be inflexible about supper he must make my excuses to his charming friends any pretext he chose he did not insist he took up his stand by the fireplace and began to talk said rather intelligent things i did not drive him out it was his own house and he made himself agreeable after a time a deputation of his friends came down the hall somewhat boisterously to say that supper could not be served until we came down stein was still standing by the mantel i remember he scattered them without moving or speaking to them by a portentous look there is something hideously forceful about him he took a very profound leave of me and said he would order his car at once in a moment peppo arrived splashed to the ankles and we made our escape together a week later peppo came to me in a rage with a paper called the american gentleman and showed me a page devoted to three photographs mr and mrs siegmund stein lately married in new york city and kitty ayrshire operatic soprano who sang at their housewarming mrs stein and i were grinning our best looked frantic with delight and siegmund frowned inscrutably between us poor peppo wasnt mentioned stein has a publicity sense tevis rose and you have enormous publicity value and no discretion it was just like you to fall for such a plot kitty youd be sure to whats the use of discretion she murmured behind her hand if the steins want to adopt you into their family circle theyll get you in the end thats why i dont feel compassionate about your ruby she and i are in the same boat we are both the victims of circumstance and in new york so many of the circumstances are steins pauls case it was pauls afternoon to appear before the faculty of the pittsburgh high school to account for his various misdemeanours he had been suspended a week ago and his father had called at the principals office and confessed his perplexity about his son paul entered the faculty room suave and smiling his clothes were a trifle outgrown and the tan velvet on the collar of his open overcoat was frayed and worn but for all that there was something of the dandy about him and he wore an opal pin in his neatly knotted black fourinhand and a red carnation in his buttonhole this latter adornment the faculty somehow felt was not properly significant of the contrite spirit befitting a boy under the ban of suspension paul was tall for his age and very thin with high cramped shoulders and a narrow chest his eyes were remarkable for a certain hysterical brilliancy and he continually used them in a conscious theatrical sort of way peculiarly offensive in a boy the pupils were abnormally large as though he were addicted to belladonna but there was a glassy glitter about them which that drug does not produce when questioned by the principal as to why he was there paul stated politely enough that he wanted to come back to school this was a lie but paul was quite accustomed to lying found it indeed indispensable for overcoming friction his teachers were asked to state their respective charges against him which they did with such a rancour and aggrievedness as evinced that this was not a usual case disorder and impertinence were among the offences named yet each of his instructors felt that it was scarcely possible to put into words the real cause of the trouble which lay in a sort of hysterically defiant manner of the boys in the contempt which they all knew he felt for them and which he seemingly made not the least effort to conceal once when he had been making a synopsis of a paragraph at the blackboard his english teacher had stepped to his side and attempted to guide his hand paul had started back with a shudder and thrust his hands violently behind him the astonished woman could scarcely have been more hurt and embarrassed had he struck at her the insult was so involuntary and definitely personal as to be unforgettable in one way and another he had made all his teachers men and women alike conscious of the same feeling of physical aversion in one class he habitually sat with his hand shading his eyes in another he always looked out of the window during the recitation in another he made a running commentary on the lecture with humorous intent his teachers felt this afternoon that his whole attitude was symbolized by his shrug and his flippantly red carnation flower and they fell upon him without mercy his english teacher leading the pack he stood through it smiling his pale lips parted over his white teeth his lips were continually twitching and he had a habit of raising his eyebrows that was contemptuous and irritating to the last degree older boys than paul had broken down and shed tears under that ordeal but his set smile did not once desert him and his only sign of discomfort was the nervous trembling of the fingers that toyed with the buttons of his overcoat and an occasional jerking of the other hand which held his hat paul was always smiling always glancing about him seeming to feel that people might be watching him and trying to detect something this conscious expression since it was as far as possible from boyish mirthfulness was usually attributed to insolence or smartness as the inquisition proceeded one of his instructors repeated an impertinent remark of the boys and the principal asked him whether he thought that a courteous speech to make to a woman paul shrugged his shoulders slightly and his eyebrows twitched i dont know he replied i didnt mean to be polite or impolite either i guess its a sort of way i have of saying things regardless the principal asked him whether he didnt think that a way it would be well to get rid of paul grinned and said he guessed so when he was told that he could go he bowed gracefully and went out his bow was like a repetition of the scandalous red carnation his teachers were in despair and his drawing master voiced the feeling of them all when he declared there was something about the boy which none of them understood he added i dont really believe that smile of his comes altogether from insolence theres something sort of haunted about it the boy is not strong for one thing there is something wrong about the fellow the drawing master had come to realize that in looking at paul one saw only his white teeth and the forced animation of his eyes one warm afternoon the boy had gone to sleep at his drawingboard and his master had noted with amazement what a white blueveined face it was drawn and wrinkled like an old mans about the eyes the lips twitching even in his sleep his teachers left the building dissatisfied and unhappy humiliated to have felt so vindictive toward a mere boy to have uttered this feeling in cutting terms and to have set each other on as it were in the grewsome game of intemperate reproach one of them remembered having seen a miserable street cat set at bay by a ring of tormentors as for paul he ran down the hill whistling the soldiers chorus from faust looking wildly behind him now and then to see whether some of his teachers were not there to witness his lightheartedness as it was now late in the afternoon and paul was on duty that evening as usher at carnegie hall he decided that he would not go home to supper when he reached the concert hall the doors were not yet open it was chilly outside and he decided to go up into the picture gallery always deserted at this hour where there were some of raffellis gay studies of paris streets and an airy blue venetian scene or two that always exhilarated him he was delighted to find no one in the gallery but the old guard who sat in the corner a newspaper on his knee a black patch over one eye and the other closed paul possessed himself of the place and walked confidently up and down whistling under his breath after a while he sat down before a blue rico and lost himself when he bethought him to look at his watch it was after seven oclock and he rose with a start and ran downstairs making a face at augustus caesar peering out from the castroom and an evil gesture at the venus of milo as he passed her on the stairway when paul reached the ushers dressingroom halfadozen boys were there already and he began excitedly to tumble into his uniform it was one of the few that at all approached fitting and paul thought it very becoming though he knew the tight straight coat accentuated his narrow chest about which he was exceedingly sensitive he was always excited while he dressed twanging all over to the tuning of the strings and the preliminary flourishes of the horns in the musicroom but tonight he seemed quite beside himself and he teased and plagued the boys until telling him that he was crazy they put him down on the floor and sat on him somewhat calmed by his suppression paul dashed out to the front of the house to seat the early comers he was a model usher gracious and smiling he ran up and down the aisles nothing was too much trouble for him he carried messages and brought programs as though it were his greatest pleasure in life and all the people in his section thought him a charming boy feeling that he remembered and admired them as the house filled he grew more and more vivacious and animated and the colour came to his cheeks and lips it was very much as though this were a great reception and paul were the host just as the musicians came out to take their places his english teacher arrived with checks for the seats which a prominent manufacturer had taken for the season she betrayed some embarrassment when she handed paul the tickets and a hauteur which subsequently made her feel very foolish paul was startled for a moment and had the feeling of wanting to put her out what business had she here among all these fine people and gay colours he looked her over and decided that she was not appropriately dressed and must be a fool to sit downstairs in such togs the tickets had probably been sent her out of kindness he reflected as he put down a seat for her and she had about as much right to sit there as he had when the symphony began paul sank into one of the rear seats with a long sigh of relief and lost himself as he had done before the rico it was not that symphonies as such meant anything in particular to paul but the first sigh of the instruments seemed to free some hilarious spirit within him something that struggled there like the genius in the bottle found by the arab fisherman he felt a sudden zest of life the lights danced before his eyes and the concert hall blazed into unimaginable splendour when the soprano soloist came on paul forgot even the nastiness of his teachers being there and gave himself up to the peculiar intoxication such personages always had for him the soloist chanced to be a german woman by no means in her first youth and the mother of many children but she wore a satin gown and a tiara and she had that indefinable air of achievement that worldshine upon her which always blinded paul to any possible defects after a concert was over paul was often irritable and wretched until he got to sleep and tonight he was even more than usually restless he had the feeling of not being able to let down of its being impossible to give up this delicious excitement which was the only thing that could be called living at all during the last number he withdrew and after hastily changing his clothes in the dressingroom slipped out to the side door where the singers carriage stood here he began pacing rapidly up and down the walk waiting to see her come out over yonder the schenley in its vacant stretch loomed big and square through the fine rain the windows of its twelve stories glowing like those of a lighted cardboard house under a christmas tree all the actors and singers of any importance stayed there when they were in the city and a number of the big manufacturers of the place lived there in the winter paul had often hung about the hotel watching the people go in and out longing to enter and leave schoolmasters and dull care behind him for ever at last the singer came out accompanied by the conductor who helped her into her carriage and closed the door with a cordial auf wiedersehen which set paul to wondering whether she were not an old sweetheart of his paul followed the carriage over to the hotel walking so rapidly as not to be far from the entrance when the singer alighted and disappeared behind the swinging glass doors which were opened by a negro in a tall hat and a long coat in the moment that the door was ajar it seemed to paul that he too entered he seemed to feel himself go after her up the steps into the warm lighted building into an exotic a tropical world of shiny glistening surfaces and basking ease he reflected upon the mysterious dishes that were brought into the diningroom the green bottles in buckets of ice as he had seen them in the supper party pictures of the sunday supplement a quick gust of wind brought the rain down with sudden vehemence and paul was startled to find that he was still outside in the slush of the gravel driveway that his boots were letting in the water and his scanty overcoat was clinging wet about him that the lights in front of the concert hall were out and that the rain was driving in sheets between him and the orange glow of the windows above him there it was what he wanted tangibly before him like the fairy world of a christmas pantomime as the rain beat in his face paul wondered whether he were destined always to shiver in the black night outside looking up at it he turned and walked reluctantly toward the car tracks the end had to come sometime his father in his nightclothes at the top of the stairs explanations that did not explain hastily improvised fictions that were forever tripping him up his upstairs room and its horrible yellow wallpaper the creaking bureau with the greasy plush collarbox and over his painted wooden bed the pictures of george washington and john calvin and the framed motto feed my lambs which had been worked in red worsted by his mother whom paul could not remember half an hour later paul alighted from the negley avenue car and went slowly down one of the side streets off the main thoroughfare it was a highly respectable street where all the houses were exactly alike and where business men of moderate means begot and reared large families of children all of whom went to sabbathschool and learned the shorter catechism and were interested in arithmetic all of whom were as exactly alike as their homes and of a piece with the monotony in which they lived paul never went up cordelia street without a shudder of loathing his home was next the house of the cumberland minister he approached it tonight with the nerveless sense of defeat the hopeless feeling of sinking back forever into ugliness and commonness that he had always had when he came home the moment he turned into cordelia street he felt the waters close above his head after each of these orgies of living he experienced all the physical depression which follows a debauch the loathing of respectable beds of common food of a house permeated by kitchen odours a shuddering repulsion for the flavourless colourless mass of everyday existence a morbid desire for cool things and soft lights and fresh flowers the nearer he approached the house the more absolutely unequal paul felt to the sight of it all his ugly sleeping chamber the cold bathroom with the grimy zinc tub the cracked mirror the dripping spiggots his father at the top of the stairs his hairy legs sticking out from his nightshirt his feet thrust into carpet slippers he was so much later than usual that there would certainly be inquiries and reproaches paul stopped short before the door he felt that he could not be accosted by his father tonight that he could not toss again on that miserable bed he would not go in he would tell his father that he had no car fare and it was raining so hard he had gone home with one of the boys and stayed all night meanwhile he was wet and cold he went around to the back of the house and tried one of the basement windows found it open raised it cautiously and scrambled down the cellar wall to the floor there he stood holding his breath terrified by the noise he had made but the floor above him was silent and there was no creak on the stairs he found a soapbox and carried it over to the soft ring of light that streamed from the furnace door and sat down he was horribly afraid of rats so he did not try to sleep but sat looking distrustfully at the dark still terrified lest he might have awakened his father in such reactions after one of the experiences which made days and nights out of the dreary blanks of the calendar when his senses were deadened pauls head was always singularly clear suppose his father had heard him getting in at the window and had come down and shot him for a burglar then again suppose his father had come down pistol in hand and he had cried out in time to save himself and his father had been horrified to think how nearly he had killed him then again suppose a day should come when his father would remember that night and wish there had been no warning cry to stay his hand with this last supposition paul entertained himself until daybreak the following sunday was fine the sodden november chill was broken by the last flash of autumnal summer in the morning paul had to go to church and sabbathschool as always on seasonable sunday afternoons the burghers of cordelia street usually sat out on their front stoops and talked to their neighbours on the next stoop or called to those across the street in neighbourly fashion the men sat placidly on gay cushions placed upon the steps that led down to the sidewalk while the women in their sunday waists sat in rockers on the cramped porches pretending to be greatly at their ease the children played in the streets there were so many of them that the place resembled the recreation grounds of a kindergarten the men on the steps all in their shirt sleeves their vests unbuttoned sat with their legs well apart their stomachs comfortably protruding and talked of the prices of things or told anecdotes of the sagacity of their various chiefs and overlords they occasionally looked over the multitude of squabbling children listened affectionately to their highpitched nasal voices smiling to see their own proclivities reproduced in their offspring and interspersed their legends of the iron kings with remarks about their sons progress at school their grades in arithmetic and the amounts they had saved in their toy banks on this last sunday of november paul sat all the afternoon on the lowest step of his stoop staring into the street while his sisters in their rockers were talking to the ministers daughters next door about how many shirtwaists they had made in the last week and how many waffles some one had eaten at the last church supper when the weather was warm and his father was in a particularly jovial frame of mind the girls made lemonade which was always brought out in a redglass pitcher ornamented with forgetmenots in blue enamel this the girls thought very fine and the neighbours joked about the suspicious colour of the pitcher today pauls father on the top step was talking to a young man who shifted a restless baby from knee to knee he happened to be the young man who was daily held up to paul as a model and after whom it was his fathers dearest hope that he would pattern this young man was of a ruddy complexion with a compressed red mouth and faded nearsighted eyes over which he wore thick spectacles with gold bows that curved about his ears he was clerk to one of the magnates of a great steel corporation and was looked upon in cordelia street as a young man with a future there was a story that some five years ago he was now barely twentysix he had been a trifle dissipated but in order to curb his appetites and save the loss of time and strength that a sowing of wild oats might have entailed he had taken his chiefs advice oft reiterated to his employees and at twentyone had married the first woman whom he could persuade to share his fortunes she happened to be an angular schoolmistress much older than he who also wore thick glasses and who had now borne him four children all nearsighted like herself the young man was relating how his chief now cruising in the mediterranean kept in touch with all the details of the business arranging his office hours on his yacht just as though he were at home and knocking off work enough to keep two stenographers busy his father told in turn the plan his corporation was considering of putting in an electric railway plant at cairo paul snapped his teeth he had an awful apprehension that they might spoil it all before he got there yet he rather liked to hear these legends of the iron kings that were told and retold on sundays and holidays these stories of palaces in venice yachts on the mediterranean and high play at monte carlo appealed to his fancy and he was interested in the triumphs of cash boys who had become famous though he had no mind for the cashboy stage after supper was over and he had helped to dry the dishes paul nervously asked his father whether he could go to georges to get some help in his geometry and still more nervously asked for carfare this latter request he had to repeat as his father on principle did not like to hear requests for money whether much or little he asked paul whether he could not go to some boy who lived nearer and told him that he ought not to leave his school work until sunday but he gave him the dime he was not a poor man but he had a worthy ambition to come up in the world his only reason for allowing paul to usher was that he thought a boy ought to be earning a little paul bounded upstairs scrubbed the greasy odour of the dishwater from his hands with the illsmelling soap he hated and then shook over his fingers a few drops of violet water from the bottle he kept hidden in his drawer he left the house with his geometry conspicuously under his arm and the moment he got out of cordelia street and boarded a downtown car he shook off the lethargy of two deadening days and began to live again the leading juvenile of the permanent stock company which played at one of the downtown theatres was an acquaintance of pauls and the boy had been invited to drop in at the sundaynight rehearsals whenever he could for more than a year paul had spent every available moment loitering about charley edwardss dressingroom he had won a place among edwardss following not only because the young actor who could not afford to employ a dresser often found him useful but because he recognized in paul something akin to what churchmen term vocation it was at the theatre and at carnegie hall that paul really lived the rest was but a sleep and a forgetting this was pauls fairy tale and it had for him all the allurement of a secret love the moment he inhaled the gassy painty dusty odour behind the scenes he breathed like a prisoner set free and felt within him the possibility of doing or saying splendid brilliant things the moment the cracked orchestra beat out the overture from martha or jerked at the serenade from rigoletto all stupid and ugly things slid from him and his senses were deliciously yet delicately fired perhaps it was because in pauls world the natural nearly always wore the guise of ugliness that a certain element of artificiality seemed to him necessary in beauty perhaps it was because his experience of life elsewhere was so full of sabbathschool picnics petty economies wholesome advice as to how to succeed in life and the unescapable odours of cooking that he found this existence so alluring these smartlyclad men and women so attractive that he was so moved by these starry apple orchards that bloomed perennially under the limelight it would be difficult to put it strongly enough how convincingly the stage entrance of that theatre was for paul the actual portal of romance certainly none of the company ever suspected it least of all charley edwards it was very like the old stories that used to float about london of fabulously rich jews who had subterranean halls with palms and fountains and soft lamps and richly apparelled women who never saw the disenchanting light of london day so in the midst of that smokepalled city enamoured of figures and grimy toil paul had his secret temple his wishingcarpet his bit of blueandwhite mediterranean shore bathed in perpetual sunshine several of pauls teachers had a theory that his imagination had been perverted by garish fiction but the truth was he scarcely ever read at all the books at home were not such as would either tempt or corrupt a youthful mind and as for reading the novels that some of his friends urged upon him well he got what he wanted much more quickly from music any sort of music from an orchestra to a barrel organ he needed only the spark the indescribable thrill that made his imagination master of his senses and he could make plots and pictures enough of his own it was equally true that he was not stagestruck not at any rate in the usual acceptation of that expression he had no desire to become an actor any more than he had to become a musician he felt no necessity to do any of these things what he wanted was to see to be in the atmosphere float on the wave of it to be carried out blue league after blue league away from everything after a night behind the scenes paul found the schoolroom more than ever repulsive the bare floors and naked walls the prosy men who never wore frock coats or violets in their buttonholes the women with their dull gowns shrill voices and pitiful seriousness about prepositions that govern the dative he could not bear to have the other pupils think for a moment that he took these people seriously he must convey to them that he considered it all trivial and was there only by way of a joke anyway he had autograph pictures of all the members of the stock company which he showed his classmates telling them the most incredible stories of his familiarity with these people of his acquaintance with the soloists who came to carnegie hall his suppers with them and the flowers he sent them when these stories lost their effect and his audience grew listless he would bid all the boys goodbye announcing that he was going to travel for awhile going to naples to california to egypt then next monday he would slip back conscious and nervously smiling his sister was ill and he would have to defer his voyage until spring matters went steadily worse with paul at school in the itch to let his instructors know how heartily he despised them and how thoroughly he was appreciated elsewhere he mentioned once or twice that he had no time to fool with theorems adding with a twitch of the eyebrows and a touch of that nervous bravado which so perplexed them that he was helping the people down at the stock company they were old friends of his the upshot of the matter was that the principal went to pauls father and paul was taken out of school and put to work the manager at carnegie hall was told to get another usher in his stead the doorkeeper at the theatre was warned not to admit him to the house and charley edwards remorsefully promised the boys father not to see him again the members of the stock company were vastly amused when some of pauls stories reached them especially the women they were hardworking women most of them supporting indolent husbands or brothers and they laughed rather bitterly at having stirred the boy to such fervid and florid inventions they agreed with the faculty and with his father that pauls was a bad case the eastbound train was ploughing through a january snowstorm the dull dawn was beginning to show grey when the engine whistled a mile out of newark paul started up from the seat where he had lain curled in uneasy slumber rubbed the breathmisted window glass with his hand and peered out the snow was whirling in curling eddies above the white bottom lands and the drifts lay already deep in the fields and along the fences while here and there the long dead grass and dried weed stalks protruded black above it lights shone from the scattered houses and a gang of labourers who stood beside the track waved their lanterns paul had slept very little and he felt grimy and uncomfortable he had made the allnight journey in a day coach because he was afraid if he took a pullman he might be seen by some pittsburgh business man who had noticed him in denny carsons office when the whistle woke him he clutched quickly at his breast pocket glancing about him with an uncertain smile but the little claybespattered italians were still sleeping the slatternly women across the aisle were in openmouthed oblivion and even the crumby crying babies were for the nonce stilled paul settled back to struggle with his impatience as best he could when he arrived at the jersey city station he hurried through his breakfast manifestly ill at ease and keeping a sharp eye about him after he reached the twentythird street station he consulted a cabman and had himself driven to a mens furnishing establishment which was just opening for the day he spent upward of two hours there buying with endless reconsidering and great care his new street suit he put on in the fittingroom the frock coat and dress clothes he had bundled into the cab with his new shirts then he drove to a hatters and a shoe house his next errand was at tiffanys where he selected silver mounted brushes and a scarfpin he would not wait to have his silver marked he said lastly he stopped at a trunk shop on broadway and had his purchases packed into various travelling bags it was a little after one oclock when he drove up to the waldorf and after settling with the cabman went into the office he registered from washington said his mother and father had been abroad and that he had come down to await the arrival of their steamer he told his story plausibly and had no trouble since he offered to pay for them in advance in engaging his rooms a sleepingroom sittingroom and bath not once but a hundred times paul had planned this entry into new york he had gone over every detail of it with charley edwards and in his scrap book at home there were pages of description about new york hotels cut from the sunday papers when he was shown to his sittingroom on the eighth floor he saw at a glance that everything was as it should be there was but one detail in his mental picture that the place did not realize so he rang for the bell boy and sent him down for flowers he moved about nervously until the boy returned putting away his new linen and fingering it delightedly as he did so when the flowers came he put them hastily into water and then tumbled into a hot bath presently he came out of his white bathroom resplendent in his new silk underwear and playing with the tassels of his red robe the snow was whirling so fiercely outside his windows that he could scarcely see across the street but within the air was deliciously soft and fragrant he put the violets and jonquils on the tabouret beside the couch and threw himself down with a long sigh covering himself with a roman blanket he was thoroughly tired he had been in such haste he had stood up to such a strain covered so much ground in the last twentyfour hours that he wanted to think how it had all come about lulled by the sound of the wind the warm air and the cool fragrance of the flowers he sank into deep drowsy retrospection it had been wonderfully simple when they had shut him out of the theatre and concert hall when they had taken away his bone the whole thing was virtually determined the rest was a mere matter of opportunity the only thing that at all surprised him was his own courage for he realized well enough that he had always been tormented by fear a sort of apprehensive dread that of late years as the meshes of the lies he had told closed about him had been pulling the muscles of his body tighter and tighter until now he could not remember a time when he had not been dreading something even when he was a little boy it was always there behind him or before or on either side there had always been the shadowed corner the dark place into which he dared not look but from which something seemed always to be watching him and paul had done things that were not pretty to watch he knew but now he had a curious sense of relief as though he had at last thrown down the gauntlet to the thing in the corner yet it was but a day since he had been sulking in the traces but yesterday afternoon that he had been sent to the bank with denny carsons deposit as usual but this time he was instructed to leave the book to be balanced there was above two thousand dollars in checks and nearly a thousand in the bank notes which he had taken from the book and quietly transferred to his pocket at the bank he had made out a new deposit slip his nerves had been steady enough to permit of his returning to the office where he had finished his work and asked for a full days holiday tomorrow saturday giving a perfectly reasonable pretext the bank book he knew would not be returned before monday or tuesday and his father would be out of town for the next week from the time he slipped the bank notes into his pocket until he boarded the night train for new york he had not known a moments hesitation how astonishingly easy it had all been here he was the thing done and this time there would be no awakening no figure at the top of the stairs he watched the snow flakes whirling by his window until he fell asleep when he awoke it was four oclock in the afternoon he bounded up with a start one of his precious days gone already he spent nearly an hour in dressing watching every stage of his toilet carefully in the mirror everything was quite perfect he was exactly the kind of boy he had always wanted to be when he went downstairs paul took a carriage and drove up fifth avenue toward the park the snow had somewhat abated carriages and tradesmens wagons were hurrying soundlessly to and fro in the winter twilight boys in woollen mufflers were shovelling off the doorsteps the avenue stages made fine spots of colour against the white street here and there on the corners whole flower gardens blooming behind glass windows against which the snow flakes stuck and melted violets roses carnations lilies of the valley somehow vastly more lovely and alluring that they blossomed thus unnaturally in the snow the park itself was a wonderful stage winterpiece when he returned the pause of the twilight had ceased and the tune of the streets had changed the snow was falling faster lights streamed from the hotels that reared their many stories fearlessly up into the storm defying the raging atlantic winds a long black stream of carriages poured down the avenue intersected here and there by other streams tending horizontally there were a score of cabs about the entrance of his hotel and his driver had to wait boys in livery were running in and out of the awning stretched across the sidewalk up and down the red velvet carpet laid from the door to the street above about within it all was the rumble and roar the hurry and toss of thousands of human beings as hot for pleasure as himself and on every side of him towered the glaring affirmation of the omnipotence of wealth the boy set his teeth and drew his shoulders together in a spasm of realization the plot of all dramas the text of all romances the nervestuff of all sensations was whirling about him like the snow flakes he burnt like a faggot in a tempest when paul came down to dinner the music of the orchestra floated up the elevator shaft to greet him as he stepped into the thronged corridor he sank back into one of the chairs against the wall to get his breath the lights the chatter the perfumes the bewildering medley of colour he had for a moment the feeling of not being able to stand it but only for a moment these were his own people he told himself he went slowly about the corridors through the writingrooms smokingrooms receptionrooms as though he were exploring the chambers of an enchanted palace built and peopled for him alone when he reached the diningroom he sat down at a table near a window the flowers the white linen the manycoloured wine glasses the gay toilettes of the women the low popping of corks the undulating repetitions of the blue danube from the orchestra all flooded pauls dream with bewildering radiance when the roseate tinge of his champagne was added that cold precious bubbling stuff that creamed and foamed in his glass paul wondered that there were honest men in the world at all this was what all the world was fighting for he reflected this was what all the struggle was about he doubted the reality of his past had he ever known a place called cordelia street a place where fagged looking business men boarded the early car mere rivets in a machine they seemed to paul sickening men with combings of childrens hair always hanging to their coats and the smell of cooking in their clothes cordelia street ah that belonged to another time and country had he not always been thus had he not sat here night after night from as far back as he could remember looking pensively over just such shimmering textures and slowly twirling the stem of a glass like this one between his thumb and middle finger he rather thought he had he was not in the least abashed or lonely he had no especial desire to meet or to know any of these people all he demanded was the right to look on and conjecture to watch the pageant the mere stage properties were all he contended for nor was he lonely later in the evening in his loge at the opera he was entirely rid of his nervous misgivings of his forced aggressiveness of the imperative desire to show himself different from his surroundings he felt now that his surroundings explained him nobody questioned the purple he had only to wear it passively he had only to glance down at his dress coat to reassure himself that here it would be impossible for anyone to humiliate him he found it hard to leave his beautiful sittingroom to go to bed that night and sat long watching the raging storm from his turret window when he went to sleep it was with the lights turned on in his bedroom partly because of his old timidity and partly so that if he should wake in the night there would be no wretched moment of doubt no horrible suspicion of yellow wallpaper or of washington and calvin above his bed on sunday morning the city was practically snowbound paul breakfasted late and in the afternoon he fell in with a wild san francisco boy a freshman at yale who said he had run down for a little flyer over sunday the young man offered to show paul the night side of the town and the two boys went off together after dinner not returning to the hotel until seven oclock the next morning they had started out in the confiding warmth of a champagne friendship but their parting in the elevator was singularly cool the freshman pulled himself together to make his train and paul went to bed he awoke at two oclock in the afternoon very thirsty and dizzy and rang for icewater coffee and the pittsburgh papers on the part of the hotel management paul excited no suspicion there was this to be said for him that he wore his spoils with dignity and in no way made himself conspicuous his chief greediness lay in his ears and eyes and his excesses were not offensive ones his dearest pleasures were the grey winter twilights in his sittingroom his quiet enjoyment of his flowers his clothes his wide divan his cigarette and his sense of power he could not remember a time when he had felt so at peace with himself the mere release from the necessity of petty lying lying every day and every day restored his selfrespect he had never lied for pleasure even at school but to make himself noticed and admired to assert his difference from other cordelia street boys and he felt a good deal more manly more honest even now that he had no need for boastful pretensions now that he could as his actor friends used to say dress the part it was characteristic that remorse did not occur to him his golden days went by without a shadow and he made each as perfect as he could on the eighth day after his arrival in new york he found the whole affair exploited in the pittsburgh papers exploited with a wealth of detail which indicated that local news of a sensational nature was at a low ebb the firm of denny carson announced that the boys father had refunded the full amount of his theft and that they had no intention of prosecuting the cumberland minister had been interviewed and expressed his hope of yet reclaiming the motherless lad and pauls sabbathschool teacher declared that she would spare no effort to that end the rumour had reached pittsburgh that the boy had been seen in a new york hotel and his father had gone east to find him and bring him home paul had just come in to dress for dinner he sank into a chair weak in the knees and clasped his head in his hands it was to be worse than jail even the tepid waters of cordelia street were to close over him finally and forever the grey monotony stretched before him in hopeless unrelieved years sabbathschool young peoples meeting the yellowpapered room the damp dishtowels it all rushed back upon him with sickening vividness he had the old feeling that the orchestra had suddenly stopped the sinking sensation that the play was over the sweat broke out on his face and he sprang to his feet looked about him with his white conscious smile and winked at himself in the mirror with something of the childish belief in miracles with which he had so often gone to class all his lessons unlearned paul dressed and dashed whistling down the corridor to the elevator he had no sooner entered the diningroom and caught the measure of the music than his remembrance was lightened by his old elastic power of claiming the moment mounting with it and finding it all sufficient the glare and glitter about him the mere scenic accessories had again and for the last time their old potency he would show himself that he was game he would finish the thing splendidly he doubted more than ever the existence of cordelia street and for the first time he drank his wine recklessly was he not after all one of these fortunate beings was he not still himself and in his own place he drummed a nervous accompaniment to the music and looked about him telling himself over and over that it had paid he reflected drowsily to the swell of the violin and the chill sweetness of his wine that he might have done it more wisely he might have caught an outbound steamer and been well out of their clutches before now but the other side of the world had seemed too far away and too uncertain then he could not have waited for it his need had been too sharp if he had to choose over again he would do the same thing tomorrow he looked affectionately about the diningroom now gilded with a soft mist ah it had paid indeed paul was awakened next morning by a painful throbbing in his head and feet he had thrown himself across the bed without undressing and had slept with his shoes on his limbs and hands were lead heavy and his tongue and throat were parched there came upon him one of those fateful attacks of clearheadedness that never occurred except when he was physically exhausted and his nerves hung loose he lay still and closed his eyes and let the tide of realities wash over him his father was in new york stopping at some joint or other he told himself the memory of successive summers on the front stoop fell upon him like a weight of black water he had not a hundred dollars left and he knew now more than ever that money was everything the wall that stood between all he loathed and all he wanted the thing was winding itself up he had thought of that on his first glorious day in new york and had even provided a way to snap the thread it lay on his dressingtable now he had got it out last night when he came blindly up from dinner but the shiny metal hurt his eyes and he disliked the look of it anyway he rose and moved about with a painful effort succumbing now and again to attacks of nausea it was the old depression exaggerated all the world had become cordelia street yet somehow he was not afraid of anything was absolutely calm perhaps because he had looked into the dark corner at last and knew it was bad enough what he saw there but somehow not so bad as his long fear of it had been he saw everything clearly now he had a feeling that he had made the best of it that he had lived the sort of life he was meant to live and for half an hour he sat staring at the revolver but he told himself that was not the way so he went downstairs and took a cab to the ferry when paul arrived at newark he got off the train and took another cab directing the driver to follow the pennsylvania tracks out of the town the snow lay heavy on the roadways and had drifted deep in the open fields only here and there the dead grass or dried weed stalks projected singularly black above it once well into the country paul dismissed the carriage and walked floundering along the tracks his mind a medley of irrelevant things he seemed to hold in his brain an actual picture of everything he had seen that morning he remembered every feature of both his drivers the toothless old woman from whom he had bought the red flowers in his coat the agent from whom he had got his ticket and all of his fellowpassengers on the ferry his mind unable to cope with vital matters near at hand worked feverishly and deftly at sorting and grouping these images they made for him a part of the ugliness of the world of the ache in his head and the bitter burning on his tongue he stooped and put a handful of snow into his mouth as he walked but that too seemed hot when he reached a little hillside where the tracks ran through a cut some twenty feet below him he stopped and sat down the carnations in his coat were drooping with the cold he noticed all their red glory over it occurred to him that all the flowers he had seen in the show windows that first night must have gone the same way long before this it was only one splendid breath they had in spite of their brave mockery at the winter outside the glass it was a losing game in the end it seemed this revolt against the homilies by which the world is run paul took one of the blossoms carefully from his coat and scooped a little hole in the snow where he covered it up then he dozed a while from his weak condition seeming insensible to the cold the sound of an approaching train woke him and he started to his feet remembering only his resolution and afraid lest he should be too late he stood watching the approaching locomotive his teeth chattering his lips drawn away from them in a frightened smile once or twice he glanced nervously sidewise as though he were being watched when the right moment came he jumped as he fell the folly of his haste occurred to him with merciless clearness the vastness of what he had left undone there flashed through his brain clearer than ever before the blue of adriatic water the yellow of algerian sands he felt something strike his chest his body was being thrown swiftly through the air on and on immeasurably far and fast while his limbs gently relaxed then because the picture making mechanism was crushed the disturbing visions flashed into black and paul dropped back into the immense design of things a wagner matinee i received one morning a letter written in pale ink on glassy bluelined notepaper and bearing the postmark of a little nebraska village this communication worn and rubbed looking as if it had been carried for some days in a coat pocket that was none too clean was from my uncle howard and informed me that his wife had been left a small legacy by a bachelor relative and that it would be necessary for her to go to boston to attend to the settling of the estate he requested me to meet her at the station and render her whatever services might be necessary on examining the date indicated as that of her arrival i found it to be no later than tomorrow he had characteristically delayed writing until had i been away from home for a day i must have missed my aunt altogether the name of my aunt georgiana opened before me a gulf of recollection so wide and deep that as the letter dropped from my hand i felt suddenly a stranger to all the present conditions of my existence wholly ill at ease and out of place amid the familiar surroundings of my study i became in short the gangling farmerboy my aunt had known scourged with chilblains and bashfulness my hands cracked and sore from the corn husking i sat again before her parlour organ fumbling the scales with my stiff red fingers while she beside me made canvas mittens for the huskers the next morning after preparing my landlady for a visitor i set out for the station when the train arrived i had some difficulty in finding my aunt she was the last of the passengers to alight and it was not until i got her into the carriage that she seemed really to recognize me she had come all the way in a day coach her linen duster had become black with soot and her black bonnet grey with dust during the journey when we arrived at my boardinghouse the landlady put her to bed at once and i did not see her again until the next morning whatever shock mrs springer experienced at my aunts appearance she considerately concealed as for myself i saw my aunts battered figure with that feeling of awe and respect with which we behold explorers who have left their ears and fingers north of franzjosephland or their health somewhere along the upper congo my aunt georgiana had been a music teacher at the boston conservatory somewhere back in the latter sixties one summer while visiting in the little village among the green mountains where her ancestors had dwelt for generations she had kindled the callow fancy of my uncle howard carpenter then an idle shiftless boy of twentyone when she returned to her duties in boston howard followed her and the upshot of this infatuation was that she eloped with him eluding the reproaches of her family and the criticism of her friends by going with him to the nebraska frontier carpenter who of course had no money took up a homestead in red willow county fifty miles from the railroad there they had measured off their land themselves driving across the prairie in a wagon to the wheel of which they had tied a red cotton handkerchief and counting its revolutions they built a dugout in the red hillside one of those cave dwellings whose inmates so often reverted to primitive conditions their water they got from the lagoons where the buffalo drank and their slender stock of provisions was always at the mercy of bands of roving indians for thirty years my aunt had not been farther than fifty miles from the homestead i owed to this woman most of the good that ever came my way in my boyhood and had a reverential affection for her during the years when i was riding herd for my uncle my aunt after cooking the three meals the first of which was ready at six oclock in the morning and putting the six children to bed would often stand until midnight at her ironingboard with me at the kitchen table beside her hearing me recite latin declensions and conjugations gently shaking me when my drowsy head sank down over a page of irregular verbs it was to her at her ironing or mending that i read my first shakspere and her old textbook on mythology was the first that ever came into my empty hands she taught me my scales and exercises on the little parlour organ which her husband had bought her after fifteen years during which she had not so much as seen a musical instrument she would sit beside me by the hour darning and counting while i struggled with the joyous farmer she seldom talked to me about music and i understood why once when i had been doggedly beating out some easy passages from an old score of euryanthe i had found among her music books she came up to me and putting her hands over my eyes gently drew my head back upon her shoulder saying tremulously dont love it so well clark or it may be taken from you when my aunt appeared on the morning after her arrival in boston she was still in a semisomnambulant state she seemed not to realize that she was in the city where she had spent her youth the place longed for hungrily half a lifetime she had been so wretchedly trainsick throughout the journey that she had no recollection of anything but her discomfort and to all intents and purposes there were but a few hours of nightmare between the farm in red willow county and my study on newbury street i had planned a little pleasure for her that afternoon to repay her for some of the glorious moments she had given me when we used to milk together in the strawthatched cowshed and she because i was more than usually tired or because her husband had spoken sharply to me would tell me of the splendid performance of the huguenots she had seen in paris in her youth at two oclock the symphony orchestra was to give a wagner program and i intended to take my aunt though as i conversed with her i grew doubtful about her enjoyment of it i suggested our visiting the conservatory and the common before lunch but she seemed altogether too timid to wish to venture out she questioned me absently about various changes in the city but she was chiefly concerned that she had forgotten to leave instructions about feeding halfskimmed milk to a certain weakling calf old maggies calf you know clark she explained evidently having forgotten how long i had been away she was further troubled because she had neglected to tell her daughter about the freshlyopened kit of mackerel in the cellar which would spoil if it were not used directly i asked her whether she had ever heard any of the wagnerian operas and found that she had not though she was perfectly familiar with their respective situations and had once possessed the piano score of the flying dutchman i began to think it would be best to get her back to red willow county without waking her and regretted having suggested the concert from the time we entered the concert hall however she was a trifle less passive and inert and for the first time seemed to perceive her surroundings i had felt some trepidation lest she might become aware of her queer country clothes or might experience some painful embarrassment at stepping suddenly into the world to which she had been dead for a quarter of a century but again i found how superficially i had judged her she sat looking about her with eyes as impersonal almost as stony as those with which the granite rameses in a museum watches the froth and fret that ebbs and flows about his pedestal i have seen this same aloofness in old miners who drift into the brown hotel at denver their pockets full of bullion their linen soiled their haggard faces unshaven standing in the thronged corridors as solitary as though they were still in a frozen camp on the yukon the matinйe audience was made up chiefly of women one lost the contour of faces and figures indeed any effect of line whatever and there was only the colour of bodices past counting the shimmer of fabrics soft and firm silky and sheer red mauve pink blue lilac purple йcru rose yellow cream and white all the colours that an impressionist finds in a sunlit landscape with here and there the dead shadow of a frock coat my aunt georgiana regarded them as though they had been so many daubs of tubepaint on a palette when the musicians came out and took their places she gave a little stir of anticipation and looked with quickening interest down over the rail at that invariable grouping perhaps the first wholly familiar thing that had greeted her eye since she had left old maggie and her weakling calf i could feel how all those details sank into her soul for i had not forgotten how they had sunk into mine when i came fresh from ploughing forever and forever between green aisles of corn where as in a treadmill one might walk from daybreak to dusk without perceiving a shadow of change the clean profiles of the musicians the gloss of their linen the dull black of their coats the beloved shapes of the instruments the patches of yellow light on the smooth varnished bellies of the cellos and the bass viols in the rear the restless windtossed forest of fiddle necks and bows i recalled how in the first orchestra i ever heard those long bowstrokes seemed to draw the heart out of me as a conjurers stick reels out yards of paper ribbon from a hat the first number was the tannhauser overture when the horns drew out the first strain of the pilgrims chorus aunt georgiana clutched my coat sleeve then it was i first realized that for her this broke a silence of thirty years with the battle between the two motives with the frenzy of the venusberg theme and its ripping of strings there came to me an overwhelming sense of the waste and wear we are so powerless to combat and i saw again the tall naked house on the prairie black and grim as a wooden fortress the black pond where i had learned to swim its margin pitted with sundried cattle tracks the rain gullied clay banks about the naked house the four dwarf ash seedlings where the dishcloths were always hung to dry before the kitchen door the world there was the flat world of the ancients to the east a cornfield that stretched to daybreak to the west a corral that reached to sunset between the conquests of peace dearerbought than those of war the overture closed my aunt released my coat sleeve but she said nothing she sat staring dully at the orchestra what i wondered did she get from it she had been a good pianist in her day i knew and her musical education had been broader than that of most music teachers of a quarter of a century ago she had often told me of mozarts operas and meyerbeers and i could remember hearing her sing years ago certain melodies of verdi when i had fallen ill with a fever in her house she used to sit by my cot in the evening when the cool night wind blew in through the faded mosquito netting tacked over the window and i lay watching a certain bright star that burned red above the cornfield and sing home to our mountains o let us return in a way fit to break the heart of a vermont boy near dead of homesickness already i watched her closely through the prelude to tristan and isolde trying vainly to conjecture what that seething turmoil of strings and winds might mean to her but she sat mutely staring at the violin bows that drove obliquely downward like the pelting streaks of rain in a summer shower had this music any message for her had she enough left to at all comprehend this power which had kindled the world since she had left it i was in a fever of curiosity but aunt georgiana sat silent upon her peak in darien she preserved this utter immobility throughout the number from the flying dutchman though her fingers worked mechanically upon her black dress as if of themselves they were recalling the piano score they had once played poor hands they had been stretched and twisted into mere tentacles to hold and lift and knead with on one of them a thin worn band that had once been a wedding ring as i pressed and gently quieted one of those groping hands i remembered with quivering eyelids their services for me in other days soon after the tenor began the prize song i heard a quick drawn breath and turned to my aunt her eyes were closed but the tears were glistening on her cheeks and i think in a moment more they were in my eyes as well it never really died then the soul which can suffer so excruciatingly and so interminably it withers to the outward eye only like that strange moss which can lie on a dusty shelf half a century and yet if placed in water grows green again she wept so throughout the development and elaboration of the melody during the intermission before the second half i questioned my aunt and found that the prize song was not new to her some years before there had drifted to the farm in red willow county a young german a tramp cowpuncher who had sung in the chorus at bayreuth when he was a boy along with the other peasant boys and girls of a sunday morning he used to sit on his ginghamsheeted bed in the hands bedroom which opened off the kitchen cleaning the leather of his boots and saddle singing the prize song while my aunt went about her work in the kitchen she had hovered over him until she had prevailed upon him to join the country church though his sole fitness for this step in so far as i could gather lay in his boyish face and his possession of this divine melody shortly afterward he had gone to town on the fourth of july been drunk for several days lost his money at a faro table ridden a saddled texas steer on a bet and disappeared with a fractured collarbone all this my aunt told me huskily wanderingly as though she were talking in the weak lapses of illness well we have come to better things than the old trovatore at any rate aunt georgie i queried with a well meant effort at jocularity her lip quivered and she hastily put her handkerchief up to her mouth from behind it she murmured and you have been hearing this ever since you left me clark her question was the gentlest and saddest of reproaches the second half of the program consisted of four numbers from the ring and closed with siegfrieds funeral march my aunt wept quietly but almost continuously as a shallow vessel overflows in a rainstorm from time to time her dim eyes looked up at the lights burning softly under their dull glass globes the deluge of sound poured on and on i never knew what she found in the shining current of it i never knew how far it bore her or past what happy islands from the trembling of her face i could well believe that before the last number she had been carried out where the myriad graves are into the grey nameless burying grounds of the sea or into some world of death vaster yet where from the beginning of the world hope has lain down with hope and dream with dream and renouncing slept the concert was over the people filed out of the hall chattering and laughing glad to relax and find the living level again but my kinswoman made no effort to rise the harpist slipped the green felt cover over his instrument the fluteplayers shook the water from their mouthpieces the men of the orchestra went out one by one leaving the stage to the chairs and music stands empty as a winter cornfield i spoke to my aunt she burst into tears and sobbed pleadingly i dont want to go clark i dont want to go i understood for her just outside the concert hall lay the black pond with the cattletracked bluffs the tall unpainted house with weathercurled boards naked as a tower the crookbacked ash seedlings where the dishcloths hung to dry the gaunt moulting turkeys picking up refuse about the kitchen door the sculptors funeral a group of the townspeople stood on the station siding of a little kansas town awaiting the coming of the night train which was already twenty minutes overdue the snow had fallen thick over everything in the pale starlight the line of bluffs across the wide white meadows south of the town made soft smokecoloured curves against the clear sky the men on the siding stood first on one foot and then on the other their hands thrust deep into their trousers pockets their overcoats open their shoulders screwed up with the cold and they glanced from time to time toward the southeast where the railroad track wound along the river shore they conversed in low tones and moved about restlessly seeming uncertain as to what was expected of them there was but one of the company who looked as if he knew exactly why he was there and he kept conspicuously apart walking to the far end of the platform returning to the station door then pacing up the track again his chin sunk in the high collar of his overcoat his burly shoulders drooping forward his gait heavy and dogged presently he was approached by a tall spare grizzled man clad in a faded grand army suit who shuffled out from the group and advanced with a certain deference craning his neck forward until his back made the angle of a jackknife threequarters open i reckon shes agoin to be pretty late agin tonight jim he remarked in a squeaky falsetto spose its the snow i dont know responded the other man with a shade of annoyance speaking from out an astonishing cataract of red beard that grew fiercely and thickly in all directions the spare man shifted the quill toothpick he was chewing to the other side of his mouth it aint likely that anybody from the east will come with the corpse i spose he went on reflectively i dont know responded the other more curtly than before its too bad he didnt belong to some lodge or other i like an order funeral myself they seem more appropriate for people of some repytation the spare man continued with an ingratiating concession in his shrill voice as he carefully placed his toothpick in his vest pocket he always carried the flag at the gar funerals in the town the heavy man turned on his heel without replying and walked up the siding the spare man rejoined the uneasy group jims ez full ez a tick ez ushel he commented commiseratingly just then a distant whistle sounded and there was a shuffling of feet on the platform a number of lanky boys of all ages appeared as suddenly and slimily as eels wakened by the crack of thunder some came from the waitingroom where they had been warming themselves by the red stove or half asleep on the slat benches others uncoiled themselves from baggage trucks or slid out of express wagons two clambered down from the drivers seat of a hearse that stood backed up against the siding they straightened their stooping shoulders and lifted their heads and a flash of momentary animation kindled their dull eyes at that cold vibrant scream the worldwide call for men it stirred them like the note of a trumpet just as it had often stirred the man who was coming home tonight in his boyhood the night express shot red as a rocket from out the eastward marsh lands and wound along the river shore under the long lines of shivering poplars that sentinelled the meadows the escaping steam hanging in grey masses against the pale sky and blotting out the milky way in a moment the red glare from the headlight streamed up the snowcovered track before the siding and glittered on the wet black rails the burly man with the dishevelled red beard walked swiftly up the platform toward the approaching train uncovering his head as he went the group of men behind him hesitated glanced questioningly at one another and awkwardly followed his example the train stopped and the crowd shuffled up to the express car just as the door was thrown open the man in the gar suit thrusting his head forward with curiosity the express messenger appeared in the doorway accompanied by a young man in a long ulster and travelling cap are mr merricks friends here inquired the young man the group on the platform swayed uneasily philip phelps the banker responded with dignity we have come to take charge of the body mr merricks father is very feeble and cant be about send the agent out here growled the express messenger and tell the operator to lend a hand the coffin was got out of its roughbox and down on the snowy platform the townspeople drew back enough to make room for it and then formed a close semicircle about it looking curiously at the palm leaf which lay across the black cover no one said anything the baggage man stood by his truck waiting to get at the trunks the engine panted heavily and the fireman dodged in and out among the wheels with his yellow torch and long oilcan snapping the spindle boxes the young bostonian one of the dead sculptors pupils who had come with the body looked about him helplessly he turned to the banker the only one of that black uneasy stoopshouldered group who seemed enough of an individual to be addressed none of mr merricks brothers are here he asked uncertainly the man with the red beard for the first time stepped up and joined the others no they have not come yet the family is scattered the body will be taken directly to the house he stooped and took hold of one of the handles of the coffin take the long hill road up thompson it will be easier on the horses called the liveryman as the undertaker snapped the door of the hearse and prepared to mount to the drivers seat laird the redbearded lawyer turned again to the stranger we didnt know whether there would be any one with him or not he explained its a long walk so youd better go up in the hack he pointed to a single battered conveyance but the young man replied stiffly thank you but i think i will go up with the hearse if you dont object turning to the undertaker ill ride with you they clambered up over the wheels and drove off in the starlight up the long white hill toward the town the lamps in the still village were shining from under the low snowburdened roofs and beyond on every side the plains reached out into emptiness peaceful and wide as the soft sky itself and wrapped in a tangible white silence when the hearse backed up to a wooden sidewalk before a naked weatherbeaten frame house the same composite illdefined group that had stood upon the station siding was huddled about the gate the front yard was an icy swamp and a couple of warped planks extending from the sidewalk to the door made a sort of rickety footbridge the gate hung on one hinge and was opened wide with difficulty steavens the young stranger noticed that something black was tied to the knob of the front door the grating sound made by the casket as it was drawn from the hearse was answered by a scream from the house the front door was wrenched open and a tall corpulent woman rushed out bareheaded into the snow and flung herself upon the coffin shrieking my boy my boy and this is how youve come home to me as steavens turned away and closed his eyes with a shudder of unutterable repulsion another woman also tall but flat and angular dressed entirely in black darted out of the house and caught mrs merrick by the shoulders crying sharply come come mother you mustnt go on like this her tone changed to one of obsequious solemnity as she turned to the banker the parlour is ready mr phelps the bearers carried the coffin along the narrow boards while the undertaker ran ahead with the coffinrests they bore it into a large unheated room that smelled of dampness and disuse and furniture polish and set it down under a hanging lamp ornamented with jingling glass prisms and before a rogers group of john alden and priscilla wreathed with smilax henry steavens stared about him with the sickening conviction that there had been a mistake and that he had somehow arrived at the wrong destination he looked at the clovergreen brussels the fat plush upholstery among the handpainted china placques and panels and vases for some mark of identification for something that might once conceivably have belonged to harvey merrick it was not until he recognized his friend in the crayon portrait of a little boy in kilts and curls hanging above the piano that he felt willing to let any of these people approach the coffin take the lid off mr thompson let me see my boys face wailed the elder woman between her sobs this time steavens looked fearfully almost beseechingly into her face red and swollen under its masses of strong black shiny hair he flushed dropped his eyes and then almost incredulously looked again there was a kind of power about her face a kind of brutal handsomeness even but it was scarred and furrowed by violence and so coloured and coarsened by fiercer passions that grief seemed never to have laid a gentle finger there the long nose was distended and knobbed at the end and there were deep lines on either side of it her heavy black brows almost met across her forehead her teeth were large and square and set far apart teeth that could tear she filled the room the men were obliterated seemed tossed about like twigs in an angry water and even steavens felt himself being drawn into the whirlpool the daughter the tall rawboned woman in crкpe with a mourning comb in her hair which curiously lengthened her long face sat stiffly upon the sofa her hands conspicuous for their large knuckles folded in her lap her mouth and eyes drawn down solemnly awaiting the opening of the coffin near the door stood a mulatto woman evidently a servant in the house with a timid bearing and an emaciated face pitifully sad and gentle she was weeping silently the corner of her calico apron lifted to her eyes occasionally suppressing a long quivering sob steavens walked over and stood beside her feeble steps were heard on the stairs and an old man tall and frail odorous of pipe smoke with shaggy unkept grey hair and a dingy beard tobacco stained about the mouth entered uncertainly he went slowly up to the coffin and stood rolling a blue cotton handkerchief between his hands seeming so pained and embarrassed by his wifes orgy of grief that he had no consciousness of anything else there there annie dear dont take on so he quavered timidly putting out a shaking hand and awkwardly patting her elbow she turned and sank upon his shoulder with such violence that he tottered a little he did not even glance toward the coffin but continued to look at her with a dull frightened appealing expression as a spaniel looks at the whip his sunken cheeks slowly reddened and burned with miserable shame when his wife rushed from the room her daughter strode after her with set lips the servant stole up to the coffin bent over it for a moment and then slipped away to the kitchen leaving steavens the lawyer and the father to themselves the old man stood looking down at his dead sons face the sculptors splendid head seemed even more noble in its rigid stillness than in life the dark hair had crept down upon the wide forehead the face seemed strangely long but in it there was not that repose we expect to find in the faces of the dead the brows were so drawn that there were two deep lines above the beaked nose and the chin was thrust forward defiantly it was as though the strain of life had been so sharp and bitter that death could not at once relax the tension and smooth the countenance into perfect peace as though he were still guarding something precious which might even yet be wrested from him the old mans lips were working under his stained beard he turned to the lawyer with timid deference phelps and the rest are comin back to set up with harve aint they he asked thankee jim thankee he brushed the hair back gently from his sons forehead he was a good boy jim always a good boy he was ez gentle ez a child and the kindest of em all only we didnt none of us ever onderstand him the tears trickled slowly down his beard and dropped upon the sculptors coat martin martin oh martin come here his wife wailed from the top of the stairs the old man started timorously yes annie im coming he turned away hesitated stood for a moment in miserable indecision then reached back and patted the dead mans hair softly and stumbled from the room poor old man i didnt think he had any tears left seems as if his eyes would have gone dry long ago at his age nothing cuts very deep remarked the lawyer something in his tone made steavens glance up while the mother had been in the room the young man had scarcely seen any one else but now from the moment he first glanced into jim lairds florid face and bloodshot eyes he knew that he had found what he had been heartsick at not finding before the feeling the understanding that must exist in some one even here the man was red as his beard with features swollen and blurred by dissipation and a hot blazing blue eye his face was strained that of a man who is controlling himself with difficulty and he kept plucking at his beard with a sort of fierce resentment steavens sitting by the window watched him turn down the glaring lamp still its jangling pendants with an angry gesture and then stand with his hands locked behind him staring down into the masters face he could not help wondering what link there had been between the porcelain vessel and so sooty a lump of potters clay from the kitchen an uproar was sounding when the diningroom door opened the import of it was clear the mother was abusing the maid for having forgotten to make the dressing for the chicken salad which had been prepared for the watchers steavens had never heard anything in the least like it it was injured emotional dramatic abuse unique and masterly in its excruciating cruelty as violent and unrestrained as had been her grief of twenty minutes before with a shudder of disgust the lawyer went into the diningroom and closed the door into the kitchen poor roxys getting it now he remarked when he came back the merricks took her out of the poorhouse years ago and if her loyalty would let her i guess the poor old thing could tell tales that would curdle your blood shes the mulatto woman who was standing in here a while ago with her apron to her eyes the old woman is a fury there never was anybody like her she made harveys life a hell for him when he lived at home he was so sick ashamed of it i never could see how he kept himself sweet he was wonderful said steavens slowly wonderful but until tonight i have never known how wonderful that is the eternal wonder of it anyway that it can come even from such a dung heap as this the lawyer cried with a sweeping gesture which seemed to indicate much more than the four walls within which they stood i think ill see whether i can get a little air the room is so close i am beginning to feel rather faint murmured steavens struggling with one of the windows the sash was stuck however and would not yield so he sat down dejectedly and began pulling at his collar the lawyer came over loosened the sash with one blow of his red fist and sent the window up a few inches steavens thanked him but the nausea which had been gradually climbing into his throat for the last half hour left him with but one desire a desperate feeling that he must get away from this place with what was left of harvey merrick oh he comprehended well enough now the quiet bitterness of the smile that he had seen so often on his masters lips once when merrick returned from a visit home he brought with him a singularly feeling and suggestive basrelief of a thin faded old woman sitting and sewing something pinned to her knee while a fulllipped fullblooded little urchin his trousers held up by a single gallows stood beside her impatiently twitching her gown to call her attention to a butterfly he had caught steavens impressed by the tender and delicate modelling of the thin tired face had asked him if it were his mother he remembered the dull flush that had burned up in the sculptors face the lawyer was sitting in a rockingchair beside the coffin his head thrown back and his eyes closed steavens looked at him earnestly puzzled at the line of the chin and wondering why a man should conceal a feature of such distinction under that disfiguring shock of beard suddenly as though he felt the young sculptors keen glance jim laird opened his eyes was he always a good deal of an oyster he asked abruptly he was terribly shy as a boy yes he was an oyster since you put it so rejoined stevens although he could be very fond of people he always gave one the impression of being detached he disliked violent emotion he was reflective and rather distrustful of himself except of course as regarded his work he was sure enough there he distrusted men pretty thoroughly and women even more yet somehow without believing ill of them he was determined indeed to believe the best but he seemed afraid to investigate a burnt dog dreads the fire said the lawyer grimly and closed his eyes steavens went on and on reconstructing that whole miserable boyhood all this raw biting ugliness had been the portion of the man whose mind was to become an exhaustless gallery of beautiful impressions so sensitive that the mere shadow of a poplar leaf flickering against a sunny wall would be etched and held there for ever surely if ever a man had the magic word in his finger tips it was merrick whatever he touched he revealed its holiest secret liberated it from enchantment and restored it to its pristine loveliness upon whatever he had come in contact with he had left a beautiful record of the experience a sort of ethereal signature a scent a sound a colour that was his own steavens understood now the real tragedy of his masters life neither love nor wine as many had conjectured but a blow which had fallen earlier and cut deeper than anything else could have done a shame not his and yet so unescapably his to bide in his heart from his very boyhood and without the frontier warfare the yearning of a boy cast ashore upon a desert of newness and ugliness and sordidness for all that is chastened and old and noble with traditions at eleven oclock the tall flat woman in black announced that the watchers were arriving and asked them to step into the diningroom as steavens rose the lawyer said dryly you go on itll be a good experience for you im not equal to that crowd tonight ive had twenty years of them as steavens closed the door after him he glanced back at the lawyer sitting by the coffin in the dim light with his chin resting on his hand the same misty group that had stood before the door of the express car shuffled into the diningroom in the light of the kerosene lamp they separated and became individuals the minister a pale feeblelooking man with white hair and blond chinwhiskers took his seat beside a small side table and placed his bible upon it the grand army man sat down behind the stove and tilted his chair back comfortably against the wall fishing his quill toothpick from his waistcoat pocket the two bankers phelps and elder sat off in a corner behind the dinnertable where they could finish their discussion of the new usury law and its effect on chattel security loans the real estate agent an old man with a smiling hypocritical face soon joined them the coal and lumber dealer and the cattle shipper sat on opposite sides of the hard coalburner their feet on the nickelwork steavens took a book from his pocket and began to read the talk around him ranged through various topics of local interest while the house was quieting down when it was clear that the members of the family were in bed the grand army man hitched his shoulders and untangling his long legs caught his heels on the rounds of his chair spose therell be a will phelps he queried in his weak falsetto the banker laughed disagreeably and began trimming his nails with a pearlhandled pocketknife therell scarcely be any need for one will there he queried in his turn the restless grand army man shifted his position again getting his knees still nearer his chin why the ole man says harves done right well lately he chirped the other banker spoke up i reckon he means by that harve aint asked him to mortgage any more farms lately so as he could go on with his education seems like my mind dont reach back to a time when harve wasnt bein edycated tittered the grand army man there was a general chuckle the minister took out his handkerchief and blew his nose sonorously banker phelps closed his knife with a snap its too bad the old mans sons didnt turn out better he remarked with reflective authority they never hung together he spent money enough on harve to stock a dozen cattlefarms and he might as well have poured it into sand creek if harve had stayed at home and helped nurse what little they had and gone into stock on the old mans bottom farm they might all have been well fixed but the old man had to trust everything to tenants and was cheated right and left harve never could have handled stock none interposed the cattleman he hadnt it in him to be sharp do you remember when he bought sanders mules for eightyear olds when everybody in town knew that sanders fatherinlaw give em to his wife for a wedding present eighteen years before an they was fullgrown mules then the company laughed discreetly and the grand army man rubbed his knees with a spasm of childish delight harve never was much account for anything practical and he shore was never fond of work began the coal and lumber dealer i mind the last time he was home the day he left when the old man was out to the barn helpin his hand hitch up to take harve to the train and cal moots was patchin up the fence harve he come out on the step and sings out in his ladylike voice cal moots cal moots please come cord my trunk thats harve for you approved the grand army man i kin hear him howlin yet when he was a big feller in long pants and his mother used to whale him with a rawhide in the barn for lettin the cows git foundered in the cornfield when he was drivin em home from pasture he killed a cow of mine thataway onct a pure jersey and the best milker i had an the ole man had to put up for her harve he was watchin the sun set acrost the marshes when the anamile got away where the old man made his mistake was in sending the boy east to school said phelps stroking his goatee and speaking in a deliberate judicial tone there was where he got his head full of nonsense what harve needed of all people was a course in some firstclass kansas city business college the letters were swimming before steavenss eyes was it possible that these men did not understand that the palm on the coffin meant nothing to them the very name of their town would have remained for ever buried in the postal guide had it not been now and again mentioned in the world in connection with harvey merricks he remembered what his master had said to him on the day of his death after the congestion of both lungs had shut off any probability of recovery and the sculptor had asked his pupil to send his body home its not a pleasant place to be lying while the world is moving and doing and bettering he had said with a feeble smile but it rather seems as though we ought to go back to the place we came from in the end the townspeople will come in for a look at me and after they have had their say i shant have much to fear from the judgment of god the cattleman took up the comment fortys young for a merrick to cash in they usually hang on pretty well probably he helped it along with whisky his mothers people were not long lived and harvey never had a robust constitution said the minister mildly he would have liked to say more he had been the boys sundayschool teacher and had been fond of him but he felt that he was not in a position to speak his own sons had turned out badly and it was not a year since one of them had made his last trip home in the express car shot in a gamblinghouse in the black hills nevertheless there is no disputin that harve frequently looked upon the wine when it was red also variegated and it shore made an oncommon fool of him moralized the cattleman just then the door leading into the parlour rattled loudly and every one started involuntarily looking relieved when only jim laird came out the grand army man ducked his head when he saw the spark in his blue bloodshot eye they were all afraid of jim he was a drunkard but he could twist the law to suit his clients needs as no other man in all western kansas could do and there were many who tried the lawyer closed the door behind him leaned back against it and folded his arms cocking his head a little to one side when he assumed this attitude in the courtroom ears were always pricked up as it usually foretold a flood of withering sarcasm ive been with you gentlemen before he began in a dry even tone when youve sat by the coffins of boys born and raised in this town and if i remember rightly you were never any too well satisfied when you checked them up whats the matter anyhow why is it that reputable young men are as scarce as millionaires in sand city it might almost seem to a stranger that there was some way something the matter with your progressive town why did ruben sayer the brightest young lawyer you ever turned out after he had come home from the university as straight as a die take to drinking and forge a check and shoot himself why did bill merrits son die of the shakes in a saloon in omaha why was mr thomass son here shot in a gamblinghouse why did young adams burn his mill to beat the insurance companies and go to the pen the lawyer paused and unfolded his arms laying one clenched fist quietly on the table ill tell you why because you drummed nothing but money and knavery into their ears from the time they wore knickerbockers because you carped away at them as youve been carping here tonight holding our friends phelps and elder up to them for their models as our grandfathers held up george washington and john adams but the boys were young and raw at the business you put them to and how could they match coppers with such artists as phelps and elder you wanted them to be successful rascals they were only unsuccessful ones thats all the difference there was only one boy ever raised in this borderland between ruffianism and civilization who didnt come to grief and you hated harvey merrick more for winning out than you hated all the other boys who got under the wheels lord lord how you did hate him phelps here is fond of saying that he could buy and sell us all out any time hes a mind to but he knew harve wouldnt have given a tinkers damn for his bank and all his cattlefarms put together and a lack of appreciation that way goes hard with phelps old nimrod thinks harve drank too much and this from such as nimrod and me brother elder says harve was too free with the old mans money fell short in filial consideration maybe well we can all remember the very tone in which brother elder swore his own father was a liar in the county court and we all know that the old man came out of that partnership with his son as bare as a sheared lamb but maybe im getting personal and id better be driving ahead at what i want to say the lawyer paused a moment squared his heavy shoulders and went on harvey merrick and i went to school together back east we were dead in earnest and we wanted you all to be proud of us some day we meant to be great men even i and i havent lost my sense of humour gentlemen i meant to be a great man i came back here to practise and i found you didnt in the least want me to be a great man you wanted me to be a shrewd lawyer oh yes our veteran here wanted me to get him an increase of pension because he had dyspepsia phelps wanted a new county survey that would put the widow wilsons little bottom farm inside his south line elder wanted to lend money at per cent a month and get it collected and stark here wanted to wheedle old women up in vermont into investing their annuities in realestate mortgages that are not worth the paper they are written on oh you needed me hard enough and youll go on needing me well i came back here and became the damned shyster you wanted me to be you pretend to have some sort of respect for me and yet youll stand up and throw mud at harvey merrick whose soul you couldnt dirty and whose hands you couldnt tie oh youre a discriminating lot of christians there have been times when the sight of harveys name in some eastern paper has made me hang my head like a whipped dog and again times when i liked to think of him off there in the world away from all this hogwallow climbing the big clean upgrade hed set for himself and we now that weve fought and lied and sweated and stolen and hated as only the disappointed strugglers in a bitter dead little western town know how to do what have we got to show for it harvey merrick wouldnt have given one sunset over your marshes for all youve got put together and you know it its not for me to say why in the inscrutable wisdom of god a genius should ever have been called from this place of hatred and bitter waters but i want this boston man to know that the drivel hes been hearing here tonight is the only tribute any truly great man could have from such a lot of sick sidetracked burntdog landpoor sharks as the herepresent financiers of sand city upon which town may god have mercy the lawyer thrust out his hand to steavens as he passed him caught up his overcoat in the hall and had left the house before the grand army man had had time to lift his ducked head and crane his long neck about at his fellows next day jim laird was drunk and unable to attend the funeral services steavens called twice at his office but was compelled to start east without seeing him he had a presentiment that he would hear from him again and left his address on the lawyers table but if laird found it he never acknowledged it the thing in him that harvey merrick had loved must have gone under ground with harvey merricks coffin for it never spoke again and jim got the cold he died of driving across the colorado mountains to defend one of phelpss sons who had got into trouble out there by cutting government timber a death in the desert everett hilgarde was conscious that the man in the seat across the aisle was looking at him intently he was a large florid man wore a conspicuous diamond solitaire upon his third finger and everett judged him to be a travelling salesman of some sort he had the air of an adaptable fellow who had been about the world and who could keep cool and clean under almost any circumstances the high line flyer as this train was derisively called among railroad men was jerking along through the hot afternoon over the monotonous country between holdredge and cheyenne besides the blond man and himself the only occupants of the car were two dusty bedraggledlooking girls who had been to the exposition at chicago and who were earnestly discussing the cost of their first trip out of colorado the four uncomfortable passengers were covered with a sediment of fine yellow dust which clung to their hair and eyebrows like gold powder it blew up in clouds from the bleak lifeless country through which they passed until they were one colour with the sagebrush and sandhills the grey and yellow desert was varied only by occasional ruins of deserted towns and the little red boxes of stationhouses where the spindling trees and sickly vines in the bluegrass yards made little green reserves fenced off in that confusing wilderness of sand as the slanting rays of the sun beat in stronger and stronger through the carwindows the blond gentleman asked the ladies permission to remove his coat and sat in his lavender striped shirtsleeves with a black silk handkerchief tucked about his collar he had seemed interested in everett since they had boarded the train at holdredge kept glancing at him curiously and then looking reflectively out of the window as though he were trying to recall something but wherever everett went some one was almost sure to look at him with that curious interest and it had ceased to embarrass or annoy him presently the stranger seeming satisfied with his observation leaned back in his seat half closed his eyes and began softly to whistle the spring song from proserpine the cantata that a dozen years before had made its young composer famous in a night everett had heard that air on guitars in old mexico on mandolins at college glees on cottage organs in new england hamlets and only two weeks ago he had heard it played on sleighbells at a variety theatre in denver there was literally no way of escaping his brothers precocity adriance could live on the other side of the atlantic where his youthful indiscretions were forgotten in his mature achievements but his brother had never been able to outrun proserpine and here he found it again in the colorado sandhills not that everett was exactly ashamed of proserpine only a man of genius could have written it but it was the sort of thing that a man of genius outgrows as soon as he can everett unbent a trifle and smiled at his neighbour across the aisle immediately the large man rose and coming over dropped into the seat facing hilgarde extending his card dusty ride isnt it i dont mind it myself im used to it born and bred in de briar patch like brer rabbit ive been trying to place you for a long time i think i must have met you before thank you said everett taking the card my name is hilgarde youve probably met my brother adriance people often mistake me for him the travellingman brought his hand down upon his knee with such vehemence that the solitaire blazed so i was right after all and if youre not adriance hilgarde youre his double i thought i couldnt be mistaken seen him well i guess i never missed one of his recitals at the auditorium and he played the piano score of proserpine through to us once at the chicago press club i used to be on the commercial there before i began to travel for the publishing department of the concern so youre hilgardes brother and here ive run into you at the jumpingoff place sounds like a newspaper yarn doesnt it the travellingman laughed and offering everett a cigar plied him with questions on the only subject that people ever seemed to care to talk to him about at length the salesman and the two girls alighted at a colorado way station and everett went on to cheyenne alone the train pulled into cheyenne at nine oclock late by a matter of four hours or so but no one seemed particularly concerned at its tardiness except the station agent who grumbled at being kept in the office over time on a summer night when everett alighted from the train he walked down the platform and stopped at the track crossing uncertain as to what direction he should take to reach a hotel a phaeton stood near the crossing and a woman held the reins she was dressed in white and her figure was clearly silhouetted against the cushions though it was too dark to see her face everett had scarcely noticed her when the switchengine came puffing up from the opposite direction and the headlight threw a strong glare of light on his face the woman in the phaeton uttered a low cry and dropped the reins everett started forward and caught the horses head but the animal only lifted its ears and whisked its tail in impatient surprise the woman sat perfectly still her head sunk between her shoulders and her handkerchief pressed to her face another woman came out of the depot and hurried toward the phaeton crying katharine dear what is the matter everett hesitated a moment in painful embarrassment then lifted his hat and passed on he was accustomed to sudden recognitions in the most impossible places especially from women while he was breakfasting the next morning the head waiter leaned over his chair to murmur that there was a gentleman waiting to see him in the parlour everett finished his coffee and went in the direction indicated where he found his visitor restlessly pacing the floor his whole manner betrayed a high degree of agitation though his physique was not that of a man whose nerves lie near the surface he was something below medium height squareshouldered and solidly built his thick closely cut hair was beginning to show grey about the ears and his bronzed face was heavily lined his square brown hands were locked behind him and he held his shoulders like a man conscious of responsibilities yet as he turned to greet everett there was an incongruous diffidence in his address goodmorning mr hilgarde he said extending his hand i found your name on the hotel register my name is gaylord im afraid my sister startled you at the station last night and ive come around to explain ah the young lady in the phaeton im sure i didnt know whether i had anything to do with her alarm or not if i did it is i who owe an apology the man coloured a little under the dark brown of his face oh its nothing you could help sir i fully understand that you see my sister used to be a pupil of your brothers and it seems you favour him when the switchengine threw a light on your face it startled her everett wheeled about in his chair oh katharine gaylord is it possible why i used to know her when i was a boy what on earth is she doing here gaylord grimly filled out the pause youve got at the heart of the matter you know my sister had been in bad health for a long time no the last i knew of her she was singing in london my brother and i correspond infrequently and seldom get beyond family matters i am deeply sorry to hear this the lines in charley gaylords brow relaxed a little what im trying to say mr hilgarde is that she wants to see you shes set on it we live several miles out of town but my rigs below and i can take you out any time you can go at once then ill get my hat and be with you in a moment when he came downstairs everett found a cart at the door and charley gaylord drew a long sigh of relief as he gathered up the reins and settled back into his own element i think id better tell you something about my sister before you see her and i dont know just where to begin she travelled in europe with your brother and his wife and sang at a lot of his concerts but i dont know just how much you know about her very little except that my brother always thought her the most gifted of his pupils when i knew her she was very young and very beautiful and quite turned my head for a while everett saw that gaylords mind was entirely taken up by his grief thats the whole thing he went on flecking his horses with the whip she was a great woman as you say and she didnt come of a great family she had to fight her own way from the first she got to chicago and then to new york and then to europe and got a taste for it all and now shes dying here like a rat in a hole out of her own world and she cant fall back into ours weve grown apart some way miles and miles apart and im afraid shes fearfully unhappy its a tragic story youre telling me gaylord said everett they were well out into the country now spinning along over the dusty plains of red grass with the ragged blue outline of the mountains before them tragic cried gaylord starting up in his seat my god nobody will ever know how tragic its a tragedy i live with and eat with and sleep with until ive lost my grip on everything you see she had made a good bit of money but she spent it all going to health resorts its her lungs ive got money enough to send her anywhere but the doctors all say its no use she hasnt the ghost of a chance its just getting through the days now i had no notion she was half so bad before she came to me she just wrote that she was run down now that shes here i think shed be happier anywhere under the sun but she wont leave she says its easier to let go of life here there was a time when i was a brakeman with a run out of bird city iowa and she was a little thing i could carry on my shoulder when i could get her everything on earth she wanted and she hadnt a wish my a month didnt cover and now when ive got a little property together i cant buy her a nights sleep everett saw that whatever charley gaylords present status in the world might be he had brought the brakemans heart up the ladder with him the reins slackened in gaylords hand as they drew up before a showily painted house with many gables and a round tower here we are he said turning to everett and i guess we understand each other they were met at the door by a thin colourless woman whom gaylord introduced as my sister maggie she asked her brother to show mr hilgarde into the musicroom where katharine would join him when everett entered the musicroom he gave a little start of surprise feeling that he had stepped from the glaring wyoming sunlight into some new york studio that he had always known he looked incredulously out of the window at the grey plain that ended in the great upheaval of the rockies the haunting air of familiarity perplexed him suddenly his eye fell upon a large photograph of his brother above the piano then it all became clear enough this was veritably his brothers room if it were not an exact copy of one of the many studios that adriance had fitted up in various parts of the world wearying of them and leaving almost before the renovators varnish had dried it was at least in the same tone in every detail adriances taste was so manifest that the room seemed to exhale his personality among the photographs on the wall there was one of katharine gaylord taken in the days when everett had known her and when the flash of her eye or the flutter of her skirt was enough to set his boyish heart in a tumult even now he stood before the portrait with a certain degree of embarrassment it was the face of a woman already old in her first youth a trifle hard and it told of what her brother had called her fight the camaraderie of her frank confident eyes was qualified by the deep lines about her mouth and the curve of the lips which was both sad and cynical certainly she had more goodwill than confidence toward the world the chief charm of the woman as everett had known her lay in her superb figure and in her eyes which possessed a warm lifegiving quality like the sunlight eyes which glowed with a perpetual salutat to the world everett was still standing before the picture his hands behind him and his head inclined when he heard the door open a tall woman advanced toward him holding out her hand as she started to speak she coughed slightly then laughing said in a low rich voice a trifle husky you see i make the traditional camille entrance how good of you to come mr hilgarde everett was acutely conscious that while addressing him she was not looking at him at all and as he assured her of his pleasure in coming he was glad to have an opportunity to collect himself he had not reckoned upon the ravages of a long illness the long loose folds of her white gown had been especially designed to conceal the sharp outlines of her body but the stamp of her disease was there simple and ugly and obtrusive a pitiless fact that could not be disguised or evaded the splendid shoulders were stooped there was a swaying unevenness in her gait her arms seemed disproportionately long and her hands were transparently white and cold to the touch the changes in her face were less obvious the proud carriage of the head the warm clear eyes even the delicate flush of colour in her cheeks all defiantly remained though they were all in a lower key older sadder softer she sat down upon the divan and began nervously to arrange the pillows of course im ill and i look it but you must be quite frank and sensible about that and get used to it at once for weve no time to lose and if im a trifle irritable you wont mind for im more than usually nervous dont bother with me this morning if you are tired urged everett i can come quite as well tomorrow gracious no she protested with a flash of that quick keen humour that he remembered as a part of her its solitude that im tired to death of solitude and the wrong kind of people you see the minister called on me this morning he happened to be riding by on his bicycle and felt it his duty to stop the funniest feature of his conversation is that he is always excusing my own profession to me but how we are losing time do tell me about new york charley says youre just on from there how does it look and taste and smell just now i think a whiff of the jersey ferry would be as flagons of codliver oil to me are the trees still green in madison square or have they grown brown and dusty does the chaste diana still keep her vows through all the exasperating changes of weather who has your brothers old studio now and what misguided aspirants practise their scales in the rookeries about carnegie hall what do people go to see at the theatres and what do they eat and drink in the world nowadays oh let me die in harlem she was interrupted by a violent attack of coughing and everett embarrassed by her discomfort plunged into gossip about the professional people he had met in town during the summer and the musical outlook for the winter he was diagramming with his pencil some new mechanical device to be used at the metropolitan in the production of the rheingold when he became conscious that she was looking at him intently and that he was talking to the four walls katharine was lying back among the pillows watching him through halfclosed eyes as a painter looks at a picture he finished his explanation vaguely enough and put the pencil back in his pocket as he did so she said quietly how wonderfully like adriance you are he laughed looking up at her with a touch of pride in his eyes that made them seem quite boyish yes isnt it absurd its almost as awkward as looking like napoleon but after all there are some advantages it has made some of his friends like me and i hope it will make you katharine gave him a quick meaning glance from under her lashes oh it did that long ago what a haughty reserved youth you were then and how you used to stare at people and then blush and look cross do you remember that night you took me home from a rehearsal and scarcely spoke a word to me it was the silence of admiration protested everett very crude and boyish but certainly sincere perhaps you suspected something of the sort i believe i suspected a pose the one that boys often affect with singers but it rather surprised me in you for you must have seen a good deal of your brothers pupils everett shook his head i saw my brothers pupils come and go sometimes i was called on to play accompaniments or to fill out a vacancy at a rehearsal or to order a carriage for an infuriated soprano who had thrown up her part but they never spent any time on me unless it was to notice the resemblance you speak of yes observed katharine thoughtfully i noticed it then too but it has grown as you have grown older that is rather strange when you have lived such different lives its not merely an ordinary family likeness of features you know but the suggestion of the other mans personality in your face like an air transposed to another key but im not attempting to define it its beyond me something altogether unusual and a trifle well uncanny she finished laughing everett sat looking out under the red windowblind which was raised just a little as it swung back and forth in the wind it revealed the glaring panorama of the desert a blinding stretch of yellow flat as the sea in dead calm splotched here and there with deep purple shadows and beyond the ragged blue outline of the mountains and the peaks of snow white as the white clouds i remember when i was a child i used to be very sensitive about it i dont think it exactly displeased me or that i would have had it otherwise but it seemed like a birthmark or something not to be lightly spoken of it came into even my relations with my mother ad went abroad to study when he was very young and mother was all broken up over it she did her whole duty by each of us but it was generally understood among us that shed have made burntofferings of us all for him any day i was a little fellow then and when she sat alone on the porch on summer evenings she used sometimes to call me to her and turn my face up in the light that streamed out through the shutters and kiss me and then i always knew she was thinking of adriance poor little chap said katharine in her husky voice how fond people have always been of adriance tell me the latest news of him i havent heard except through the press for a year or more he was in algiers then in the valley of the chelif riding horseback and he had quite made up his mind to adopt the mahometan faith and become an arab how many countries and faiths has he adopted i wonder oh thats adriance chuckled everett he is himself barely long enough to write checks and be measured for his clothes i didnt hear from him while he was an arab i missed that he was writing an algerian suite for the piano then it must be in the publishers hands by this time i have been too ill to answer his letter and have lost touch with him everett drew an envelope from his pocket this came a month ago read it at your leisure thanks i shall keep it as a hostage now i want you to play for me whatever you like but if there is anything new in the world in mercy let me hear it he sat down at the piano and katharine sat near him absorbed in his remarkable physical likeness to his brother and trying to discover in just what it consisted he was of a larger build than adriance and much heavier his face was of the same oval mould but it was grey and darkened about the mouth by continual shaving his eyes were of the same inconstant april colour but they were reflective and rather dull while adriances were always points of high light and always meaning another thing than the thing they meant yesterday it was hard to see why this earnest man should so continually suggest that lyric youthful face as gay as his was grave for adriance though he was ten years the elder and though his hair was streaked with silver had the face of a boy of twenty so mobile that it told his thoughts before he could put them into words a contralto famous for the extravagance of her vocal methods and of her affections once said that the shepherdboys who sang in the vale of tempe must certainly have looked like young hilgarde everett sat smoking on the veranda of the interocean house that night the victim of mournful recollections his infatuation for katharine gaylord visionary as it was had been the most serious of his boyish loveaffairs the fact that it was all so done and dead and far behind him and that the woman had lived her life out since then gave him an oppressive sense of age and loss he remembered how bitter and morose he had grown during his stay at his brothers studio when katharine gaylord was working there and how he had wounded adriance on the night of his last concert in new york he had sat there in the box while his brother and katherine were called back again and again and the flowers went up over the footlights until they were stacked half as high as the piano brooding in his sullen boys heart upon the pride those two felt in each others work spurring each other to their best and beautifully contending in song the footlights had seemed a hard glittering line drawn sharply between their life and his he walked back to his hotel alone and sat in his window staring out on madison square until long after midnight resolved to beat no more at doors that he could never enter everetts week in cheyenne stretched to three and he saw no prospect of release except through the thing he dreaded the bright windy days of the wyoming autumn passed swiftly letters and telegrams came urging him to hasten his trip to the coast but he resolutely postponed his business engagements the mornings he spent on one of charley gaylords ponies or fishing in the mountains in the afternoon he was usually at his post of duty destiny he reflected seems to have very positive notions about the sort of parts we are fitted to play the scene changes and the compensation varies but in the end we usually find that we have played the same class of business from first to last everett had been a stopgap all his life he remembered going through a lookingglass labyrinth when he was a boy and trying gallery after gallery only at every turn to bump his nose against his own face which indeed was not his own but his brothers no matter what his mission east or west by land or sea he was sure to find himself employed in his brothers business one of the tributary lives which helped to swell the shining current of adriance hilgardes it was not the first time that his duty had been to comfort as best he could one of the broken things his brothers imperious speed had cast aside and forgotten he made no attempt to analyse the situation or to state it in exact terms but he accepted it as a commission from his brother to help this woman to die day by day he felt her need for him grow more acute and positive and day by day he felt that in his peculiar relation to her his own individuality played a smaller part his power to minister to her comfort lay solely in his link with his brothers life he knew that she sat by him always watching for some trick of gesture some familiar play of expression some illusion of light and shadow in which he should seem wholly adriance he knew that she lived upon this and that in the exhaustion which followed this turmoil of her dying senses she slept deep and sweet and dreamed of youth and art and days in a certain old florentine garden and not of bitterness and death a few days after his first meeting with katharine gaylord he had cabled his brother to write her he merely said that she was mortally ill he could depend on adriance to say the right thing that was a part of his gift adriance always said not only the right thing but the opportune graceful exquisite thing he caught the lyric essence of the moment the poetic suggestion of every situation moreover he usually did the right thing except when he did very cruel things bent upon making people happy when their existence touched his just as he insisted that his material environment should be beautiful lavishing upon those near him all the warmth and radiance of his rich nature all the homage of the poet and troubadour and when they were no longer near forgetting for that also was a part of adriances gift three weeks after everett had sent his cable when he made his daily call at the gaily painted ranchhouse he found katharine laughing like a girl have you ever thought she said as he entered the musicroom how much these sйances of ours are like heines florentine nights except that i dont give you an opportunity to monopolize the conversation she held his hand longer than usual as she greeted him you are the kindest man living the kindest she added softly everetts grey face coloured faintly as he drew his hand away for he felt that this time she was looking at him and not at a whimsical caricature of his brother she drew a letter with a foreign postmark from between the leaves of a book and held it out smiling you got him to write it dont say you didnt for it came direct you see and the last address i gave him was a place in florida this deed shall be remembered of you when i am with the just in paradise but one thing you did not ask him to do for you didnt know about it he has sent me his latest work the new sonata and you are to play it for me directly but first for the letter i think you would better read it aloud to me everett sat down in a low chair facing the windowseat in which she reclined with a barricade of pillows behind her he opened the letter his lashes halfveiling his kind eyes and saw to his satisfaction that it was a long one wonderfully tactful and tender even for adriance who was tender with his valet and his stableboy with his old gondolier and the beggarwomen who prayed to the saints for him the letter was from granada written in the alhambra as he sat by the fountain of the patio di lindaraxa the air was heavy with the warm fragrance of the south and full of the sound of splashing running water as it had been in a certain old garden in florence long ago the sky was one great turquoise heated until it glowed the wonderful moorish arches threw graceful blue shadows all about him he had sketched an outline of them on the margin of his notepaper the letter was full of confidences about his work and delicate allusions to their old happy days of study and comradeship as everett folded it he felt that adriance had divined the thing needed and had risen to it in his own wonderful way the letter was consistently egotistical and seemed to him even a trifle patronizing yet it was just what she had wanted a strong realization of his brothers charm and intensity and power came over him he felt the breath of that whirlwind of flame in which adriance passed consuming all in his path and himself even more resolutely than he consumed others then he looked down at this white burntout brand that lay before him like him isnt it she said quietly i think i can scarcely answer his letter but when you see him next you can do that for me i want you to tell him many things for me yet they can all be summed up in this i want him to grow wholly into his best and greatest self even at the cost of what is half his charm to you and me do you understand me i know perfectly well what you mean answered everett thoughtfully and yet its difficult to prescribe for those fellows so little makes so little mars katharine raised herself upon her elbow and her face flushed with feverish earnestness ah but it is the waste of himself that i mean his lashing himself out on stupid and uncomprehending people until they take him at their own estimate come come expostulated everett now alarmed at her excitement where is the new sonata let him speak for himself he sat down at the piano and began playing the first movement which was indeed the voice of adriance his proper speech the sonata was the most ambitious work he had done up to that time and marked the transition from his early lyric vein to a deeper and nobler style everett played intelligently and with that sympathetic comprehension which seems peculiar to a certain lovable class of men who never accomplish anything in particular when he had finished he turned to katharine how he has grown she cried what the three last years have done for him he used to write only the tragedies of passion but this is the tragedy of effort and failure the thing keats called hell this is my tragedy as i lie here listening to the feet of the runners as they pass me ah god the swift feet of the runners she turned her face away and covered it with her hands everett crossed over to her and knelt beside her in all the days he had known her she had never before beyond an occasional ironical jest given voice to the bitterness of her own defeat her courage had become a point of pride with him dont do it he gasped i cant stand it i really cant i feel it too much when she turned her face back to him there was a ghost of the old brave cynical smile on it more bitter than the tears she could not shed no i wont i will save that for the night when i have no better company run over that theme at the beginning again will you it was running in his head when we were in venice years ago and he used to drum it on his glass at the dinnertable he had just begun to work it out when the late autumn came on and he decided to go to florence for the winter he lost touch with his idea i suppose during his illness do you remember those frightful days all the people who have loved him are not strong enough to save him from himself when i got word from florence that he had been ill i was singing at monte carlo his wife was hurrying to him from paris but i reached him first i arrived at dusk in a terrific storm they had taken an old palace there for the winter and i found him in the library a long dark room full of old latin books and heavy furniture and bronzes he was sitting by a wood fire at one end of the room looking oh so worn and pale as he always does when he is ill you know ah it is so good that you do know even his red smokingjacket lent no colour to his face his first words were not to tell me how ill he had been but that that morning he had been well enough to put the last strokes to the score of his souvenirs d automne and he was as i most like to remember him calm and happy and tired with that heavenly tiredness that comes after a good work done at last outside the rain poured down in torrents and the wind moaned and sobbed in the garden and about the walls of that desolated old palace how that night comes back to me there were no lights in the room only the wood fire it glowed on the black walls and floor like the reflection of purgatorial flame beyond us it scarcely penetrated the gloom at all adriance sat staring at the fire with the weariness of all his life in his eyes and of all the other lives that must aspire and suffer to make up one such life as his somehow the wind with all its worldpain had got into the room and the cold rain was in our eyes and the wave came up in both of us at once that awful vague universal pain that cold fear of life and death and god and hope and we were like two clinging together on a spar in midocean after the shipwreck of everything then we heard the front door open with a great gust of wind that shook even the walls and the servants came running with lights announcing that madame had returned and in the book we read no more that night she gave the old line with a certain bitter humour and with the hard bright smile in which of old she had wrapped her weakness as in a glittering garment that ironical smile worn through so many years had gradually changed the lines of her face and when she looked in the mirror she saw not herself but the scathing critic the amused observer and satirist of herself everett dropped his head upon his hand how much you have cared he said ah yes i cared she replied closing her eyes you cant imagine what a comfort it is to have you know how i cared what a relief it is to be able to tell it to some one everett continued to look helplessly at the floor i was not sure how much you wanted me to know he said oh i intended you should know from the first time i looked into your face when you came that day with charley you are so like him that it is almost like telling him himself at least i feel now that he will know some day and then i will be quite sacred from his compassion and has he never known at all asked everett in a thick voice oh never at all in the way that you mean of course he is accustomed to looking into the eyes of women and finding love there when he doesnt find it there he thinks he must have been guilty of some discourtesy he has a genuine fondness for every woman who is not stupid or gloomy or old or preternaturally ugly i shared with the rest shared the smiles and the gallantries and the droll little sermons it was quite like a sundayschool picnic we wore our best clothes and a smile and took our turns it was his kindness that was hardest dont youll make me hate him groaned everett katherine laughed and began to play nervously with her fan it wasnt in the slightest degree his fault that is the most grotesque part of it why it had really begun before i ever met him i fought my way to him and i drank my doom greedily enough everett rose and stood hesitating i think i must go you ought to be quiet and i dont think i can hear any more just now she put out her hand and took his playfully youve put in three weeks at this sort of thing havent you well it ought to square accounts for a much worse life than yours will ever be he knelt beside her saying brokenly i stayed because i wanted to be with you thats all i have never cared about other women since i knew you in new york when i was a lad you are a part of my destiny and i could not leave you if i would she put her hands on his shoulders and shook her head no no dont tell me that i have seen enough tragedy it was only a boys fancy and your divine pity and my utter pitiableness have recalled it for a moment one does not love the dying dear friend now go and you will come again tomorrow as long as there are tomorrows she took his hand with a smile that was both courage and despair and full of infinite loyalty and tenderness as she said softly for ever and for ever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made the courage in her eyes was like the clear light of a star to him as he went out on the night of adriance hilgardes opening concert in paris everett sat by the bed in the ranchhouse in wyoming watching over the last battle that we have with the flesh before we are done with it and free of it for ever at times it seemed that the serene soul of her must have left already and found some refuge from the storm and only the tenacious animal life were left to do battle with death she laboured under a delusion at once pitiful and merciful thinking that she was in the pullman on her way to new york going back to her life and her work when she roused from her stupor it was only to ask the porter to waken her half an hour out of jersey city or to remonstrate about the delays and the roughness of the road at midnight everett and the nurse were left alone with her poor charley gaylord had lain down on a couch outside the door everett sat looking at the sputtering nightlamp until it made his eyes ache his head dropped forward and he sank into heavy distressful slumber he was dreaming of adriances concert in paris and of adriance the troubadour he heard the applause and he saw the flowers going up over the footlights until they were stacked half as high as the piano and the petals fell and scattered making crimson splotches on the floor down this crimson pathway came adriance with his youthful step leading his singer by the hand a dark woman this time with spanish eyes the nurse touched him on the shoulder he started and awoke she screened the lamp with her hand everett saw that katharine was awake and conscious and struggling a little he lifted her gently on his arm and began to fan her she looked into his face with eyes that seemed never to have wept or doubted ah dear adriance dear dear she whispered everett went to call her brother but when they came back the madness of art was over for katharine two days later everett was pacing the station siding waiting for the westbound train charley gaylord walked beside him but the two men had nothing to say to each other everetts bags were piled on the truck and his step was hurried and his eyes were full of impatience as he gazed again and again up the track watching for the train gaylords impatience was not less than his own these two who had grown so close had now become painful and impossible to each other and longed for the wrench of farewell as the train pulled in everett wrung gaylords hand among the crowd of alighting passengers the people of a german opera company en route for the coast rushed by them in frantic haste to snatch their breakfast during the stop everett heard an exclamation and a stout woman rushed up to him glowing with joyful surprise and caught his coatsleeve with her tightly gloved hands herr gott adriance lieber freund she cried everett lifted his hat blushing pardon me madame i see that you have mistaken me for adriance hilgarde i am his brother turning from the crestfallen singer he hurried into the car
