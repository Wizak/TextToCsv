art of writing on creativity how to climb the tree of life throw rocks at yourself and get down again without breaking your bones or your spirit a preface with a title not m uch longer than the book sometimes i am stunned at my capacity as a nineyearold to understand my entrapment and escape it how is it that the boy i was in october could because of the criticism of his fourth grade schoolmates tear up his buck rogers comic strips and a month later judge all of his friends idiots and rush back to collecting where did that judgment and strength come from what sort of process did i experience to enable me to say i am as good as dead who is killing me what do i suffer from whats the cure i was able obviously to answer all of the above i named the sickness my tearing up the strips i found the cure go back to collecting no matter what i did and was made well but still at that age when we are accustomed to responding to peer pressure where did i find the courage to rebel change my life live alone i dont want to overestimate all this but damn it i love that nineyearold whoever in hell he was without him i could not have survived to introduce these essays part of the answer of course is in the fact that i was so madly in love with buck rogers i could not see my love my hero my life destroyed it is almost that simple it was like having your best allround greatestlovingbuddy pal centeroflife drown or get shotgun killed friends so killed cannot be saved from funerals buck rogers i realized might know a second life if i gave it to him so i breathed in his mouth and lo he sat up and talked and said what yell jump play outrun those sonsofbitches theyll never live the way you live go do it except i never used the sob words they were not allowed heck was about the size and strength of my outcry stay alive so i collected comics fell in love with carnivals and worlds fairs and began to write and what you ask does writing teach us first and foremost it reminds us that we are alive and that it is a gift and a privilege not a right we must earn life once it has been awarded us life asks for rewards back because it has favored us with animation so while our art cannot as we wish it could save us from wars privation envy greed old age or death it can revitalize us amidst it all secondly writing is survival any art any good work of course is that not to write for many of us is to die we must take arms each and every day perhaps knowing that the battle cannot be entirely won but fight we must if only agentle bout the smallest effort to win means at the end of each day a sort of victory remember that pianist who said that if he did not practice every day he would know if he did not practice for two days the critics would know after three days his audiences would know a variation of this is true for writers not that your style whatever that is would melt out of shape in those few days but what would happen is that the world would catch up with and try to sicken you if you did not write every day the poisons would accumulate and you would begin to die or act crazy or both you must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you for writing allows just the proper recipes of truth life reality as you are able to eat drink and digest without hyperventilating and flopping like a dead fish in your bed i have learned on my journeys that if i let a day go by without writing i grow uneasy two days and i am in tremor three and i suspect lunacy four and i might as well be a hog suffering the flux in a wallow an hours writing is tonic im on my feet running in circles and yelling for a clean pair of spats so that in one way or another is what this book is all about taking your pinch of arsenic every morn so you can survive to sunset another pinch at sunset so that you can morethansurvive until dawn the mircoarsenicdose swallowed here prepares you not to be poisoned and destroyed up ahead work in the midst of life is that dosage to manipulate life toss the brightcolored orbs up to mix with the dark ones blending a variation of truths we use the grand and beautiful facts of existence in order to put up with the horrors that afflict us directly in our families and friends or through the newspapers and tv the horrors are not to be denied who amongst us has not had a cancerdead friend which family exists where some relative has not been killed or maimed by the automobile i know of none in my own circle an aunt and uncle and a cousin as well as six friends have been destroyed by the car the list is endless and crushing if we do not creatively oppose it which means writing as cure not completely of course you never get over your parents in the hospital or your best love in the grave i wont use the word therapy its too clean too sterile a word i only say when death slows others you must leap to set up your diving board and dive head first into your typewriter the poets and artists of other years long past knew all and everything i have said here or put in the following essays aristotle said it for the ages have you listened to him lately these essays were written at various times over a thirtyyear period to express special discoveries to serve special needs but they all echo the same truths of explosive selfrevelation and continuous astonishment at what your deep well contains if you just haul off and shout down it even as i write this a letter has come from a young unknown writer who says he is going to live by my motto found in my toynbee convector to gently lie and prove the lie true everything is finally a promise what seems a lie is a ramshackle need wishing to be born and now i have come up with a new simile to describe myself lately it can be yours every morning i jump out of bed and step on a landmine the i landmine is me after the explosion i spend the rest of the day putting the pieces together now its your turn jump the joy of writing zest gusto how rarely one hears these words used how rarely do we see people living or for that matter creating by them yet if i were asked to name the most important items in a writers makeup the things that shape his material and rush him along the road to where he wants to go i could only warn him to look to his zest see to his gusto you have your list of favorite writers i have mine dickens twain wolfe peacock shaw moliere jonson wycherly sam johnson poets gerard manley hopkins dylan thomas pope painters el greco tintoretto musicians mozart haydn ravel johann strauss think of all these names and you think of big or little but nonetheless important zests appetites hungers think of shakespeare and melville and you think of thunder lightning wind they all knew the joy of creating in large or small forms on unlimited or restricted canvasses these are the children of the gods they knew fun in their work no matter if creation came hard here and there along the way or what illnesses and tragedies touched their most private lives the important things are those passed down to us from their hands and minds and these are full to bursting with animal vigor andintellectual vitality their hatreds and despairs were reported with a kind of love look at el grecos elongation and tell me if you can that he had no joy in his work can you really pretend that tintorettos god creating the animals of the universe is a work founded on anything less than fun in its widest and most completely involved sense the best jazz says gonna live forever dont believe in death the best sculpture like the head of nefertiti says again and again the beautiful one was here is here and will be here forever each of the men i have listed seized a bit of the quicksilver of life froze it for all time and turned in the blaze of their creativity to point at it and cry isnt this good and it was good what has all this to do with writing the short story in our times only this if you are writing without zest without gusto without love without fun you are only half a writer it means you are so busy keeping one eye on the commercial market or one ear peeled for the avantgarde coterie that you are not being yourself you dont even know yourself for the first thing a writer should be isexcited he should be a thing of fevers and enthusiasms without such vigor he might as well be out picking peaches or digging ditches god knows itd be better for his health how long has it been since you wrote a story where your real love or your real hatred somehow got onto the paper when was the last time you dared release a cherished prejudice so itslammed the page like a lightning bolt what are the best things and the worst things in your life and when are you going to get around to whispering or shouting them wouldnt it be wonderful for instance to throw down a copy of harpers bazaar you happened to be leafing through at the dentists and leap to your typewriter and ride off with hilarious anger attacking their silly and sometimes shocking snobbishness years ago i did just that i came across an issue where the bazaar photographers with their perverted sense of equality once again utilized natives in a puerto rican backstreet as props in front of which their starvedlooking mannikins postured for the benefit of yet more emaciated halfwomen in the best salons in the country the photographs so enraged me i ran did not walk to my machine and wrote sun and shadow the story of an old puerto rican who ruins the bazaar photographers afternoon by sneaking into each picture and dropping his pants i dare say there are a few of you who would like to have done this job i had the fun of doing it the cleansing after effects of the hoot the holler and the great horselaugh probably the editors at the bazaar never heard but a lot of readers did and cried go it bazaar go it bradbury i claim no victory but there was blood on my gloves when i hung them up when was the last time you did a story like that out of pure indignation when was the last time you were stopped by the police in your neighborhood because you like to walk and perhaps think atnight it happened to me just often enough that irritated i wrote the pedestrian a story of a time fifty years from now when a man is arrested and taken off for clinical study because he insists on looking at untelevised reality and breathing unairconditioned air irritations and angers aside what about loves what do you love most in the world the big and little things i mean a trolley car a pair of tennis shoes these at one time when we were children were invested with magic for us during the past year ive published one story about a boys last ride in a trolley that smells of all the thunderstorms in time full of coolgreen mossvelvet seats and blue electricity but doomed to be replaced by the more prosaic more practicalsmelling bus another story concerned a boy who wanted to own a pair of new tennis shoes for the power they gave him to leap rivers and houses and streets and even bushes sidewalks and dogs the shoes were to him the surge of antelope and gazelle on african summer veldt the energy of unleashed rivers and summer storms lay in the shoes he had to have them more than anything else in the world so simply then here is my formula what do you want more than anything else in the world what do you love or what do you hate find a character like yourself who will want something or not want something with all his heart give him running orders shoot him off then follow as fast as you can go the character in his great love or hate will rush you through to the end of thestory the zest and gusto of his need and there is zest in hate as well as in love will fire the landscape and raise the temperature of your typewriter thirty degrees all of this is primarily directed to the writer who has already learned his trade that is has put into himself enough grammatical tools and literary knowledge so he wont trip himself up when he wants to run the advice holds good for the beginner too however even though his steps may falter for purely technical reasons even here passion often saves the day the history of each story then should read almost like a weather report hot today cool tomorrow this afternoon burn down the house tomorrow pour cold critical water upon the simmering coals time enough to think and cut and rewrite tomorrow but todayexplodefly apartdisintegrate the other six or seven drafts are going to be pure torture so why not enjoy the first draft in the hope that your joy will seek and find others in the world who reading your story will catch fire too it doesnt have to be a big fire a small blaze candlelight perhaps a longing for a mechanical wonder like a trolley or an animal wonder like a pair of sneakers rabbiting the lawns of early morning look for the little loves find and shape the little bitternesses savor them in your mouth try them on your typewriter when did you last read a book of poetry or take time of an afternoon for an essay or two have you ever read a single issue of geriatrics the official journal of the american geriatrics society a magazine devoted to research and clinical study of thediseases and processes of the aged and aging or read or even seen a copy of whats new a magazine published by the abbott laboratories in north chicago containing articles such as tubocurarene for cesarean section or phenurone in epilepsy but also utilizing poems by william carlos williams archibald macleish stories by clifton fadiman and leo rosten covers and interior illustrations by john groth aaron bohrod william sharp russell cowles absurd perhaps but ideas lie everywhere like apples fallen and melting in the grass for lack of wayfaring strangers with an eye and a tongue for beauty whether absurd horrific or genteel gerard manley hopkins put it this way glory be to god for dappled things for skies of couplecolor as a brinded cow for rosemoles all in stipple upon trout that swim

every hour of his life moliere tasting society turned to pick up his scalpel as did pope and shaw everywhere you look in the literary cosmos the great ones are busy loving and hating have you given up this primary business as obsolete in your own writing what fun you are missing then the fun of anger and disillusion the fun of loving and being loved of moving and being moved by this masked ball which dances us from cradle to churchyard life is short misery sure mortality certain but on the way in your work why not carry those two inflated pigbladders labeled zest and gusto with them traveling to the grave i intend to slap some dummoxs behind pat a pretty girls coiffure wave to a tad up a persimmon tree anyone wants to join me theres plenty of room in coxies army run fast stand still or the thing at the top of the stairs or new ghosts from old minds run fast stand still this the lesson from lizards for all writers observe almost any survival creature you see the same jump run freeze in the ability to flick like an eyelash crack like a whip vanish like steam here this instant gone the nextlife teems the earth and when that life is not rushing to escape it is playing statues to do the same see the hummingbird there not there as thought arises and blinks off so this thing of summer vapor the clearing of a cosmic throat the fall of a leaf and where it wasa whisper what can we writers learn from lizards lift from birds in quickness is truth the faster you blurt the more swiftly you write the more honest you are in hesitation is thought in delay comes the effort for a style instead of leaping upon truth which is the only style worth deadfalling or tigertrapping in between the scurries and flights what be a chameleon inkblend chromosome change with the landscape be a pet rock lie with the dust rest in the rainwater in the filled barrel by the drainspout outside your grandparents window long ago be dandelion wine in the ketchup bottle capped and placed with an inked inscription june morn first day of summer summer fireworks night last day of summer last of the dandelions oct st and out of all this wind up with your first success as a writer at a story in weird tales how do you commence to start to begin an almost new kind of writing to terrify and scare you stumble into it mostly you dont know what youre doing and suddenly its done you dont set out to reform a certain kind of writing it evolves out of your own life and night scares suddenly you look around and see that you have done something almost fresh the problem for any writer in any field is being circumscribed by what has gone before or what is being printed that very day in books and magazines i grew up reading and loving the traditional ghost stories of dickens lovecraft poe and later kuttner bloch and clark ashton smith i tried to write stories heavily influenced by various of these writers and succeeded in making quadruplelayered mudpies all language and style that would not float and sank without a trace i was too young to identify my problem i was so busy imitating i almost blundered into my creative self in my last year in high school when i wrote a kind of long remembrance of the deep ravine in my home town and my fear of it at night but i had no story to go with the ravine so my discovering the true source of my future writing was put off for some few years i wrote at least a thousand words a day every day from the age of twelve on for years poe was looking over one shoulder while wells burroughs and just about every writer in astounding and weird tales looked over the other i loved them and they smothered me i hadnt learned how to look away and in the process look not at myself but at what went on behind my face it was only when i began to discover the treats and tricks that came with word association that i began to find some true way through the minefields of imitation i finally figured out that if you are going to step on a live mine make it your own be blown up as it were by your own delights and despairs i began to put down brief notes and descriptions of loves and hates all during my twentieth and twentyfirst years i circled around summer noons and october midnights sensing that there somewhere in the bright and dark seasons must be something that was really me i finally found it one afternoon when i was twentytwo years old i wrote the title the lake on the first page of a story that finished itself two hours later two hours after that i was sitting at my typewriter out on a porch in the sun with tears running off the tip of my nose and the hair on my neck standing up why the arousal of hair and the dripping nose i realized i had at last written a really fine story the first in ten years of writing and not only was it a fine story but it was some sort of hybrid something verging on the new not a traditional ghost story at all but a story about love time remembrance and drowning i sent it off to julie schwartz my pulp agent who liked it but said it was not a traditional tale and might be hard to sell weird tales walked around it touched it with a tenfoot pole and finally decided what the hey to publish it even though it didnt fit their magazine but i must promise next time to write a good oldfashioned ghost story i promised they gave me twenty dollars and everyone was happy well some of you know the rest the lake has been reprinted dozens of times in the fortyfour years since and it was the story that first got various editors of other magazines to sit up and notice the guy with the aroused hair and the wet nose did i learn a hard fast or even an easy lesson from the lake i did not i went back to writing the oldfashioned ghost story for i was far too young to understand much about writing at all and my discoveries went unnoticed by me for years i was wandering all over the place and writing poorly much of the time during my early twenties if my weird fiction was imitative with an occasional surprise of a concept and a further surprise in execution my sciencefiction writing was abysmal and my detective fiction verged on the ludicrous i was deeply under the influence of my loving friend leigh brackett whom i used to meet every sunday at muscle beach in santa monica california there to read her superior stark on mars tales or to envy and try to emulate her flynns detective stories but along through those years i began to make lists of titles to put down long lines of nouns these lists were the provocations finally that caused my better stuff to surface i was feeling my way toward something honest hidden under the trapdoor on the top of my skull the lists ran something like this the lake the night the crickets the ravine the attic the basement the trapdoor the baby the crowd the night train the fog horn the scythe the carnival the carousel the dwarf the mirror maze the skeleton i was beginning to see a pattern in the list in these words that i had simply flung forth on paper trusting my subconscious to give bread as it were to the birds glancing over the list i discovered my old love and fright having to do with circuses and carnivals i remembered and then forgot and then remembered again how terrified i had been when my mother took me for my first ride on a merrygoround with the calliope screaming and the world spinning and the terrible horses leaping i added my shrieks to the din i did not go near the carousel again for years when i really did decades later it rode me into the midst of something wicked this way comes but long before that i went on making the lists the meadow the toy chest the monster tyrannosaurus rex the town clock the old man the old woman the telephone the sidewalks the coffin the electric chair the magician out on the margin of these nouns i blundered into a sciencefiction story that was not a sciencefiction story my title was r is for rocket the published title was king of the grey spaces the story of two boys great friends one elected to go off to the space academy the other staying home the tale was rejected by every sciencefiction magazine because after all it was only a story about friendship being tested by circumstance even though the circumstance was space travel mary gnaedinger at famous fantastic mysteries took one look at my story and published it but again i was too young to see that r is for rocket would be the kind of story that would make me as a sciencefiction writer admired by some and criticized by many who observed that i was no writer of science fictions i was a people writer and to hell with that i went on making lists having to do not only with night nightmares darkness and objects in attics but the toys that men play with in space and the ideas i found in detective magazines most of the detective material i published in my twentyfourth year in detective tales and dime detective is not worth rereading here and there i fell over my own shoelaces and did a nearly good job of remembering mexico which scared me or downtown los angeles during the pachucho riots but it would take me the better part of forty years to assimilate the detectivemysterysuspense genre and make it work for me in my novel death is a lonely business but back to my lists and why go back to them where am i leading you well if you are a writer or would hope to be one similar lists dredged out of the lopside of your brain might well help you discover you even as i flopped around and finally found me i began to run through those lists pick a noun and then sit down to write a long prosepoemessay on it somewhere along about the middle of the page or perhaps on the second page the prose poem would turn into a story which is to say that a character suddenly appeared and said thats me or thats an idea i like and the character would then finish the tale for me it began to be obvious that i was learning from my lists of nouns and that i was further learning that my characters would do my work for me if i let them alone if i gave them their heads which is to say their fantasies their frights i looked at my list saw skeleton and remembered the first artworks of my childhood i drew skeletons to scare my girl cousins i was fascinated with those unclothed medical displays of skulls and ribs and pelvic sculptures my favorite tune was taint no sin to take off your skin and dance around in your bones remembering my early artwork and my favorite tune i ambled into my doctors office one day with a sore throat i touched myadams apple and the tendons on each side of my neck and asked for his medical advice know what youre suffering from asked the doc what discovery of the larynx he crowed take some aspirin two dollars please discovery of the larynx my god how beautiful i trotted home feeling my throat and then my ribs and then my medulla oblongata and my kneecaps holy moses why not write a story about a man who is terrified to discover that under his skin inside his flesh hidden is a symbol of all the gothic horrors in historya skeleton the story wrote itself in a few hours a perfectly obvious concept yet no one else in the history of writing weird tales had ever scribbled it down i fell into my typewriter with it and came up with a brandnew absolutely original tale which had been lurking under my skin since i first drew a skull and crossbones aged six i began to gain steam the ideas came faster now and all of them from my lists i prowled up in my grandparents attics and down in their basements i listened to the middleofthenight locomotives wailing across the northern illinois landscape and that was death a funeral train taking my loved ones away to some far graveyard i remembered five oclock in the morning predawn arrivals of ringling brothers barnum and bailey and all the animals parading by before sunrise heading for the emptymeadows where the great tents would rise like incredible mushrooms i remembered mr electrico and his traveling electric chair i remembered blackstone the magician dancing magical handkerchiefs and vanishing elephants on my hometown stage i remembered my grandfather my sister and various aunts and cousins in their coffins and gone forever in the tombyards where the butterflies settled like flowers on the graves and where the flowers blew away like butterflies over the stones i remembered my dog lost for days coming home late on a winter night with snow and mud and leaves in his pelt and the stories began to burst to explode from those memories hidden in the nouns lost in the lists my remembrance of my dog and his winter pelt became the emissary the story of a boy sick in bed who sends his dog out to gather the seasons in his fur and report back and then one night the dog comes back from a journey to the graveyard and brings company with him my listed title the old woman became two stories one there was an old woman about a lady who refuses to die and demands her body back from the undertakers defying death and a second tale season of disbelief about some children who refuse to believe that a very old woman was ever young was ever a girl a child the first story appeared in my first collection dark carnival the second became part of a further wordassociation test i gave myself called dandelion wine we can surely see now cant we that it is the personal observation the odd fancy the strange conceit that pays off i was fascinated by old people i tried to solve their mystery with my eyes and young mind but was continually astounded to realize that once upon a time they had been me and some day up ahead i would be them absolutely impossible yet there the boys and girls were locked in old bodies a dreadful situation a terrible trick right before my gaze pilfering from my list again i seized out the title the jar the result of my being stunned at an encounter with a series of embryos on display in a carnival when i was twelve and again when i was fourteen in those longgone days of and we children knew nothing of course absolutely nothing about sex and procreation so you can imagine how astounded i was when i prowled through a free carnival exhibit and saw all those fetuses of humans and cats and dogs displayed in labeled jars i was shocked by the look of the unborn dead and the new mysteries of life they caused to rise up in my head later that night and all through the years i never mentioned the jars and the formaldehyde fetuses to my parents i knew i had stumbled on some truths which were better not discussed all of this surfaced of course when i wrote the jar and the carnival and the fetal displays and all the old terrors poured out of my fingertips into my typewriter the old mystery had finally found a resting place in a story i found another title in my list the crowd and typing furiously i recalled a terrible concussion when i was fifteen andran from a friends house at the sound to be confronted by a car that had hit an obstruction in the street and rocketed into a telephone pole the car was split in half two people lay dead on the pavement another woman died just as i reached her her face ruined another man died a minute later still another died the next day i had never seen anything like it i walked home bumping into trees in shock it took me months to get over the horror of that scene years later with my list before me i remembered a number of peculiar things about that night the accident had occurred at an intersection surrounded on one side by empty factories and a deserted schoolyard and on the opposite side by a graveyard i had come running from the nearest house a hundred yards away yet within moments it seemed a crowd had gathered where had they all come from later on in time i could only imagine that some came in some strange fashion out of the empty factories or even more strangely out of the graveyard after typing for only a few minutes it came to me that yes this crowd was always the same crowd that it gathered at all accidents these were victims from accidents years ago doomed to come back and haunt the scene of new accidents as they occurred once i hit on this idea the story finished itself in a single afternoon meanwhile the carnival artifacts were gathering closer their great bones starting to thrust up through my skin i was makinglonger and longer prose poem excursions about circuses that arrived long after midnight during those years in my early twenties prowling a mirror maze on the old venice pier with my friends leigh brackett and edmond hamilton ed suddenly cried lets get out of here before ray writes a story about a dwarf who pays his way in here every night so he can stand and make himself tall in the big stretch mirror thats it i shouted and ran home to write the dwarf thatll teach me to shoot off my mouth said ed when he read the story the next week the baby on that list was of course me i remembered an old nightmare it was about being born i remembered lying in my crib three days old wailing with the knowledge of being thrust out into the world the pressure the cold the shrieking into life i remembered my mothers breast i remembered the doctor on the fourth day of my life bending over me with a scalpel to perform circumcision i remembered i remembered i changed the title from the baby to the small assassin that story has been anthologized dozens of times and i had lived the story or part of it from my first hour of life onward and only truly remembered and nailed it down in my twenties did i write stories based on every single noun in my pages and pages of lists not all but most the trap door listed way back in or didnt surface until three years ago as a story in omni another story about me and my dog took more than fifty years to surface in bless me father for i have sinned i went back in time to relive a beating i had given my dog when i was twelve and for which i had never forgiven myself i wrote the story to at last examine that cruel sad boy and put his ghost and the ghost of my muchloved dog to rest forever it was the same dog incidentally who brought company back from the graveyard in the emissary during these years henry kuttner along with leigh was my teacher he suggested authors katherine anne porter john collier eudora weltyand books the lost weekend one mans meat rain in the doorway to be read and learned from along the way he gave me a copy of winesburg ohio by sherwood anderson finishing the book i said to myself someday i would like to write a novel laid on the planet mars with somewhat similar people i immediately jotted down a list of the sorts of folks i would want to plant on mars to see what would happen i forgot winesburg ohio and my list over the years i wrote a series of stories about the red planet one day i looked up and the book was finished the list complete the martian chronicles on its way to publication so there you have it in sum a series of nouns some with rare adjectives which described a territory unknown an undiscovered country part of it death the rest life if i had not made up these prescriptions for discovery i would never have become the jackdaw archaeologist or anthropologist that i am that jackdaw who seeks bright objects odd carapaces and misshapen femurs from the boneheaps of junk inside my head where lay strewn the remnants of collisions with life as well as buck rogers tarzan john carter quasimodo and all the other creatures who made me want to live forever in the words of the old mikado song i had a little list save it was a long one which led me into dandelion wine country and helped me move the dandelion wine country up to mars and ricocheted me back into dark wine territory as mr darks night train arrived long before dawn but the first and most important pileup of nouns was the one filled with leaves whispering along the sidewalks at am and funerals wheeling by on empty railtracks following and crickets that suddenly for no reason shut up so you could hear your own heart and wish you couldnt which leads us to a final revelation one of the nouns on my list in high school was the thing or better yet the thing at the top of the stairs when i was growing up in waukegan illinois there was only one bathroom upstairs you had to climb an unlit hall halfway before you could find and turn on a light i tried to get my dad to keep the light on all night but that was expensive stuff the light stayed off around two or three in the morning i would have to go to the bathroom i would lie in bed for half an hour or so torn between the agonized need for relief and what i knew was waiting for me in the dark hall leading up to the attic at last driven by pain i would edge out of our dining room into that hall thinking run fast leap up turn on the light but whatever you do dont look up if you look up before you get the light on it will be there the thing the terrible thing waiting at the top of the stairs so run blind dont look i ran i leaped but always i couldnt help it at the last moment i blinked and stared into the awful darkness and it was always there and i screamed and fell back downstairs waking my parents my dad would groan and turn over in bed wondering where this son of his had come from my mother would get up find me in a scrambled heap in the hall and go up to turn on the light she would wait for me to climb up to the bathroom and come back down to have my tearstained face kissed and my terrified body tucked in bed the next night and the next night and the night after that the same thing happened driven mad by my hysteria dad got out the old chamber pot and shoved it under my bed but i was never cured the thing remained there forever only moving west when i was thirteen got me away from that terror what have i done recently about that nightmare well now very late in time the thing is standing up at the top ofthe stairs still waiting from to now in the spring of is a long waiting but at last gleaning my ever dependable list i have typed the noun out on paper adding the stairs and i have finally faced up to the dark climb and the arctic coldness held in place for sixty years waiting to be asked to come down through my frozen fingertips and into your bloodstream the story associated out of memory was finished this week even as i wrote this essay i leave you now at the bottom of your own stair at half after midnight with a pad a pen and a list to be made conjure the nouns alert the secret self taste the darkness your own thing stands waiting way up there in the attic shadows if you speak softly and write any old word that wants to jump out of your nerves onto the page your thing at the top of your stairs in your own private night may well come down how to keep and feed a muse it isnt easy nobody has ever done it consistently those who try hardest scare it off into the woods those who turn their backs and saunter along whistling softly between their teeth hear it treading quietly behind them lured by a carefully acquired disdain we are of course speaking of the muse the term has fallen out of the language in our time more often than not when we hear it now we smile and summon up images of some fragile greek goddess dressed in ferns harp in hand stroking the brow of your perspiring scribe the muse then is that most terrified of all the virgins she starts if she hears a sound pales if you ask her questions spins and vanishes if you disturb her dress what ails her you ask why does she flinch at the stare where does she come from and where go how can we get her to visit for longer periods of time what temperature pleasures her does she like loud voices or soft where do you buy food for her and of what quality and quantity and what hours for dining we might start off by paraphrasing oscar wildes poem substituting the word art for love art will fly if held too lightly art will die if held too tightly lightly tightly how do i know whether im holding or letting art go for art substitute if you wish creativity or the subconscious or heat or whatever your own word is for what happens when you spin like a firewheel and a story happens another way of describing the muse might be to reassess those little specks of light those airy bubbles which float across everyones vision minute flaws in the lens or the outer transparent skin of the eye unnoticed for years when you first focus your attention on them they can become unbearable nuisances ruptures in ones attention at all hours of the day they spoil what you are looking at by getting in the way people have gone to psychiatrists with the problem of specks the inevitable advice ignore them and theyll go away the fact is they dont go away they remain but we focus out beyond them on the world and the worlds everchanging objects as we should so too with our muse if we focus beyond her she regains her poise and stands out of the way it is my contention that in order to keep a muse you must first offer food how you can feed something that isnt yet there is a little hard to explain but we live surrounded by paradoxes one more shouldnt hurt us the fact is simple enough through a lifetime by ingesting food and water we build cells we grow we become larger andmore substantial that which was not is the process is undetectable it can be viewed only at intervals along the way we know it is happening but we dont know quite how or why similarly in a lifetime we stuff ourselves with sounds sights smells tastes and textures of people animals landscapes events large and small we stuff ourselves with these impressions and experiences and our reaction to them into our subconscious go not only factual data but reactive data our movement toward or away from the sensed events these are the stuffs the foods on which the muse grows this is the storehouse the file to which we must return every waking hour to check reality against memory and in sleep to check memory against memory which means ghost against ghost in order to exorcise them if necessary what is the subconscious to every other man in its creative aspect becomes for writers the muse they are two names for one thing but no matter what we call it here is the core of the individual we pretend to extol to whom we build shrines and hold lip services in our democratic society here is the stuff of originality for it is in the totality of experience reckoned with filed and forgotten that each man is truly different from all others in the world for no man sees the same events in the same order in his life one man sees death younger than another one man knows love more quickly than another two men as weknow seeing the same accident file it with different crossreferences in another part of their own alien alphabet there are not onehundred elements but two billion elements in the world all would assay differently in the spectroscopes and scales we know how fresh and original is each man even the slowest and dullest if we come at him right talk him along and give him his head and at last say what do you want or if the man is very old what did you want every man will speak his dream and when a man talks from his heart in his moment of truth he speaks poetry i have had this happen not once but a thousand times in my life my father and i were really not great friends until very late his language his thought from day to day was not remarkable but whenever i said dad tell me about tombstone when you were seventeen or the wheatfields minnesota when you were twenty dad would begin to speak about running away from home when he was sixteen heading west in the early part of this century before the last boundaries were fixedwhen there were no highways only horse paths and train tracks and the gold rush was on in nevada not in the first minute or the second or the third minute no did the thing happen to dads voice did the right cadence come or the right words but after he had talked five or six minutes and got his pipe going quite suddenly the old passion was back the old days the old tunes the weather the look of the sun the sound of the voices the boxcars traveling late at night the jails thetracks narrowing to golden dust behind as the west opened up beforeall all of it and the cadence there the moment the many moments of truth and therefore poetry the muse was suddenly there for dad the truth lay easy in his mind the subconscious lay saying its say untouched and flowing off his tongue as we must learn to do in our writing as we can learn from every man or woman or child around us when touched and moved they tell of something they loved or hated this day yesterday or some other day long past at a given moment the fuse after sputtering wetly flares and the fireworks begin oh its limping crude hard work for many with language in their way but i have heard farmers tell about their very first wheat crop on their first farm after moving from another state and if it wasnt robert frost talking it was his cousin five times removed i have heard locomotive engineers talk about america in the tones of thomas wolfe who rode our country with his style as they ride it in their steel i have heard mothers tell of the long night with their firstborn when they were afraid that they and the baby might die and i have heard my grandmother speak of her first ball when she was seventeen and they were all when their souls grew warm poets if it seems ive come the long way around perhaps i have but i wanted to show what we all have in us that it has always been there and so few of us bother to notice when people ask me where i get my ideas i laugh how strangewere so busy looking out to find ways and means we forget to look in the muse to belabor the point then is there a fantastic storehouse our complete being all that is most original lies waiting for us to summon it forth and yet we know it is not as easy as that we know how fragile is the pattern woven by our fathers or uncles or friends who can have their moment destroyed by a wrong word a slammed door or a passing firewagon so too embarrassment selfconsciousness remembered criticisms can stifle the average person so that less and less in his lifetime can he open himself out lets say that each of us has fed himself on life first and later on books and magazines the difference is that one set of events happened to us and the other was forced feeding if we are going to diet our subconscious how prepare the menu well we might start our list like this read poetry every day of your life poetry is good because it flexes muscles you dont use often enough poetry expands the senses and keeps them in prime condition it keeps you aware of your nose your eye your ear your tongue your hand and above all poetry is compacted metaphor or simile such metaphors like japanese paper flowers may expand outward intogigantic shapes ideas lie everywhere through the poetry books yet how rarely have i heard short story teachers recommending them for browsing my story the shoreline at sunset is a direct result of reading robert hillyers lovely poem about finding a mermaid near plymouth rock my story there will come soft rains is based on the poem of that title by sara teasdale and the body of the story encompasses the theme of her poem from byrons and the moon be still as bright came a chapter for my novel the martian chronicles which speaks for a dead race of martians who will no longer prowl empty seas late at night in these cases and dozens of others i have had a metaphor jump at me give me a spin and run me off to do a story what poetry any poetry that makes your hair stand up along your arms dont force yourself too hard take it easy over the years you may catch up to move even with and pass t s eliot on your way to other pastures you say you dont understand dylan thomas yes but your ganglion does and your secret wits and all your unborn children read him as you can read a horse with your eyes set free and charging over an endless green meadow on a windy day what else fits in our diet books of essays here again pick and choose amble along the centuries youll have much to pick over from the days before theessay became less popular you can never tell when you might want to know the finer points of being a pedestrian keeping bees carving headstones or rolling hoops here is where you play the dilettante and where it pays to do so you are in effect dropping stones down a well every time you hear an echo from your subconscious you know yourself a little better a small echo may start an idea a big echo may result in a story in your reading find books to improve your color sense your sense of shape and size in the world why not learn about the senses of smell and hearing your characters must sometimes use their noses and ears or they may miss half the smells and sounds of the city and all of the sounds of the wilderness still loose in the trees and on the lawns of the city why all this insistence on the senses because in order to convince your reader that he is there you must assault each of his senses in turn with color sound taste and texture if your reader feels the sun on his flesh the wind fluttering his shirt sleeves half your fight is won the most improbable tales can be made believable if your reader through his senses feels certain that he stands at the middle of events he cannot refuse then to participate the logic of events always gives way to the logic of the senses unless of course you do something really unforgivable to wrench the reader out of context such as having the american revolution won with machine guns or introducing dinosaurs and cave men into the same scene they lived millionsof years apart even with this last a welldescribed technically perfect time machine can suspend disbelief again poetry essays what about short stories novels of course read those authors who write the way you hope to write those who think the way you would like to think but also read those who do not think as you think or write as you want to write and so be stimulated in directions you might not take for many years here again dont let the snobbery of others prevent you from reading kipling say while no one else is reading him ours is a culture and a time immensely rich in trash as it is in treasures sometimes it is a little hard to tell the trash from the treasure so we hold back afraid to declare ourselves but since we are out to give ourselves texture to collect truths on many levels and in many ways to test ourselves against life and the truths of others offered us in comic strips tv shows books magazines newspapers plays and films we should not fear to be seen in strange companies i have always felt on good terms with al capps lil abner i think there is much to be learned about child psychology from peanuts a whole world of romantic adventure has existed beautifully drawn by hal foster in his prince valiant as a boy i collected and was perhaps influenced in my later books by the wonderful middleclass american daily strip out our way by j c williams i am as much charlie chaplin in modern times in as i am aldous huxleys readerfriend in i am not one thing i am many things that america has been in my time i had enough sense to keep moving learning growing and i have never reviled or turned my back on the things i grew out of i learned from tom swift and i learned from george orwell i delighted in edgar rice burroughss tarzan and still respect that old delight and will not be brainwashed from it as today i delight in c s lewiss screwtape letters i have known bertrand russell and i have known tom mix and my muse has grown out of the mulch of good bad and indifferent i am such a creature as can remember with love not only michelangelos vatican ceilings but the longgone sounds of the radio show vic and sade what is the pattern that holds all this together if i have fed my muse on equal parts of trash and treasure how have i come out at the farther end of life with what some people take to be acceptable stories i believe one thing holds it all together everything ive ever done was done with excitement because i wanted to do it because i loved doing it the greatest man in the world for me one day was lon chaney was orson welles in citizen kane was laurence olivier in richard iii the men change but one thing remains always the same the fever the ardor the delight because i wanted to do i did where i wanted to feed i fed i remember wandering stunned off a stage in my home town holding a live rabbit given to me by blackstone the magician inthe greatest performance ever i remember wandering stunned in the papiermache streets of the century of progress exhibition in chicago in in the halls of the venetian doges in italy in the quality of each event was immensely different but my ability to drink it in the same this does not mean to say that ones reaction to everything at a given time should be similar first off it cannot be at ten jules verne is accepted huxley rejected at eighteen thomas wolfe accepted and buck rogers left behind at thirty melville discovered and thomas wolfe lost the constant remains the search the finding the admiration the love the honest response to materials at hand no matter how shabby they one day seem when looked back on i sent away for a statue of an african gorilla made of the cheapest ceramics when i was ten said statue a reward for enclosing the wrapper from a package of foulds macaroni the gorilla arriving by mail got a reception as large as that given the boy david at his first unveiling the feeding of the muse then which we have spent most of our time on here seems to me to be the continual running after loves the checking of these loves against ones present and future needs the moving on from simple textures to more complex ones from naive ones to more informed ones from nonintellectual to intellectual ones nothing is ever lost if you have moved over vastterritories and dared to love silly things you will have learned even from the most primitive items collected and put aside in your life from an everroaming curiosity in all the arts from bad radio to good theatre from nursery rhyme to symphony from jungle compound to kafkas castle there is basic excellence to be winnowed out truths found kept savored and used on some later day to be a child of ones time is to do all these things do not for money turn away from all the stuff you have collected in a lifetime do not for the vanity of intellectual publications turn away from what you arethe material within you which makes you individual and therefore indispensable to others to feed your muse then you should always have been hungry about life since you were a child if not it is a little late to start better late than never of course do you feel up to it it means you must still take long walks at night around your city or town or walks in the country by day and long walks at any time through bookstores and libraries and while feeding how to keep your muse is our final problem the muse must have shape you will write a thousand words a day for ten or twenty years in order to try to give it shape to learn enough about grammar and story construction so that these become part of the subconscious without restraining or distorting the muse by living well by observing as you live by reading well andobserving as you read you have fed your most original self by training yourself in writing by repetitious exercise imitation good example you have made a clean welllighted place to keep the muse you have given her him it or whatever room to turn around in and through training you have relaxed yourself enough not to stare discourteously when inspiration comes into the room you have learned to go immediately to the typewriter and preserve the inspiration for all time by putting it on paper and you have learned the answer to the question asked earlier does creativity like loud or soft voices the loud the passionate voice seems to please most the voice upraised in conflict the comparison of opposites sit at your typewriter pick characters of various sorts let them fly together in a great clang in no time at all your secret self is roused we all like decision declaration anyone loudly for anyone loudly against this is not to say the quiet story is excluded one can be as excited and passionate about a quiet story as any there is excitement in the calm still beauty of a venus de milo the spectator here becomes as important as the thing viewed be certain of this when honest love speaks when true admiration begins when excitement rises when hate curls like smoke you need never doubt that creativity will stay with you for a lifetime the core of your creativity should be the same as the core of your story and of the main character in your story what does your character want what is his dream what shape has it andhow expressed given expression this is the dynamo of his life and your life then as creator at the exact moment when truth erupts the subconscious changes from wastebasket file to angel writing in a book of gold look at yourself then consider everything you have fed yourself over the years was it a banquet or a starvation diet who are your friends do they believe in you or do they stunt your growth with ridicule and disbelief if the latter you havent friends go find some and finally have you trained well enough so you can say what you want to say without getting hamstrung have you written enough so that you are relaxed and can allow the truth to get out without being ruined by selfconscious posturings or changed by a desire to become rich to feed well is to grow to work well and constantly is to keep what you have learned and know in prime condition experience labor these are the twin sides of the coin which when spun is neither experience nor labor but the moment of revelation the coin by optical illusion becomes a round bright whirling globe of life it is the moment when the porch swing creaks gentle and a voice speaks all hold their breath the voice rises and falls dad tells of other years a ghost rises off his lips the subconscious stirs and rubs its eyes the muse ventures in the ferns below the porch where the summer boys strewn on the lawn listen the words become poetry that no one minds because no one has thought to call it that time is there love is there story is therea wellfed man keeps and calmly gives forth his infinitesimal portion of eternity it sounds big in the summer night and it is as it always was down the ages when there was a man with something to tell and ones quiet and wise to listen a closing note the first movie star i remember is lon chaney the first drawing i made was a skeleton the first awe i remember having was of the stars on a summer night in illinois the first stories i read were sciencefiction stories in amazing the first time i ever went away from home was to go to new york and see the world of the future enclosed in the perisphere and shadowed by the trylon my first decision about a career was at eleven to be a magician and travel the world with my illusions my second decision was at twelve when i got a toy typewriter for christmas and i decided to become a writer and between the decision and the reality lay eight years of junior high school high school and selling newspapers on a street corner in los angeles while i wrote three million words my first acceptance came from rob wagners script magazine when i was twenty my second sale was to thrilling wonder stories my third was to weird tales since then i have sold stories to almost every magazine in the us plus writing the screenplay of moby dick for john huston i have written about the lon chaneyandtheskeletonpeople for weird tales i have written about illinois and its wilderness in my dandelion wine novel i have written about those stars over illinois to which a new generation is going i have made worlds of the future on paper much like that world i saw in new york at the fair as a boy and i have decided very late in the day that i never gave up my first dream i am like it or not some sort of magician after all halfbrother to houdini rabbitson of blackstone born in the cinema light of an old theatre i would like to think my middle name is douglas fairbanks was at his height when i arrived in and matured at a perfect timewhen man makes his last and greatest step out away from the sea that birthed him the cave that sheltered him the land that held him and the air that summoned him so that he could never rest in sum i am a piebald offspring of our massmoved massentertained aloneinanewyearscrowd age it is a great age to live in and if need be die in and for any magician worth his salt would tell you the same drunk and in charge of a bicycle in i wrote an article for the nation defending my work as a sciencefiction writer even though that label only applied to perhaps one third of my output each year a few weeks later in late may a letter arrived from italy on the back of the envelope in a spidery hand i read these words b berenson i tatti settignano firenze italia i turned to my wife and said my god this cant be from the berenson can it the great art historian open it said my wife i did and read dear mr bradbury in years of life this is the first fan letter i have written it is to tell you that i have just read your article in the nation day after tomorrow it is the first time i have encountered the statement by an artist in any field that to work creatively he must put flesh into it and enjoy it as a lark or as a fascinating adventure how different from the workers in the heavy industry that professional writing has become if you ever touch florence come to see me sincerely yours b berenson thus at the age of thirtythree i had my way of seeing writing and living approved of by a man who became a second father to me i needed that approval we all need someone higher wiser older to tell us were not crazy after all that what were doing is all right all right hell fine but it is easy to doubt yourself because you look around at a community of notions held by other writers other intellectuals and they make you blush with guilt writing is supposed to be difficult agonizing a dreadful exercise a terrible occupation but you see my stories have led me through my life they shout i follow they run up and bite me on the legi respond by writing down everything that goes on during the bite when i finish the idea lets go and runs off that is the kind of life ive had drunk and in charge of a bicycle as an irish police report once put it drunk with life that is and not knowing where off to next but youre on your way before dawn and the trip exactly one half terror exactly one half exhilaration when i was three my mother snuck me in and out of movies two or three times a week my first film was lon chaney in the hunchback of notre dame i suffered permanent curvature of the spine and of my imagination that day a long time ago in from that hour on i knew a kindred and wonderfully grotesque compatriot of the dark when i saw one i ran off to see all the chaney films again and again to be deliciously frightened the phantom of the opera stood astride my life with his scarlet cape and when it wasnt the phantom it was the terrible hand that gestured from behind the bookcase in the cat and the canary bidding me to come find more darkness hid in books i was in love then with monsters and skeletons and circuses and carnivals and dinosaurs and at last the red planet mars from these primitive bricks i have built a life and a career by my staying in love with all of these amazing things all of the good things in my existence have come about in other words i was not embarrassed at circuses some people are circuses are loud vulgar and smell in the sun by the time many people are fourteen or fifteen they have been divested of their loves their ancient and intuitive tastes one by one until when they reach maturity there is no fun left no zest no gusto no flavor others have criticized and they have criticized themselves into embarrassment when the circus pulls in at five of a dark cold summer morn and the calliope sounds they do not rise and run they turn in their sleep and life passes by i did rise and run i learned that i was right and everyone else wrong when i was nine buck rogers arrived on scene that year and it was instant love i collected the daily strips and was madness maddened by them friends criticized friends made fun i tore up the buck rogers strips for a month i walked through my fourthgrade classes stunned and empty one day i burst into tears wondering what devastation had happened to me the answer was buck rogers he was gone and life simply wasnt worth living the next thought was those are not my friends the ones who got me to tear the strips apart and so tear my own life down the middle they are my enemies i went back to collecting buck rogers my life has been happy ever since for that was the beginning of my writing science fiction since then i have never listened to anyone who criticized my taste in space travel sideshows or gorillas when this occurs i pack up my dinosaurs and leave the room for you see it is all mulch if i hadnt stuffed my eyes and stuffed my head with all of the above for a lifetime when it came round to wordassociating myself into story ideas i would have brought up a ton of ciphers and a halfton of zeros the veldt is a prime example of what goes on in a headful of images myths toys back some thirty years ago i sat down to my typewriter one day and wrote these words the playroom playroom where the past no the present hardly the future yes well then what would a playroom in some future year be like i began typing wordassociating around the roomsuch a playroom must have television monitors lining each wall and the ceiling walking into such an environment a child could shout river nile sphinx pyramids and they would appear surrounding him in full color full sound and why not glorious warm scents and smells and odors pick one for the nose all this came to me in a few seconds of fast typing i knew the room now i must put characters in the room i typed out a character named george brought him into a futuretime kitchen where his wife turned and said george i wish youd look at the playroom i think its broken george and his wife go down the hall i follow them typing madly not knowing what will happen next they open the door of the playroom and step in africa hot sun vultures dead meat lions two hours later the lions leaped out of the walls of the playroom and devoured george and his wife while their tvdominated children sat by and sipped tea end of wordassociation end of story the whole thing complete and almost ready to send out an explosion of idea in something like minutes the lions in that room where did they come from from the lions i found in the books in the town library when i was ten from the lions i saw in the real circuses when i was five from the lion that prowled in lon chaneys film he who gets slapped in in you say with immense doubt yes i didnt see the chaney film again until a year ago as soon as it flashed on the screen i knew that that was where my lions in the veldt came from they had been hiding out waiting given shelter by my intuitive self all these years for i am that special freak the man with the child inside who remembers all i remember the day and the hour i was born i remember being circumcised on the fourth day after my birth i remember suckling at my mothers breast years later i asked my mother about the circumcision i had information that couldnt have been told to me there would be no reason to tell a child especially in those stillvictorian times was i circumcised somewhere away from the lyingin hospital i was my father took me to the doctors office i remember the doctor i remember the scalpel i wrote the story the small assassin twentysix years later it tells of a baby born with all its senses operative filled with terror at being thrust out into a cold world and taking revenge on its parents by crawling secretly about at night and at last destroying them when did it all really begin the writing that is everything came together in the summer and fall and early winter of by that time i was stuffed full of buck rogers the novels of edgar rice burroughs and the nighttime radio serial chandu the magician chandu said magic and the psychic summons and thefar east and strange places which made me sit down every night and from memory write out the scripts of each show but the whole conglomeration of magic and myths and falling downstairs with brontosaurs only to arise with la of opar was shaken into a pattern by one man mr electrico he arrived with a seedy twobit carnival the dill brothers combined shows during labor day weekend of when i was twelve every night for three nights mr electrico sat in his electric chair being fired with ten billion volts of pure blue sizzling power reaching out into the audience his eyes flaming his white hair standing on end sparks leaping between his smiling teeth he brushed an excalibur sword over the heads of the children knighting them with fire when he came to me he tapped me on both shoulders and then the tip of my nose the lightning jumped into me mr electrico cried live forever i decided that was the greatest idea i had ever heard i went to see mr electrico the next day with the excuse that a nickel magic trick i had purchased from him wasnt in working order he fixed it and toured me around the tents shouting at each clean up your language before we entered to meet the dwarfs acrobats fat women and illustrated men waiting there we walked down to sit by lake michigan where mr electrico spoke his small philosophies and i talked my big ones why he put up with me ill never know but he listened or it seemed he listened maybe because he was far from home maybe because hehad a son somewhere in the world or had no son at all and wanted one anyway he was a defrocked presbyterian minister he said and lived down in cairo illinois and i could write him there any time i wished finally he gave me some special news weve met before he said you were my best friend in france in and you died in my arms in the battle of the ardennes forest that year and here you are born again in a new body with a new name welcome back i staggered away from that encounter with mr electrico wonderfully uplifted by two gifts the gift of having lived once before and of being told about it and the gift of trying somehow to live forever a few weeks later i started writing my first short stories about the planet mars from that time to this i have never stopped god bless mr electrico the catalyst wherever he is if i consider every aspect of all the above my beginnings almost inevitably had to be in the attic from the time i was twelve until i was twentytwo orthree i wrote stories long after midnightunconventional stories of ghosts and haunts and things in jars that i had seen in sour armpit carnivals of friends lost to the tides in lakes and of consorts of three in the morning those souls who had to fly in the dark in order not to be shot in the sun it took me many years to write myself down out of the attic where i had to make do with my own eventual mortality a teenagers preoccupation make it to the living room then out to the lawn and sunlight where the dandelions had come up ready for wine getting out on the front lawn with my fourth of july relatives gave me not only my green town illinois stories it also shoved me off toward mars following edgar rice burroughss and john carters advice taking my childhood luggage my uncles aunts my mom dad and brother with me when i arrived on mars i found them in fact waiting for me or martians who looked like them pretending me into a grave the green town stories that found their way into an accidental novel titled dandelion wine and the red planet stories that blundered into another accidental novel called the martian chronicles were written alternately during the same years that i ran to the rainbarrel outside my grandparents house to dip out all the memories the myths the wordassociations of other years along the way i also recreated my relatives as vampires who inhabited a town similar to the one in dandelion wine dark first cousin to the town on mars where the third expedition expired so i had my life three ways as town explorer space traveler and wanderer with count draculas american cousins i realize i havent talked half enough as yet about one variety of creature you will find stalking this collection rising here innightmares to founder there in loneliness and despair dinosaurs from the time i was seventeen until i was thirtytwo i wrote some halfdozen dinosaur stories one night when my wife and i were walking along the beach in venice california where we lived in a thirtydollaramonth newly weds apartment we came upon the bones of the venice pier and the struts tracks and ties of the ancient rollercoaster collapsed on the sand and being eaten by the sea whats that dinosaur doing lying here on the beach i said my wife very wisely had no answer the answer came the next night when summoned from sleep by a voice calling i rose up listened and heard the lonely voice of the santa monica bay fog horn blowing over and over and over again of course i thought the dinosaur heard that lighthouse fog horn blowing thought it was another dinosaur arisen from the deep past came swimming in for a loving confrontation discovered it was only a fog horn and died of a broken heart there on the shore i leaped from bed wrote the story and sent it to the saturday evening post that week where it appeared soon after under the title the beast from fathoms that story titled the fog horn became a film two years later the story was read by john huston in who promptly called to ask if i would like to write the screenplay for his film moby dick i accepted and moved from one beast to the next because of moby dick i reexamined the life of melville and jules verne compared their mad captains in an essay written to reintroduce a new translation of leagues beneath the sea which read by the new york worlds fair people put me in charge of conceptualizing the entire upper floor of the united states pavilion because of the pavilion the disney organization hired me to help plan the dreams that went into spaceship earth part of epcot center a permanent worlds fair now building to open in in that one building i have crammed a history of mankind coming and going back and forth in time then plunging into our wild future in space including dinosaurs all of my activities all of my growing all of my new jobs and new loves caused and created by that original primitive love of the beasts i saw when i was five and dearly cherished when i was twenty and twentynine and thirty look around among my stories and you will probably find only one or two that actually happened to me i have resisted most of my life being given assignments to go somewhere and sponge up the local color the natives the look and feel of the land i learned long ago that i am not seeing directly that my subconscious is doing most of the sponging and it will be years before any usable impressions surface as a young man i lived in a tenement in the chicano section of los angeles most of my latino stories were written years after ihad moved from the tenement with one terrifying onthespot exception in late with world war ii freshly over a friend of mine asked me to accompany him to mexico city in an old beatup ford v i reminded him of the vow of poverty that circumstances had forced on me he rebutted by calling me a coward wondering why i didnt rev up my courage and send out three or four stories which i had hidden away reason for the hiding the stories had been rejected once or twice by various magazines pummeled by my friend i dusted the stories off and mailed them out under the pseudonym william elliott why the pseudonym because i feared that some manhattan editors might have seen the name bradbury on the covers of weird tales and would be prejudiced against this pulp writer i mailed off three short stories to three different magazines in the second week of august on august sold one story to charm on august i sold a story to mademoiselle and on august my twentyfifth birthday i sold a story to colliers the total monies amounted to which would be like having arrive in the mail today i was rich or so close to it i was dumbfounded it was a turning point in my life of course and i hastened to write to the editors of those three magazines confessing my true name all three stories were listed in the best american short stories of by martha foley and one of them was published in herschel brickells o henry memorial award prize stories the following year that money took me to mexico to guanajuato and the mummies in the catacombs the experience so wounded and terrified me i could hardly wait to flee mexico i had nightmares about dying and having to remain in the halls of the dead with those propped and wired bodies in order to purge my terror instantly i wrote the next in line one of the few times that an experience yielded results almost on the spot enough of mexico what about ireland there is every kind of irish story among my work because after living in dublin for six months i saw that most of the irish i met had a variety of ways of making do with that dreadful beast reality you can run into it headon which is a dire business or you can skirt around it give it a poke dance for it make up a song write you a tale prolong the gab fill up the flask each partakes of irish cliche but each in the foul weather and the foundering politics is true i got to know every beggar in the streets of dublin the ones near oconnells bridge with maniac pianolas grinding more coffee than tunes and the ones who loaned out a single baby among a whole tribe of rainsoaked mendicants so you saw the babe one hour at the top of grafton street and the next by the royal hibernian hotel and at midnight down by the river but i never thought i would write of them then the need to howl and give an angry weep made me rear up one night and write mcgillahees brat out of terrible suspicions and the begging of a rainwalking ghost that had to be laid i visited some of the oldburntout estates of the great irish landowners and heard tales of one burning that had not quite come off and so wrote the terrible conflagration up at the place the anthem sprinters another irish encounter wrote itself down years later when one rainy night i recalled the countless times my wife and i had sprinted out of dublin cinemas dashing for the exit knocking children and old folks to left and right in order to make it to the exit before the national anthem was played but how did i begin starting in mr electricos year i wrote a thousand words a day for ten years i wrote at least one short story a week somehow guessing that a day would finally come when i truly got out of the way and let it happen the day came in when i wrote the lake ten years of doing everything wrong suddenly became the right idea the right scene the right characters the right day the right creative time i wrote the story sitting outside with my typewriter on the lawn at the end of an hour the story was finished the hair on the back of my neck was standing up and i was in tears i knew i had written the first really good story of my life all during my early twenties i had the following schedule on monday morning i wrote the first draft of a new story on tuesday i did a second draft on wednesday a third on thursday a fourth on friday a fifth and on saturday at noon i mailed out the sixth and final draft to new york sunday i thought about all the wild ideas scrambling for my attention waitingunder the attic lid confident at last that because of the lake i would soon let them out if this all sounds mechanical it wasnt my ideas drove me to it you see the more i did the more i wanted to do you grow ravenous you run fevers you know exhilarations you cant sleep at night because your beastcreature ideas want out and turn you in your bed it is a grand way to live there was another reason to write so much i was being paid twenty to forty dollars a story by the pulp magazines high on the hog was hardly my way of life i had to sell at least one story or better two each month in order to survive my hotdog hamburger trolleycarfare life in i sold some forty stories but my total income for the year was only it suddenly strikes me that there is much to comment on in my collected stories the black ferris is of interest here because early one autumn twentythree years ago it changed itself from a short short story into a screenplay and then into a novel something wicked this way comes the day it rained forever was another wordassociation i handed myself one afternoon thinking about hot suns deserts and harps that could change the weather the leavetaking is the true story of my greatgrandmother who nailed shingles on rooftops well into her seventies then took herself up to bed when i was three and said farewell to everyone and went to sleep calling mexico sprang into being because i visited a friend of mine one afternoon in the summer of and as i entered the room he handed me the telephone and said listen i listened and heard the sounds of mexico city coming from two thousand miles away i went home and wrote about my telephone experience to a friend in paris halfway through my letter the letter turned into the story which went off in the mail that day the picasso summer was the result of my walking on the shoreline with friends and my wife one late afternoon i picked up a popsicle stick drew pictures in the sand and said wouldnt it be awful if youd wanted to own a picasso all your life and suddenly bumped into him here drawing mythological beasts in the sand your very own picasso etching right in front of you i finished the story about picasso on the beach at two in the morning hemingway the parrot who met papa one night in i drove across los angeles with friends to invade the printing plant where life was publishing their issue with hemingways old man and the sea in it we grabbed copies hot off the press sat in the nearest bar and talked about papa finca vigia cuba and somehow a parrot who had lived in that bar and talked to hemingway every night i went home made a notation about the parrot and put it away for sixteen years prowling my file folders in i came upon just the note for a title the parrot who met papa my god i thought papas been dead eight years if that parrot is still around remembers hemingway can speak with his voice hes worth millions and what if someone kidnapped the parrot held it for ransom the haunting of the new happened because john godley lord kilbracken wrote me from ireland describing his visit to a house that had burned and been replaced stone by stone brick by brick in imitation of the original within half a day of reading kilbrackens postcard i had firstdrafted the tale enough now there you have it there are one hundred stories from almost forty years of my life contained in my collected stories they contain half the damning truths i suspected at midnight and half of the saving truths i refound next noon if anything is taught here it is simply the charting of the life of someone who started out to somewhereand went i have not so much thought my way through life as done things and found what it was and who i was after the doing each tale was a way of finding selves each self found each day slightly different from the one found twentyfour hours earlier it all started that autumn day in when mr electrico gave me the two gifts i dont know if i believe in previous lives im not sure i can live forever but that young boy believed in both and i have let him have his head he has written my stories and books for me he runs the ouija board and says aye or nay to submerged truths or halftruths he is the skin through which by osmosis all the stuffs pass and put themselves on paper i havetrusted his passions his fears and his joys he has as a result rarely failed me when it is a long damp november in my soul and i think too much and perceive too little i know it is high time to get back to that boy with the tennis shoes the high fevers the multitudinous joys and the terrible nightmares im not sure where he leaves off and i start but im proud of the tandem team what else can i do but wish him well and at the same time acknowledge and wish two other people well in the same month that i married my wife marguerite i became affiliated with my literary representative and closest friend don congdon maggie typed and criticized my stories don criticized and sold the results with the two of them as teammates these past thirtythree years how could i have failed we are the connemara lightfoots the queens own evaders and were still sprinting for that exit investing dimes fahrenheit i didnt know it but i was literally writing a dime novel in the spring of it cost me nine dollars and eighty cents in dimes to write and finish the first draft of the fire man which later became fahrenheit in all the years from to that time i had done most of my typing in the family garages either in venice california where we lived because we were poor not because it was the in place to be or behind the tract house where my wife marguerite and i raised our family i was driven out of my garage by my loving children who insisted on coming around to the rear window and singing and tapping on the panes father had to choose between finishing a story or playing with the girls i chose to play of course which endangered the family income an office had to be found we couldnt afford one finally i located just the place the typing room in the basement of the library at the university of california at los angeles there in neat rows were a score or more of old remington or underwood typewriters which rented out at a dime a half hour you thrust your dime in the clock ticked madly and you typed wildly to finish before the half hour ran out thus i was twice driven by children to leave home and by a typewriter timingdevice to be a maniac at the keys time was indeed money i finished the first draft in roughly nine days at words it was half the novel it eventually would become between investing dimes and going insane when the typewriter jammed for there went your precious time and whipping pages in and out of the device i wandered upstairs there i strolled lost in love down the corridors and through the stacks touching books pulling volumes out turning pages thrusting volumes back drowning in all the good stuffs that are the essence of libraries what a place dont you agree to write a novel about burning books in the future so much for pasts what about fahrenheit in this day and age have i changed my mind about much that it said to me when i was a younger writer only if by change you mean has my love of libraries widened and deepened to which the answer is a yes that ricochets off the stacks and dusts talcum off the librarians cheek since writing this book i have spun more stories novels essays and poems about writers than any other writer in history that i can think of i have written poems about melville melville and emily dickinson emily dickinson and charles dickens hawthorne poe edgar rice burroughs and along the way i compared jules verne and his mad captain to melville and his equally obsessed mariner i have scribbled poems about librarians taken night trains with my favorite authors across the continental wilderness staying up all night gabbling and drinking drinking and chatting i warned melville in one poem to stay away from land it never was his stuff and turned bernard shaw into a robot so as to conveniently stow him aboard a rocket and wake him on the long journey to alpha centauri to hear his prefaces piped off his tongue and into my delighted ear i have written a time machine story in which i hum back to sit at the deathbeds of wilde melville and poe to tell of my love and warm their bones in their last hours but enough as you can see i am madnessmaddened when it comes to books writers and the great granary silos where their wits are stored recently with the studio theatre playhouse in los angeles at hand i called all my characters from f out of the shadows whats new i said to montag clarisse faber beatty since last we met in i asked they answered they wrote new scenes revealed odd parts of their as yet undiscovered souls and dreams the result was a twoact drama staged with good results and in the main fine reviews beatty came farthest out of the wings in answer to my question how did it start why did you make the decision to become fire chief a burner of books beattys surprising answer came in a scene where he takes our hero guy montag home to his apartment entering montag is stunned to discover the thousands upon thousands of books lining the walls of the fire chiefs hidden library montag turns and cries out to his superior but youre the chief burner you cant have books on your premises to which the chief with a dry light smile replies its not owning books thats a crime montag its reading them yes thats right i own books but dont read them montag in shock awaits beattys explanation dont you see the beauty montag i never read them not one book not one chapter not one page not one paragraph i do play with ironies dont i to have thousands of books and never crack one to turn your back on the lot and say no its like having a house full of beautiful women and smiling not touching one so you see im not a criminal at all if you ever catch me reading one yes then turn me in but this place is as pure as a twelveyearold virgin girls creamwhite summer night bedroom these books die on the shelves why because i say so i do not give them sustenance no hope with hand or eye or tongue they are no better than dust montag protests i dont see how you cant be tempted cries the fire chief oh that was long ago the apple is eaten and gone the snake has returned to its tree the garden has grown to weed and rust once montag hesitates then continues once you must have loved books very much touche the fire chief responds below the belt on the chin through the heart ripping the gut oh look at me montag the man who loved books no the boy who was wild for them insane for them who climbed the stacks like a chimpanzee gone mad for them i ate them like salad books were my sandwich for lunch my tiffin and dinner and midnight munch i tore out the pages ate them with salt doused them with relish gnawed on the bindings turned the chapters with my tongue books by the dozen the score and the billion i carried so many home i was hunchbacked for years philosophy art history politics social science the poem the essay the grandiose play you name em i ate em and then and then the fire chiefs voice fades montag prompts and then why life happened to me the fire chief shuts his eyes to remember life the usual the same the love that wasnt quite right the dream that went sour the sex that fell apart the deaths that came swiftly to friends not deserving the murder of someone or another the insanity of someone close the slow death of a mother the abrupt suicide of a fathera stampede of elephants an onslaught of disease and nowhere nowhere the right book for the right time to stuff in the crumbling wall of the breaking dam to hold back the deluge give or take a metaphor lose or find a simile and by the far edge of thirty and the near rim of thirtyone i picked myself up every bone broken every centimeter of flesh abraded bruised or scarred i looked in the mirror and found an old man lost behind the frightened face of a young man saw a hatred there for everything and anything you name it id damn it and opened the pages of my fine library books and found what what what montag guesses the pages were empty bulls eye blank oh the words were there allright but they ran over my eyes like hot oil signifying nothing offering no help no solace no peace no harbor no true love no bed no light montag thinks back thirty years ago the final library burnings on target beatty nods and having no job and being a failed romantic or whatever in hell i put in for fireman first class first up the steps first into the library first in the burning furnace heart of his everblazing countrymen douse me with kerosene hand me my torch end of lecture there you go montag out the door montag leaves with more curiosity than ever about books well on his way to becoming an outcast soon to be pursued and almost destroyed by the mechanical hound my robot clone of a conan doyles great baskerville beast in my play old man faber the teachernotquiteinresidence speaking to montag through the long night via the seashell tampin ear radio is victimized by the fire chief how beatty suspects montag is being instructed by such a secret device knocks it out of his ear and shouts at the farremoved teacher were coming to get you were at the door were up the stairs gotcha which so terrifies faber his heart destroys him all good stuff tempting this late in time ive had to fight not to stuff it into the novel finally many readers have written protesting clarisses disappearance wondering what happened to her francois truffaut felt the same curiosity and in his film version of my novel rescued clarisse from oblivion and located her with the book people wandering in the forest reciting their litany of books to themselves i felt the same need to save her for after all she verging on silly starstruck chatter was in many ways responsible for montags beginning to wonder about books and what was in them in my play therefore clarisse emerges to welcome montag and give a somewhat happier ending to what was in essence pretty grim stuff the novel however remains true to its former self i dont believe in tampering with any young writers material especially when that young writer was once myself montag beatty mildred faber clarisse all stand move enter and exit as they did thirtytwo years ago when i first wrote them down at a dime a half hour in the basement of the ucla library i have changed not one thought or word a last discovery i write all of my novels and stories as you have seen in a great surge of delightful passion only recently glancing at the novel i realized that montag is named after a paper manufacturing company and faber of course is a maker of pencils what a sly thing my subconscious was to name them thus and not tell me just this side of byzantium dandelion wine dandelion wine like most of my books and stories was a surprise i began to learn the nature of such surprises thank god when i was fairly young as a writer before that like every beginner i thought you could beat pummel and thrash an idea into existence under such treatment of course any decent idea folds up its paws turns on its back fixes its eyes on eternity and dies it was with great relief then that in my early twenties i floundered into a wordassociation process in which i simply got out of bed each morning walked to my desk and put down any word or series of words that happened along in my head i would then take arms against the word or for it and bring on an assortment of characters to weigh the word and show me its meaning in my own life an hour or two hours later to my amazement a new story would be finished and done the surprise was total and lovely i soon found that i would have to work this way for the rest of my life first i rummaged my mind for words that could describe my personal nightmares fears of night and time from my childhood and shaped stories from these then i took a long look at the green apple trees and the oldhouse i was born in and the house next door where lived my grandparents and all the lawns of the summers i grew up in and i began to try words for all that what you have in dandelion wine then is a gathering of dandelions from all those years the wine metaphor which appears again and again in these pages is wonderfully apt i was gathering images all of my life storing them away and forgetting them somehow i had to send myself back with words as catalysts to open the memories out and see what they had to offer so from the age of twentyfour to thirtysix hardly a day passed when i didnt stroll myself across a recollection of my grandparents northern illinois grass hoping to come across some old halfburnt firecracker a rusted toy or a fragment of letter written to myself in some young year hoping to contact the older person i became to remind him of his past his life his people his joys and his drenching sorrows it became a game that i took to with immense gusto to see how much i could remember about dandelions themselves or picking wild grapes with my father and brother rediscovering the mosquitobreeding ground rain barrel by the side bay window or searching out the smell of the goldfuzzed bees that hung around our back porch grape arbor bees do have a smell you know and if they dont they should for their feet are dusted with spices from a million flowers and then i wanted to call back what the ravine was like especially on those nights when walking home late across townafter seeing lon chaneys delicious fright the phantom of the opera my brother skip would run ahead and hide under the ravinecreek bridge like the lonely one and leap out and grab me shrieking so i ran fell and ran again gibbering all the way home that was great stuff along the way i came upon and collided through wordassociation with old and true friendships i borrowed my friend john huff from my childhood in arizona and shipped him east to green town so that i could say goodbye to him properly along the way i sat me down to breakfasts lunches and dinners with the long dead and much loved for i was a boy who did indeed love his parents and grandparents and his brother even when that brother ditched him along the way i found myself in the basement working the winepress for my father or on the front porch independence night helping my uncle bion load and fire his homemade brass cannon thus i fell into surprise no one told me to surprise myself i might add i came on the old and best ways of writing through ignorance and experiment and was startled when truths leaped out of bushes like quail before gunshot i blundered into creativity as blindly as any child learning to walk and see i learned to let my senses and my past tell me all that was somehow true so i turned myself into a boy running to bring a dipper of clear rainwater out of that barrel by the side of the house and of course the more water you dip out the more flows in the flowhas never ceased once i learned to keep going back and back again to those times i had plenty of memories and sense impressions to play with not work with no play with dandelion wine is nothing if it is not the boyhidintheman playing in the fields of the lord on the green grass of other augusts in the midst of starting to grow up grow old and sense darkness waiting under the trees to seed the blood i was amused and somewhat astonished at a critic a few years back who wrote an article analyzing dandelion wine plus the more realistic works of sinclair lewis wondering how i could have been born and raised in waukegan which i renamed green town for my novel and not noticed how ugly the harbor was and how depressing the coal docks and railyards down below the town but of course i had noticed them and genetic enchanter that i was was fascinated by their beauty trains and boxcars and the smell of coal and fire are not ugly to children ugliness is a concept that we happen on later and become selfconscious about counting boxcars is a prime activity of boys their elders fret and fume and jeer at the train that holds them up but boys happily count and cry the names of the cars as they pass from far places and again that supposedly ugly railyard was where carnivals and circuses arrived with elephants who washed the brick pavements with mighty steaming acid waters at five in the dark morning as for the coal from the docks i went down in my basementevery autumn to await the arrival of the truck and its metal chute which clanged down and released a ton of beauteous meteors that fell out of far space into my cellar and threatened to bury me beneath dark treasures in other words if your boy is a poet horse manure can only mean flowers to him which is of course what horse manure has always been about perhaps a new poem of mine will explain more than this introduction about the germination of all the summers of my life into one book heres the start of the poem byzantium i come not from but from another time and place whose race was simple tried and true as boy i dropped me forth in illinois a name with neither love nor grace was waukegan there i came from and not good friends byzantium the poem continues describing my lifelong relationship to my birthplace and yet in looking back i see from topmost part of farthest tree a land as bright beloved and blue as any yeats found to be true waukegan visited by me often since is neither homelier nor more beautiful than any other small midwestern town much of it is green the trees do touch in the middle of streets the street in front of my old home is still paved with red bricks in what way then was the town special why i was born there it was my life i had to write of it as i saw fit so we grew up with mythic dead to spoon upon midwestern bread and spread old gods bright marmalade to slake in peanutbutter shade pretending there beneath our sky that it was aphrodites thigh while by the porchrail calm and bold his words pure wisdom stare pure gold my grandfather a myth indeed did all of plato supersede while grandmama in rockingchair sewed up the raveled sleeve of care crocheted cool snowflakes rare and bright to winter us on summer night and uncles gathered with their smokes emitted wisdoms masked as jokes and aunts as wise as delphic maids dispensed prophetic lemonades to boys knelt there as acolytes to grecian porch on summer nights then went to bed there to repent the evils of the innocent the gnatsins sizzling in their ears said through the nights and through the years not illinois nor waukegan but blither sky and blither sun though mediocre all our fates and mayor not as bright as yeats yet still we knew ourselves the sum byzantium byzantium waukegangreen townbyzantium green town did exist then yes and again yes was there a real boy named john huff there was and that was truly his name but he didnt go away from me i went away from him but happy ending he is still alive fortytwo years later and remembers our love was there a lonely one there was and that was his name and he moved around atnight in my home town when i was six years old and he frightened everyone and was never captured most importantly did the big house itself with grandpa and grandma and the boarders and uncles and aunts in it exist i have already answered that is the ravine real and deep and dark at night it was it is i took my daughters there a few years back fearful that the ravine might have gone shallow with time i am relieved and happy to report that the ravine is deeper darker and more mysterious than ever i would not even now go home through there after seeing the phantom of the opera so there you have it waukegan was green town was byzantium with all the happiness that that means with all the sadness that these names imply the people there were gods and midgets and knew themselves mortal and so the midgets walked tall so as not to embarrass the gods and the gods crouched so as to make the small ones feel at home and after all isnt that what life is all about the ability to go around back and come up inside other peoples heads to look out at the damned fool miracle and say oh so thats how you see it well now i must remember that here is my celebration then of death as well as life dark as well as light old as well as young smart and dumb combined sheer joy as well as complete terror written by a boy who once hung upside down in trees dressed in his bat costume with candy fangs in his mouth who finally fell out of the trees when he wastwelve and went and found a toydial typewriter and wrote his first novel a final memory fire balloons you rarely see them these days though in some countries i hear they are still made and filled with warm breath from a small straw fire hung beneath but in illinois we still had them and one of the last memories i have of my grandfather is the last hour of a fourth of july night fortyeight years ago when grandpa and i walked out on the lawn and lit a small fire and filled the pearshaped redwhiteandbluestriped paper balloon with hot air and held the flickering brightangel presence in our hands a final moment in front of a porch lined with uncles and aunts and cousins and mothers and fathers and then very softly let the thing that was life and light and mystery go out of our fingers up on the summer air and away over the beginningtosleep houses among the stars as fragile as wondrous as vulnerable as lovely as life itself i see my grandfather there looking up at that strange drifting light thinking his own still thoughts i see me my eyes filled with tears because it was all over the night was done i knew there would never be another night like this no one said anything we all just looked up at the sky and we breathed out and in and we all thought the same things butnobody said someone finally had to say though didnt they and that one is me the wine still waits in the cellars below my beloved family still sits on the porch in the dark the fire balloon still drifts and burns in the night sky of an as yet unburied summer why and how because i say it is so the long road to mars how did i get from waukegan illinois to red planet mars perhaps two men could tell you their names appear on the dedication page of the fortieth anniversary edition of the martian chronicles for it was my friend norman corwin who first listened to me tell my martian stories and my future editor walter i bradbury no relation who saw what i was up to even though i was unaware of what i was doing and persuaded me to finish a novel i didnt know i had written how i traveled to that spring night in when walter bradbury surprised me with myself is an unguided pathway of what ifs what if i had never heard and fallen in love with norman corwins radio dramas when i was nineteen what if i had never sent my first book of stories to corwin who then became a lifetime friend and what if i hadnt taken his advice to go to new york city in june then very simply the martian chronicles might never have existed but norman argued again and again that i should be underfoot in the publishing houses of manhattan and that he and his wife katie would be there to lead and protect me in and around the big town because of his persuasion i traveled across the country four long days and nights on a greyhound bus fermenting into a large ball of fungus with a pregnant wife left behind in los angeles with in the bank and the ymca a week waiting for me on fortysecond street the corwins good to their promise toured and introduced me to a clutch of editors who asked did you bring a novel i confessed that i was a sprinter and had brought only fifty short stories and an ancient battered portable typewriter were they in need of fifty superimaginative tales mostly brilliant they were not which brings me to my final most important what if what if i had never dined with the last editor i met walter i bradbury from doubleday who asked the old depressing questionis there a novel in you somewhereonly to hear me describe the fourminute mile i paced each day stepping on a land mine idea at breakfast picking up the pieces and fusing them to cool by lunch walter bradbury shook his head finished his desert mused and then said i think youve already written a novel what i said and when what about all those martian stories youve published in thepast four years brad replied isnt there a common thread buried there couldnt you sew them together make some sort of tapestry halfcousin to a novel my god i said yes my god i said back in i was so impressed by sherwood andersons winesburg ohio that i told myself i must try to write something half as good and set it on mars i sketched out an outline of characters and events on the red planet but soon lost it in my files looks as if weve found it said brad have we we have said brad go back to the ymca and type me an outline of those two or three dozen martian stories bring it in tomorrow if i like what i see ill give you a contract and an advance don congdon my best friend and literary agent seated across the table nodded ill be at your office by noon i said to brad to celebrate i ordered a second desert brad and don each had a beer it was a typical hot june night in new york air conditioning was still a luxury of some future year i typed until am perspiring in my underwear as i weighted and balanced my martians in their strange cities in the last hours before arrivals and departures of my astronauts at noon exhausted but elated i delivered the outline to walter i bradbury youve done it he said youll get a contract and a check tomorrow i must have made a lot of noise when i calmed down i asked him about my other stories now that were publishing your first novel brad said we can take a chance on your stories even though such collections rarely sell can you think of a title that would sort of put a skin around two dozen different tales skin i said why not the illustrated man my story about a carnival barker whose tattoos sweat themselves alive one by one and act out their futures on his chest and legs and arms looks as if ill have to make out two advance checks said walter i bradbury i left new york three days later with two contracts and two checks totaling enough money to pay our amonth rent for a year finance our baby and help with the down payment on a small tract house inland from venice california by the time our first daughter was born in the autumn of i had fitted and fused all of my lost but now found martian objects it turned out to be not a book of eccentric characters as in winesburg ohio but a series of strange ideas notions fancies and dreams that i had begun to sleep on and waken to when i was twelve the martian chronicles was published the next year in the late spring of traveling east that spring i did not know what i had done between trains in chicago i walked to the art institute to have lunch with a friend i saw a crowd at the top of the institute stairs and thought they were tourists but as i started walking up the crowd came down and surrounded me they were not art lovers but readers who had gotten early copies of the martian chronicles and had come to tell me just exactly what i had alltoounkowningly done that noon encounter changed my life forever nothing was the same after that the list of what ifs could go on forever what if i hadnt met maggie who took a vow of poverty to marry me what if don congdon had never written to become and remain my agent for fortythree years starting in the same week that i married marguerite and what if soon after the publication of the chronicles i had missed being in a small santa monica bookshop when christopher isherwood stopped by quickly i signed and handed over a copy of my novel with an expression of regret and alarm isherwood accepted and fled three days later he telephoned do you know what youve done he said what i said youve written a fine book he said ive just become the lead book reviewer for tomorrow magazine and yours will be the first book that i review a few months later isherwood called to say that the celebrated english philosopher gerald heard wished to come meet me he cant i cried why not because i protested we have no furniture in our new house gerald heard will sit on your floor said isherwood heard arrived and perched on our one and only chair isherwood maggie and i sat on the floor some weeks later heard and aldous huxley invited me to tea where both leaned forward one echoing the other and asked do you know what you are what a poet they said my god i said am i so we end as we began with one friend seeing me off and another taking me in from a journey what if norman corwin had not sent me or if walter i bradbury had not received me mars might never have gained an atmosphere and its people would never have been born to live in golden masks and its cities unbuilt would have stayed lost in the unquarried hills much thanks to them then for that journey to manhattan which turned out to be a fortyyear round trip to another world july on the shoulders of giants dusk in the robot museums the rebirth of imagination for some ten years now i have been writing a long narrative poem about a small boy in the near future who runs into an audioanimatronic museum veers away from the right portico marked rome passes a door marked alexandria and enters across a sill where a sign lettered greece points in across a meadow the boy runs over the artificial grass and comes upon plato socrates and perhaps euripides seated at high noon under an olive tree sipping wine and eating bread and honey and speaking truths the boy hesitates and then addresses plato how goes it with the republic sit down boy says plato and ill tell you the boy sits plato tells socrates steps in from time to time euripides does a scene from one of his plays along the way the boy might well ask a question which hovered in all of our minds the past few decades how come the united states the country of ideas on the march for so long neglected fantasy and science fiction why is it that only during the past thirty years attention is being paid another question from the boy might well be who is responsible for the change who has taught the teachers and the librarians to pull up their socks sit straight and take notice simultaneously which group in our country has backed off from abstraction and moved art back in the direction of pure illustration since i am neither dead nor a robot and platoasaudioanimatronic lecturer might not be programmed to respond let me answer as best i can the answer is the students the young people the children they have led the revolution in reading and painting for the first time in the history of art and teaching the children have become the teachers before our time knowledge came down from the top of the pyramid to the broad base where the students survived as best they could the gods spoke and the children listened but lo gravity reverses itself the massive pyramid turns like a melting iceberg until the boys and girls are on top the base of the pyramid now teaches how did it happen after all back in the twenties and thirties there were no sciencefiction books in the curricula of schools anywhere there were few in the libraries only once or twice ayear did a responsible publisher dare to publish one or two books which could be designated as speculative fiction if you went into the average library as you motored across america in or you would have found no edgar rice burroughs no l frank baum and no oz in or you would have found no asimov no heinlein no van vogt and er no bradbury here and there perhaps one book or two by the above for the rest a desert what were the reasons for this among librarians and teachers there was then and there still somewhat dimly persists an idea a notion a concept that only fact should be eaten with your wheaties fantasy thats for the fire birds fantasy even when it takes sciencefictional forms which it often does is dangerous it is escapist it is daydreaming it has nothing to do with the world and the worlds problems so said the snobs who did not know themselves as snobs so the shelves lay empty the books untouched in publishers bins the subject untaught comes the evolution the survival of that species called child the children dying of starvation hungry for ideas which lay all about in this fabulous land locked into machines and architecture struck out on their own what did they do they walked into classrooms in waukesha and peoria andneepawa and cheyenne and moose jaw and redwood city and placed a gentle bomb on teachers desk instead of an apple it was asimov whats that the teacher asked suspiciously try it its good for you said the students no thanks try it said the students read the first page if you dont like it stop and the clever students turned and went away the teachers and the librarians later put off reading kept the book around the house for a few weeks and then late one night tried the first paragraph and the bomb exploded they not only read the first but the second paragraph the second and third pages the fourth and fifth chapters my god they cried almost in unison these damned books are about something good lord they cried reading a second book there are ideas here holy smoke they babbled on their way through clarke heading into heinlein emerging from sturgeon these books areugly wordrelevant yes shouted the chorus of kids starving in the yard oh my yes and the teachers began to teach and discovered an amazing thing students who had never wanted to read before suddenly weregalvanized pulled up their socks and began to read and quote ursula le guin kids who had never read so much as one pirates obituary in their lives were suddenly turning pages with their tongues ravening for more librarians were stunned to find that sciencefiction books were not only being borrowed in the tens of thousands but stolen and never returned where have we been the librarians and the teachers asked each other as the prince kissed them awake whats in these books that makes them as irresistible as cracker jack the history of ideas the children wouldnt have said it in so many words they only sensed it and read it and loved it the kids sensed if they could not speak it that the first sciencefiction writers were cavemen who were trying to figure out the first scienceswhich were what how to capture fire what to do about that lout of a mammoth hanging around outside the cave how to play dentist to the sabretooth tiger and turn him into a housecat pondering those problems and possible sciences the first cavemen and women drew sciencefiction dreams on the cave walls scribbles in soot blueprinting possible strategies illustrations of mammoths tigers fires how to solve how to turn sciencefiction problem solving into sciencefact problem solved some few brave ones ran out of the cave to be stomped by the mammoth toothed by the tiger scorched by the bestial fire that lived on trees and devoured wood some few finally returned todraw on the walls the triumph of the mammoth knocked like a hairy cathedral to earth the tiger toothless and the fire tamed and brought within the cave to light their nightmares and warm their souls the children sensed if they could not speak that the entire history of mankind is problem solving or science fiction swallowing ideas digesting them and excreting formulas for survival you cant have one without the other no fantasy no reality no studies concerning loss no gain no imagination no will no impossible dreams no possible solutions the children sensed if they could not say that fantasy and its robot child science fiction is not escape at all but a circling round of reality to enchant it and make it behave what is an airplane after all but a circling of reality an approach to gravity which says look with my magic machine i defy you gravity be gone distance stand aside time stand still or reverse as i finally outrace the sun around the world in by god look plane jetrocket minutes the children guessed if they did not whisper it that all science fiction is an attempt to solve problems by pretending to look the other way in another place i have described this literary process as perseus confronted by medusa gazing at medusas image in his bronze shield pretending to look one way perseus reaches back over his shoulder and severs medusas head so science fictionpretends at futures in order to cure sick dogs lying in todays road indirection is everything metaphor is the medicine children love cataphracts though do not name them thusly a cataphract is only a special persian on a specially bred horse the combination of which threw back the roman legions some long while ago problem solving problem massive roman armies on foot science fiction dreams cataphractmanonhorseback romans dispersed problem solved science fiction becomes scientific fact problem botulism science fiction dreams to someday produce a container which would preserve food prevent death sciencefictional dreamers napoleon and his technicians dream become fact the invention of the tin can outcome millions alive today who would have otherwise writhed and died so it seems we are all sciencefictional children dreaming ourselves into new ways of survival we are the reliquaries of all time instead of putting saints bones by in crystal and gold jars to be touched by the faithful in the following centuries we put by voices and faces dreams and impossible dreams on tape on records in books on tv in films man the problem solver is that only because he is the idea keeper only by finding technological ways to save time keep time learn from time and grow into solutions have we survived into and through this age toward even better ones are we polluted we can unpollute ourselves are we crowded we can demob ourselves are we alone arewe sick the hospitals of the world are better places since tv came to visit hold hands take away half the curse of illness and isolation do we want the stars we can have them can we borrow cups of fire from the sun we can and must and light the world everywhere we look problems everywhere we further deeply look solutions the children of men the children of time how can they not be fascinated with these challenges thus science fiction and its recent history on top of which as mentioned earlier on the young people have tossed bombs into your nearest corner art gallery your downtown art museum they have walked through the halls and dozed off at the modern scene as represented by sixtyodd years of abstraction superabstracting itself until it vanished up its own backside empty canvases empty minds no concepts sometimes no color no ideas that would interest a performing flea at a dog circus enough cried the children let there be fantasy let there be sciencefiction light let illustration be reborn let the preraphaelites reclone themselves and proliferate and it was so and because the children of the space age and the sons and daughters of tolkien wanted their fictional dreams sketched and painted in illustrative terms the ancient art of storytelling as acted out by your caveman or your fra angelico or your dante gabriel rossetti was reinvented as yet the second giant pyramid turned end for end and education ran from the base into the apex and the old order was reversed hence your double revolution in reading in teaching literature and pictorial art hence by osmosis the industrial revolution and the electronic and space ages have finally seeped into the blood bone marrow heart flesh and mind of the young who as teachers teach us what we should have known all along that truth again the history of ideas which is all that science fiction ever has been ideas birthing themselves into fact dying only to reinvent new dreams and ideas to be reborn in yet more fascinating shapes and forms some of them permanent all of them promising survival i hope we will not get too serious here for seriousness is the red death if we let it move too freely amongst us its freedom is our prison and our defeat and death a good idea should worry us like a dog we should not in turn worry it into the grave smother it with intellect pontificate it into snoozing kill it with the death of a thousand analytical slices let us remain childlike and not childish in our vision borrowing such telescopes rockets or magic carpets as may be needed to hurry us along to miracles of physics as well as dream the double revolution continues and there are more invisible revolutions to come there will always be problems thankgod for that and solutions thank god for that and tomorrow mornings in which to seek them praise allah and fill the libraries and art galleries of the world with martians elves goblins astronauts and librarians and teachers on alpha centauri who are busy telling the kids not to read science fiction or fantasy itll turn your brains to mush go children run and read read and run show and tell spin another pyramid on its nose turn another world upsidedown knock the soot off my brain repaint the sistine chapel inside my skull laugh and think dream and learn and build run boys run girls run and with such good advice the kids will run and the republic will be saved the secret mind i had never wanted to go to ireland in my life yet here was john huston on the telephone asking me to his hotel for a drink later that afternoon drinks in hand huston eyed me carefully and said how would you like to live in ireland and write moby dick for the screen and suddenly we were off after the white whale myself the wife and two daughters it took me seven months to track catch and throw the whale flukes out from october to april i lived in a country where i did not want to be i thought that i saw nothing heard nothing felt nothing of ireland the church was deplorable the weather was dreadful the poverty was inadmissible i would have none of it besides there was this big fish i did not count on my subconscious tripping me up in the middle of all the threadbare dampness while trying to beach leviathan with my typewriter my antennae were noticing the people not that my wideawake self conscious and afoot did not notice them like and admire and have some for friends and see them often no but the overall thing pervasivewas the poorness and the rain and feeling sorry for myself in a sorry land with the beast rendered down into oil and delivered to the cameras i fled ireland positive i had learned naught save how to dread storms fogs and the pennybeggar streets of dublin and kilcock but the subliminal eye is shrewd while i lamented my hard work and my inability every other day to feel as much like herman melville as i wished my interior self kept alert snuffed deep listened long watched close and filed ireland and its people for other times when i might relax and let them teem forth to my own surprise i came home via sicily and italy where i had baked myself free of the irish winter assuring one and all ill write nothing ever about the connemara lightfoots and the donnybrook gazelles i should have remembered my experience with mexico many years before where i had encountered not rain and poverty but sun and poverty and come away panicked by a weather of mortality and the terrible sweet smell when the mexicans exhaled death i had at last written some fine nightmares out of that even so i insisted eire was dead the wake over her people would never haunt me several years passed then one rainy afternoon mike whose real name is nick thetaxidriver came to sit just out of sight in my mind he nudged me gently and dared to remind me of our journeys together across the bogs along the liffey and him talking and wheeling his old iron car slow through the mist night after night driving me home to the royal hibernian hotel the one man i knew best in all the wild green country from dozens of scores of dark journeys tell the truth about me mike said just put it down the way it was and suddenly i had a short story and a play and the story is true and the play is true it happened like that it could have happened no other way well the story we understand but why after all these years did i turn to the stage it was not a turn but a return i acted on the amateur stage and radio as a boy i wrote plays as a young man these plays unproduced were so bad that i promised myself never to write again for the stage until late in life after id learned to write all the other ways first and best simultaneously i gave up acting because i dreaded the competitive politics actors must play in order to work besides the short story the novel called i answered i plunged into writing years passed i went to hundreds of plays i loved them but still i held off from ever writing act i scene i again then came moby dick a while to brood over it and suddenly here was mike my taxidriver rummaging my soul lifting up tidbits of adventurefrom a few years before near the hill of tara or inland at the autumn changing of leaves in killeshandra my old love of the theater with a final shove pushed me over but also pushing and shoving with free and unexpected gifts came a mob of letterwriting strangers some eight or nine years back i began receiving notes that ran as follows sir last night in bed i told your story the fog horn to my wife or sir i am fifteen years old and won the annual recitation prize at gurnee illinois high having memorized and declaimed your tale a sound of thunder or dear mr b we are pleased to report our sevenman semistaged reading of your novel fahrenheit was greeted warmly by english teachers at our conference last night in a sevenyear period dozens of my stories were read declaimed recited and dramatized by grade school high school and college amateurs all across the country the letters piled up finally they toppled and fell on me i turned to my wife and said everyone except me is having fun adapting me how come it was then the reverse of the old tale instead of crying out that the emperor is naked these people were saying unmistakably that an english flunkout from los angeles high school was fully clothed and too thick to see it i began then to write plays one final thing jolted me back toward the stage in the last five years i have borrowed or bought a good many european and american idea plays to read i have watched the absurd and the morethanabsurd theater in the aggregate i could not help but judge the plays as frail exercises more often than not halfwitted but above all lacking in the prime requisites of imagination and ability it is only fair given this flat opinion i should now put my own head on the choppingblock you may if you wish be my executioners this is not so unusual literary history is filled with writers who rightly or wrongly felt they could tidy up improve upon or revolutionize a given field so many of us plunge forward where angels leave no dustprint having dared once exuberant i dared again when mike vaulted from my machine others unbidden followed and the more that swarmed the more jostled to fill the spaces i suddenly saw that i knew more of the minglings and commotions of the irish than i could disentangle in a month or a year of writing and unraveling them forth inadvertently i found myself blessing the secret mind and winnowing a vast interior postoffice calling nights towns weathers beasts bicycles churches cinemas and ritual marches and flights by name mike had started me at an amble i broke into a trot which was before long a full sprint the stories the plays were born in a yelping litter i had but to get out of their way now done and busy with other plays about sciencefiction machineries do i have an afterthefact theory to fit playwriting yes for only after can one nail down examine explain to try to know beforehand is to freeze and kill selfconsciousness is the enemy of all art be it acting writing painting or living itself which is the greatest art of all heres how my theory goes we writers are up to the following we build tensions toward laughter then give permission and laughter comes we build tensions toward sorrow and at last say cry and hope to see our audience in tears we build tensions toward violence light the fuse and run we build the strange tensions of love where so many of the other tensions mix to be modified and transcended and allow that fruition in the mind of the audience we build tensions especially today toward sickness and then if we are good enough talented enough observant enough allow our audiences to be sick each tension seeks its own proper end release and relaxation no tension it follows aesthetically as well as practically must be built which remains unreleased without this any art endsincomplete halfway to its goal and in real life as we know the failure to relax a particular tension can lead to madness there are seeming exceptions to this in which novels or plays end at the height of tension but the release is implied the audience is asked to go forth into the world and explode an idea the final action is passed on from creator to readerviewer whose job it is to finish off the laughter the tears the violence the sexuality or the sickness not to know this is not to know the essence of creativity which at heart is the essence of mans being if i were to advise new writers if i were to advise the new writer in myself going into the theater of the absurd the almostabsurd the theater of ideas the anykindoftheateratall i would advise like this tell me no pointless jokes i will laugh at your refusal to allow me laughter build me no tension toward tears and refuse me my lamentations i will go find me better wailing walls do not clench my fists for me and hide the target i might strike you instead above all sicken me not unless you show me the way to the ships rail for please understand if you poison me i must be sick it seems to me that many people writing the sick film the sick novel the sick play have forgotten that poison can destroy mindseven as it can destroy flesh most poison bottles have emetic recipes stamped on the labels through neglect ignorance or inability the new intellectual borgias cram hairballs down our throats and refuse us the convulsion that could make us well they have forgotten if they ever knew the ancient knowledge that only by being truly sick can one regain health even beasts know when it is good and proper to throw up teach me how to be sick then in the right time and place so that i may again walk in the fields and with the wise and smiling dogs know enough to chew sweet grass the art aesthetic is all encompassing there is room in it for every horror every delight if the tensions representing these are carried to their furthest perimeters and released in action i ask for no happy endings i ask only for proper endings based on proper assessments of energy contained and given detonation where mexico surprised me with so much darkness at the heart of the noon sun ireland surprised me with so much sun swallowed in the heart of the fog to keep one warm the distant drummer i listened to in mexico tread me to a funeral march the drummer in dublin tread me lightly through the pubs the plays wanted to be happy plays i let them write themselves that way out of their own hungers and needs their unusual joys and fine delights so i wrote half a dozen plays and will write more about irelanddid you know that people meet in great headon bicycle collisions and suffer from fearful concussions for years after all over eire they do i have caught and held them in one act did you know that in the cinemas each night just an instant before the irish national anthem is due to explode its rhythms there is a terrible surge and outflux as people fight to escape through the exits so as not to hear the dread music again it happens i saw it i ran with them now i have done it as a play the anthem sprinters did you know that the best way to drive at night in the fog across the boggy midlands of irish country is to keep your lights off and to drive terribly fast is better i have written thatis it the blood of an irishman that moves his tongue to beauty or the whiskey that he pours in to move his blood to move his tongue and tell poems and declaim with harps i do not know i ask my secret self which tells me back wise man i listen so thinking myself bankrupt ignorant unnoticing i wind up with oneact plays a threeact play essays poems and a novel about ireland i was rich and didnt know it we all are rich and ignore the buried fact of accumulated wisdom so again and again my stories and my plays teach me remind me that i must never doubt myself my gut my ganglion or my ouija subconscious again from now on i hope always to stay alert to educate myself as best i can but lacking this in future i will relaxedly turn back to my secret mind to see what it has observed when i thought i was sitting this one out we never sit anything out we are cups constantly and quietly being filled the trick is knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out my theater of ideas the time indeed is theatrical it is full of craziness wildness brilliance inventiveness it both exhilarates and depresses it says either too much or too little and one thing is constant through all the instances cited above ideas ideas are on the march for the first time in the long and plaguesome history of man ideas do not merely exist on paper as philosophies in books do todays ideas are blueprinted mockedup engineered electrified woundtight and set loose to rev men up or run men down all this being true how rare the motion picture the novel the poem the story the painting or the play which deals with the greatest problem of our time man and his fabulous tools man and his mechanical children man and his amoral robots which lead him strangely and inexplicably into immorality i intend my plays to be first entertaining and grand fun that will stimulate provoke terrify and one hopes amuse this i think is important to tell a good story to write the passions wellon to the end let the residue come when the plays are over and the crowd goes home let the audience wake in the night and say oh thats what hes up to or the next day cry he means us he means now our world our problems our delights and our despairs i do not want to be a snobbish lecturer a grandiloquent dogooder or a boring reformer i do wish to run seize this greatest time in all the history of man to be alive stuff my senses with it eye it touch it listen to it smell it taste it and hope that others will run with me pursuing and pursued by ideas and ideasmade machines i have been stopped once too often by policemen at night who ask me what i am doing walking on the sidewalk i have written a play called the pedestrian laid in the future about the plight of similar walkers in the cities i have witnessed innumerable seances between television sets and rapt transported and oblivious children of all ages and i have written the veldt a play about a walltowall television room in the very near future which becomes the center of all existence to a trapped family and i have written a play about a poetoftheordinary a master of the mediocre an old man whose greatest feat of memory is to recall how a moon or kisselkar or buick once looked down to the hubcaps windshields dashboards and license plates a man who can describe the color of every candywrapper ever purchased and the design of every package of cigarettes ever smoked these plays these ideas put in motion now on the stage i hope will be considered a true product of our time shooting haiku in a barrel it started as the black ferris a g oooword story published in weird tales about two youngsters who suspect there is something peculiar about the carnival that comes to town the story became a seventypage screen treatment dark carnival a project for gene kelly to direct unproduced the treatment became a novel something wicked this way comes the novel a screenplay then a second screenplay and now at last a film the author of the story the treatment the novel and the screenplays is of course ray bradbury lucky that bradbury feels i have always been a good editor of my own work ive tried to teach my writing friends that there are two arts number one getting a thing done and then the second great art is learning how to cut it so you dont kill it or hurt it in any way when you start out life as a writer you hate that job but now that im older its turned into a wonderful game and i love the challenge just as much as writing the original because its a challenge its an intellectual challenge to get a scalpel and cut the patient without killing if editing is a wonderful game then something wicked this way comes is a veritable parker brothers of possibilities so long hasbradbury been adapting and readapting and readapting the little story of will holloway and jim nightshade and the demonic carousel whose riders age a year with each revolution he is satisfied that the jack clayton version which disney will release in february is the closest yet of anything of mine on the screen he seems pleased with their collaboration i spent six months doing a whole new screenplay for jack which was a gorgeous experience because jack is a wonderful man to sit with every afternoon mitch tuchman i had to a page screenplay thats six hours jack said well now youve got to cut out forty pages i said god i cant he said go ahead i know you can do it ill be behind you so i cut forty pages out he said okay now youve got to cut another forty pages out i got it down to pages and then jack said thirty more i said impossible impossible okay i got it down to pages and jack said thirty more well he kept telling me i could do it and by god i went through a final time and got it down to pages it was better when you gave clayton pages did you think he would shoot it that way as an experienced screenwriter you must have known oh sure i knew it was too long i knew i could do the first cutting but from then on it gets harder first of all you get tired and you cant see a thing clearly so its up to the director or the producer who are fresher than you are to be able to help you find shortcuts what sorts of ideas did clayton come up with just daytoday sitting and saying instead of these six lines of dialogue cant you find a way of saying it with two he challenged me to go find a shorter way to say it so i found it so it was the indirect suggestion and the knowledge that he was backing me psychologically that was important would you be cutting dialogue or action everything the main thing is compression it really isnt cutting so much as learning metaphorand this is where my knowledge of poetry has been such a help to me theres a relationship between the great poems of the world and the great screenplays they both deal in compact images if you can find the right metaphor the right image and put it in a scene it can replace four pages of dialogue you look at a thing like lawrence of arabia some of the greatest scenes there are nondialogue scenes the whole scene where lawrence goes back into the desert to rescue the camel driver theres not a line of dialogue it goes on for five minutes and its all image when lawrence comes out of the desert after everyones waited for him for those minutes of beating sun and violent temperaturethe music rises and your heart rises with you thats the sort of thing youre looking for im an automatic screenwriter i always have been ive always belonged to films im a child of movies ive seen every film ever made starting when i was two im just chockful when i was seventeen i was seeing as many as twelve to fourteen movies a week well thats a hell of a lot of movies that means ive seen everything and that means all the crap but thats good its a way of learning youve got to learn how not to do things just seeing excellent films doesnt educate you at all because theyre mysterious a great film is mysterious theres no way of solving it why does citizen kane work well it just does its brilliant on every level and theres no way of putting your finger on any one thing thats right its just all right but a bad film is immediately evident and it can teach you more ill never do that and ill never do that and ill never do that tales of novelists dissatisfied with screen adaptations of their work are legion often their dissatisfaction is a result of their own false expectations can you give an example of advice that ray bradbury the screenwriter might have given to ray bradbury the novelist while adapting something wicked jack and i debated for a long time about the dust witch shes a very weird creature in the novel i have her coming to the library and shes got her eyes sewn shut but we were both afraid that if you didnt do it just right it was going to be hilarious so we reversed it now shes the most beautiful woman in the world pam grier occasionally shell turn suddenly and the kids will see what she is underneath this ugly ugly creature i think it works better that way in the book charles holloway has a sorrowful attitude toward the inevitabilty of youth slipping away was there some way to express that in the film other than with rueful looks some way to retain that internal monologue that has no action connected with it there is its not all there but weve strengthened it i believe at a given time in his life when his son was young charles holloway jason robards missed a chance to save him from drowning and the man across the street mr nightshade saved him instead so you then have this as a recurring chord at the very end its up to holloway then to save his son vidal i peterson in the mirror maze that strengthens that then you have little hints in the script all through of the father talking with the mother ellen geer late at night or with the son on the porch you dont have to do it too heavily thats the great thing about film work you just have someone look a certain wayor sense the wind a certain way and you dont have to go through all the speeches theres a wonderful scene when the fathers sitting on the porch with will late at night and the little boy says sometimes i hear you moan late at night i wish i could make you happy and the father says just tell me ill live forever it breaks your heart what about hyperbole i guess theres no question of retaining the billion voices ceased instantly as if the train had plunged in afire storm off the earth my dear young man theres a scene where the boys peterson and shawn carson run through the graveyard and watch the train go by theyre huddled against the embankment and a certain moment the train whistle screams and all the stones in the graveyard shudder and the angels weep dust ah ha you have an eyecatching way of using nouns as verbs at one point you describe charles holloway as a father who storked his legs and turkeyed his arms can descriptive language like that ever make it to the screen a good director could do it would you still see the bird a good director would find a way because what youre shooting is haiku youre shooting haiku in a barrel let me give you an example of what were talking about ive been lecturing at the university of southern california cinema department for twentytwo yearsi go down there a couple of times a yearand various students have come up to me and said can we make films of your short stories i say sure take them do it but theres one restriction i put on you shoot the whole story just read what ive done and line up the shots by the paragraphs all the paragraphs are shots by the way the paragraph reads you know whether its a closeup or a long shot so by god those students with their little cameras and have shot better films than the big productions ive had because theyve followed the story all my stories are cinematic the illustrated man over at warner brothers a couple of years ago didnt work because they didnt read the short stories i may be the most cinematic novelist in the country today all of my short stories can be shot right off the page each paragraph is a shot when i first talked to sam peckinpah years ago about directing something wicked i said to him how are you going to shoot the film if we do it he said tear the pages out of the book and stuff them into the camera i said right the job finally is to pick and choose among all metaphors in the book put them into a screenplay in just the right proportion where people dont start to laugh at you for instance i saw the only game in town george stevens film about gambling in las vegas on tv recently warren beatty and elizabeth taylor who is a little bit porky pig about a half hour in taylor turns to beatty and she says carry me into the bedroom well theres no way to do anything but laugh i thought hes going to throw his back out i mean there goes your film so when you do a fantasy for the screen make sure people dont fall off their seats how do you begin the process of adapting for movies i throw it all out and start over you never look at the original material when i write a screenplay or stage play based on my work i never look at the original work i get the play done and then i go back and see what ive missed you can always insert things if theyre missing its more fun to hear characters speak thirty years later i did farenheit for the stage in los angeles two years ago i just went to the characters and i said hey i havent talked to you in thirty years have you grown up i hope so i have and of course they had too the fire chief came to me and said hey thirty years ago when you wrote me down you forgot to ask me why i burn books i said god damn good question why do you burn books and he told mea glorious scene thats not in the novel its in the play now at some time in the future im going to go to the novel open it up and shove in the new material because its glorious could you do another film about it its not necessary because i love the truffaut film but i would like to do a tv special of the play with all the new material give the fire chief a chance to tell you that he is a failed romantic he thought books could cure everything we all think that at a certain time in our livesdont wewhen we discover books we think in an emergency all youve got to do is open the bible or shakespeare or emily dickinson and we think wow they know all the secrets with all your knowledge of screenwriting and what can and cannot be done on screen are you not interested in taking the step into directing films no i dont want to handle that many people a director has got to make forty or fifty people love him or fear him or a combination of both all the time and how do you handle that many people and keep your sanity and your politeness im afraid i would be impatient which i wouldnt want to be im accustomed you see to getting up every morning running to the typewriter and in an hour ive created a world i dont have to wait for anyone i dont have to criticize anyone its done all i need is an hour and im ahead of everyone the rest of the day i can goof off ive already done a thousand words this morning so if i want to have a two or threehour lunch i can have it because ive already beat everyone but a director says oh god my spirits are up now i wonder if i can get everyone elses up what if my leading lady isnt feeling well today what if my leading man is cantankerous how do i handle it your characters never present those problems never i never put up with anything from my ideas you just slap them into place as soon as things get difficult i walk away thats the great secret of creativity you treat ideas like cats you make them follow you if you try to approach a cat and pick it up hell it wont let you do it youve got to say well to hell with you and the cat says wait a minute hes not behaving the way most humans do then the cat follows you out of curiosity well whats wrong with you that you dont love me well thats what an idea is see you just say well hell i dont need depression i dont need worry i dont need to push the ideas will follow me when there offguard and ready to be born ill turn around and grab them zen in the art of writing i selected the above title quite obviously for its shock value the variety of reactions to it should guarantee me some sort of crowd if only of curious onlookers those who come to pity and stay to shout the old sideshow medicine men who traveled about our country used calliope drum and blackfoot indian to insure openmouthed attention i hope i will be forgiven for using zen in much the same way at least here at the start for in the end you may discover im not joking after all but let us grow serious in stages now while i have you here before my platform what words shall i whip forth painted in red letters ten feet tall work thats the first one relaxation thats the second followed by two final ones dont think well now what have these words to do with zen buddhism what do they have to do with writing with me but most especially with you first off lets take a long look at that faintly repellent wordwork it is above all the word about which your career will revolve for a lifetime beginning now you should become not its slave which is too mean a term but its partner once you are really a cosharer of existence with your work that word will lose its repellent aspects let me stop here a moment to ask some questions why is it that in a society with a puritan heritage we have such completely ambivalent feelings about work we feel guilty do we not if not busy but we feel somewhat soiled on the other hand if we sweat overmuch i can only suggest that we often indulge in made work in false business to keep from being bored or worse still we conceive the idea of working for money the money becomes the object the target the endall and beall thus work being important only as a means to that end degenerates into boredom can we wonder then that we hate it so simultaneously others have fostered the notion among the more selfconscious literary that quill some parchment an idle hour in midday a soupcon of ink daintily tapped on paper will suffice given inspirations whiff said inspiration being all too often the latest issue of the kenyon review or some other literary quarterly a few words an hour a few etched paragraphs per day and voila we are the creator or better still joyce kafka sartre nothing could be further from true creativity nothing could be more destructive than the two attitudes above why because both are a form of lying it is a lie to write in such a way as to be rewarded by money in the commercial market it is a lie to write in such a way as to be rewarded by fame offered you by some snobbish quasiliterary group in the intellectual gazettes do i have to tell you how filled to the brim the literary quarterlies are with young lads and lasses kidding themselves they are creating when all they are doing is imitating the scrolls and flourishes of virginia woolf william faulkner or jack kerouac do i have to tell you how filled to the brim are our womens magazines and other mass circulation publications with yet other lads and lasses kidding themselves they are creating when they are only imitating clarence buddington kelland anya seton or sax rohmer the avantgarde liar kids himself he will be remembered for his pedantic lie the commercial liar too on his own level kids himself that while he is slanting it is only because the world is tilted everyone walks like that now i would like to believe that everyone reading this article is not interested in those two forms of lying each of you curious about creativity wants to make contact with that thing in yourself that is truly original you want fame and fortune yes but only as rewards for work well and truly done notoriety and a fat bankbalance must come after everything else is finished and done that means that they cannot even be considered while you are at the typewriter the man who considers them lies one of the two ways to please a tiny audience that can only beat an idea insensible and then to death or a large audience that wouldnt know an idea if it came up and bit them we hear a lot about slanting for the commercial market but not enough about slanting for the literary cliques both approaches in the final analysis are unhappy ways for a writer to live in this world no one remembers no one brings up no one discusses the slanted story be it diminuendoed hemingway or thirdtimearound elinor glyn what is the greatest reward a writer can have isnt it that day when someone rushes up to you his face bursting with honesty his eyes afire with admiration and cries that new story of yours was fine really wonderful then and only then is writing worthwhile quite suddenly the pomposities of the intellectual fadists fade to dust suddenly the agreeable monies collected from the fatadvertising magazines are unimportant the most callous of commercial writers loves that moment the most artificial of literary writers lives for that moment and god in his wisdom often provides that moment for the most moneygrubbing of hacks or the most attentiongrabbing of literateurs for there comes a time in the days occupations when old money writer falls so in love with an idea that he begins to gallop steam pant rave and write from the heart in spite of himself so too the man with the quill pen is suddenly taken with fevers gives up purple ink for pure hot perspiration then he tatters quills by the dozen and hours later emerges ruinous from the bed of creation looking as if he had channeled an avalanche through his house now you ask what transpired what caused these two almost compulsive liars to start telling the truth let me haul out my signs again work its quite obvious that both men were working and work itself after awhile takes on a rhythm the mechanical begins to fall away the body begins to take over the guard goes down what happens then relaxation and then the men are happily following my last advice dont think which results in more relaxation and more unthinkingness and greater creativity now that i have you thoroughly confused let me pause to hear your own dismayed cry impossible you say how can you work and relax how can you create and not be a nervous wreck it can be done it is done every day of every week of every year athletes do it painters do it mountain climbers do it zen buddhists with their little bows and arrows do it even i can do it and if even i can do it as you are probably hissing now through clenched teeth you can do it too all right lets line up the signs again we could put them in any order really relaxation or dont think could come first or simultaneously followed by work but for convenience lets do it this way with a fourth developmental sign added work relaxation dont think further relaxation shall we analyze word number one work you have been working havent you or do you plan some sort of schedule for yourself starting as soon as you put down this article what kind of schedule something like this onethousand or twothousand words every day for the next twenty years at the start you might shoot for one short story a week fiftytwo stories a year for five years you will have to write and put away or burn a lot of material before you are comfortable in this medium you might as well start now and get the necessary work done for i believe that eventually quantity will make for quality how so michelangelos da vincis tintorettos billion sketches the quantitative prepared them for the qualitative single sketches further down the line single portraits single landscapes of incredible control and beauty a great surgeon dissects and redissects a thousand ten thousand bodies tissues organs preparing thus by quantity the time when quality will countwith a living creature under his knife an athlete may run ten thousand miles in order to prepare for one hundred yards quantity gives experience from experience alone can quality come all arts big and small are the elimination of waste motion in favor of the concise declaration the artist learns what to leave out the surgeon knows how to go directly to the source of trouble how to avoid wasted time and complications the athlete learns how to conserve power and apply it now here now there how to utilize this muscle rather than that is the writer different i think not his greatest art will often be what he does not say what he leaves out his ability to state simply with clear emotion the way he wants to go the artist must work so hard so long that a brain develops and lives all of itself in his fingers so with the surgeon whose hand at last like the hand of da vinci must sketch lifesaving designs on the flesh of man so with the athlete whose body at last is educated and becomes of itself a mind by work by quantitative experience man releases himself from obligation to anything but the task at hand the artist must not think of the critical rewards or money he will get for painting pictures he must think of beauty here in this brush ready to flow if he will release it the surgeon must not think of his fee but the life beating under his hands the athlete must ignore the crowd and let his body run the race for him the writer must let his fingers run out the story of his characters who being only human and full of strange dreams and obsessions are only too glad to run work then hard work prepares the way for the first stages of relaxation when one begins to approach what orwell might call not think as in learning to typewrite a day comes when the single letters asdf and jk give way to a flow of words so we should not look down on work nor look down on the fortyfive out of fiftytwo stories written in our first year as failures to fail is to give up but you are in the midst of a moving process nothing fails then all goes on work is done if good you learn from it if bad you learn even more work done and behind you is a lesson to be studied there is no failure unless one stops not to work is to cease tighten up become nervous and therefore destructive of the creative process so you see we are working not for works sake producing not for productions sake if that were the case you would be right in throwing up your hands in horror and turning away from me what we are trying to do is find a way to release the truth that lies in all of us isnt it obvious by now that the more we talk of work the closer we come to relaxation tenseness results from not knowing or giving up trying to know work giving us experience results in new confidence and eventually in relaxation the type of dynamic relaxation again as in sculpting where the sculptor does not consciously have to tell his fingers what to do the surgeon does not tell his scalpel what to do nor does the athlete advise his body suddenly a natural rhythm is achieved the body thinks for itself so again the three signs put them together any way you wish work relaxation dont think once separated out now all three together in a process for if one works one finally relaxes and stops thinking true creation occurs then and only then but work without right thinking is almost useless i repeat myself but the writer who wants to tap the larger truth in himself must reject the temptations of joyce or camus or tennessee williams as exhibited in the literary reviews he must forget the money waiting for him in masscirculation he must ask himself what do i really think of the world what do i love fear hate and begin to pour this on paper then through the emotions working steadily over a longperiod of time his writing will clarify he will relax because he thinks right and he will think even righter because he relaxes the two will become interchangeable at last he will begin to see himself at night the very phosphorescence of his insides will throw shadows long on the wall at last the surge the agreeable blending of work not thinking and relaxation will be like the blood in ones body flowing because it has to flow moving because it must move from the heart what are we trying to uncover in this flow the one person irreplaceable to the world of which there is no duplicate you as there was only one shakespeare moliere dr johnson so you are that precious commodity the individual man the man we all democratically proclaim but who so often gets lost or loses himself in the shuffle how does one get lost through incorrect aims as i have said through wanting literary fame too quickly from wanting money too soon if only we could remember fame and money are gifts given us only after we have gifted the world with our best our lonely our individual truths now we must build our better mousetrap heedless if a path is being beaten to our door what do you think of the world you the prism measure the light of the world it burns through your mind to throw a different spectroscopic reading onto white paper than anyone else anywhere can throw let the world burn through you throw the prism light white hot on paper make your own individual spectroscopic reading then you a new element are discovered charted named then wonder of wonders you may even be popular with the literary magazines and one day a solvent citizen be dazzled and made happy when someone sincerely cries well done a sense of inferiority then in a person quite often means true inferiority in a craft through simple lack of experience work then gain experience so that you will be at ease in your writing as a swimmer buoys himself in water there is only one type of story in the world your story if you write your story it could possibly sell to any magazine i have had stories rejected by weird tales that i turned around and sold to harpers i have had stories rejected by planet stories that i sold to mademoiselle why because i have always tried to write my own story give it a label if you wish call it science fiction or fantasy or the mystery or the western but at heart all good stories are the one kind of story the story written by an individual man from his individual truth that kind of story can be fitted into any magazine be it the post or mccalls astounding sciencefiction harpers bazaar or the atlantic i hasten to add here that imitation is natural and necessary to the beginning writer in the preparatory years a writer mustselect that field where he thinks his ideas will develop comfortably if his nature in any way resembles the hemingway philosophy it is correct that he will imitate hemingway if lawrence is his hero a period of imitating lawrence will follow if the westerns of eugene manlove rhodes are an influence it will show in the writers work work and imitation go together in the process of learning it is only when imitation outruns its natural function that a man prevents his becoming truly creative some writers will take years some a few months before they come upon the truly original story in themselves after millions of words of imitation when i was twentytwo years old i suddenly made the breakthrough relaxed that is into originality with a sciencefiction story that was entirely my own remember then that picking a field to write in is totally different from slanting within that field if your great love happens to be the world of the future it is only right that you spend your energies on science fiction your passion will protect you from slanting or imitation beyond the allowable learningpoint no field fully loved can be bad for a writer only types of selfconscious writing in a field can do great harm why arent more creative stories written and sold in our time in any time mainly i believe because many writers dont even know about this way of working which i have discussed here we are so used to the dichotomy of literary as opposed to commercial writing that we havent labeled or considered themiddle way the way to the creative process that is best for everyone and most conducive to producing stories that are agreeable to snobs and hacks alike as usual we have solved our problem or thought we solved it by cramming everything in two boxes with two names anything that doesnt fit in one box or another doesnt fit anywhere so long as we continue to do and think this way our writers will continue to truss and bind themselves the high road the happy way lies between now are you surprised seriously i must suggest that you read zen in the art of archery a book by eugen herrigel here the words or words like them work relaxation and dont think appear in different aspects and different settings i knew nothing of zen until a few weeks ago what little i know now since you must be curious as to the reason for my title is that here again in the art of archery long years must pass where one learns simply the act of drawing the bow and fitting the arrow then the process sometimes tedious and nervewracking of preparing to allow the string the arrow to release itself the arrow must fly on its way to a target that must never be considered i dont think after this long article i have to show you here the relationship between archery and the writers art i have already warned against thinking on targets instinctively years ago i knew the part that work must play in my life more than twelve years ago i wrote in ink on my typingboard at my right hand the words dont think can you blame me if at this late date i am delighted when i stumble upon verification of my instinct in herrigels book on zen the time will come when your characters will write your stories for you when your emotions free of literary cant and commercial bias will blast the page and tell the truth remember plot is no more than footprints left in the snow after your characters have run by on their way to incredible destinations plot is observed after the fact rather than before it cannot precede action it is the chart that remains when an action is through that is all plot ever should be it is human desire let run running and reaching a goal it cannot be mechanical it can only be dynamic so stand aside forget targets let the characters your fingers body blood and heart do contemplate not your navel then but your subconscious with what wordsworth called a wise passiveness you need to go to zen for the answer to your problems zen like all philosophies followed but in the tracks of men who learned from instinct what was good for them every woodturner every sculptor worth his marble every ballerina practices what zen preaches without having heard the word in all their lives it is a wise father that knows his own child should be paraphrased to it is a wise writer who knows his own subconscious and not only knows it but lets it speak of the world as it and it alone has sensed it and shaped it to its own truth schiller advised those who would compose to remove the watchers from the gates of intelligence coleridge put it thus the streamy nature of association which thinking curbs and rudders lastly for additional reading to supplement what i have said aldous huxleys the education of an amphibian in his book tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and a really fine book dorothea brandes becoming a writer published many years ago but detailing many of the ways a writer can find out who he is and how to get the stuff of himself out on paper often through wordassociation now have i sounded like a cultist of some sort a yogi feeding on kumquats grapenuts and almonds here beneath the banyan tree let me assure you i speak of all these things only because they have worked for me for fifty years and i think they might work for you the true test is in the doing be pragmatic then if youre not happy with the way your writing has gone you might give my method a try if you do i think you might easily find a new definition for work and the word is love on creativity go pantherpawed where all the mined truths sleep not smash and grab but rather find and keep go pantherpawed where all the mined truths sleep to detonate the hidden seeds with stealth so in your wake a weltering of wealth springs up unseen ignored and left behind as you sneak on pretending to be blind on your return along the jungle path youve made find all the littered stuffs where you have strayed the small truths and the large have surfaced there where you stealthblundered wildly unaware or seeming so and so these mines were mined in easy game of pace and pounce and find but mostly fluid pace not too much pounce attention must be paid but by the ounce mock caring seem aloof ignore each mile and metaphors like cats behind your smile each one wound up to purr each one a pride each one a fine gold beast youve hid inside now summoned forth in harvests from the brake turned anteloping elephants that shake and drum and crack the mind to awe to behold beauty yet perceive its flaw then flaw discovered like fair beautys mole haste back to reckon all entire the whole this done pretend these wits you do not keep go pantherpawed where all the mined truths sleep what i do is me for that i came for gerard manley hopkins what i do is me for that i came what i do is me for that i came into the world so said gerard so said that gentle manley hopkins in his poetry and prose he saw the fates that chose him in genetics then set him free to find his way among the sly electric printings in his blood god thumbprints thee he said within your hour of birth he touches hand to brow he whorls and softly stamps the ridges and the symbols of his soul above your eyes but in that selfsame hour full born and shouting shocked pronouncements of ones birth in mirrored gaze of midwife mother doctor see that thumbprint fade and fall away in flesh so lost erased you seek a lifetimes days for it and dig deep to find the sweet instructions there put by when god first circuited and printed thee to life go hence do this do that do yet another thing this self is yours be it and what is that you cry at hearthing breast is there no rest no only journeying to be yourself and even as the birthmark vanishes in seashell ear now fading to a sigh his last words send you in the world not mother father grandfather are you be not another be the self i signed you in your blood i swarm your flesh with you seek that and finding be what no one else can be i leave you gifts of fate most secret find no others fate for if you do no grave is deep enough for your despair no country far enough to hide your loss i circumnavigate each cell in you your merest molecule is right and true look there for destinies indelible and fine and rare ten thousand futures share your blood each instant each drop of blood a cloned electric twin of you in merest wound on hand read replicas of what i planned and knew before your birth then hid it in your heart no part of you that does not snug and hold and hide the self that you will be if faith abide what you do is thee for that i gave you birth be that so be the only you thats truly you on earth dear hopkins gentle manley rare gerard fine name what we do is us because of you for that we came the other me i do not write the other me demands emergence constantly but if i turn to face him much too swiftly then he sidles back to where and when he was before i unknowingly cracked the door and let him out sometimes a fireshout beckons him he reckons that i need him so i do his task to tell me who i am behind this mask he phantom is and i facade that hides the opera he writes with god while i all blind wait raptureless until his mind steals down my arm to wrist to hand to fingertips and stealing find such truths as fall from tongues and burn with sound and all of it from secret blood and secret soul on secret ground with glee he sidles forth to write then run and hide all week until another try at hideandseek in which i do pretend that teasing him is not my end yet tease i do and feign to look away or else that secret self will hide all day i run and play some simple game a mindless leap which from sleep summons forth the bright beast lurking whose preserves and gaming ground my breath my blood my nerves but where in all that stuff does he abide in all my rampant seekings wheres he hide behind this ear like gum that ear like fat where does this mischief boy hatrack his hat no use a hermit he was born and lives recluse theres nothing for it but i join his ruse his game and let him run at will and make my fame on which i put my name and steal his stuff and all because i sneezed him forth with sweet creations snuff did r b write that poem that line that speech no innerape invisible did teach his reach clothed in my flesh stays mystery say not my name praise other me troy my troy was there of course though people said not so blind homers dead his ancient myths no way to go leave off dont dig but i then rigged some means whereby to seam my earthen soul or die i knew my troy folks warned this boy it was mere tale and nothing more i bore their warning with a smile while all the while my spade was delving homers gardened sun and shade gods never mind cried friends dumb homers blind how can he show you ruins that ner were im sure i said he speaks i hear im sure their advice spurned i dug when all their backs were turned for i had learned when i was eight doom was my fate they said the world would end that day i panicked thought it true that you and i and they would never see the light of the next day yet that day came with shame i saw it come recalled my doubt and wondered what those doomsters were about from that day on i kept a private joy and did not let them sense my buried troy for if they had what scorns derision jokes i sealed my city deep from all those folks and growing dug each day what did i find and given as gift by homer old and homer blind one troy no ten ten troys no two times ten three dozen and each a richer finer brighter cousin all in my flesh and blood and each one true so whats this mean go dig the troy in you go not with ruins in your mind go not with ruins in your mind or beauty fails romes sun is blind and catacomb your cold hotel where shouldbe heavens couldbe hell beware the temblors and the flood that time hides fast in tourists blood and shambles forth from hidden home at sight of lostinruins rome think on your joyless blood take care romes scattered bricks and bones lie there in every chromosome and gene lie all that was or might have been all architectural tombs and thrones are tossed to ruin in your bones time earthquakes there all life that grows and all your future darkness knows take not these inner ruins to rome a sad man wisely stays at home for if your melancholy goes where all is lost then your loss grows and all the dark that self employs will teemso travel then with joys or else in ruins consummate a death that waited long and late and all the burning towns of blood will shake and fall from sane and good and you with ruined sight will see a lost and ruined rome and thee cracked statue mended by noons light yet innerscaped with souls midnight so go not traveling with mood or lack of sunlight in your blood such traveling has double cost when you and empire both are lost when your mind stormdrains catacomb and all seems graveyard rock in rometourist go not stay home stay home i die so dies the world poor world that does not know its doom the day i die two hundred million pass within my hour of passing i take this continent with me into the grave they are most brave allinnocent and do not know that if
