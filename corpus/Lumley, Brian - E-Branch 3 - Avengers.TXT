an epilogue not so very devious after all invaders and defilers a resume what has gone before invaders and defilers three years ago three great vampires two lords and a lady of the wamphyri the alien originators of the alleged vampire myths or legends of earth entered our world via a trans dimensional gate under the carpathian mountains having split up following their covert invasion the trio went their own ways lord nephran malinari enthralled an australian billionaire to set himself up in a casino aerie in the exclusive resort of xanadu in the macpherson mountains lord szwart a metamorphic flythelight in the truest sense of the term headed for london settling in a forgotten roman temple in the deepest most inaccessible bowels of the city and vavara beautiful mistress of masshypnotism defiled an order of nuns by infiltrating their fortresslike monastery on the greek island of krassos their plan to overthrow the planet reducing it to a vampire paradise was in essence a simple one to plant gardens of deadspawn fungi and bring them to deadly maturity nurtured on the life fluids of sacrificed vampire thralls or lieutenants these toadstools when they ripened and spawned would release myriad spores into the earths atmosphere to be breathed by an unwitting human race then as men became bloodlusting monsters who hid from the sun during daylight hours and hunted by night and nation fought nation as the world sank into chaos and no one least of all the mazed bloodaddicted victims was able to understand or even consider fighting the incurable disease that was converting them then the great vampires the wamphyri would emerge from the shadows and come into their own as in the earliest days of their predawn vampire world of sunsidestarside their thralls and lieutenants would go abroad in the world carrying their monstrous plague with them as they consolidated their masters territories where the laws of the wamphyri would be the only laws malinari would take australia expanding into all the islands around and eventually into asia and vavara would take the mediterranean and africa spreading east to form a border with malinari as for the metamorphic horror that was lord szwart while it would seem he had been disadvantaged with only the british isles france spain and the northern and westernmost regions of europe coming under his control as he deployed his forces west across the atlantic he would quickly seed the americas with his deadspawn and when the time was ripe he would move his power base to new york the metropoliss sprawling underground network would provide access to all parts of the city whether in daylight or darkness while its greatest building would be szwarts aerie its every window lacquered black and draped against the sun these had been the ambitions of the wamphyri and they had seemed infallible their dreams and an unwitting mankinds as yet unrealized nightmares but despite their legendary cunning and leechlike tenacity the three great vampires had not reckoned with ebranch ebranch a top secret arm of the british intelligence services many of whose psychically talented agents had dealt with vampires before not only in this world but also in sunsidestarside ben trask the members of his londonbased organization and a small handful of people in the corridors of power were the only human beings who knew of the alien invasion and because of the planetwide panic any disclosure would cause they dared not speak of it to anyone outside their circle but having traced malinari to australia trask and an ebranch task force had ventured down under to confront malinari in his aerie there in xanadu they had destroyed his fungi garden but the mind himself had escaped as for jake cutter jake seems an entirely wrongheaded man with something of a chequered background having fallen foul of a gang of international drugrunners and suffered at their hands he was bent on settling old scores when strange circumstances brought him into contact with ebranch he was in fact pursuing a vendetta with this criminal organizations powerful leader and several of his close colleagues people who had raped and murdered a girl of jakes aquaintance with whom he had had a brief but passionate affair and had been responsible for a series of violent extremely ugly deaths in their higher echelon but the leader of the gang a sicilian vampire named luigi castellano had laid a trap for jake causing him to fall into the hands of the italian police incarcerated in a turin prison jake had soon discovered that castellano was not without influence there and that his demise had been scheduled for the very near future then during a jailbreak when it seemed certain that jake must die under fire from the guards a weird reprieve a miraculous escape jakes first taste of things to come and the beginning of his transition something he took to be a ricochetting bullet a flash of golden fire struck him in the forehead but instead of falling dead he fell into something else entirely and was conveyed through the mobius continuum to harrys room at ebranch hq in london harrys room the longdead necroscope harry keogh was once the most important member of ebranch on those occasions when he stayed at the london hq he had a room of his own as did many espers harrys room however has always been different from the other rooms perhaps to signal their regard for their much loved highly respected exmember or perhaps because the room continues to retain something of the necroscopes personality it has been left untouched and unoccupied exactly as it was in the time of harrys residence and so it was a singular event for ben trask and his espers to discover a bewildered stranger inside the locked room of the necroscope in the heart of securityconscious ebranch hq and it had to be more than a mere coincidence jakes advent had come at a propitious moment for it was only a short time later that nephran malinari was discovered in xanadu his playboy retreat and aerie in the mountains of the macpherson range and teaming jake up with liz merrick a young attractive budding telepathic receiver whose powers like jakes were still developing trask took them to australia as part of his task force it was during the course of this largely successful operation that jake discovered the truth of what trask and his people had suspected all along that indeed he had inherited something of harrys powers for when the original necroscope had died on starside his metaphysical personality the sidereal intelligence that was harry had fragmented into many golden splinters or darts one of which had entered into jake now in his dreams jake could converse with the dead necroscope through the medium of deadspeak then too jake had felt obliged to ask trask just what exactly a necroscope was but while trask had been willing to explain something of a necroscopes powers to jake his ability to teleport and the unearthly gift that enabled him to converse with the dead there were certain other things that he dared not speak of for as the director of ebranch for many years trask had developed an inquiring and sceptical mind he knew how very deceiving outward appearances could be and how even the most innocentseeming of men might be susceptible to the greatest evils moreover trask had never had much faith in coincidence or synchronicity he believed that things usually had good reasons for happening and that when they happened might be equally relevant jake had come on the scene at a propitious time certainly but propitious for whom and wasnt it simply too much of a coincidence that at the advent of a trio of great vampires out of starside a new necroscope should also put in an appearance so had jake arrived of his own accord by coincidence or had he in fact been sent to infiltrate ebranch what was it of the original necroscope how much of harry what element that had entered jake something of his light side from his earlier life or something of his far more dangerous side from a later darker period for one of the several things that jake didnt yet know was that at the end of the necroscopes time on earth he had been a vampire in his own right wamphyri and probably the greatest of them all and not only harry but two of his sons they too had been vampires changeling creatures on starside in a weird parallel world thus trasks doubts or more properly his natural caution coupled with his inability to read the young necroscope despite that his own weird talent made him a human liedetector held him back from bringing jake more fully into his confidence for if jake was not the real thing if he had not inherited harrys mantle to become the fantastic weapon against the wamphyri that most of trasks agents believed him to be but rather possessed the potential to become the exact opposite then trask might yet have to kill him hence his great quandary for if on the other hand jake was the real thing and if he was made privy to everything then he might easily shy from the knowledge the full knowledge of what he was becoming and what he would be capable of doing and would be lost to ebranch for ever for while it takes a special kind of man to accept the responsibilities of a necroscope the role of caretaker to the dead it takes an extraspecial man to accept that the great majority will do almost anything for love of him including the agony and horror of selfresurrection of rising from their graves in order to protect him after the australian venture when jake was given the comparative freedom of ebranch hq if not access to all of its many secrets the first thing he did was desert the cause in order to pursue his own agenda his vendetta with castellano but the fact was that jake didnt see his leaving as any kind of treachery his reasons for walking out on ben trask and ebranch were more than one and not least selfpreservation first the harry keogh influence had been replaced by something of a far more disturbing nature jake was finding himself under constant attack from a deceased vampire lieutenant called korath an exminion of malinaris dead and sloughed away in a subterranean sump in romania korath had used deadspeak to tell jake the histories of the three wamphyri invaders from starsidebut in the process he had also tricked his way into semiresidence in jakes head only let jake relax and let his mental shields down and korath would be there with him in his mind dreaming his dreams conversing with him attempting to influence to guide or advise him and generally sharing his wakingworld experiences jake could send him away back to his sump but he could never be absolutely certain when korath was or wasnt there the only good thing to come out of this was that korath had inherited something of his former masters mentalism endowed with eidetic recall hed memorized the mathematical mobius formula given to jake by harry keogh which for some reason jake was unable to grasp and had thus become his reluctant hosts one and only key to the metaphysical mobius continuums mode of trans or teleportation and so he and jake had worked out a compromise all korath wanted or so he had led jake to believe was revenge on his former master and the other great vampires for killing him as a means of accessing our world but since korath was incorporeal a dead creature whose sole contact with the living was through jake and his deadspeak the new necroscope was the only one who could possibly exact such a revenge jake couldnt go about his business without korath and korath would have no existence at all without jake one other problem with korathi if ben trask found out about his coexistence with jake it might yet be a case of having to kill two birds with one stone or more properly one man and a parasitic mindthing with however many bullets were required to do the job but even that selfpreservation wasnt jakes only reason for quitting the branch in fact he was driven to leave by some unknown but increasingly insistent force that demanded that he pursue his own or perhaps someone elses agenda moreover the longer he remained with ebranch the greater the chance of a romantic attachment with liz merrick with whom hed developed a semitelepathic rapport the last thing jake needed was to be close to someone he couldnt touch for fear of a dead vampires voyeurism in jakes absence while he used the mobius continuum to pursue and harass luigi castellanos mediterraneanbased drugrunners ebranch had tracked down malinari and vavara to the tiny greek island of krassos this time as distinct from the australian operation trasks task force was a very small one and politically and economically there were huge problems to be overcome but with the help of a greek friend of theirs from an earlier adventure an athenian police inspector called manolis papastamos finally ebranch located and burned vavaras monastery aerie while her deadspawn garden was dynamited and buried in a series of explosive attacks but at the same time there had been two major setbacks in london ben trasks newfound love of only a few days duration the telepath millicent cleary had been kidnapped by szwart and his minions down into his roman temple dedicated to dark gods in a forgotten cavern deep under the city and in krassos liz merrick had been taken by vavara when that mistress of evil made her escape from the blazing monastery it had looked like the end for both of these brave women but in sicily where jake had finally rid the world of castellano and his organization and in the process discovered why he had felt so driven by his vendetta that this had been part of a task begun but left unfinished even unremembered by the original necroscope the new necroscope heard lizs desperate cry for help across all the many miles between them jake beard it it was the rapport which existed between them that had boosted lizs developing telepathic talent but when jake required korath to show him the mobius equations in order that he might use the continuum to find liz and rescue her then korath had sprung his trap korath had already discovered that jake couldnt be bribed or threatened when his own life was at stake for without jake there would be no korath so whatever else the vampire did he would try to keep his host alive but jake would definitely be open to persuasion if anothers life were at risk and more especially if that other was the woman he loved now jake knew koraths real objective access to his inner mind to be one with him a part of him and perhaps permanently jake couldnt refuse without koraths help liz was as good as dead in order to view the equations create a mobius door teleport through the continuum and rescue liz jake must first accept this dead but incredibly dangerous things conditions and this despite harry keoghs warning that he must never let a vampire into his mind but there was no longer any other way he went along with it gave korath access to the very core of his mind and welcomed him in of his own free will and only then discovered how he had been duped that he would have been able to conjure the formula all along if korath had not been blocking his every attempt too late now though to do anything about it for liz was in trouble on a small greek island hundreds of miles away jake was in the nick of time in krassos he reunited liz with her ebranch colleagues who then informed him of the plight of the telepath millie cleary in london using the continuum jake returned trask and company to their london hq where the espers combined their weird talents to locate millie still alive her psychic aura was well known to liz who was then able to contact her and determine her precise whereabouts now it was up to the new necroscope taking millies coordinates from lizs mind jake went to the distraught telepath in her previously unknown temple prison there he found not only millie but also lord szwarts terrible deadspawn garden which he managed to destroy by bringing about an explosion of natural gas so now and despite that the plans of the wamphyri were in disarray the main question had to be how many of the invaders themselves had survived had vavara died when her limo crashed throwing her into the sea had malinari been trapped below in vavaras garden when it was buried had the metamorphic szwart suffered the true death in a roman temple whose destruction had even registered on the seismographs at greenwich now too with ben trask and his people in jakes debt it was time for a showdown time for jake to give up bis secret the fact that he harboured a vampire intelligence in his mind and ask for ebranchs help but also time for him to demand to know the full story why trask had been so reticent in his dealings with him and what had been the problem with the previous necroscope that the head of branch hadnt dared talk about it harry keoghs ability to raise the dead but jake had found that out for himself indeed it accounted for the grey streaks at his temples and the hint of fearful forbidden knowledge in his eyes but he knew that wasnt the entire story perhaps one day the teeming dead that great majority of human souls gone before might believe in jake have enough faith in him that he could ask them but for now he was asking ben trask or he would have been but at a meeting in trasks office when all jakes questions might finally have been answered an urgent message from the minister responsible something had come up that he knew would interest ebranch his usual british understatement for in fact the minister knew that it was something that only ebranch could handle and now read on the sun the sea and the drifting doom at some tons and just over feet from stem to stern the evening star was a mediterranean cruise ship without peer her eight public decks were all served by elevators and with her casino gymnasium outdoor pools bars gift shops sports deck all the usual amenities the star was the pride of her line of an evening her plus passengers could choose to relax in the moulin rouge lounge or the all that jazz show bar dance the night away in the sierra ballroom or simply sit and be serenaded watching the sunset from the panoramic sun deck this being the stars last voyage of the season however last night had been a little different a midcruise extravaganza the extra glitz of its shows and its grand finale a fireworks display from the stern lighting the aegean sky with dazzling spirals and brilliant thunderclap bombbursts had been one of the highlights of the voyage the locals ashore in mytilene on the island of lesbos had enjoyed it as much as the passengers aboard had add to this cuisine straight out of a gourmets dream of paradise and it was easy to see why the onboard partying had gone on and on through the night and why the run on the champagne locker had seemed unending but all good things do come to an end now it was early morning of a monday in october and in the galley breakfast was being prepared for those who still had the stomach for yet more food while those who didnt slept off their excesses a few younger passengers were up and about making the most of the pools while they still had them to themselves as if emulating their energy a pod of dolphins like so many silver minisubmarines played chicken on the bowwave crisscrossing the prow just beneath a sparkling surface that was so flat calm it might well have been a horizonspanning plate of diamondetched glass while the sun had risen no more than half an hour ago already the deck rails were warm from its rays perfect so thought purser bill galliard where he strolled the main deck forard having risen early to prepare the shoreexcursion roster for the stars midday visit to the picturesque island of limnos thus far the cruise had gone precisely to plan without a hitch and galliard had wanted to do his bit to ensure things stayed that way now that hed finished with the limnos documentation he could take it easy for an hour or so at least until the bulk of the passengers were astir and those who desired to go ashore were readying themselves for terra firma now in the very prow of the ship forty feet above and forward of the spot where the knifelike stem sliced the water he leaned on the deck rail and looked out across the vast curve of the ocean no land in sight but galliard came from a long line of deckhands he knew how quickly land masses could take shape on the horizon especially in the aegean looming up as if from nowhere into cloudcapped mountain ranges and with the cooling breeze of the vessels forward motion in his face and the hiss of parted waters in his ears he reflected on the trip so far most of the passengers were middleaged comfortably welltodo generally easygoing brits and the crew was composed of a british captain officers and senior stewards supported by a largely greek cypriot body of deckhands engineers chefs and an international lineup of entertainers the passengers had flown out from england to cyprus joining the cruise in limassol after a week of sailing they would return to cyprus before flying home sailing from limassol on thursday evening the evening star had cruised all day friday providing an ideal opportunity for the passengers to get to know the vessel and their fellow holidaymakers saturday it had been all ashore whos going ashore in volos on the greek mainland and purser bill had taken time out to visit friends in their villa at the foot of the pelion mountains also to pick up some gifts in voloss bustling bazaar for the folks back home sunday theyd cruised to lesbos and mytilene where the sightseers had gone ashore again and last night had been the foodandfireworks fest that brought galliard up to date the next port of call in some four hours time would be limnoss new deepwater harbour and tomorrow theyd be through the dardanelles on their way to istanbul but that was to look too far ahead and cruises such as this were best taken one day at a time as he thought these things through galliard had been idly scanning the forward horizon a moment ago if only for a moment hed caught sight of something in direct line ahead the fact hadnt made a great impact on him shipping of one sort or another can be found any time in mediterranean waters and just about anywhere anyway it had been a flash of white on a glittering surface maybe a dolphin had leaped clear of the water and the splashdown had caught his eye but purser galliard stepped to one of two telescopes mounted on the rail and focused ahead for a while there was nothing but then now what was that a greek caique just sitting there all these miles from the nearest island nothing peculiar about the boat itself the islands were full of them like gondolas in venice but they usually stuck pretty close to shore this one looked becalmed and it simply shouldnt have been there the canopied boat was maybe threequarters of a mile ahead but dead ahead and it definitely wasnt moving galliard took out his onboard communicator and pressed one for the bridge three decks higher his call sign was recognized and a voice answered bridge what can we do for you purser bill it was captain geoff anderson informal as ever you might try swinging her a tad to port and calling full stop on all engines galliard told him at once were about a minute and a half from running someone down wait came the terse answer and ten seconds later well done purser bill we would have seen and cleared her okay but if they need help wed have had to slow down and come about so youve saved us some time and a little embarrassment possibly now for your trouble you can arm yourself with a hailer and get down starboard onto b deck okay aye aye capn galliard answered with a grin heading at the double for his office amidships after only a few paces he was gratified to feel the gentle shudder of a sudden deceleration the barely noticeable shifting underfoot as the star began veering a few degrees to port from just below the surface of b deck a section of the hull had been rotated outwards to form stairs and from the bottom step purser bill galliard threw out a line to the tatteredlooking man in the shade of the caiques canopy accompanied by three stewards and a deckhand galliard watched as the figure of the man in the caique made fast the line then began to haul his boat in alongside thats okay galliard called out ill do that you just sit tight water the shaded crumpledseeming man answered him his voice a dry croak the lady and i were burning up a lady that must be the second figure lying supine between the thwarts even as galliard drew the caique alongside he saw her jewelgreen eyes flicker open to fix his own in the moment before a luminous glow suffused her face making it indistinct and god sbes beautiful he thought before wondering where that idea had come from since as yet she was barely visible in the shade of the boats canopy which made a jetblack contrast with the blinding sunlight shade said the gaunt ragged figure of the man standing hunched under the canopy the sun we have suffered we have juice said galliard passing a pitcher down sip a little it will ease your throats give you strength but how long have you been out here too long said the other sipping and passing the pitcher to the woman then reaching out a hand to galliard help me to get her up there the purser took his hand and felt its chill strange on a day as hot as this to feel a hand so cold stranger by far that the hand seemed to smoke in the sunlight but galliard was much too busy too concerned to wonder about the apparent contradictions here the woman was heavily muffled wrapped head to toe she seemed almost mummified as she struggled to her feet tottering where she emerged into the light galliard leaned forward held to the rail with one hand and caught her round her slender waist with the other she stepped was lifted up from the boat to the stairs and her manfriend close behind apparently eager to enter into the shade of the ship but what on earth happened here galliard enquired as he and the stewards assisted the pair up into the ship and towards the elevators and the deckhand left to go about his business i mean that you got into trouble adrift way out here we ran out of fuel said the man throwing off the jacket hed been using to cover his head we were taken by an unusual tide off krassos we used up our fuel trying to get back to the island a little jaunt turned into a nightmare his story sounded incredible that even in this mad el nino summer theyd been lost in the aegean adrift and going unnoticed through all the regular shipping routes long enough to have become so dehydrated and so badly burned but on the other hand it must be true for the condition of the pair admitted of no other explanation galliard looked sideways at the tall dark wouldhavebeen handsome man wouldhavebeen because the skin was peeling from his blackened face and his sunken cheeks were pitted almost as if by small meteorites the womans condition was harder to describe similar yet different she was burned too blackened in places as if by real fire as distinct from strong sunlight and yet that strange glow obscured most of her facial ravages she had thrown off some of her upper wrappings revealing her face and now breathed so much easier in the electric light of the ships bowels but although she was close enough to lean on galliard still he couldnt make out her features and riding the elevator up through four decks to the fifth the bridge deck purser bill frowned and shook his head he continued to support the woman but was aware now of something weirder by far despite that he somehow knew she was beautiful she felt decidely unlovely her waist where his arm circled it and also her body where he supported it they were hard angular bony but now breaking into his thoughts as galliard shrank back a little from these far from ordinary people take us to the captain purser galliard the man growled his voice firmer now and commanding and dont let the details concern you all will become clear shortly you you know my name but of course i do just as you told it to me the other answered and through all his burns somehow the enigmatic stranger managed to smile a leering smile they left the elevator and headed for the bridge at which the pursers weird sensation of suspended reality of all of this not really happening eased off a little then releasing the woman and drawing farther apart from her he turned to the stewards saying lads theres something not quite right in fact totally wrong here and far more so than galliard had suspected or so it appeared for the stewards all three of them seemed dazed in a world of their own having taken the womans weight now they were wholly intent upon her unable to take their eyes off her and they werent listening to galliard at all just beyond a sign saying officers and crew members only purser galliard came to a stifflegged halt and turned to face the man he had so recently rescued what he started to say and stopped for the tall stranger had moved so quickly taking galliards face between his cold burned hands that the purser hadnt been able to avoid the contact following which it was too late anyway and your knowledge of the vessel the words flowed like a river of ice in galliards trembling mind freezing him solid of its captain and other officers of anything that might be dangerous to me and my companion i need to understand your communication capability with the outside world and other ships ahhh your radio room yesss and the location of any weapons that you are carrying do not think to deny me purser galliard for the pain i can cause you will not be denied give me everything i want and suffer no further or suffer all that i can bring to bear in the knowledge that i shall still get what i want galliard fought or rather he fought to move to cry out to break free but it was useless the icy power of this creature the alien nightmare of his sucking hands feeding on the pursers knowledge held him rooted to the spot but he sensed what was happening to him felt the flow of his thoughts in fact his memories going out of him and knew that the chill they left behind them was the emptiness of a mental vacuum as cold as the spaces between the stars you are correct the thing told him my mind is a great storehouse of memories only a small number of which are mine but knowledge is power bill galliard without which im at the mercy of a strange environment so dont bold back now but let me have it all everything then as i remember so you shall forget even bow to experience hurt for as nepbran malinari reads a book so be tears out its pages you men galliard gasped swivelling his bulging eyes to stare at the three stewards at the same time trying to shrink down into himself away from his tormentor but held up held fast by the monsters hands you men you have to to do something you have to fight it fight them one of the stewards had heard him his eyes focused as he staggered back away from the woman and looked at the purser in the hands of the demoniac stranger purser bill he mumbled blinking rapidly i mean what the hell the woman at once went after him seemed to flow upon him her slender hands reaching out like long raking claws and as galliard saw her actual face for the first time so his jaw fell open beautiful but she was the worst possible nightmare hag her eyes were green as jewels but they burned crimson in their cores as if lit by internal fires and her jaws her teeth her face closed with the stewards shoulder where it joined his neck and galliard heard her lustful snarl as she bit him there then he knew what they were monsters out of myths and legends but real for all that and fought harder still a mistake for he left the mancreature no choice and you have a saying said that one in galliards mind which has it that the eyes are the windows of the soul it may be so i who am without a soul cannot say for sure but they are most certainly a means of entry to the brain and likewise the ears routes of access to the inner mind these organs the ears that hear his index fingers extended themselves projecting deep into the pursers ears their knifelike nails slicing a way in through flesh and cartilage and the eyes that see i want to know what youve heard and all that youve seen painful aye but didnt i warn you not to resist me galliards screams were thin highpitched wailing things more like the whining of a small child than the agonized denial of a tortured man as his mind was drained and he forgot all that hed ever known about the evening star and with his face hideously altered he crumpled to the floor as lord malinari of the wamphyri finally withdrew his brainslimed fingers by then vavara malinaris partner if only for the time being had dealt with the second steward but the third was recovering from her hypnotic spell blinking his eyes and shaking his head he peered slackjawed at his shipmates where they had slumped to the deck in blood that fountained from severed arteries in their necks also at the spastically twitching crumpled figure of the purser his eyes flopping on his bloodied cheeks while his cries turned to a vacant moaning as his cruelly depleted crippled brain closed down his survival systems one by one but already muffled enquiries were sounding from beyond the reinforced door to the bridge someone in there must have heard the pursers strangled inarticulate babbling and malinari saw at least two outlines in motion behind the frosted glass of the doors upper panel with no time to waste on the third steward he grabbed him and swung him out through a hatch and up against the deck rail stiffening his hand and arm to a ramrod the vampire slammed bone fingers into his victims chest rupturing his heart then after yanking his hand free a push was sufficient to topple the steward backwards over the rail sending him plummeting to the promenade deck twenty feet below down there a halfdozen or so early risers were leaning on the rail taking in the view as malinari snarled his hatred of the seething sunlight and snatched himself back into the shade he saw their startled horrified faces glancing up at him hah as yet they hadnt the slightest notion of what real horror was but theyd know soon enough oh yes they would know and gritting his awesome teeth against the agony of his seared forearms and face malinari returned to vavara in time to see her trying the handle of the door to the bridge as malinari had learned from the purser however this was a security door with a voiceactivated lock vavaras hiss of frustration wasnt a voice or code that it would recognize but she wasnt much known for her patience either and before he could caution her against it shed balled a fist and struck furiously at the pane of frosted glass fortified against ordinary shocks or blows still the pane caved in shattering as if struck by an axe vavaras hand continued on unhindered caught at the throat of a blurred figure on the far side and drew him headlong through the razorsharp daggerrimmed frame deeply cut about his face and arms shouting his pain and shock he was sent skidding along the deck in his own blood only coming to a halt at malinaris feet malinari dragged him upright scanned his bloodied wideeyed face his tattered spattered ships uniform and said not captain geoff anderson no merely his underling but you are going to take us to him arent you and he propelled him back towards vavara at the door vavaras guise was down now furious she showed herself in all her horror her forked devils tongue wriggled behind teeth that looked like twin rows of knives her eyes flared red her clawed hands brooked no resistance as she sank fingers like rusty fishhooks deep into the first mates cheek lifting him up onto his toes and open this door she hissed lest im tempted to toss you through it for i refuse to climb in the way you came out its voiceactivated malinari told her let him speak speak then said vavara speak now or lose whats left of your face dddoor the man gasped and a buzz sounded from within followed by a series of clicks when the clicks stopped vavara turned the handle thrust her shoulder at the door and when it sprang open hurled the mate ahead of her onto the bridge captain anderson was there he was using a telephone at the traditional mainly ceremonial wheel taking one look at vavara and malinari where they stood framed in the doorway he dropped the phone and made a clumsy run for the radio room in a soundproofed glasswalled wing of the bridge calmly following him malinari caught up with him just as he uttered the command that opened the door and taking anderson by the scruff of the neck he thrust him ahead into the radio room an operator sat at the console with earphones on his head with staring eyes he glanced around saw the captain hurtling towards him and was slammed back into the console winded he toppled from his chair as anderson rebounded from him and in the next moment malinari stood over both men grabbing the radio operator by the hair malinari drew him to his feet and almost casually inquired of him have you sent any messages about a becalmed caique perhaps and a rescue at sea nnno the radio man gasped i i was waiting on the captains orders ehsaid malinari raising an eyebrow whats that this ones orders do you mean grabbing anderson by the throat he exerted the massive strength of a lord of the wamphyri and tore out the captains windpipe anderson died in a crimson welter of blood and mangled gristle which malinari draped over the bald sweating head of the radio operator and as that one shrank back and down the great vampire effortlessly took up the captains body by the shoulder and hip hoisted it overhead for a moment then slammed it down onto the radio console with such force that the entire bank of dials and switches flew apart under the impact then as a sputtering shower of electrical sparks ensued and a whiff of acrid smoke drifted from the wreckage malinari said thus you have a new captain you may call me captain malinari or better still lord malinari the the radio the other sputtered hoarsely youve destroyed it and not just the radio but our navigation satellite navigation was routed through these controls oh i know malinari nodded so now were not only dumb but were blind too that is unless we go to manual can you by any chance pilot this vessel im not qqqualified the man wiped blood from his face his hand trembling violently but yyyes i think so excellent said malinari the purser thought so too so if youd told me otherwise well that would have gone quite badly for you so perhaps youll now consult the charts find a suitable rock and dock us a rockthe man looked this way and that dock us wreck us malinari nodded bring us up aground but first he must see us under way again said vavara as she entered the room seeing her in close proximity the radio operator shrank back more yet so then things to do malinari told him you have your orders but try not to fail me or i may put you over the side where you will be drawn into the propellers and whatever else you do do not think to disobey me that would prove even more unfortunate hooking the man under the chin vavara drew him upright and let him see the gape of her jaws and smell her breath and very well then she glared at him is all understood he couldnt speak and so simply nodded his head releasing him she turned to malinari i think i hear running footsteps are they coming to their senses do you think he shrugged very possibly as youll recall the captain was on the phone speaking to someone when we broke in also i killed a steward and hurled him down a deck that should definitely have alerted them to the fact that something is amiss then perhaps its time we introduced ourselves she said to the rest of the crew and then to the passengers aye malinari agreed to all of them eventually myself i am sorely in need of refreshment and ive heard the cuisine aboard these pleasure cruisers is superb cuisine she laughed throatily then you shall have your choice whats your preference blonde or brunette redhead i think malinari leered there are bound to be a few among the fourteen hundred on board but first theres an arms locker we should see to just a few small arms in the pursers cabin on the main deck we should heave that overboard i think our leeches have work enough with all our burns without that theyre overtaxed healing bullet holes too i agree she answered as for the rest the passengers and crew it wont be long before they discover that the only safe places are on the open decks out in the sunlight safe while it lasts malinari nodded thoughfully and at least until tonight by which time if were assiduous in our work we shall have a good many thralls to instruct vampires in the making as they left the radio room and made for the shattered door to the bridge deck the radio operator came staggering in their wake malinari glanced at him reminding him now dont let us down will you if in five minutes time this ship isnt making headway ill know where to come looking for an answer oh and as for that rock i mentioned the aegean has plenty of them as im sure youre aware so find one on your charts the nearest one will do and take us to it he pointed at the telephone dangling over a varnished spoke of the wooden wheel where the captain had let it fall a second spoke supported the first mates limp body it was sunk deep in the socket of his right eye having got stuck in his skull when vavara had slammed him face down onto it hanging there like a wet towel his blood had pooled around his knees and was still spreading but the phone was squawking like a tiny strangled chicken making shrill enquiries and carry on then malinari pushed the radio operator forward do something speak to whoever it is tell lies and live but remember if you intend to survive this dont do or say anything too rash and with a final monstrous smile he followed after vavara out through the door and into hell hell for the passengers and crew of the evening star but to the wamphyri a way of life and of undeath that they had kept mainly suppressed for far too long the survivor three days later gunnery commander john argyle was thirtyeight years old a good six foot two inches tall immaculate in lightweight warmweather order blueeyed blond and crewcut beneath his flattopped naval officers cap and plainly annoyed as a man who had gone to sea at eighteen and climbed up through the ranks to his current position in which he was a stickler for regulations and discipline in general it was these despised civilians or in ratings belowdecks parlance landlubbers who were the cause of his considerable displeasure more to the point however it was the fact that the captain had seen fit to detail him as escort to this polyglot party of nonnautical and apparently seriously disturbed people only add to this their implied vip status it did nothing to curb argyles feelings of resentment for in his estimation based on previous mercifully infrequent contacts with such vips the abbreviation usually stood for virtually incompetent plebs and as for this foursome well what was one to make of them three of them sunbrowned and one pale as a ghost three of them comparatively old men and one little more than a girl or young woman at best three of them caucasian and one as chinese as they come in his looks if not in his accent which was pure eastender london and all of them wont to converse with his or her fellows in a kind of doubletalk as alien as martian to the downtoearth gunnery officer argyle realized that hed been scowling just a moment after the leader of his charges a slightly overweight broadshouldered somewhat lugubriouslooking man called trask gave him a much sharper sideways look and said cant we get in closer than this id like to get down there alongside or whatever and see if we can take a look in through the bridges windows his voice over the headphones was tinny but even so there was a definite bite to it the group of five was standing in the midsection observation bay of a royal navy antisubmarine jetcopter hooked up to a safety rail with the boarding door open in front of them and below the oval door frame the silvery curve of the streamlined starboard pontoon was plainly visible to anyone suffering from vertigo it would seem the ideal launching platform into oblivion trask and his colleagues had been in a great many far more dangerous places however and the height and frequently dizzying motion when the chopper manoeuvred were the least of their concerns we can indeed get down there and alongside or whatever argyle eventually answered in normal circumstances wed even be able to land on her god knows shes big enough but weve already tried that remember and if this really is a new variant strain of the plague he let the sentence taper off shrugged and went on well it isnt a good idea it could be airborne and this choppers fan is disturbing an awful lot of air you dont want to be breathing plague germs do you now trask looked at argyle more closely even penetratingly and there was something in the older mans keen green eyes and in his frown that warned the gunnery officer not to appear too defiant but if argyle couldnt say it he could at least think it get in closer my backside wbat to a fucking plague ship wbat a fucking idiot a virtually incompetent pleb indeed but even as argyle smiled at his own wit again trasks eyes were flashing their singular warning and so youre an expert in these matters are you he cocked his head a little on one side you know all about this plague right i know enough to stand well back from sudden death said argyle stiffening at trasks dry tone his deadpan expression i know that if its killed off an entire shipload of passengers and crew in the few days since the ship sailed from cyprus taking them all out before they could even tell us what was going on and that if a chopper only has to touch down on the deck to cost the lives of a pilot two aircrew and the ships doctor you know nothing trask snapped cutting him off youre merely guessing and youre being deliberately obstructive you dont much care for me and my people and you think that youre wasting your time with us were sightseers sensationseekers thats all and youd much rather be back on invincible in the officers mess with your shipmates than looking after a gaggle of dumb boffins and as for us since we cant possibly achieve anything here wed do best to bugger off home and let the navy handle things their own way right for a moment argyles mouth fell open in astonishment this sudden outburst for all that it was mainly correct seemed to confirm his original opinion but since he was here to cater to these people pander to their needs he gritted his teeth and said let me assure you mr trask that im only dont you go assuring us of anything the girl standing beside trask spoke up narrowing her eyes where she stared into argyles face as intensely as trask himself mr trasks right youve been thinking your nasty pigheaded thoughts all along you consider us highpowered mentally impoverished bureaucrats or something morbid thrillseekers swarming around the mediterranean wholl eventually report back to our bosses in whitehall and make out weve actually done something but at the end of the day itll be you who gets stuck with the job argyle frowned back at her rubbed at his chin awhile finally grinned wonderingly and genuinely both trask and the girl theyd come pretty close actually he answered i was thinking you might be lloyds underwriters or something from mr trasks expression i would have guessed he was calculating his personal losses relaxing a little trask shook his head my future losses possibly and not just mine or lloyds but the worlds so let me straighten you out commander were not the bureaucrats and utter assholes you might think we are but this time around we are the experts yes there was and probably still is a plague here but it didnt originate in china and it isnt what youve been made to believe in broad daylight like this high noon as it were it cant do us any harm the only mistake the navy made which in the circumstances was pretty much understandable even if it wasnt what youd been advised to do was to send in that recce chopper in the twilight after sundown would you care to explain argyle had begun to sense something of the others authority now just looking at this man he knew he wasnt exaggerating waffling or just plain lying yet at the same time he wasnt saying too much either so what the hell was going on here what was it all about you see if you really want me to commit this aircraft placing the pilot your people and myself in danger i really should know what but again trask cut him off no you really shouldnt you see commander even if i were to tell you its doubtful youd believe me and i certainly wouldnt blame you but if or when youve seen something of it for yourself seeing is believing said the girl well in most cases anyway where people arent quite so stiffnecked locked into their own little worlds but at least its encouraging that you are actually beginning to think now and not just snarling away to yourself the commander gave a small start for it was a fact that he had been snarling away to himself getting all hot under the collar and it was also a fact that he was actually beginning to think now which made one too many times that trask and the girl had seen through him but right through him to the core who on earth are you peopleargyle stared at trask then at the girl also at the tall pale man and at the yellow one and began to feel more than a little foolish as he tried to grin and frown at the same time and only succeeded in blinking his confusion the way they looked back at him made him feel very much cut down to size so that again he felt prompted to inquire i mean all i was told is that youre ebranch so what does that make you mindreaders psychics or something or something obviously for the girl only smiled and looked away likewise her colleagues the tall man and the small yellow man both while trask said now maybe youll be so good as to have the pilot take us in closer theres no danger commander not as long as we dont try to alight on this lady and even then not until nightfall the lady trask had referred to was a cruise ship that had beached herself on an unnamed island or more properly a fang of sunbleached rock between the island of ayios evstratios itself little more than a boulder and the popular greek island resort of limnos ten miles to the north except ebranchs best bet was that she hadnt simply run aground in some kind of accident but that shed been wrecked deliberately and it was just possible that the wreckers were still aboard as for a mutating strain of the asiatic bubonic plague that was the cover story certainly but as trask had stated it was a very different kind of plague that he and his party expected to find here they had even dared hope that they might also discover its source here and put an end to it forever what do you think david trask asked the smallest of his colleagues after argyle had ordered the pilot to take them down and in a little closer how does it look to you mindsmog said the other at once his voice taut as piano wire over the headsets the ship is full of it stem to stern this is where they escaped to definitely but i find it doubtful that they themselves are still here its too thin theres no heavy presence or presences that i can detect just a lot a bell of a lot of individual sources not that we can put a great deal of faith in that for it was the same on krassos for a while until we learned what we were doing wrong or what they were doing right ourold friend is good at shielding himself while she i dont need to remind you what she can do still and all i reckon theyve moved on they must surely have known theyd make one hell of a target sitting here so i dont think we need worry so much about them as what theyve left behind trask offered a grim nod of agreement theyre on the run and theyre all through with doing things quietly covertly we hit them in australia krassos london and ruined their plans now theyre deliberately giving us work leaving a trail yes but one of destruction in the full knowledge that while were dealing with problems like this we cant concentrate on tracking them the yellow man whom argyle knew to be called david chung finished it for him yes that sounds about right liz trask glanced at the girl and totally bewildered by their doubletalk argyle looked at her too now that a little of his venom had been drawn that wasnt at all hard to do liz merrick as shed been introduced to him when first the commander met up with these people was maybe fiveseven and about as pert as a girl can get as hed found out the hard way shed be twentysomething she was all curves longlegged and willowwaisted and when she smiled it was like a ray of bright light her green eyes were a very different shade from trasks deep as a beer bottle deep as the sea but her stare could be equally unnerving her hair black as night and cut in a boyish bob had the shine of natural good health to it and argyle suspected that if he had photographs of her in a swimsuit he could earn himself a months salary selling them to hms invincibles crew come to think of it it appeared that at least one member of the crew had already contrived to get to know her a little better she was wearing ships fatigues three sizes too big for her that had never looked nearly this good on any sailor of argyles acquaintance as he was thinking these things the chopper performed a jig in a small thermal and for a moment the beached and apparently derelict pleasure cruiser sidestepped out of view in that same moment liz glanced at argyle and said thats better but now if youll try to keep your mental observations lowkey this is one virtually incompetent pleb whos trying to concentrate argyles jaw fell open dumbfounded he could only stare at her but the shipwreck had swung back into view maybe a hundred feet below and a hundred yards away and as liz focused all of her attention on it her forehead had wrinkled into a deep frown of intense concentration taking one hand from the safety rail she lightly touched her fingertips to her temple forward of her right ear and in the next moment gasped and jerked back on her line as if she had been physically thrust backwards rebounding when the nylon safety line reached full stretch trask caught her arm chung too as she steadied herself and made a wild grab for the safety bar with her free hand she couldnt have fallen anyway but some kind of temporary disorientation had completely thrown her and liz trask said again no longer her superior but more an anxious father figure now as he continued to support her are you okay she took a deep breath and tried a wan smile but under her tan she was visibly paler as if the blood had drained from her face argyle believing he knew what this was said its just motion sickness very much akin to seasickness i see plenty of it shes not used to the rhythm of the chopper thats all trask barely glanced at him then spoke to liz again what was it what did you get people she answered hundreds of them men women and children all of them in shock not knowing whats happened to them but knowing enough not to come out on the decks in the sunlight itll be instinctive by now the filthy stuff in their blood will have done it to them and the terrible craving its already there she offered a small involuntary shudder its horrible ben it makes your skin crawl in the last twentyfour hours theyve all of them infected each other now theyre hungry again soon theyll separate into factions and then and then i know said trask i know a minibloodwar and argyle said hungry people on the ship but you cant possibly know that and anyway you must be wrong this is a big pleasure cruiser and the galley will be full of excellent food its only been a few days and if theres still anyone alive on that vessel theyll most of them will still be alive trask told him if not as we understand life and yes theyd be perfectly capable of surviving on the ships food except theyll be driven to go for something more to their liking most of this had flown right over argyles head not as we understand life he frowned im not sure i understand any of what youre saying you can only mean theyre incurable better off dead something like that trask answered after a moment sighing his resignation but the commander was plainly confused very uncertain now and feeling well out of his depth but i want to get in a whole lot closer trask told him yet again and i do intend to look inside he tapped a fingernail on a pair of binoculars slung around his neck those huge panoramic windows in the bridge will do nicely standing in line hooked up in their safety harnesses from left to right the five were argyle trask liz chung and last but not least the tall pale almost cadaverous figure of a man called ian goodly now the latter spoke up well have to sink her ben according to the charts this rock is only the tip of a steepsided submarine mountain if we were to send her to the bottom here the abyss would finish it for us in fact there is no if or were or would about it though i hate to have to say it thats how its going to be the only way we can ensure that nothing of this ever er resurfaces youve seen it trask said sharply oh yes said the other the shiptoship missiles going in the explosions the stem going up in the air and the rapid slide backwards off those rocks sink her now argyle exploded finally he had had enough of this gobbledegook what youre talking about invincible having to sink her you must be out of your tiny minds you people this is an ultramodern pleasure cruiser and even her lifeboats are worth millions just looking at her im sure she can be refloated then sailed or towed away that is of course after weve made sure shes clean but even if shes too badly holed still the salvage contract alone would be worth nothing said trask nothing is coming off that ship you are fucking crazy argyle exploded again and if you dont mind next time i start a sentence id like to be able to finish it im getting heartily sick of commander the pilots voice sounded in his headphones oh bloody hell yes argyle snapped still glowering his fury at the four the airsea rescue chopper has spotted something starboard of the wreck the pilot came back something someone the other specified a living omuonc still on board and active do you want me to patch you through yes said argyle of course patch us through we may as well all hear whats going on who knows that way i might actually get to learn something too roger said the pilot and ill take us starboard of the wreck so you can see whats happening the airsea rescue helicopter had accompanied them out from the carrier hms invincible where she lay at anchor like a small land mass in her own right on the horizon some five or six miles away starboard of the wreck about the same distance away from her as argyle trask and party were to port now the big rescue chopper sat like a great hawk on the air with the ripples from her down draught spreading out in choppy concentric circles on the surface of the deadcalm sea along with its regular crew the rescue chopper carried two other members of ebranchs contingent a roguish leathery old gypsy by the name of lardis lidesci possibly of hungarian or romanian descent if argyle was any judge of ethnic origins and a young englishman called jake cutter who seemed to stand somewhat apart from the rest of the team as if he wasnt quite one of them like the others he had a very definite attitude but where theirs seemed intense beyond the demands of the situation his was different argyle had spoken to him on first meeting and it had seemed to him that cutter wasnt all there not meaning that he was in any way mentally deficient but just that he appeared very much preoccupied despite that he tried to hide it and while the commander had no way of knowing it hed hit the nail right on the head preoccupied to engross or fill the mind of or to dominate attention thoughts mind etc and so on and therefore from a defining viewpoint jake cutter could be said to be very preoccupied but for the moment at least he was concentrating on what could be seen through his binoculars that tiny human figure on the shielding collar almost a small deck in its own right that protected the upper deck from the hot stench of the ships slipstreamed chimney array a deltashaped set of six massive exhaust flues high over the stern right now however with the engines at a standstill there were no exhaust fumes and the small lonely figure was leaning or propping itself up against an open service hatch in the foremost chimney from which it had emerged only a few seconds ago jake could see now that it was a man but he looked so tattered and dirty in grimy coveralls that at first it had been hard to tell and he was looking up openmouthed at the two helicopters in a kind of stunned disbelief or was he simply in shock mr cutter mr trask is asking to speak to you im patching him through now roger said jake as he leaned out a little from the open hatch to watch the antisubmarine jetcopter come whupwhupping through one hundred and eighty degrees to the starboard side of the wreck giving it a wide berth and in the next moment jake ben trasks harsh gravelly unmistakable voice was sounding in his ears where is he wheres this survivor our side of the exhaust flues jake answered in fact he just a moment ago climbed out of one you should be able to see him by now he looks done in yes we see him said trask but done in by what by his experience or by the sunlight doesnt look like hes shrinking from the sun to me jake answered hes just shrinking on the point of collapse maybe you should let liz take a look at him wait said trask and a few seconds later she says hes in shock hes almost a blank in there his mind shot to pieces so he probably is a survivor i can go down on their rescue gear and get him off there jake suggested or i could do it my way and get him off faster still no trask answered at once keep the continuum as a last resort send down the gear by all means yes but if hes going to make it off that ship it will have to be under his own steam you see that chopper standing idle on the promenade deck i know i know said jake thats what happened the last time someone landed on her they stayed landed right said trask grimly and jake sensed his nod so we wont be making the same mistake if this one really wants off he gets off on his own by the time youve reeled him in lardis will know if hes okay or not if he is okay then its a lucky break not only for him but also for us and if he isnt okay well lardis will be able to handle that too its one hell of a drop back down to the deck or onto those rocks either way it wont make too much difference ben said jake you know this is a rescue chopper dont you i mean the crew heard what you said just then and if you were the captain f suspect youd have a mutiny on your hands yes i know its a rescue chopper trask answered and i also know what we could be dealing with here as do you so for now just you get that gear down to him and then well see what well see and meanwhile commander argyle and i will be taking a shot at looking in through the panoramic windows at the sharp end thats the bridge to you roger and out said jake sourly that boss of yours one of the rescue crew asked jake after the pilot had reverted to an onboard frequency what is he some kind of monster anyone who doesnt know trask or his work jake answered might easily make that mistake but no he isnt a monster he does know an awful lot about monsters though dont ask me to explain more than that because i cant and dont ask us to lower the gear said the other its our job sure and god knows wed like to get that guy off but if hes a carrier his shrug was by no means callous on the contrary if anything it was helpless commander argyle is the only one who can give that kind of order jake looked at him the sailor was a young petty officer a freshfaced twentytwoyearold with fair hair and freckles he was also an expert at his job and he knew the rules only this time he was torn two ways between knowing what hed like to do and knowing the dangers inherent in that course of action it was the difference between his training his duty and natural instinct to save life and the knowledge that the life he wanted to save might be a plaguebearer someone who carried the seeds of death and that was a feeling that jake understood only too well no sweat he said so well simply sit tight here me you and your mates and wait for the order from your commander argyle i understand your position but the order will come i can promise you that so even if we cant lower the gear now still we should have it ready its already ready said the other scathingly on a job like this and once were airborne its always ready whoa said jake ruefully what would i know im just a civilian right the rescue team was made up of three petty officers and as far as they were concerned jake cutter and lardis lidesci were precisely that just civilians alleged experts whod doubtless get in the way at their earliest opportunity as for their boss this trask bloke and co on the antisub hunterkiller well gunnery commander argyle would sort them out for sure the three glanced at each other where they sat hooked up in their safety rigs then looked again at cutter and his gypsyish companion and even though jake wasnt a telepath not in the fullest sense of the word still it wasnt hard to guess what they were thinking if this was what experts in tropical diseases were supposed to look like well it had them beat all to hell jake was wearing a shirt a flying jacket jeans and cowboy boots in fact he looked something of a cowboy to the crew of the airsea rescue chopper longlegged he had narrow hips and a small backside but the rest of him wasnt small he was well over six foot tall maybe sixfour if you included the heels of those boots and had long arms to match his legs his eyes were chestnut brown likewise his hair which he wore swept back and braided into a pigtail his hair wasnt all brown however but had contrasting even startling shocks of white at the temples this was a recent thing a change that had taken place in him almost overnight his face was lean and hollowcheeked and he looked like a week of hms invincibles meals wouldnt do him any harm but on the other hand the extra weight would certainly slow him down and jake cutter looked fast his lips were thin and when he smiled it was hard to make out if there was any real humour in it his jaw was angular and thinly scarred on the left side and his nose had been broken high on the bridge so that it hung like a sheer cliff like the straight strong nose of a native american instead of projecting but despite his lean and hungry look jakes shoulders were broad his chest deep and there was more than enough of strength in him both physical and psychological indeed his mental powers bordered on the metaphysical occasionally crossing those borders into realms that other men had never dreamed of visiting and certainly wouldnt care to as for jakes companion the old lidesci was short barrelbodied and almost simian in the great length of his arms his lank hair once jet black was greying now and in places turning white it framed a leathery weatherbeaten face with a flattened suspicious nose that sat uncomfortably over a mouth that was missing too many teeth as for the ones that hed kept they were uneven and as stained as old ivory but under shaggy and expressive eyebrows lardiss dark brown watchful eyes glittered his minds agilty and defied the everencroaching infirmities of his body and if jake had seemed a little cowboyish in boots jeans and his deliberately contrived casual manner then what was the rescue helicopters crew supposed to make of lardis the lidescis mode of dress was outlandish like a cross between that of a frontiersman out of the old west and a european gypsy of that same era it was all greens browns and greys all tassles and tiny silver bells that jingled when he moved so that the overall impression was that of a total outdoorsman a fighting man and a wanderer in endless woodlands as if to verify all that in a cutaway sheath under his left arm lardis carried a wickedlooking razorsharp machete its timeblackened ironwood grip etched with several rows of notches while the crew had been spending a little time wondering about jake and lardis commander argyle and the larger ebranch contingent aboard the hunterkiller had descended to within thirty feet of the stem of the stranded vessel and were looking through binoculars into the spacious bridge for perhaps thirty seconds jake watched the jetcopter hovering there fanning the air over the stricken ship but then as the aircraft suddenly gained altitude performing a slow spiral up and outward trasks voice was again patched through to the rescue chopper and if anything it was harsher than ever wheres that rescue tackle i want you to get that man off there and i do mean right now fine jake sent back but the crew needs argyles sayso on that ten seconds ticked by and then commander argyles voice stuttering and quite obviously shocked said ggget him off there get that man off that bbloody ship and be bloody quick about it but listen in no matter how long it takes no one is to go down there he has to make it on his own and once again trask saying jake the same rules are in force if he isnt what he would seem to be let lardis handle it his way is that understood only too well said jake over and out the trouble with harry down below on the shielding collar of the exhaust array the rescue bucket had swung to and fro in front of the survivors face half a dozen times without him seeming to notice it but as it finally collided with him almost sending him sprawling he appeared to wake up then looking up at the chopper sixty feet overhead and fending off the bucket and harness as once again it made a swing at him he reached up an imploring hand blinked his eyes and seemed to be trying to say something the winchman directed the pilot on his headset take her down just a few more feet good now hold it steady hold it right there and as the gear clattered down and skittered on the collar jerking this way and that immediately in front of the survivor a second petty officer with a loud hailer called down dont try to grab the bucket or it may haul you off your feet just sit yourself in it your whole body weight and adjust the harness straps then try to sit back and hang on to the chains thatll help you feel secure and dont worry we wont let you fall the bucket was more like one of those aerial chairs that children ride at fairgrounds suspended from four leathersheathed chains it had a back and sides but no legs a webbing harness was fitted to the interior with a safety belt dangling loose and like an aerial chair even a child could see how to use it or should have been able to but the man below was in shock as the bucket danced in front of him now bouncing on the collar now twitching to knee height finally swinging out and away from him he took a dazed stumbling step toward it and tried to grab at it after that it was only sheer good fortune that saved him one more staggering step would have taken him to the rim of the collar some twenty feet above the bridge deck and the rescue tackle might easily have dragged him over the edge but as it happened the chair spun around him struck him behind the knees and scooped him up and slumped in the bucket with his arms and legs dangling loose and likewise the straps of the harness which he hadnt fastened he was winched toward safety or to what would have been safety in any normal or routine rescue situation but even as the gears wound him in and he flopped there with his vacant eyes staring up at his rescuers from a pale dirty slackjawed face so trasks harsh apparently emotionless voice was in the crews ears telling them from now on you do exactly as jake cutter and the old lidesci tell you to do they are acting on my orders on authority conveyed to me by your gunnery commander argyle the man youre bringing up from that ship may or may not be infected with this this terrible disease but the old man called lardis is the worlds foremost expert in such things and he will know in any event his decision and whatever action he takes has my full backing anyone attempting to interfere will not only be liable to severe disciplinary action he may well be placing the lives of your entire crew in jeopardy the rescue crews members glanced at each other but made no comment and the bucket came up within reach of the hatch then lardis yelled across to the man in the bucket you i want you to give me your hand reach out and give it now he leaned out of the hatch on his safety strap and offered a gnarled purpleveined left hand to the survivor the fingers of that hand were heavy with rings of purest silver the man in the bucket looked at lardis then at his hand a flicker of vague recognition passed over his face and his lips formed the word szgany but still his arms continued to hang loose in the down draught and in another moment his eyes had gone vacant again lardis glanced at the three petty officers swing him in a little but carefully and to jake in the event he makes any sudden move tries to jump aboard you know what to do nodding his understanding jake took out a specially modified mm browning automatic from an inside pocket of his flying jacket and cocked it at which the fairhaired freckled petty officer gasped and said what the fuck just do as lardis said jake told him aiming his weapon directly between the eyes of the man in the bucket and without further protest and beginning to understand just how serious this business was beyond any normal course of duty the winchman swung the pulley arm in toward the hatch in that selfsame moment the survivor moved he grabbed hold of the old lidescis hand gave a wild inarticulate cry and babbled something that to jake sounded utterly unintelligible what did he say said jake anxiously what did he say he called me father lardis grunted said hed cried out to me and was glad that id answered his call very complimentary he doesnt seem to be afraid of silver either but were not finished yet using his free hand he took out a small aerosol dispenser that he passed to jake and drawing his machete he said he has my hand this one but if he should squeeze it too hard perhaps with a fiends strength then i shall have his jake leaned out a little on his line showed the dispenser to the man in the bucket and said this shouldnt do you any harm close your eyes and dont breathe for a moment continuing to cling to lardiss hand the man looked to him for reassurance do as he says lardis told him and dangling there on thin air the survivor closed his eyes jake sprayed him in the face a full burst of two or three seconds and nothing happened but the rescue crew wrinkled their noses and again looked at each other what garlic well something that smelled like garlic anyway the man in the bucket opened his eyes took a deep breath didnt seem at all affected and lardis said now the acid test except it isnt acid but blood and without pause he slid the razorsharp blade of his weapon lightly over the back of his own wrist and showing the survivor what hed done the slow drip of his blood into the abyss he said no im not your father but i readily understand why you would cry out to him so perhaps we can be brothers you and i perhaps we already are of a sort szgany you called me aye and youre right so what do you say can we be blood brothers my friend from this worlds socalled old country and doubtless from a long line of szgany forefathers the other said nothing simply watched as jake sprayed the blade of lardiss machete before it descended to the survivors wrist and cut a thin red line there and the freckled petty officer burst out now what kind of fucking voodoo barbarism is this reaching past jake he made to grab at lardis and felt the barrel of jakes gun digging into his ribs and let it be jake warned him through clenched teeth what didnt you hear what trask said man youre under orders but but this is just a very frightened man the crewman protested drawing back just a man aye lardis agreed with a curt nod only a man but a damned lucky one and as he sheathed his machete you can bring him in now meanwhile the survivor had done absolutely nothing he continued to sit there looking unemotionally at his wrist without really seeing anything and if that could be called a reaction it was his only one they swung the rescue tackle in secured it and closed the hatch then gentled the rescued man out of the tangle of chains and webbing he immediately toppled into lardiss arms and the old man fell back with him onto the crews padded bench and sat there cradling him we have him jake told trask on his headset he seems to be okay has he said anything trasks voice had lost something of its sharp edge said anythingjake answered hell no nothing i could understand just looking at him id say he still doesnt believe hes alive well dont let him say anything trask said dont even ask him anything not until were back aboard invincible and we can talk to him in private roger that said jake and to lardis is he okay oh yes the old man answered wonderingly in fact hes already asleep probably for the first time in three days said jake probably aye lardis replied gruffly and certainly for the first time in three long nights aboard the aircraft carrier invincible trasks contingent had bunks next to a large stateroom used for ships orders groups they also had use of the stateroom which was where the medics saw to the survivor on landing however trask had been called to see the captain which meant that he arrived at the stateroom some fifteen minutes later briefly looking inside and on seeing the medics he called his people out into the cramped privacy of the corridor all except lardis who stayed with the survivor and trask was plainly bitter as he told his colleagues we have to go back to the evening star we what said liz very obviously concerned are you saying i missed someone else ben i cant see how thats possible okay i know i overlooked the survivor but in all that horror confusion and mindsmog i mean he was just one small human mind thats if you can call that crawling void a mind but i swear that while he was being rescued i scanned the entire ship stem to stern and this has nothing to do with survivors trask shook his head cutting her off its a safe bet that there arent going to be any more of those but the captains had a request from our minister responsible which of course was relayed to invincible through the admiralty and the admiralty not being quite as diplomatic as our old man has made it an order weve been ordered back to that ship goodly spoke up in his typically highpitched piping voice but why the ships doomed ben ive already seen it going down it will happen i know said trask and weve got to ensure were not on board when it does but thats not the worst of it so what is the worst of it said david chung nervously scowling trask leaned back against a bulkhead scratched his forehead and said as if we havent enough on our hands now theres this and then resignedly people it seems that someone in high places someone who should have known better if not our minister responsible then maybe one of his superiors possibly the prime minister himself has let something of what we did on krassos and what were trying to doing on hms invincible slip that would be bad enough but it seems its slipped all the way to some highprofile boffin at porton down torton down liz frowned then opened her eyes wide and gasped she was plainly shocked jake glanced from face to face and saw the same expression on all of them what he said porton down isnt that some kind of i dont know some kind of research establishment where they mess about with with but there he paused for hed suddenly remembered what they messed about with trask nodded his bleak corroboration yes i suppose its accurate to say they mess about down there in wiltshire for certainly they handle some of the messiest stuff on this small planet were talking about the porton down centre for applied microbiology and research and that same person in high places the bloody idiot has agreed with them that we should get them a sample a sample david chung had backed off a pace a sample of what dont tell me they but i am telling you trask answered and its not only a sample they want but preferably a live one oh if it was up to me ians cruise missiles would be on their way right now and the evening star on her way straight to the bottom but now that the admiraltys involved its no longer up to me if we dont go in and i do have the right to refuse as the message makes plain then the navy will do the job their way but do you think im going to allow that to happen not a snowballs chance in hell said jake fully in the picture now the idea of a thing like that getting loose on a ship of war like invincible it doesnt bear thinking about theres more sheer destructive firepower on this ship than was used in both world wars thats right said trask and a lot more than enough to start world war three so since were the only ones who really understand what were up against were going in said liz with a small shudder but not you said trask not this time but she began to protest no buts about it again trask shook his head determinedly you put ten years on me when vavara got hold of you on krassos and frankly ive no years left to spare anyway this wont be like anything weve ever done before on the australian job most of those vampires we tackled had wamphyri or lieutenant overseers they knew what they were doing likewise on krassos this time the poor creatures well be dealing with are barely thralls not even that for only three days ago they were people holidaying in the med now theyre undead in the med and the ones who changed them are no longer here to offer them any kind of guidance so if we should be attacked en masse it will be a slaughter said jake and itll be us doing the slaughtering well be armed and they wont be well know what were about and theyll still be coming to terms with the unknown the utterly horrific but liz shook her head they know what they are she said oh theyre confused for now terrified as yet but they do know and that hideous hunger is growing in them down there in the dark in the bowels of that ship all eight decks well look like so much fresh meat to them except slaughter isnt our job said trask and we wont be doing it or having it done to us nor will we be going below decks not too far below anyway our job is to get a sample just one and once weve got it and were out of there well call in ians missiles that will be the slaughter i wish you wouldnt call them my missiles said goodly i cant help what i saw cant stop what will be and my god all those people chung shook his head looked small and pale and sick and jake said am i missing something here i thought wed already agreed that we wont do it that we simply cant afford to bring something like that out of there nothing living said trask when were in the air again well tell them we have a sample and they can sink the ship by the time they find out the sample isnt alive itll be too late to do anything about it a dead sample said liz an undead one yes trask stared at her they want infected blood flesh brain tissue thats why theyre asking for jesus an entire specimen a person for gods sake but we wont let them have one oh theyll get what they want but it wont be walking on two legs and it definitely wont be thinking calculating and just waiting for its first opportunity flesh blood brain tissue jake frowned and continued to look puzzled but trask only glanced at him and said no need to concern yourself itll be more work for lardis for where that kind of thing is concerned the old lidesci really is the worlds foremost expert and not only on this world they had been scheduled to go in that evening well before dark it would have been sooner but trasks one stipulation had been that he had to be allowed to speak to the survivor first invincibles medics however had temporarily sedated that one in the hope that sleep would be conducive to recovery used to dealing with physical rather than mental trauma and lacking the guidance of the vessels chief medical officer assumed dead on the star they believed that sleep a universal panacea would be equally effective here perhaps it would be but meanwhile their patient would be out for the next three or four hours after the ebranch members had talked through and finalized details for the coming mission goodly and chung returned to the stateroom trask took liz and jake aside to talk to them in private things seem to be coming to the boil far more quickly than we expected he said and it really does appear that malinari and vavara have thrown caution to the winds as for lord szwart well we dont know about him we cant say for sure whether he was trapped and died below when you destroyed that temple under london he glanced at jake for once appreciatively ungrudgingly or whether he escaped but we do know that these creatures are tenacious beyond any other species the other two well obviously theyre undead and well and until recently were living on that cruise ship or rather on its passengers both of them said jake look i may not be as quick on the uptake as you people but how can we be sure it wasnt just one of them because when we returned to england trask told him our good friend manolis papastamos remained on krassos with his men to prepare the way for our followup team on the other side of the palataki promontory in a bight under the cliffs they found evidence that suggested a boat had been kept there there was a tunnel leading back into that labyrinth under the little palace too that was where vavara was going when we forced her car off the road and into the sea not far from palataki the assumption has to be that she swam the rest of the way or maybe clambered along the base of the sheer cliffs he shrugged and added no easy task not even for a strong man but there you go vavara is wamphyri after all and malinari said jake ian goodly had a close encounter with him under palataki said trask so we know he was definitely there that was just before the fireworks but the point is if ian had time to get out of there and climb to the surface before the dynamite blew that place to hell then so did malinari jake finished it for him correct trask nodded and since he didnt emerge on the surface it looks like he made his way to that cave and escaped by boat along with vavara yes said trask lets face it wamphyri or not it would be damned difficult for just one of these creatures to take over a ship as big as the evening star but both of them together nephran malinari with his powers of mentalism and vavara with her mass hypnotism they could do it all right and they did and when they met with resistance with someone or something or some situation they couldnt control then they resorted to mindless violence said liz and theres nothing so violent as a great vampire as witness the mess they made of that bridge said trask grimly i feel sort of sorry for commander argyle he was just a bit too full of himself until he saw that bridge its as you told him liz seeing is believing now hes on our side i heard him advise the captain to give us carte blanche but that was before the admiralty entered the picture or should we say before porton down came in on it this porton down said jake i mean how is it an outfit like that has so much clout but thats where they found the answer to hiv trask told him its also where they brewed up the antidote to the plague out of china the new asiatic bubonic hell they do good work so maybe im overreacting maybe we should have thought earlier to open this thing up ask for outside help maybe our minister responsible or whoever it was who let the cat out of the bag has done the right thing after all i just dont know god id certainly like to think so said liz with feeling youd think wed be hardened to it by now but i for one never will be frankly id far rather squirt aerosols or fire drugged darts than shoot silver bullets you and me both jake agreed surely anyone would rather cure than kill do you really think so said trask looking morose again perhaps youd like to mention it to the wamphyri huh thatll be the day and then changing the subject but that isnt what i wanted to talk to you about thats something else and it really cant wait its waited too long already i dont know maybe its this porton down thing thats brought it back into focus but it is important that we keep it there whats bothering you said jake actually you are trask answered but then he managed to grin however sardonically no i dont mean in the old way and yet yes perhaps in the old way too okay ill explain you were down there under london with szwart and millie and and we havent been checked out since jake cut in is that it youre worried we might have been infected his voice was suddenly wary thoughtful likewise his narroweyed expression and trask couldnt help but think how much he looked like the necroscope harry keogh in another moment it had passed and he was just jake again except just didnt do it justice for of course jake too was a necroscope and in this world he was the necroscope the only one trask shook his head im worried that the longer we leave it the less i like it he said jake i owe you more than any man should owe anyone and no way can i ever repay you but you have to understand that my concerns my duties go much farther than personal debts loyalties and friendships i am concerned yes for you and for liz your partner for the branch too and all the good people in it but mainly for humanity maybe ive been caught up in this game for too long i cant say but at least ive learned a few halfdecent tricks in my time with ebranch lord ive seen some bad shit so far ive managed to step clear and thats what im trying to do now thats all im trying to do now hold on said jake it seems to me youve missed someone out of these concerns of yours im talking about millie she was down there under london with szwart a lot longer than i was so if youre worried that maybe im a little more than i should be and if thats the case personally i know nothing about it then id suggest you stop worrying about me and check millie out first a cruel thing to say perhaps harsh words but as he spoke them jake deliberately held trasks gaze staring directly into his deep green eyes and ben trask being what he was a human liedetector knew that jake spoke only the truth and straight from the heart if anything had got into jake in that forgotten roman temple deep under london he honestly wasnt aware of it but on the other hand only four days had passed since then and weird things had a habit of getting into jake cutter as for millie cleary the newly discovered love of trasks life millie is being checked out right now he said thats why shes not with us it was my excuse to keep her out of this that she required extra decontamination and a complete physical not that i really needed an excuse millie was in a hell of a state when you brought her up out of there you however as you just a moment ago demonstrated seem in fine fettle at least you think so and anyway i needed you out here with us so lets get to it said jake what is it you require of me whats the bottom line what do you want me to do nothing much trask shrugged perhaps a little uncomfortably just that as soon as were done here and back in london you let us treat you the same as millie let us put you through a one hundred per cent decontamination programme a full medical checkup and and but there he paused and said jake thinking here it comes and that you give us your fullest assistance in trying to help you with with your other problem the one you told me about on our way out here ob hahaaaa hes talking about meeee a loathsome deadspeak voice chuckled in jakes head this idiot believes that he can erase remove or otherwise dispose of me as if i were some kind of mental disorder well im not and he cant and telling him about me was a great error these socalled psychiatrists you told me about can only do you enormous barm aye for as you very well know jake cutter im no figment of your imagination no alter ego no mr hyde playing to your doctor jekyll but as real and as valid as you are the only difference being that while youre alive im dead but very much alive in me said jake and i really dont want or need you and incidentally i note youve accumulated a pretty good knowledge and understanding of this stuff figments of imagination alter egos jekylls and hydes et cetera all from your reading materials korath answered this er sudden penchant of yours for psychologyespecially schizophrenia and the like hah and youve never once suspected that i was reading over your shoulder as it were for the fact is that until i speak to you you simply dont know im there you dont know if im awake or sleeping but in any case theres no way round it im here in your head whether you like it or not jake cutter and neither your mr trask nor all his psychiatric specialists put together can ever change that ob hahaha bastard jake muttered darkly as korath retreated and him again liz inquired quietly him jake growled korath once mindsthrall and believe me i want rid of him just as much as you do well short of prefrontal lobotomy that is trask shook his head that doesnt come into it he said dont even think of it we wouldnt subject you to anything of that sort but if we can find a way to shift this this personal demon of yours he says you cant said jake and he makes a very valid point he isnt something i just dreamed up hes no figment of my own imagination he was a lieutenant of the wamphyri one of malinaris creatures and he was almost ready to ascend thats probably why malinari wanted rid of him and rammed him headlong into that pipe under the romanian refuge christ what a way to die but harry keogh and i we talked to him there and learned the histories of the wamphyri well of vavara and malinari anyway but that was a mistake trask nodded for even dead vampires are dangerous to such as you thats right said jake ruefully when theyre alive or undead if you prefer you cant have physical contact with them they radiate corruption like some kind of ultimate contaminant like plutonium so that even their presence is poisonous and when theyre dead you darent even talk to them i couldnt anyway said trask wonderingly as always at a loss in this kind of conversation still unable to fully accept the concept of a necroscope and i shouldnt have said jake but that wasnt my idea it was harry who put me up to it but did he do it deliberately liz wanted to know if so it might bear out bens earlier concerns that its harrys dark side that may be influencing you jake shook his head no and perhaps put me up to it was a bad choice of words he suggested it yes but only because he wanted to find out about our invaders and who better to get it from than one of their own it was for my protection and it was my mistake in fact it was harry who warned me never to let a vampire into my mind damn good advice but when harry wasnt there then korath persuaded me otherwise with such as him the word devious takes on a whole new level of meaning youre satisfied then said trask that what the necroscope gave you was for the general good for your good and the worlds both for my goodjake lifted an eyebrow well i cant say i entirely agree with that but lets face it you me liz all of us without it wed have been dead for quite some time now out there in australia thats true said trask and its also true that for all i hate korath and want rid of the bastard jake went on still he played his part in all of that trask nodded and said but for his own ends as youve now discovered best to get it straight in your head son vampires dont do anything for nothing except maybe kill they dont need a reason for that it just happens as the mood takes them what im saying is korath wasnt doing us any favours i know said jake to save me he had to save all of us but im the one he really cares about that is im the one he needs without me hes nothing just a bunch of polished bones circulating in black water in a nightdark sump in some burnedout godforsaken romanian sinkhole yes trask agreed but whatever else you do dont ever go feeling sorry for him which takes us back to where we started you said you want rid of him and so do we all are you willing to let the best specialists we can find have a look at you im not talking about quacks but people like grahame mcgilchrist who you met in australia back home in london we have some of the best in the world whatever you say jake answered just as long as theyre not going to slice my brain open i dont really care and yes ill help all i can but i know that whatever we do korath will fight me all the way hes fighting for his life after all trask nodded and said then thats it were all done for now we can join the others see how our survivor is doing not so fast said jake taking trask by the arm before he could turn away were not done yet for a moment trask stood stock still frozen there staring fixedly at jakes hand on his arm then he sighed relaxed and said very well i gave you my word after youd saved millies life and a promise is a promise what is it you want to know but with a heartfelt sigh of her own liz spoke before jake and said well thank goodness for that and not before time jake stared at her then at trask and said just look at you you know dont you i mean both of you all of you know even before ive asked my question okay what is it that you havent dared to tell me about harry whats this down you have on him a down on harry trask offered a wry smile and shook his head no such thing jake i was one of the last people to see him in this world i watched him leave this world by a route you havent discovered yet and while it was my duty while i had every right to stop him i didnt even try but let him go you let him go jake frowned and did a double take shaking his head he looked from trask to liz and back again what are you talking about you let him go he was ebranchs greatest hero or so ive been led to believe yet you make it sound as if he were a criminal almost as if he were some kind of of as he stumbled to a pause so jakes frown fell away and his eyes went wide some kind of vampire said trask questioningly the answer is yes and believe me i do mean some kind of vampire the most powerful ever harry keogh necroscope but he was also wamphyri jake wamphyril thats right liz nodded and now you understand why ben didnt tell you because youre too valuable and he didnt want to scare you off didnt want to lose you yes harry keogh was a hero and yes he almost singlehandedly won the first battle that ebranch ever fought against vampires me i wasnt around then but ive read up on it when we get back to london there are some files youll want to read up on too now jake still couldnt take it in but harry a vampire right at the end of his time here yes said trask hed got too close to them and let them get too close to him he was wamphyri but he made me a promise and he kept it and he carried on the fight in starside ask lardis lidesci about it hes been biding his time just waiting to tell you youre telling me jake felt his adams apple bobbing up and down that the man ghost thing or whatever who gave me my powers deadspeak and the mobius continuum was the revenant of a vampire and now perhaps you can understand my concern said trask you see all of harrys life was like a tragedy especially at the end and the trouble is it didnt stop with him even while he was winning it seemed like everything around him was turning to so much shit nathan kiklu or perhaps its easier to think of him as nathan keogh one of harrys sons in sunsidestarside finally redeemed him which is to say nathan put right most of the things that had turned sour for harry he squared it for him with both the living and the dead alike his sons yes said jake with a snap of his fingers i remember now the bits that were missing from those first files i read the ones that youd had doctored especially for me the material that was missing was about harrys sons because its like liz told you trask answered i didnt want to lose you letting you know about nathan was okay but i certainly couldnt tell you about the others the others jake was frowning again harrys other sons you mean trask nodded you see jake even after harry died on starside the curse remained both harry jr and nestor kiklu too nathans twin brother they both of them were vampires jake knew it was so and his hollow face turned really pale now they became wamphyri trask told him maybe it was sheer bad luck the curse call it fate or whatever you will butand not knowing what else to say he shrugged and fell silent and in a little while feeling obliged to pick it up where trask had left off jake said but now theres jake cutter a necroscope in his own right harrys heir apparent with some weird leftover of the original lodged in him not to mention a nightmarish thing called korath mindsthrall and jake has got himself involved in killing vampires too it all sounds just a little bit familiar right so what is it youre trying to say what like history is repeating itself or something not this time jake said liz moving closer and reaching out to him no way not if we have anything to say about it thats why youve got to accept bens help and in turn give us your assistance with those tests back in london thats it said trask end of story now you know almost everything and anything you dont know just ask and ill tell you right now if you like or do you need some time to think about it first jake thought about it then took a very deep breath before answering yes i have a question how soon are we going back to london the survivors story after checking that the evening stars lone survivor was sleeping comfortably and apparently well at least physically if not yet psychologically trask and his team used the extra time to get their own heads down while the journey out from london to hms invincible hadnt taken very long still it had been fairly intense a whirlwind rush from one point of departure to the next first theyd been airlifted by helicopter from the roof of the hotel that housed ebranch hq and flown to gatwick airport then a private jet courtesy of the ministry of defence had flown them to kavala a military airport on the greek mainland just a few miles north of the aegean coast and finally a jetcopter from hms invincible had sped them to the aircraft carrier herself thus the droning sound of engines was still in their ears and similarly a dizzying and debilitating kaleidoscope of scenery and tilting ocean views all fusing into one in their memories the overall result was a feeling of exhaustion and the dull neardistant heartbeat of invincibles engines at standby that came throbbing through the bulkheads was a lullaby by comparison trask was roused at hours and was handed a communication from the minister responsible relayed through admiralty channels and encrypted by them the message had been unscrambled in invincibles radio room so that trask was able to read mr trask lifeboat serial number ms has been discovered by fishermen scuttled in shallow waters off rodosto in the sea of marmara it would appear that after leaving greek waters she passed through the dardanelles at night without lights was stopped by a patrol boat which she somehow managed to set on fire and sink leaving no survivors and from then on played a catandmouse game with various turkish patrol vessels until they lost her in a sea fret off gallipoli understandably the turkish authorities are somewhat miffed especially in the light of the current heightened tension between greece and turkey so you cant expect any help from them therefore any inquiries concerning the boat or the ones who commandeered her will have to be of a covert nature suggestion collect the pd sample asap return to base then fly to istanbul using the same routine you employed in krassos ie go in as tourists there are no restrictions on british tourists in turkey at this time ill arrange your flight for you after that i assume your next port of call will be rodosto anything you need in advance let me know and ill have it waiting for you at your hq min res trask read the message again and scribbled underneath it speak to my people have bernie fletcher and a pair of minders go out there now tonight as our advance party make sure they have lots of turkish lira then he returned it for onward transmission to the cpo who had delivered it the survivor was awake but groggy shivering and still very frightened the medics had cleaned him up draped him in warm blankets and were pouring coffee into him when trask and co went in to see him in the stateroom coffee trask asked in an aside to one of the medics because he asked for it the other shrugged and has he asked for anything else or said anything nothing as yet then you can leave him with us trask dismissed them and closed the door after them lardis had been with the survivor all along but still he looked fresh as a daisy why dont you try to get some sleep trask asked him taking him to one side dont need it came the gruff reply sunside days are long ones im used to long hours but when i sleep then i really do sleep because sunside nights are long ones too anyway i wanted to stay with him i feel a kind of kinship oh aye lardis nodded this one unless im much mistaken is from your socalled old country romania szgany too by his looks besides he seems taken with me if anyone is going to be able to talk to him itll probably be me so seeing him frightened out of his wits i decided to be close to hand when he woke up ive seen people like him before on sunside after the wamphyri raided they usually needed gentling along for a while and so might he so can we talk to him at all now lets find out said lardis the pair approached the survivor where he sat in his blankets and the other ebranch people made way for them do you remember me lardis asked him i was there when they got you off that floating town the other nodded i called you father he answered but i didnt mean my father when i was a boy we always called the clan elder father while he spoke trask looked him over from what could be seen of him under the blankets he was lanky and even bony his high forehead and penetrating dark eyes signalled his intelligence but those same eyes also gave him away along with his wolfish looks ravenblack hair and light brown largepored skin they more than hinted at his origins youre from romania right said lardis but it was more a statement than a question a gypsy perhaps was said the other but when i was young my mother got married to a greek from rhodes so i was brought up on rhodes in the village of lindos we eventually moved to cyprus and i got work as a deckhand on the cruise ships at which point trask came in with may i speak to you the other looked uneasy but shrugged his acquiescence if you like you speak good english said trask from school the tourists and and the ships he gave a small shudder i also speak greek and romanian i even remember a little of the old secret tongue szgany my name is trask trask told him and my friend here is called lardis lardis knows the myths of the old country some of which arent myths at all i believe you know them too we think thats probably why youre still alive the survivors shudders were coming faster now his entire body was beginning to shake under the blankets lardis touched trasks shoulder indicating that he wanted to take over with a nod of his head trask agreed and forget about all that for now and tell me your name the old lidesci said for as you can see youre with friends now and youre safe no one is safe the other gabbled you didnt see you didnt hear you didnt smell it but the whole ship smelled of it i saw heard smelled it and i knew right from the time we took them on board i knew but i didnt speak i he paused began to blink rapidly and uncontrollably and gave a start when lardis placed a gnarled hand on his shoulder but then he calmed down and was able to continue as for my name its nicolae rusu i go by my real fathers name his blood is my blessing it most certainly has been said lardis for without it youd never have known and you wouldnt be here talking to us now and i understand why you told no one they wouldnt have believed and you werent quite ready to believe yourself now listen carefully nicolae rusu these people here with me are experts in such matters they know and understand such things that ship the evening star is a ship of death you know what happened and weve come here to take our revenge but we have to know the whole story else we wont know what were up against you are the only witness but i dont want to remember the survivor was shivering again i was i was trying to forget when you rescued me i know said lardis i understand but tell me now do you want it to happen again to others for you can be sure it will nicolae if we dont stop it call me call me nick said the other and in another feverish burst you cant stop it you cant stop them i saw them and no one can stop them easy easy said lardis and in a moment can you give them a name perhaps do you know what we call them the survivors eyes went this way and that do you really believe he said or is it that you think im crazy you were crazy with fear lardis answered for a little while at least but youre safe now and sane yes we believe and more than that we do what i said we do we hunt such creatures to destroy them wampir said the other then but so low they could barely hear him or obour the terror by night the thing that drinks blood vampires but no one ever dreamed of such vampires as these and wamphyri said lardis aye we know so then will you tell us your story nick how you survived your ordeal and what what happened to the others yes nicolae rusu nodded yes if only to get it out of my system and then i want to go away from here and away from cruise ships back to cyprus or rhodes or maybe farther still far far away i was doing some cleaningup on the cabaret deck near the prow when purser galliard called down to me to meet him starboard on b deck but in fact i met him in the lift on the way down he had got hold of three stewards and a loud hailer and seemed very excited by the time we got down onto b deck thats inside the ship you understand not quite the basement but just above the plimsoll line the star was just about dead in the water and that was when they opened the forard gang a large watertight hatch for lowlevel loading it forms steps when you let it down allowing access from the docks or in this case permitting a rescue the becalmed boat just a boat which should never have been out there in midocean was a thirteenfoot greek caique with a wide black canopy there were two people aboard her when i saw the man at first glance just looking at him as he stepped from the caique to the gangway i took fright he was tall and dark he could even have been one of my people but something told me he wasnt it was like as if my blood was running cold inside me and i knew right there and then that we were in trouble but what could i do or say we cant let this man come aboard ridiculous of course they would have thought i was mad i myself believed that i must be out of sorts ill feverish or something i felt sick and so very very scared and that was even before i saw how his hand shimmered seeming to smoke when the sunlight fell on it but after that why i could even feel the evil it was as if every atom of my body knew that this was wrong that be was wrong and then i saw her that shecreature i cant remember exactly how it was my mind was whirling but her terrible companion helped her and purser galliard lifted her up and they were aboard she was wrapped like a mummy all covered against the sun yet still i saw that she was beautiful and knew that she wasnt it must have been my szgany blood something out of the dark past like a strange memory of times ive never known but it was as if i could see through her tatters to the tbing beneath them and she was ancient and ugly and terrifying perhaps i looked sick i cant remember in any case once they were aboard purser galliard released me told me to return to whatever i had been doing but in fact i hurried in search of a place to be ill sick to my stomach i threw up and it had all been so weird so inexplicable that i still thought i was actually ill that something id eaten hadnt agreed with me when all it was all it really was was sheer terror but of what anyway after my head stopped spinning i knew i must speak to someone i didnt know what i would say but i must at least try to explain it to someone maybe to the captain to captain geoff anderson who was an understanding man i knew i couldnt talk of it to the other deckhands who would only laugh at me or to the stewards who would probably just brush it aside but the captain himself well he was understanding and patient hed know what to do what to say to me and how to reassure me and if there was something wrong with me hed know what to do about that too i went to the bridge oh god i would have gone to the bridge i almost went to the bridge but it had already bbbegun no no just wait a minute give me a chance and it will pass it will be okay there so then i went up onto the bridge deck the place seemed very quiet but wed had a big night and the people werent up yet it was still fairly early in the morning and and god god im avoiding it and i cant help it okay im okay i can do this in the crewonly area the gangway that leads to the door to the bridge purser galliard and two of the stewards were on the floor in pools of their own blood the pursers face was a nightmare ill see as long as i live his eyes were hanging on his cheeks hanging loose there on threads of gristle and their sockets were black and streaming blood galliards ears too with curtains of blood and brain fluid dripping down onto his shoulders he was twitching twitching his last i would guess but as for the stewards well even though they were obviously dead i mean no one who looks as bad as pale as drained as that can possibly be alive still they were moving jerking and moaning their arms and legs twitching as if they were asleep and nightmaring nightmaring yes well i certainly was but i was awake yet i hoped and prayed i wasnt and the door to the bridge had been shattered and there was blood on the glass blood everywhere and and i could hear sounds cries screams sounds of violence destruction from the bridge and i knew then that i wasnt ever going to speak to captain anderson or to anyone on that bridge i got out of there i ran oh i admit it ran aimlessly out through a hatch and onto the outer deck down below people were running about shouting about an accident but i saw blood on the rail and knew that it hadnt been an accident somewhere along the way i bumped into two stewards and tried to tell them what had happened trouble on the bridge purser galliard was dead also two or possibly three stewards and creatures were aboard and ravening but they only heard half of what i said before they went running off to see what was going on i called after them to get guns arm themselves but they werent listening instead they told me to go with them i pretended to follow them but as soon as they turned out of sight i was gone in the other direction later i found myself in my bunk locked in but you know the doors are so flimsy i couldnt stay there and every so often i thought i could hear screaming i had told the stewards to get guns now i thought maybe i should arm myself i knew that there was a smallarms locker in the pursers cabin on the main deck i didnt have the key he would have that poor purser galliard or purser bill as we had used to call him and i couldnt go back for it anyway this was hardly the time to be worrying about keys a fire axe would do just as well my bunk was on b deck down in the guts of the ship so i had to go up two decks to get to the main deck and the pursers cabin it seemed to me that the safest easiest quickest route would be by lift the star is a huge ship it was unlikely that i would that i would come up against anything unpleasant on the way i mean out of all the passengers and crew on that big ship there were only two of of them when i left my cabin people were still moving around nice and normal on b deck i got in the lift with a family of four on their way to a late breakfast in the glory of knossos dining room also on the main deck they were all excited full of the thrills of the cruise looking forward to all the onboard activities theyd planned for the day ahead and all i wanted to do was scream at them that there wasnt going to be a day ahead not for them and probably not for anybody we got out of the lift forard and the pursers cabin was amidships past the hotel managers office and gift shops there was a lot of shouting going on that way and these two children a boy and a girl wanted to see what all of the noise was about i called them back to their mother and father but they wouldnt come they were just just little kids so then i told their parents go and get them and get out on the open decks in the sunlight keep them safe they looked at me as if i was weird and i realized how i must look all trembling and and wild they went after their kids but far too slowly and by then the shouting had stopped other people were on the move now some were running many seemed dazed disbelieving and then from the pursers office the screaming started oh god the screaming i passed a steward who i knew he was sitting on the floor with his legs stretched out and his back against a bulkhead he didnt seem to see me i went to offer help but he didnt want any he just looked right through me and brushed my hand aside then i noticed how pale he was and the twin trails of blood on his neck and those poisonous punctures like craters where hed been bitten the kids parents had seen him too and now they began to call out for their little ones running after them other people were down on the deck many unconscious while some just sprawled there i saw at least a dozen like that and then the screaming stopped again but finally these nice people chasing their kids reached the pursers cabin more a kind of storeroom than a cabin proper with plenty of open deck outside under a fancy railtorail canopy and there outside the cabin it was a strange and very terrible thing i was standing well back from it but i could feel all the lure of it like a magnet dragging at me it was the woman no i cant call that tbing a woman the female creature and she was surrounded by a ring of maybe ten or twelve men women and children alike but they werent attacking her on the contrary they were just standing there while she stepped among them and again she looked beautiful and again i knew that she wasnt at all beautiful that she was in fact a monster she was covered in a radiant haze outlined in a dazzling corona like the sun in an eclipse it was her disguise i knew she stroked the men touched their faces then bit them i saw those terrible jaws like mantraps they were mantraps and each time she struck the blood would spurt spattering her face and neck with crimson and god how she drank it in soaking it up like a sponge then like men in a trance her victims would stagger away stumbling and going weak at the knees until they gradually collapsed to the deck they were so obviously fascinated enthralled by her lying charms and each time a man fell another would step forward to take his place the women too they couldnt resist her they would reach out touch her awful body go to their knees before her as that loathsome tbing nipped at their necks dribbling blood from her mouth down into theirs one of them was a very lovely girl her husband i suppose he was her husband seemed uncertain he wasnt as hypnotized as the rest protesting he tried to push the monster away the shething took something from her robe a sharp knife shaped like a sickle and with a single stroke that was so fast i didnt even see it just a blur of something that glinted and was gone she struck after that nothing seemed to have changed but as the young man began to protest again even as he opened his mouth a great gush of blood came out and his throat opened from ear to ear as he collapsed to the deck but the most terrible thing was this that his wife didnt even see what had happened and while she fondled the monsters loose paps through her rags so she in turn was deeply bitten and the children the children they were all enraptured smiles where they gazed upon this beautiful creature even as she murdered or forever changed their parents before turning on them which included the family i had come up with in the lift they went the same way yes as the female was finishing with those shed hypnotized for surely it could only be hypnotism so the male came striding out of the pursers cabin he was carrying the arms locker a heavy metal trunk that he handled like a small suitcase and that was when the two stewards who i had spoken to earlier came on the scene theyd obviously seen something of what id tried to tell them and had followed the trail to its source they had fire axes and when they saw what was happening all the bloody mayhem then with cries of outrage and horror they came on and hurled themselves at the vampires the monsters didnt see them until the last moment but as the male creature reached the ships rail with the arms locker and hoisted it up to throw it overboard so one of the stewards swung at him with his fire axe the creature saw him flung the locker over the rail and made to step aside the way he moved his motions were like quicksilver but lightning fast as he was and so fluid in his actions still the pick end of the axe went home through his trousers and into his left buttock just above the thigh it went all the way home right up to the haft the sheer agony that would have caused any other man would surely have been enough to bring him down but this one reached over his shoulder backhanded the steward and knocked him away and all he said was ah ahh ahhhh as he drew the axe out but i saw his face the way his jaws extended and the way his teeth sprouted into scythes his colour turned to lead and his eyes were afire as he swung that axe in an arc driving it into the stewards forehead it got stuck there lodged in his head his skull and the steward dangling his arms and legs jerking and kicking like those of a frenzied puppet as this creature lifted him fire axe and all over the rail and let him fall as for the other steward rushing headlong at the female he had entered her hypnotic zone penetrating the haze she wore all about her his axe was raised overhead but already she had him frozen there solid as a statue his mouth had fallen open then his stomach fell open too as she laughed at him and used her knife to cut through his shirt and the tight muscles of his belly from right to left across his navel he made no outcry said nothing did nothing but simply dropped the fire axe to clatter on the redslimed deck and in the next moment with an upward sweep of her arm shed cut him again from his crotch to his navel so that his belly opened up in twin triangular flaps and uncoiled his guts onto the deck and i ran away ran and ran down to my bunk and out of there to a storage room with a steel door then out of there and down through a trapdoor into the bilges where i huddled against the iron plates of the ship and there i stayed with the rats and the diesel stench for hours and hours until i think i fell asleep or it could be that my mind was numb and totally insensible to everything around me eventually i came to my senses or perhaps not not quite for my senses like my manhood had deserted me but as for what had brought me round i think it was the insistent pounding of the engines or more probably the sudden shock that had jolted me as they ground to a shuddering halt i found myself slammed this way and that in the dark belly of the ship until at last there was no motion at all not even the gentle wash of aegean waters against the hull still i was certain that the engines had been working and i knew that id felt the ship in motion so what was this this silence this stillness i thought i dared to hope that it was over and those creatures were dead perhaps the rest of the crew had got themselves together and gone at the monsters in a body to finish them and now the star had limped into some port or other it had to be at least possible but still i was quiet as a mouse as i left my hideyhole crept up through the trapdoor onto b decks gangway then up through the aft service ladders and hatches to the performers changing rooms in the rear of the all that jazz show bar finally onto the stage where i peered through the drawn curtains into the room itself at the aisles the bars and the seating area but there was no band no entertainers no bar stewards at their stations and no audience the lighting was as low as it would be during a show but the place seemed completely empty except i thought i could hear a low moaning a faint cry for help perhaps and a frightened timidsounding sobbing and i thought maybe its someone like me someone who has seen heard taken flight and gone into hiding here and in the gloom i sought him out and i found him yes the show bars master of ceremonies a black american he was sitting at a table all alone just sitting there in top hat and tails his cab calloway outfit with his head down on his chest and a bottle of champagne cooling in a bucket of ice on the table in front of him he seemed to be wearing a necklace of rubies which patterned his starched white shirt and matched his crimson cummerbund but as i moved closer i saw that they werent rubies they were clots of blood that had dribbled from the punctures in his neck he gives and he takes he halfsobbed when he sensed me standing there and looked up what i answered what are you saying thats what he said to me he went on he said i take to make me strong and i give to make you strong my essence is powerful and will soon work on you so dont fight it for from now on you are mine and belong to malinari so now im waiting for him to come back for hes the only one who can help me and tell me what to do then he began to sob again but id seen his eyes and they had a faint yellowish glow in the gloom i made to move away but he gripped my wrist and said do you know i think this champagne is off here try a glass and be so good as to tell me what you think he slopped a glass of champagne for me and i used my free hand to sip at it for i didnt know what else to do and then i told him it seems fine to me but i have to go now go he said but no no you mustnt its so very cold and lonely here i am cold and you are so strangely warm but i must go i said and i said you mustnt he answered and again i saw the greenishyellow glow of his eyes and of course i knew then i snatched myself away from him and when he came to his feet i smashed the champagne bottle over his head he at once sat down again so heavily that the chair fell apart under his weight sending him crashing to the floor i didnt wait to see what he would do then but was off and away from that place up through the secret ways that only a deckhand knows to what i prayed would be the clean sunlit upper decks but when i got there oh god it was evening and night coming in fast give me a moment and ill go on but you know i think maybe im getting used to the idea now that these memories will stay with me for ever so sharing them with you perhaps thats as good a way as any of relieving myself of some of the burden it sounds cowardly i know but if thats the way it is then so be it i may be a coward but at least im a live coward at least im not not undead it was evening yes so obviously i had indeed been asleep or in deep shock for quite some time at least eight hours but now the last rays of the sun were falling slantingly on the upper decks and apart from that it was as if nothing had happened there was no sign of trouble no trace of blood but then of course there wouldt be for these decks had been awash with brilliant mediterranean sunlight from early morning until until now now all that remained were those last few slanting beams and the air was that much cooler in a breeze from the north as for having docked or run aground oh yes we had run aground but not on any island worth mentioning it was barely a rock and the star was stuck fast on it there was no way i could get off the ship not if i intended to go anywhere and no easy way back to civilization and and humanity but then i heard commanding voices and the sounds of mechanical activity forard the creaking of booms as they took the strain and a rattling of chains id heard these soundsbefore during ships drills someone a group of people was trying to launch a lifeboat which could only mean one thing at least a handful of crew members had survived and were now attempting to get off the star before sundown at that point i might easily have made a dreadful mistake but something warned me to remain vigilant so instead of rushing to declare myself i took off my shoes and disposed of them over the side and keeping to the shadows crept silently toward the activity i was on the bridge deck open both port and starboard where the lifeboats lined the deck to starboard the sun was a golden blister sinking in the sea portside all was now in shade the two forard boats were small launches fairly powerful vessels each capable of towing a string of lesser boats behind them the portside launch was being lowered its lights were on and i could see people inside as it slipped down out of view i knew these people they were all women and i shivered as i remembered who they were an exotic dance troupe called the belles from brazil but in several of their more outrageous routines they were also known as vals vamps and the thing was they were all wearing exactly the same enthralled expression dazed staringeyed and zombielike down below the rocks were like dark fangs jutting up from the calm sea but directly below the launch was a deep natural channel and as the winch turned and the launch settled down to the water again i heard that commanding voice but this time i knew it didnt belong to any crew member it wasnt the kind of voice you would expect to hear on a daily basis but it was the kind i hope never to hear again not on any day ever you have done well it said and it was deep oily purring yet in no way catlike it was a low rumble but one that i felt was volatile which might erupt at any moment into lunatic laughter or a menacing snarl of fury youve done well and your payment will be good it continued well depending how well you can hunt that is for you all know what you are now what you are rapidly becoming among my kind my bite is virulent above all others er mine and my lady companions and we have given much of what we are into making you what you are but for every one of you whom weve recruited we know there are many others hidden away who have not felt our bite for quite apart from the task being too great in so short a period of time even for great vampires such as we are still it was a deliberate omission we have left them for you at that a sigh went up or perhaps it was a gasp of denial or horror i crept closer until i could see everyone who stood there in the launchs now vacant stowage bay the male and female creatures of course they had their backs to me for which i was grateful and the rest of the small crowd who were all who had all been crew members stewards and deckhands even an officer or two their faces formed a pool of greenishyellow fire feral in the failing light and ah ah said the male creature whats this did i hear a complaint do some among you think to deny the newfound fever in their veins the ravening of their lust let me assure you it is undeniable you are not yet undead for youve never been dead but you are vampire thralls and believe me the urge will grow blossom bloat you can fight it and fail you will weaken and others will take advantage of you better if you welcome it and enjoy enjoy it aye revel in it while yet you may again that groan went up but the male creature ignored it and went on for while you hunt aboard this vessel the many hundreds who arc shivering in their rooms or hidden away in other places men will come who in their turn will hunt you they may be on their way even now you are doomed each and every one so what little time you have left put it to good use and then the female spoke up and hers was the ugly croaking voice of a hag to good use no never that not at all put it to whatever use pleases you there are women and virgin girls aboard this vessel plenty of them you men are now vampires with all the ferocious lust and every carnal desire that goes with it all that was forbidden its yours for the taking at last you are the masters of your own desires if not your puny destinies we go now the male nodded this ship this place this ohsoshort time is yours do what you will with it with which he and the female thing turned from the throng stepped easily up onto the rail with a sure balance that defied all human skills and leaped outward to the hawsers holding the launch in position and dressed in dark jewelled finery stolen from the onboard stores for a moment they clung there looking back at the changeling crew and their eyes were red as warning lamps in the deepening gloom then looking for all the world like great bats they descended their fine clothes wafting about them as they seemed to float effortlessly down out of sight a minute or so more and the hawsers slackened off as down below the launchs engines coughed into life then the double handful of excrew members fledgling vampires now looked at each other saying nothing but their eyes continued to flare with that feral light and in a little while they began to lope away into the fastfalling darkness some of them came in my direction where i hid just inside a hatch as for myself i need hardly add that i didnt wait to see what they would do or if i could reason with them but fled the other way aft and starboard i went to the last faint glimmer of daylight and what little remained of sanity undead in the med nicolae rusu had fallen silent his eyes staring blankly into the neardistant past at terrible scenes he would never be able to forget trask supposed so anyway and let him stay that way for a minute or two but time wasnt on trasks side and in a little while he said look nick we understand how difficult this must be for you but there are things we need to know were going back to that ship in an hour or sos time and we the other started back into awareness a tic jerking the flesh at the corner of his mouth as his eyes suddenly focused on trask did you say we are going back no he gave a wild shake of his headno you may be going back but i am going to find a place to hide until were under way and gone from here he gripped trasks arm and tried to rise but lardis held him down just you hold still son the old lidesci told him then he didnt mean you youre not going anywhere i reckon youve seen enough of that ship to last a good many lifetimes but the fact is we have to go back its our duty theres something we have to do before we sink her sink her rusu looked at him really the the evening star all the way to the bottom lardis nodded and every poor bloodsucking bastard aboard her but then why go back rusu was logical at least why not just do it it would be a mercy to everyone on board lardis looked at trask but trask couldnt tell nick rusu the real reason rusu had more than enough things to nightmare about already and so we have to be sure there are no more survivors he lied and that came hard to him even though it was a white lie for to trask the truth was allimportant if it was you you wouldnt want to have been left stranded on that ship would you god no the other shuddered long and uncontrollably and then gripping trasks arm more tightly yet but listen i was stranded on that ship and im telling you there are definitely no more survivors take my word for it theyre all gone trask nodded and said you know that dont you nick you know it because you saw everything not everything the other shook his head but enough be as brief as you want to be then said trask but tell us about it but its all a jumble rusu protested a whirling tangle of terrible images three nights of hell like an endless nightmare of blood and terror what if i ask you specific questions said trask do you think you could handle that we really do need your help rusu released trasks arm lay back again said ask away and if i know the answers ill ill try to tell you what about the other lifeboats said trask initially i mean in the beginning when malinari and vavara creatures we call great vampires after theyd left during that first night and the following day surely there were other survivors perhaps even other crew members how come you or they didnt try to launch another lifeboat rusu nodded i know what you mean i thought about it too i even tried it or would have if it had been at all possible trask frowned it wasnt possible but surely on a modern ship like that it cant be too difficult to launch a lifeboat that would defeat the whole purpose rusu gave a weak laugh and said they defeated the purpose those damned what great vampires dont ask me why they did it it could only have been for some perverse reason of their own perhaps to ensure that everyone on that ship was doomed but they fixed the lifeboats every damned one of them fixed them trask repeated his words you mean they sabotaged them before leaving would you care to tell us about it maybe his attitude was too casual maybe he was hardened to this kind of thing and too unsympathetic whichever rusus reaction was violent no he snarled i wouldnt care to tell anyone about it jesus christ god almighty havent i said i dont even want to think about it but as once more he tried to rise so lardis lidesci continued to hold him down saying best to get it out of your system nick you have blood of the old people in you my people an older race than you could ever imagine in a world you could scarcely believe and that will see you through but if you try to keep these memories all bottled up inside keep them to yourself he shook his head theyll only do you harm and now rusu gripped lardiss arms staring deeply into his eyes i i trust you father he said and i believe you so very well ill try and in a little while he continued that first night wasnt so bad i mean it was bad but it wasnt the worst they were still fighting that is fighting what was happening to them not fighting each other not yet and while a few were hunting others hadnt quite succumbed and were still trying to protect their loved ones later my god later theyd be converting their loved ones but it hadnt come to that just yet as for the lifeboats you saw the star the way shed brought up on those rocks that little island i believe it was done that way intentionally so that thered be no chance of getting off her once shed run aground and it was just their good fortune that they could get away in that one launch but no theres no sense in that and it seems far more likely it wasnt so much luck as planned that way as for the rest of the lifeboats apart from a handful at the stern end what good would it have been to lower them onto rocks and the situation was such that even if it could have been done there was no way we could carry a boat over that moonscape to the water ill explain the we later but the rocks well you saw them they were jagged with deep fissures over a sandy beach yes it would be possible but no way a halfdozen men could manhandle a heavy boat across even twenty or thirty feet of terrain like that when i saw those rocks it was a miracle that my hideyhole in the bilges hadnt been ripped open and me with it anyway i got through that first night i spent the whole night on the heatandfumes baffle that big collar under the exhaust array from where i was able to see to see what was going on but i i dont want to go into that not just yet let it suffice to say that there were other survivors at least for that one night and somehow it passed and it could be that i even managed to sleep a little until it was morning blessed morning and oh the wailing when the sun came up over the horizon and the way the decks cleared of that moaning howling screaming crowd they just melted away back down into the nightdark guts of the ship except for a handful that came out creeping like mice into the sunlight forard and that was where i joined them they were the we i mentioned the handful who had lived through it and there were probably plenty of others down below locked in their rooms who didnt dare come out and who could blame them for that but i didnt think theyd last through the second day poor bastards not with a horde of vampires prowling the lower decks bars lounges and all and its a funny thing or maybe not so funny but some of them for whom it was already too late they seemed to be trying to pretend that it wasnt happening they had the tannoy systems going and we could hear the cab calloway lookalike in the jazz bar doing his stuff all those old numbers minnie the moocher the scat song and and you know all that jazz but i dont like to think what his audience looked like how they showed their appreciation or what they were drinking okay we myself two other deckhands a ships engineer and a junior steward thats it all that was left of humanity aboard the vessel anyone else well like i said theyd be locked in their cabins down below but by now the hunting would be well under way and those doors were ohsoflimsy or maybe theyd be safe at least during daylight hours we didnt know enough to say for sure about the lifeboats the engineer i dont know his name didnt get to know any of their names we never got around to asking but anyway he said we should go aft and see if we could lower a boat this was a hell of a hard man he was full of grit so determined to live through this thing that he lifted our spirits well for a while at least but those perverse bastard things those what was that you called them wamphyri theyd taken care of all that the winches had all been sabotaged and to be doubly sure the boats had been wrecked too any of them that were hanging over clear water theyd been holed in far too many places to fix so that was that we were stuck there in the middle of the ocean on a ship full of vampires as rusu faltered to a halt and his eyes began to glaze over again trask prompted him but what about the radio how is it there was just one brief call for help and then on a mobile phone frequency rusu jerked alert again eh oh the mobile phone thing that was me as for the ships radio well the first place your bloody great vampires headed for was the bridge the radio room is in an annexe and after what i had seen as i approached that place im assuming they took care of communications first and then there was my cellphone im afraid my using that was completely illegal the first time ive ever been glad to break the law illegal trask didnt understand to call for help to use a cellphone on her last trip before this one just a week or so ago the star had trouble with all the sunspot activity satellite navigation shiptoshore and onboard communications were all very badly affected made worse by passengers using cellphones since the prognosis was for another perhaps even worse spell of sunspot activity cellphones were banned on this trip passengers werent allowed to bring them on board but mine was already on board in my quarters trask glanced at his colleagues and nodded we experienced something of the sunspot problem ourselves but in your case in your position surely it wasnt a case of breaking the law you and your handful of survivors you were the only legitimate or lawful people aboard nicolae rusu grinned however weakly i was making a joke he said trying to be flippant i mean do you really think i gave a damn that the captain had ruled cellphones out the captain was dead and most everyone else undead but my cellphone was down in my quarters and we didnt know what would be waiting for us down below trask blinked his surprise you went back down there had to rusu shuddered id told the engineer about the cellphone and he insisted we go below and retrieve it that it was our one last chance hed found two verey pistols and some flares and if we made torches and if we carried fire axes we should have been able to make it as it turned out our going down there was a mistake it gave us away told those bloody things that there was a bunch of people up top who hadnt been got at and when night fell when night fell again they would remember that anyway we waited until midday when the sun was sizzling hot o the decks and its glare was reflecting off the rocks and the sea blazing in through all the windows and portholes only then did we dare go below as i told you my bunk was on b deck down in the guts of the ship there were passenger cabins down there too but crew quarters werent nearly so sumptuous by then the elevators had quit working and we had to use the stairwells that was okay at first and there was plenty of light from outside but when wed got down through the main deck onto a deck by then the light was very poor the emergency lighting was still working but it was flickering weak and failing and the cabin configurations were such that they had the portholes which kept almost all of the natural light from the gangways most of the cabin doorways were open however in fact a lot of them had been ripped off their hinges so that at least a little light from outside did shine through but but the light was red the light shining in from outside that came in through the open or wrecked doorways into the gangway was red and when we checked one of the cabins we saw why a girls body was in there shed been savaged raped murdered but but raped no it was worse than that i could never have imagined anything so bad shed been just about torn apart and her blood and guts had been used to smear the porthole to keep out the light and part of her face her lips and her tongue it looked like theyd been eaten her heart had been cut out of her with i dont know with a fire axe judging by the mess it had made but whatever she wouldnt be coming back to life and god help us when we came out of that cabin and looked down the gangway every door that was open wrecked or just plain missing the light that was filtering in through them was that same shade of red as nicolae rusu paused david chung said ben we need to get on were only fifteen minutes from the evening star but the light will start fading in about an hour and a half we have to get through with our business and airborne again before invincible can finish this thing surely weve heard enough now from nick here i mean no lardis interrupted let him finish it cant hurt us to know and i think in the long run it will be good for him i feel a certain kinship and its no more than id do for one of my own on sunside looking at lardis trask nodded we owe him to let him get this out of his system we have the stars schematics so were not going in blind also it isnt as if those poor bastards on that wreck are experienced theyre neither lieutenants nor even true thralls theyre just just vampires and weve had far worse to deal with in our time and anyway as night begins to fall the first of them will be on the prowl who can say it might even make our task easier to have one of them come to us instead of having to hunt one down he nodded again and turned back to rusu so ill leave it up to you nick if you want to go on were listening rusu was no longer trembling his eyes were fully focused and he looked a lot steadier now you must be very brave men he said which makes me feel like the worlds worst coward no need for you to feel that way trask told him gruffly we really do know what youve been through but knowing whats waiting for you on that ship and then to go back to it its our job said lardis its what we do rather you than me said rusu but if thats the way it is if youll risk your lives that way then what have i got to lose all im doing is telling my story out with it then said lardis for times wasting and rusu nodded and quickly went on some of the cabins on a deck that still had doors we could hear movement behind them but not knowing what was waiting for us in there not knowing if they were survivors or or something else we didnt wait around but crept on down to b deck and this far despite all the many hundreds of people and crew on that big ship we hadnt seen a single one not one that was living anyway but dead people oh thered been plenty of those theyd littered the stairwells men women and kids and all of them so badly mangled that they were past any kind of recovery i mean they were just dead really dead most of them were either old ones or very young ones and all of them were weak ones theyd paid the price first of course and as for the living if you want to call them that the ones we hadnt as yet seen not in daylight hours anyway well plainly they werent just drinking blood but eating flesh too some of those corpses god theyd been well chewed down the stairwells the gangways and the cabins there was blood and guts everywhere the whole ship stank of blood and shit and death but the worst most nerveracking thing by far was this we knew that for every corpse wed seen there were at least two others who were still alive sleeping or hiding there crouching and listening there redmouthed feraleyed and full of a feverish hideous strength there and of course that was why we crept we made it down onto b deck and then everything went wrong by then the light was very bad only our torches electric and flaring both sustained us we had thought to go unobserved unheard unobstructed huh but when theyre no longer human it appears their senses become far more highly tuned and already they were accepting what had happened to them becoming organized and sorting themselves into groups and hunting parties so maybe they had been aware of us all along and b deck being in the guts of the ship down in the darkest levels that was the obvious place to spring their trap we reached my cabin and found the door hanging open everything inside had been turned upside down thrown about all over the place so it took me a while to find the cellphone while i searched through the jumble the others kept watch and just as i found what i was looking for under a pile of my clothing so i heard one of the other deckhands hiss a warning he thought hed seen movement in the shadows at one end of the gangway a moment later the big burly engineer cursed and fired a verey light he was good at cursing every other word was fuck or shit or bastard but id never in my life heard anything like the stream of abuse that came out of him then the reason why was obvious and when he reached into my cabin grabbed me and dragged me out into the gangway i saw it for myself back the way wed come down the aft stairwells the vampires were massingbut i do mean they were massing the engineers flare had glanced off a bulkhead gone skittering almost all the way along the gangway and there it was sizzling away spinning about all over the place like a blob of raw sodium on water or a drop of grease in a hot pan creating a brilliant dazzling ball of light in a wreathing cloud of pink smoke and leaping and dancing in the smoke skipping to avoid contact with the thing as it burned itself out a dozen or more people or things that bad been people were outlined in its glare while behind them crowding the stairwell a seething sea of faces swam in a secondary darkness made luminous by their firefly eyes but i had the cellphone and we were out of there or so we thought all of us making a stumbling run for the forard stairwells where another group was waiting for us but a group i mean they were a nightmare horde they came spilling spewing spawning from the stairwells into the gangway a milling crowd of gaunt staring feraleyed faces like so many grinning zombies and all of them reaching for us with outstretched arms and eager hands we had the big engineer with a verey pistol in front and the steward with the other pistol at the rear and only one way out now through the middle of that that awful undead horde of bloodlusting monsters the engineer had reloaded he fired his verey pistol the shot went right through the vampire crowd setting some on fire as it passed before ricochetting off the stairwell bulkhead and leaping back into the press there it flared up sputtering and jumping like a chinese firecracker issuing smoke and blinding light and setting fire to everything it touched causing the milling oncehumans to scatter like shellshocked rats simultaneously the steward had fired his pistol into the massed ranks of the original pack at the aft end of the gangway they had recovered from their panic and were loping after us to close us in in fact we were closed in from both ends and only the incendiary verey lights and our fire axes and our terror gave us any chance at all but i think the best weapon of all was our terror the big engineer led the charge he tucked his pistol into his belt and was into them in a moment his axe swinging with a will the other deckhands flanked him which just about filled the width of the gangway leaving the steward and i to turn our backs and bring up the rear and while it lasted jesus but it was a slaughter mad with bloodlust those creatures surely were but they seemed to have little or no sense of direction their orientation was shot their blood and senses were out of kilter because of the poisons that coursed through their veins oh yes their senses had been enhanced but they hadnt yet learned how to put them to best use yes they were that much stronger but as yet they didnt seem to recognize that fact and the strangest thing of all i dont think they cared a damn all they cared for was blood that was the fuel that drove or powered them theyd tasted a drug that made manmade drugs seem puny by comparison which combined with the alien stuff that had been transfused into them was instantly addictive and caused their craving they wanted ow blood but in their blind lusting theyd forgotten or ignored a simple fact we wanted to keep it and our axes did terrible work but their strength and their numbers we piled them up and then had to climb over them and through all the crimson hell of it we were awash in their blood how we made it to the forard stairwell i dont know but that was where we lost the first of our group one of the deckhands up front he fell went shooting past me feet first down the stairs kicking and screaming slipping and slithering in spilled blood he crashed into the ravening horde behind lis and because we were facing that way me and the steward we we saw the end of it still shrieking and i shall hear his screams for ever the deckhand was grabbed up by the redspattered crowd it was as if a press of red and grey and feral yellow came together on him one moment he was thrown aloft buoyed up by all the hands that grasped him and then he was dragged under it was like it was as if he had fallen into a huge vat of dense swirling paint at first the surface was solid and supported him but then the skin broke and the colours opened to engulf him whole and pale he was absorbed only to be tossed up again but no longer whole pieces of him bites out of him had gone missing in the space of only two or three seconds then all of him went missing as he was dragged under again devoured and lost to us for ever two of us in front and two behind back to back we fought all the harder up that stairwell and as daylight began filtering down to us so the pressure slackened off suddenly almost unbelievably we were fighting on the a deck landing where lances of glorious yellow light slanted down from above stinging and blinding our attackers on the way down those beams of light had seemed faint now they were quite literally the light at the end of the tunnel then just as it looked like we might make it without any more losses damn damn damn it to hell that was when we lost the young steward in the briefest of brief lulls hed put down his axe and was trying to reload his verey pistol but his hands were slimy with blood and shaking so feverishly that precious shells were spilling from his grasp and pockets both and that was it the terror that had been his mainstay now cost him everything for in the moment before he could shoot he was tripped someone or rather some thing had kept low and crept up the steps to snatch his axe where hed dropped it and now used it to catch him behind the ankles as his feet shot out from under him he gave a wild cry and finally managed to fire the pistol diagonally across the stairwell the ball of fire made a hissing zigzag of heat and smoke down the stairs ricochetting off walls and bulkheads alike before the final explosion and brilliant starburst but as burbling cries of fear and hissing warnings went up as the vampires below me retreated in confusion so they took the steward with them dragging him by his ankles it was the last i saw of him and now there were only the three of us the way below was temporarily clear so i joined the other two facing forward where they drove just three or four vampires before them considering the amazing strength of these terrible creatures you might find that hard to believe or imagine that we could force them back but in the main they were still thinking like men their nearinvincibility had not as yet dawned on them moreover there was light pouring down from above real light reflected sunlight so that as well as having to avoid our bloody axes the vampires were also hindered by stray ultraviolet rays that however watered down by reflection worried and blinded them by then we were almost exhausted even our terror could no longer fuel our desperate fight for survival and on those last few steps up to the main deck with salvation in view that was where the big engineers massive strength finally gave out and at the same time as the creatures above us realized they were being driven up into raw seething sunlight it was the moment they chose to launch themselves in a body down upon us one of them threw himself at me another at the other deckhand we were able to hold our axes overhead impaling the creatures and using their impetus to hurl them down the stairs the other two were relatively small men one was fat and balding the big engineer cursed and swung at him caving in his chest but his axe somehow got caught fast in his ribs and as the gibbering thing flopped down on him along with the last of the four their combined weight drove him backwards sent him stumbling into darkness and below us the pack that trailed us took the opportunity to reach up into the light grab him and drag him down the last i saw of him was his snarling clenched teeth his straining bloodspattered face as with his last ounce of strength he somehow managed to toss his verey pistol up to me earlier he had given me a box of four spare cartridges to carry in case he ran out knowing he was finished i rammed one of these into the pistol snapped it shut and fired it directly down the centre of the stairwell but i didnt look to see what was illuminated by the flare for i already knew then my last human friend and i were up onto the main deck and racing or rather staggering along the gangway to where it came out into broad blessed daylight at the prow and there we fell in a sprawl on the open deck gasping and sobbing until we could breathe again i was covered in blood it suddenly dawned on me that my flesh and clothing were drenched in the blood of vampires and so was my friend we climbed but we would certainly have run if only wed had the strength up three flights of exterior stairs to the open upper deck on the very roof of the ship where without pause we went amidships and threw ourselves into the large swimming pool in the water we tore our clothes off and bathed our shuddering bodies and we floundered from one patch of water to the next as each in its turn became tinged with red this cleansing seemed to take forever but when we were done we got out in the sunlight to dry incredibly i was unharmed which is to say i had no cuts bites or punctures but my friend he wasnt so fortunate during the fighting hed been bitten in the shoulder and upper arm and a shallow cut in his forehead was still oozing blood seeing his wounds he became very scared even more so than during the fighting and asked me do you think think that maybe i but i didnt know enough to answer him not right then my cellphone wouldnt work the batteries had run down and my splashing about in the swimming pool hadnt much helped things ridiculous that after all the trouble wed gone to the price wed paid to recover the damn thing i had forgotten it was in my coverall flap pocket obviously it was my state of mind the fact that id been in fear of my life and completely panicked i took the cellphone to bits and dried it out and while i was putting it together again sent my friend looking for fresh batteries fortunately id carried the verey pistol in my hand retaining sufficient common sense to leave both it and the cartridges beside the pool at least they hadnt suffered any water damage as for my friend at twothirty in the afternoon he still hadnt come back meanwhile i had fallen asleep from sheer exhaustion but there in the sunlight half in the shade of an awning i knew that i was safe and despite that there had been slaughter last night the decks were amazingly clean it seemed the vampires had seen fit to clear up after themselves apart from a few stains the ship looked freshly swabbed down or had they simply been keeping their house in order earlier there had been oh maybe a hundred or more bodies floating in the sea these had sunk or drifted away now but in a narrow bottleneck where the sea met the rocks i saw that the water was alive with motion when i looked closer i saw a huge raft of crabs and small fishes in a feeding frenzy down there nothing goes to waste in the sea the evening star is a monster of a ship hah unfortunate choice of words lets just say shes big it wouldnt make much sense for me to go looking for the other survivor he could be anywhere could even be might even have gone missing myself i didnt intend to go anywhere below decks again and certainly not into any dark places but i didnt know about my friend while he had seemed to understand what was going on maybe he hadnt understood enough and suddenly i found myself in a panic again i was alone i was stark naked my cellphone was my only hope and it wasnt working because i had no batteries i got a grip of myself or at least as much of a grip as i could get there were gift shops on the main deck but that was three flights of stairs down fortunately the shopping area was dead centre of the ship almost directly below the pools also the central main deck was above the porthole level and had windows that let in lots of godgiven daylight more to the point so far i hadnt seen a single changeling creature on that level well with the exception of the original pair of great vampires when they were rampaging and theyd now left and with the sun high in the sky i prayed i wouldnt see any more and i didnt when finally i got my nerves under control and after id descended to the central area of the main deck i saw why there were no vampires down there for indeed the windows let in lots of light and most of the shop facades and interiors were lined with chrome or mirrors that reflected it to my eyes the effect was no more dazzling than a welllit shopping mall but to them i supposed it must have seemed like hell i went to a gift shop that i knew stocked every kind of photographic accessory for some reason i thought id find the place wrecked but that wasnt so indeed it was almost fully intact except for the shelf that had housed the batteries that had been stripped clean quickly then i tried the other shops but to no avail and so i returned to the open upper deck but not before id taken socks and shoes from a shop a shirt and fresh coveralls from the laundry and raided a refrigerator in the stars main dining room to stuff my pockets with food and a bottle of decent wine the power had been off for some time but the food was still good and cold and still id seen no sign of my friend so that i found myself wondering if he was my friend after all or anyones friend for that matter i thought about using the verey lights crazy what good would it do to fire them off in the daylight and i doubted very much that id be able to do it at night if i did it would be the last thing i did anyway i needed the verey pistol as a weapon apart from a fire axe it was my only weapon after eating i felt heavy and tired from nervous exhaustion or whatever and anyway i reckoned it would be a good idea to get as much sleep as i could right there and then for i had no idea how much id get later dusk was only some three or four hours away but i did spend another hour looking for batteries without finding any i supposed that i might find some on the bridge but after just a few seconds in there i couldnt take any more and now i knew what hell must look like i climbed up to the exhaust baffle and opened a maintenance hatch in the lead stack i had been in there before scaling out the flue between voyages the burning stench of greasy diesel residue was sickening but with the engines at a standstill it was just about bearable i couldnt have gone in there when the ship was running i would have suffocated and fried in a matter of seconds but these engines wouldnt ever be running again not as long as the ship was parked on these rocks there was a ledge in there where i could even lie down but not until i had to not until nightfall and so i slept out on the collar in the shade of the big exhaust array while in the west the sun slid down the sky the entertainment and leave it to the marines david chung ever the most nervous of the team said ben we have to get on glancing at his watch trask answered we can spare a few more minutes let him carry on lardis nodded and said i agree let him get it right out of his system and anyway if its vampires youre after youll need the night its like you said ben with the sun up youd have to hunt em down but when the suns down theyll come looking for you and winking encouragingly at the survivor he prompted him nick rusu had gone from strength to strength in the presence of men such as these he felt safe for the first time in three long days and night he was actually looking around now making eye contact actually seeing people one of invincibles medics had left a pack of cigarettes and a lighter on a table after lighting up and taking a deep soothing drag rusu looked at lardis gave a curt decisive nod and continued where hed left off so there i was asleep on the collar until i heard this voice whispering hey wake up i started awake and saw it was the other deckhand he was up the maintenance ladder just his head and shoulders visible and he was staring at me where i lay i was a little chilly and started shivering and i could see by the length of the shadows that the sun was almost down both myself and and my former friend we were covered by the shadow of the exhaust array and the way he was staring at me all intent and unblinking it was unnerving whereve you been i asked him did you have to hide up or something did you get trapped hide up he said looking surprised trapped and then he gave himself a shake and seemed to come more alive trapped yes down below but they didnt see me and i fell asleep waiting them out later i couldnt find you but then i remembered where you came from this morning and and here you are as he climbed up onto the collar i sat up and backed off until i came up against the exhaust array what about the batteries i said did you find any the batteries echoing my words he sat down crosslegged facing me oh yes the batteries hed rigged himself out with some illfitting clothes and reaching into a pocket he produced three or four brand new blister packs of differentsized batteries the price tags were still on them and labels with the name of the gift shop i looked at them then at him and he nodded he knew what i was thinking and see he said its a matter of survival after all that fighting what with getting myself wounded and bitten and all i couldnt say for sure if i was if i was okay you know so i thought it through and decided to wait and see his voice had fallen to a slow monotonous husky drone he sounded as if he were drugged but even as he spoke he crept a little closer i had been using my shoes wrapped up in my new shirt as a pillow now i reached out carefully pulling the bundle toward me he watched me and said nothing so that in a little while i prompted him with you werent trapped below at all were you you were just worried about yourself right something like that he said and are you going to try the batteries then as i took out my cellphone and opened up the blister pack containing the batteries it used abruptly he moved closer still and his next few sentences tumbled out of him all urgent like and garbled how do i look youve got to tell me i have to know if i look okay see i dont feel too good i dont feel very well at all my fingers felt like rubber as i fitted the batteries but the tiny pilot light on the phone at once lit up it was working you look just fine i told him a lie because he looked like shit but i darent say that i wanted him to be okay and as yet there was very little to say he wasnt but at the same time i wasnt taking any chances he cocked his head a little on one side smiled and said i look fine oh really you think i look okay but his smile was all wrong yes i really think so i lied again and began dialling my familys number in limmasol cyprus the phone burped once twice three times and i could have screamed my frustration out loud except i didnt dare but after the fourth burp finally it was answered by my mother its nick i barely croaked the words out then cleared my throat and repeated them its nick aboard the evening star mother listen very carefully were in trouble tell the company that the star is shipwrecked on a rock but i dont know where tell them weve been boarded by but that was as far as i got for moving so fast i barely saw it my good friend reached out and slapped the phone out of my hand as it fell to the collar he brought a clenched fist down on it so hard that the thing splintered into little shards of plastic and thats enough he said in that terrible monotone see i still havent made up my mind i can see youre scared of me and maybe youve a right to be i still dont know for sure but i knew for sure for by now the sun had sunk more yet and as the gloom deepened so his eyes were beginning to shine a gleaming yellow trembling i left my shirt in a little pile and pulled my shoes on and he said are you going somewhere myself i was thinking of just of just waiting here a while waiting for what i asked him another fifteen or twenty minutes and theyll be coming out onto the decks so you and i we have to hide ourselves away he didnt seem to be listening his feral gaze had strayed to an empty carton of milk and the rind of an orange the remnants of my last meal i see youve eaten he said are you hungry i asked him if so i have some food i found food below he answered it just made me throw up so either it was off or i am coming to my feet with my shirt in my hands i unfastened the top of my coveralls its getting chilly i said making to put my shirt on he had come to his feet too the way his eyes roved over my upper body before focusing on my neck i knew there was nothing anyone could do for him or if there was i would have to be the one who did it then the way he leaned toward me telegraphed his intention but knowing how very quick he was i beat him to it as he himself had pointed out it was a matter of survival id kept the verey pistol wrapped in my shirt my finger on the trigger in the act of reaching for me he saw the weapons muzzle poised only inches from his face and as his mouth fell open in a big round o of surprise so i fired at him pointblank the charge hit him in the left eye and lodged there half in half out of his skull ejecting its hot gases and driving him backwards to the rim of the collar there he stood flailing his arms until the final brilliant starburst cooked his brain and went on to incinerate his head from the inside out as his arms flew wide he stiffened then slumped down into himself toppled backwards over the rim and went crashing down onto the pool deck twenty feet below after that i stood there for quite a while oh perhaps a minute before i could get anything working again but shadows were creeping and i knew i must get moving the trouble was that i couldnt leave this man id killed lying where he was in full sight of whoever or whatever would soon be coming out into the night if they saw him there then theyd start looking for who put him there i went down the steel rungs breakneck dragged the perfect and normalseeming body with its blistered bubbling and barely recognizable head to the rail and dumped him overboard no time to spare then as i climbed back up to the exhaust array opened the hatch a crack for easy and rapid access then stretched myself out flat on the collar to observe the nights proceedings this wasnt simply morbid curiosity i needed to know just how much these creatures had got it together in order to gauge the odds against my surviving so in a way i suppose it was morbid curiosity after all the sun was no more than a blister on the sea now and the shadows were everywhere lengthening by the second i knew where to look the stairwells forard and amidships as for the aft stairwells they were behind the array and there was nothing i could do about that but listen and i listened so intently that i thought my ears might burst from the silence then it was time that preternatural moment when the sun disappears and the gloom deepens not yet night but no longer daylight the everdeepening twilight preceding their time it stretched itself out into minutes and the minutes into half an hour the shadows gradually merged together and became pools of darkness beginning in the east the stars were flickering into being one by one and then there was movement something crept in the dark many somethings lowburning lambent candles that werent candles at all but eyes they came up out of the stairwells onto the decks two groups that i could see and one that i could hear a rustling like bat wings unfurling the association with bats seemed very obvious and then i saw those blots of darkness moving out from under the collar and spreading along the deck that sea of vampires on the swarm that host of horror between the three groups there must have been oh it seemed a thousand of them men and women alike and god only knows how many remained below but those who had come up aft i could see that they were cautious curious i supposed they must have heard my verey pistol and so lay very still when they lifted their heads en masse to sniff at the air the lingering cordite and sulphur stink some of them paused at the spot directly below me where my exdeckhand friend had fallen there would be blood and shit there of course and i saw them follow a trail go to the rail and look over but as yet none of them had looked up fearing that they might i drew back out of sight the trouble with that being that now i didnt know what was going on down there but i was still able to look forward toward the prow see what the other two groups were doing the silence was broken when the aft vampires found their voices and began to talk all in the same husky monotone of my exfriend from what they said it was fairly obvious that they suspected someone an entirely human someone was up here on the open deck mercifully they didnt seem too concerned but then again with their numbers why should they be concerned meanwhile the two groups amidships and forard had more or less held their positions none of the members of the three factions was mingling with the others so it looked like theyd formed into three quite separate bands and for a fact they had chosen or accepted leaders for there were those among them who strode about giving orders good for it was just such an order that saved my neck my blood froze when i heard boots clanging on the rungs of the exhaust arrays maintenance ladder the sound paralysed me freezing me solid some curious vampire bastard was climbing up to see what he could see probably to act as some kind of lookout for the rest of the aft group i had already loaded my verey pistol now i rolled onto my back with my shoulders slightly raised and the weapon pointing down between my feet the moment a face appeared over the collars rim i was going to send the bastard to hell after that i would have only one shot left and would have to try to bluff it out only one way up onto the collar and me waiting at the top with a deadly weapon perhaps after id taken out a second man then theyd give it up but if they should send up a third man well that would be the end of me but it didnt come to that for as i heard the boots climbing higher suddenly a gruff voice called out you there come down from there and bring on the entertainment god the first thing i thought was that he knew i was there and was talking to me but the entertainment sweet jesus then i heard the boots pause as someone hesitated and finally i started to breathe again as they went clumping back down the metal rungs the entertainment consisted of the last handful of human beings captives of the vampires theyd been saving them keeping them back for this and despite that i was now mindless with terror or perhaps because i was i had to know what was happening turning over onto my stomach again i inched forward until i could see over the edge of the collar a handful of survivors were dragged up from below decks mainly girls and young kids they were all naked sobbing and clinging to each other incapable of accepting what was happening to them for even now to me let alone to them it was beyond belief as i watched mass rape turn to murder and bloodlust to cannibalism but there are some sights that simply werent meant to be seen acts that could blind a man simply by watching them and living human flesh being carved and passed around in rough red lumps is one of them well i didnt go blind though im sure i wished it and there was the same monstrous activity in the other groups amidships and forard they had captives too and all of them went the same way but those monsters those monsters who had been men they made it last and it lasted and it lasted and all the while i lay there half delirious yet scarcely daring to breathe where finally i curled myself up into a ball at the foot of the exhaust array their moaning woke me up it was the twilight before the dawn and they were moving off in dribs and drabs disappearing back down into the darkness as the first pink flush lit the eastern sky and i had made it through a second night well and it seems i made it through last night too but not on the collar from dusk till dawn i was breathing all that stale diesel stench inside the leading exhaust stack id found a way to jam the maintenance hatch behind me and you know for all that the place is a rathole it was the only place on the ship where i felt safe there was just the once i stuck my head out and that was last night in the twilight when i heard that first helicopter coming in to the crew of that chopper it must have looked like the star was abandoned like a modern marie celeste but when they touched down and the rotors slowed to standby god i wanted to leap out of hiding wave my arms and stamp my feet yell and warn them off but i didnt and you know why i didnt they were at the stem and i was at the stern they wouldnt hear or understand me but i knew there were those who would you want to know what happened to the people in that helicopter it was like darkness fell on them swift as the shadows when a cloud passes over the moon and the pilot poor bastard they dragged him out of there onto the deck and fell on him in a swarm and that crew were gone as if theyd never existed so that when i ducked back into my hideyhole and jammed the hatch shut again i was feeling so suicidal that it was all i could do to keep from tossing myself down the flue onto the iron guts of the big engine and finishing it and i vowed that i wasnt coming out again that i would rather shrivel and die there in the greasy stinking darkness than be drained off like so much juice from a ripe fruit and the fumes in there got to me i dont know if i slept or what if i ate anything i immediately threw up when i drank it was all i could do to keep it down but i wasnt coming out not ever not even when it was daylight again id quite literally resigned myself to dying in there what with the fear and the fumes i dont know i suppose i was out of my head when i heard your choppers circling i thought it was some kind of dream a mental mirage and for a while i did nothing my head was swimming and i could scarcely get to my feet the luminous dial of my watch told me it was daylight and the sound of the choppers was getting louder suddenly the survival instinct kicked in and i had to know when i came out of hiding onto the collar the fresh air nearly did for me after all that shit id been breathing it was like good wine a champagne overdose and the rest well the rest you know so if what youve told me is true and youre going back there what can i say but god help you rusu lit another cigarette inhaled deeply and trickled the smoke out through his nostrils lay back and fell silent and trask said thanks nick you have helped us but even if you hadnt i think youve helped yourself lardis nodded and said youll dream this stuff for a long time nick but eventually youll find a way to switch off the mind is clever at switching off theres a thousand things that i no longer let myself dream one last thing said trask this story youve told us dont tell it to anyone else they wouldnt believe you anyway but if they did it might prevent us from doing our work do you understand my lips are sealed said rusu its like lardis said i have to find a way to switch off and forget and then as trask and his people left him he gave one last shudder and added but i dont think i ever will out in the gangway a cpo was waiting for them sir he spoke to trask the captain wants to see you on the helipad asap im to take you up there trask nodded his understanding its late and hes getting worried pokerfaced and possibly bridling a little the cpo looked at him i shouldnt think so the captain of hms invincible is a man who doesnt get worried too easily i only know that hes been swapping messages with the admiralty and the fleet air arm for at least two hours now and that your escort has been assembled and is waiting on the helipad our escort trask raised an eyebrow but the cpo had nothing more to say they were marines and all six of them were dressed in alienlooking nuclear chemical and biological warfare suits nitelite headgear and longsnouted gas masks carrying standard nato mm lasersighted selfloading rifles and trask just didnt want to believe it when invincibles captain mckenzie told him these men were his escort whatthe head of ebranch could scarcely contain himself youve been briefed by gunnery commander argyle who im sure must have explained something of what we saw on the evening stars bridge yet you still expect me to take these men with me and not one of them knowing a single damn thing about whats happening here captain arthur mckenzie wasnt used to being spoken to like this but on the other hand he did recognize trasks authority unfortunately however with the sun already touching the horizon there was no time left for polite explanations and no he answered i dont expect anything of you mr trask but the admiralty the fleet air arm and even your own ministerial superior they do and on this occasion im only following orders one of these soldiers is a qualified helicopter pilot his duty is to bring back the stranded chopper the other five have their orders what orders trask was dumbfounded first to protect you said the straightbacked bearded broadshouldered and unblinking captain and second to immobilize and secure at least one living specimen which is to say an infected person from that vessel and return him or her to invincible for onward conveyance to london and the proper authorities authorities meaning the boffins at porton down the captain nodded who we would assume are the experts in such matters trask shook his head i cant believe the minister responsible i mean my er ministerial superior would hamper me in this way hamper you now mckenzie bridled by giving you the protection of these marines these superb soldiers well allow me to inform you mr trask that the only reason youre going back to the evening star at all is that your minister responsible pleaded your case with my superiors and whats more if you dont board this helicopter now without wasting any more valuable time as your host and the captain of this warship i may take it upon my own shoulders to redefine the orders ive received in which case im empowered to let these men go without you captain said trask a note of desperation creeping into his voice now look you really dont understand this infection were talking about isnt anything like youve been led to believe it is mckenzie nodded i know what youre going to say mr trask for indeed commander argyle did brief me and yes im aware of what you saw on that bridge the asiatic plague has mutated and does to men what rabies does to wild animals turns them into killers but you see two of my marines are also carrying dart guns with a powerful sedative that will knock a man down in seconds and so that ill be able to follow their progress the wo has an audiovisual transmitter in his headset a camera linked to invincibles screens so ill be with you in a lot more than spirit and believe me i wont allow you to interfere you may advise by all means but leave the work to the marines i think you can be fairly certain that they wont er hamper you as he finished speaking the captain turned away and whirled his hand over his head and on the helipad the rotors of a mark vi sea king twitched into life as the marines boarded in single file trask looked this way and that and licked his lips and is that it youre not going to listen to he was about to say reason but thats it captain mckenzie cut in on my next signal she takes off with or without you there are extra nbc suits aboard id advise you to put them on even if you dont get to set foot on the evening star what said trask what did you say even if we dont get to set foot on hells teeth were the only people who know whats going on here and you jake cutter took his elbow er mr trask sir the captain is right were fortunate that we have the opportunity to watch the operation from beginning to end im sure that will suffice for our er minister responsible and now we really should get aboard right his grip on trasks arm was like iron trask looked at jake and as the down draught from the chopper built up he turned to the telepath liz merrick halfshrugging she leaned forward and whispered youd be making a mistake to think mckenzies bluffing for just a moment back there he was even thinking to throw you in the brig a passing thought yes but if were going it has to be now trask stamped for the big choppers ramp but as the others got aboard he turned and shouted captain mckenzie these men these marines theyre not my responsibility of course theyre not the captain shouted back and trask nodded just you remember that he said before climbing aboard a marine with a warrant officer class s insignia on the wrist of his nbc suit told trask sir it will take you maybe ten to fifteen minutes to get into one of these suits and were only fifteen minutes to target target said trask whose thoughts were elsewhere our destination the other shrugged he had pulled aside his headgear and gas mask in order to talk most of his men had done likewise for easy breathing en route to the star trask was still feeling sour but the mood was quickly falling off him for after all it wasnt these peoples fault that they were caught up in this they were just following orders however stupid those orders might appear to be also from what trask had been told he knew he couldnt blame the minister responsible either and it was easy to see what had happened here the minister didnt have carte blanche in this thing since hms invincible was involved hed had to work through the fleet air arm and the admiralty both so what would he have been able to tell them that ebranch had priority here and they were going up against vampires not likely which meant that it all boiled down to a military operation to these six men however it wouldnt seem like a military mission at all they were simply doing their bit to help out in an emergency situation giving aid to the civilian authorities and on second thought maybe trask sbould be blaming the minister responsible after all for he had governmental power the power to swear both the admiralty and the fleet air arm to secrecy if hed had the balls to use it or maybe it was the case that too many people were already in the know and then again maybe something had changed changed drastically since trask and his people had been sent out here but whatever or whichever it was a fucking mess these six men thought they knew what they were doing thought it was going to be easy theyd been tasked to knock down some kind of unarmed rabid civilian animal and take him to a vet to have him checked out just like that but it wasnt just like that at all you and these men trask suddenly blurted it out youre all in grave danger you arent in possession of all the facts your superiors dont know all the facts only set foot on that ship without knowing what youre doing and oh we know what were doing sir the warrant officer cut him short our orders were very simple jesus thought trask simple so were the minds that issued them and out loud listen to me im telling you that some of you might not be coming back from that vessel the wo narrowed his eyes and im telling you that thats what we call spreading alarm and despondency among the troops if you were one of mine youd be on a charge and in any case im obliged to report what you just said but just ten minutes to target the wo turned away and then turned back again and if youre not in a bloody suit when we get there ill be confining you to this chopper sir trask barely managed to keep from exploding we have our own bloody suits he said which arent nearly as complicated as yours and to his own people spray yourselves down apply noseplugs and weaponup liz i want you on guard from touchdown we all stay together as far as possible and always within sight and easy reach of jake all twelve passengers marines and ebranch people alike were standing belted hooked up to safety rings in the ceiling of the aircraft a purely precautionary and standard safety measure for except for a little vibration the ride so far had been as smooth as silk it would be relatively simple for trask and his people to unhook themselves and suitup in nbc gear instead ian goodly and david chung took out small aerosol canisters and commenced spraying down their fellows as the gas spread out the marines wrinkled their noses backed off began sliding away on their safety rings and pulling their gas masks into position over their mouths and noses shits one of them said disgustedly no liz told him its just garlic you dont need your gas masks not yet anyway and as goodly and chung finished their spraying we never use anything else said trask thats us all suitedup thats a shame said a marine junior ranker see i was sort of looking forward to helping the little lady on with her suit helping her get dressed i mean or undressed another marine sniggered watch your dirty mouths their wo told them but its okay liz smiled at him however tightly and turned to the one who would have liked to help her dress or undress i feel perfectly safe with the soldier boys here especially this one you see he has to come on all sexy because he isnt oh he has the gear all right swinging away down there but in fact thats all it does hes so worried that his wife is probably being banged by the big policeman who lives next door back home in portsmouth that he just cant get it up but still he likes to pretend he can and smiling sweetly at the marine in question who stood swaying there with his bottom jaw hanging loose and his eyes bugging she added so what does that do for your privates private now the man leaned towards her private he said what private soldier so what do you know in the marines its just marine sweetheart but with his colleagues staring at him he quickly realized that while he had corrected her error hed said nothing to address the insult so could she in fact be right why you bitch he spat then going white and yanking on his tether to get closer to her but jake cutter hooked up opposite him quickly got in the way later jake husked showing his teeth well talk about this later you and me when were back on invincible my pleasure the other spat i very much doubt that said jake but it will certainly be mine knock it off everybody the wo snapped five minutes to target and in jakes head back on invincible korath once mindsthralls deadspeak voice echoed his astonishment his disgust this one insulted your woman accepted your challenge and yet hes still standing your reaction should have been immediate instinctive final by now he should be writhing on the floor choking on his own blood sometimes you disappoint me jake im not here for your pleasure jake told him and anyway this isnt starside also and if youd been paying attention it might have dawned on you that these people will be lucky to get back to invincible in the first place ah said korath now thats more like it you have let him live knowing that be faces a far worse death on a ship full of vampires oh for christs sake jake sighed and not wanting to get into a fullblown argument or wamphyri word game with his dead familiar he added yes sure whatever you say then he glanced sideways at liz sorry shed sensed his probe no longer deadspeak but telepathy the rapport they had between them its just nerves i suppose it doesnt take too much to set them jumping i think ill probably always be like this when we when were going up against them then she shrugged and added despite that what i said about this poor jerk is true still it was cruel of me forget it jake answered and anyway my nerves are jumping just as badly and maybe im just as cruel i mean for a while there i was actually enjoying the idea that this marine fuck is on his way into hell and the fact is be may well be but not us again he glanced at her yes probably us too but at least we know what were doing we know whats waiting for us collecting the specimen they felt the sudden deceleration sensed their gradual descent towards the evening star the wo was listening to the pilot on his headset in answer to information received he said roger that slapped a magazine into the housing on his rifle and spoke to his team remember ladies these weapons are for show the infected people on this ship may be loonies but still theyll know what rifles are and what the hell the way youre dressed will most likely scare the shit out of them before they even notice your rifles so then you may fire warning shots if necessary but only if it becomes neccessary oh it will trask murmured under his breath then spoke out loud to his agents people if your weapons arent already loaded do it now that wont be necessary the wo spoke up you can belay that last i told you to suitup and you didnt therefore you arent going anywhere trask shook his head you cant confine us cant order us around were not military personnel were civilians and dont come under your jurisdiction you dont have the power to williams the wo cut him off and the man liz had taunted stopped glaring at jake and came to attention yes sir youre on rearguard said the wo stay back and keep an eye on this lot make sure that they and the pilot stay safe yes sir williams snapped and armed his rifle sergeant major trask grabbed the wos arm made one last desperate effort to get through to him those nbc suits arent any use in this situation i mean theyre tarpaper for gods sake they can only slow you down and as for the men and women on that ship on this ship trask went on theyre not mad this isnt like rabies or any other disease weve ever come across these people wont just attack you theyll fucking eat you the wo shook himself loose scowled one last tithe at trask then ordered his men out onto the stars deck as the door slid open the pneumatic boarding ramp reached out and down locked into position and the marines disembarked williams stayed on board guarding the door and looking at jake trask and the rest of the ebranch personnel with a narroweyed expression that said just you try something the sea king had landed on the sun deck midway between the two swimming pools the sun was gone dusk coming in fast and the shadow of the islands central fang had draped itself like a shroud over the ship mr beamish sir the wos voice shouted over the throb of rotors on standby the stranded choppers up front on the main deck shes all yours well see you back on invincible christ trask shouted and tried to shoulder his way past williams at the door dont let him but williams planted the butt of his rifle in trasks stomach and cut him short ugh said trask doubling up and when he spoke again his words were a gasp dont let him let him go alone too late for the marines had already dispersed the wo and one other toward the starboard stairwells two others to port and lieutenant beamish crouching low where he skirted the main pool running along the shadowy open deck toward the prow and as jake unclipped himself cursed and made to grab hold of williams the marine stuck the muzzle of his weapon into his gut took first pressure on the trigger and said dont tempt me dont even think about it his eyes had gone very wide and a nervous tic jerked his pale face in the oval frame of his nbc headgear dont give me any reason at all to pull this trigger because i just might fuckhead and looking inside williamss mind liz saw what shed previously missed that impotence wasnt his only problem he was a coward too scared shitless and his trigger finger was trembling like a leaf in a gale w bently switched on the miniature camera situated centrally between the lenses of his nitelites as yet the thermalimaging nitelites were simply goggles attachments for the gas mask that protected his mouth and nose but he needed only to trip a tiny switch to see in infrared lacking a lighting system the evening star would be dark below decks getting darker as the gloom of twilight deepened and now that bently and his men were aboard the star they had also switched on interunit communicationsi not only could they speak to each other but their conversations would be heard aboard invincible similarly anything the wo saw would also be seen by captain mckenzie get below bently told his people now one flight down and we meet up on the bridge deck any contact which is to say on first contact waste no time but dart the target and report then get him or her back up topside to the sea king thats all were here for clear roger that the answer came back from the marines on the larboard stairwell then the sounds of boots clattering on the stairs and switch your niteiites on now said bently as his teams joined forces again between the bridgedeck landings then speaking into his headset lieutenant beamish sitrep normally beamish would be his superior but in the current situation bently had command while the officer was just another man a pilot whose only task was to rescue the stranded chopper yyes sergeant major came the shaky reply but shaky is there a problem bently snapped i want a sitrep i i thought i saw some movement up ahead of me beamish answered weird flowing motion where the exterior stairs go down to the forward sun deck the light is bad and the decks are still warm their heat is interfering with the nitelites and blurring my vision probably better if i rely on my natural eyesight im switching the nitelites off now and approaching the stairs and bently waited a moment and repeated him and and theres theres no one here came the reply and what sounded like a broken sigh of relief can you see the chopper bently sighed too but managed to keep it to himself yes the shadow of the upper deck is falling right across her but but i dont think theres anyone there when you get down there said bently a couple of warning shots into the air should clear the way that is should you need to clear the way understood said lieutenant beamish bently looked at his men like molten redandblue ghosts wavering in his nicelites okay he said there are no passenger accommodations on this deck so well split up again and go down one flight to the next landing you popgun people make sure youre ready with your darts somewhere on this damn great spook of a ship there are supposed to be a couple of thousand people that is unless theyve all jumped overboard so lets find just one of them and then get the fuck out of here in the ghostly subdued fluorescent lighting of hms invincibles ops room captain mckenzie and two of his officers were following bentlys progress on a wall screen and listening to sitreps and conversations as they came in radio procedure had gone out the window but the captain wasnt worried with only a handful of marines involved all of them well known to his fellows the sops would only have slowed communications down captain mckenzie could also speak to bently if he so desired but so far he hadnt deemed it necessary the thermal imaging of bentlys camera displayed the wooden panelling on the walls of the stairwell as a softly fluctuating peripheral neon glow gradually brightening as he descended and left what little natural light thered been on the bridge deck behind then as bently reached the promenade deck and the picture on the screen stopped jerking with his motion the voice of one of his portside men came up loud and clear sir theres debris in the larboard stairwell its almost choked wooden lockers or dressers torn out of the ships bunks by the looks of it and there are bodies we can see we see a great many dead bodies no wait one of thems alive its a woman shes in a bad way trying to stand up asking for help no need to dart this one shes all done in stay there were between the landings below you well cross over to your side and come up roger that came the answer as the picture on the screen jerked into motion again and the narrow walls of softly glowing neon began to flow by but more rapidly now and then lieutenant beamishs voice or rather his stuttering choking terrified shriek god almighty oh sweet jesus yahh yahhhh yaahhhhh followed by four rapidfire shots and a new hitherto unknown triumphantly guttural voice saying oh weve got you now soldier boy then briefly beamishs panting growing louder and louder in his throat mike and what sounded like a sharp intake of breath at the beginning of a fresh bout of shrieking until a tearing sound cut it off before it could get started and finally silence what bently asked of no one in particular what and from the portside party sir weve got the woman i think but these dead uns i dont understand it theyve got body heat theyre showing up on our nitelites what do you mean you think youve got her she shes hanging on to us came the reply and god shes strong and the dead uns under this busted furniture theyre not dead tbeyre fucking mobile were coming up bently yelled over the muted but frantic clatter of booted feet on polished wooden stairs and mr beamish he began calling beamish lieutenant beamish where are you where the fuck are you but beamish didnt answer aboard the sea king the face of the marine called williams was a picture of fear he had heard lieutenant beamishs last transmission also the gunfire and beamishs screams which he would have heard anyway and without the aid of his radio the ebranch team had heard them too now trask turned to the locator david chung and said what do you make of it make of it chung flinched from the suddenness the sharpness of trasks tone the locators face had turned a very pale shade of yellow theyre everywhere thats what i make of it theyre under us and all around us were in the midst of them the only place where they arent is above us which is where we should be theyre on all the lower decks maybe even this deck hiding in the shadows its not dark enough for them up here yet but its getting darker all the time and i can feel them creeping liz said trask theyre like one big mind she answered one big silent but seething mind and theres only one thought in that awful awesome mass mind blood the picture im getting is red ben its red with blood ian said trask turning to the precog ian goodly was white as death itself swaying this way and that where he was still hooked up he said i see what liz and david saw a sea of red but its not for us we were getting out of this what the fuck are you lot talking about williamss eyes swivelled this way and that he leaned out of the big choppers door looked toward the stars prow to see if he could discover what had happened to beamish but his weapon remained pointing at jakes middle only inches away and jake couldnt make his move and now too late you see that i was correct said korath in jakes mind if you had knocked this one down necroscope if youd crippled or killed him he wouldnt be blocking your way now and id be a murderer jake answered anyway its easy to be wise after the fact but i was wise before the fact said korath williams said trask youve got to let us off this helicopter you heard those screams those gunshots but you dont have any idea what they meant they meant that beamish is dead and any time now the same thing will apply to your warrant officer and friends they dont know what theyre up against and were the only ones who can help them taking trasks elbow the cadaverous goodly shook his head and said no ben when i said we would get out of this i was talking about us ebranch i didnt say anything didnt see anything of them except for the pilot obviously he will make it too but as for the rest of them no not even this one he looked at williams looked pityingly at him so if youre right said jake glancing first at the precog and then at williams it should be okay to tell him whats going on what the fuck is all this mumbling williams was sweating now shaking in his boots what youre trying to talk me down or something i have my i have my orders to hell with your orders jake told him without waiting for trasks sayso you want to know what were talking about were talking about vampires thats what this socalled infection is all about the expassengers and crew of this ship have become vampires and all of your mates are meat for a moment williamss brow was lined in a frozen frown before his lips turned down in a sneer of disbelief you fucking he began to say but then as gunshots sounded from the port stairwell his eyes went wide again and he leaned from the door to look in that direction with the barrel of the marines rifle momentarily deflected jake saw his opportunity making a grab for the weapon he simultaneously lashed out at the man holding it jake hit hard a blow to williamss face that drove him even further out of the helicopter the old lidesci had been expecting some such the razorsharp blade of his machete hissed where it sliced through the marines safety harness windmilling his arms williams uttered an outraged cry as he released his rifle crashed down onto the boarding ramp and bounced off onto the deck crowding the doorway trask and his people looked down on the fallen marine for a moment he lay there in the shadows the shadow of the sea king itself in the shadow of the jagged central fang of the little island with his face contorted in rage then he made to get to his feet but among those gradually lengthening shadows were several much darker ones that were moving a lot faster and pale eager hands were already reaching for williams from under the bulk of the helicopter he didnt see what grabbed him but he certainly felt those powerful hands closing on his ankles the terrible urgency with which they dragged him out of sight williams screamed high and shrill just once and briefly a scream that quickly gurgled down into silence and all across the evening stars decks the shadows came alive in that same instant the tableau of frozen faces in the sea kings doorway shattered into motion as trask yelled that is what were here for we want one of those ian and david guard the door and look after the pilot liz jake lardis youre with me three minutes earlier and one and a half flights down the port stairwell w bently and his number two had been forced to slow down where broken furniture littered the stairs now as they clambered their way up toward a rightangled bend a deafening burst of gunfire sounded from just around the corner brought up short by the sound of the shooting the spanging of ricochets and the terrified cries of marines around the corner bentlys thermal imaging showed him a tall man staggering into view his head a crimson blob that appeared to be spraying red out the back like the tail of a comet both the warrant officer and his subordinate were so astonished that they fell back against opposite walls as this figure passed between them somehow staying erect as it went stumbling down the stairwell but the junior rank had to know what this thing was that he was seeing and in the deep gloom of the confined area he switched off his nitelites in favour of normal vision ggod he said then even though he still wasnt absolutely certain but what the thing had looked like before it fell over and went tumbling down the stair like a scarecrow released from its pole was a man in an evening suit with the back of his head blown off and that wasnt all the junior ranker saw for creeping up the stairs following close behind him and his superior an incredible swarm of silent nightblack figures filled the narrow passage wall to wall and as far back as could be seen bently saw them too the weird ebb and flow of their low body heat in his nitelites and the red blaze of their feral triangular eyes then over a renewed outburst of shooting and screams from around the bend coming right into bentlys ear from the receiver in his headset he heard his underlings hoarse terrified whisper whwhat the hell what are they ssir shall i ddart one bently switched his rifle to rapid fire and with his mouth half open breathed dart one throw your popgun away son and cut the fuckers down which was perhaps three seconds before the wave from below and another from above washed over them trask and jake went down the ramp side by side turning off at the bottom to fire into the darkness beneath the helicopter in the gloom under there a whole nest of triangular eyes maybe ten pairs shrank back from them their owners squealing their terror of the hot death that the two men poured into them jake fired full metal jacket and trask snubnosed silver and vampires or mere mortals flesh and blood simply couldnt withstand the onslaught the shadows shrank back and the deck behind the sea king turned darker as the vampire flood dispersed in every direction taking cover in every hiding place at the same time liz and lardis had come down the ramp more slowly spraying aerosols until the air was hot with the stench of cordite and garlic of williams there was no trace wherever the shadows had gone he had gone with them vavaras spawn most definitely korath told jake her essence is in them and copiously see how easily they disguise themselves melting into shadows and darkness but theyre barely thralls said jake out loud aye but a good many are hers taken by vavara or those she took first and as i said she wasnt sparing with her essence trask who thought jake had been speaking to him answered vampires thralls lieutenants i dont give a damn what they are theyre undead and should be dead a fresh burst of shooting and muted screaming sounded from the port stairwell looking that way jake said shouldnt we try to do something about those poor bastards no said korath its far too late there were only four of them whelmed under by a horde even with your superior weapons you wouldnt stand a chance and moment by moment the darkness deepens even here on the deck you are far from safe jake looked all around and korath was right the shadows were creeping again and feral gleams lit the deeper gloom you heard what the precog said trask answered hoarsely as the chaotic chattering of gunfire ceased and its echoes were replaced by gurgling screams which in their turn were abruptly smothered we cant help anyone theyre gone jake look liz cried help me a young girls plea rang out as she came staggering from the direction of the exhaust array in the stern of the ship oh wont somebody please help me ive been hiding from them hiding from from all the rape and the murder she was maybe eighteen had a beautiful figure and in normal circumstances would have been lovely now her makeup was streaked from her tears and her cocktail dress was hanging by a single strap leaving her right breast bare her blonde hair was everywhere stringy and unkempt falling over her face and shoulders where she came stumbling her panties snagged on the buckle of a shoe trailed from her left ankle the sight of her stopped trask and his people short jesus cbrist liz heard trasks gasp and thank god i dont have a daughter because she could be it for liz this was a new situation shed never seen anything like it before automatically she stepped off the helicopters ramp and moved toward what looked like a second survivor jake on the other hand had been in precisely this situation before in australia and he wasnt about to be taken in a second time side by side with liz he advanced on the girl as she came on arms reaching out even so it was a hard thing to do to point the rifle at her and pull the trigger so hard that at first he couldnt do it what if she really was a survivor you poor thing said liz moving quickly forward liz jake cautioned her but needlessly for in fact she knew exactly what she was doing then when it seemed that the girl was about to fall into her arms liz lifted her hand to arms length instead of gathering the poor thing up she sprayed oil of garlic directly into her face the effect was immediate and dramatic before the girl had been slumped staggering her shoulders drooping her eyes mainly hidden in tangles of matted hair now it was as if jake really had pulled the trigger she shot upright straight as a rod her hair straightening in an effect that was almost electric flying out from her head and framing it in spiky tufts her eyes previously weepy and disguised by running mascara opened wide in shock and fear blazing yellow as boiling sulphur pits and liz said surrounded by thoughts as red and evil as hell i had to close my mind to them or lose it altogether and so i couldnt be sure until now and merely pointing his weapon scarcely taking aim at all jake pulled the trigger on rapidfire his weapon stuttered an obscene war cry ripping the girls heart to pieces inside her her feet left the floor and she flew backwards two full paces but before her heels touched down and tripped her lardis lidesci was looming up alongside with his machete already raised poor lass he said as his blade made a gleaming arc liz and jake even jake turned their faces away shooting the girl had been one thing instinctive a necessity even a mercy but what lardis had to do now was calculated butchery then trask was shouting thats it lets go weve got to get out of here right now and all four ebranch agents on the ground could see why the shadows were no longer creeping but rising up up from the stairwells and the lower decks up over the fourbar railings at both sides of the ship up into view the vampires had thrown caution to the wind now they came on like a flood with their yellow halloween eyes lighting the night and illuminating their sallow hollowcheeked faces scything among them jakes bullets cut a swathe as he emptied his magazine liz and trask too with lardis between them firing silver death as they backed up the ramp to the sea king whose blades were turning faster and faster as they got aboard david chung slammed and secured the door slammed it on the horde that swarmed after them while ian goodly signalled the pilot that it was time to go but the pilot had seen enough and needed no special urging he withdrew the ramp fed power to the engine began to lift off the sea king felt a little sluggish and trask switched on the intercom to ask is everything okay no the pilot answered those mad things are clinging to the undercarriage and the ones on the deck up front are trying to disable the fan jake who had run up front rapped on the pilots interior window until it was slid open looking out through the cockpit windows he saw what the pilot meant among the crush of vampires crowding the decks around the swimming pools several had chair legs and other pieces of broken furniture which they were hurling up at the gleaming blur of the blades and drop your nose jake told the pilot they want your fan so lets give it to them but but theyre people the pilot shouted no said jake they were people now theyre things and better off dead so do it or were all dead and as finally a wooden chair leg hit the fan and flew into a thousand splinters so the pilot got the message then he did as jake had suggested floated the big chopper forward dropped its nose and went ripping like a horizontal buzzsaw along the deck and jake had a clear view of the ensuing carnage the cockpits windows turned red yellow and black as blood and guts sprayed back from the whirling blades and the screams of the vampires could be heard even over the thunder of the big helicopters engine then she was rising but still sluggishly lopsidedly as the evening star was left below and behind now what trasks anxious voice on the intercom god knows how the pilot answered but i think weve got a bunch of those things still hanging on underneath yes trask told him theyre good at that but theres a cure for it take her up a couple of hundred feet into the sunlight and up they went until the sun was once more visible low on the western horizon and its cleansing beams reached out to the dragonfly plane golden fire blazed in through the windows but more importantly on the creatures that were clinging impossibly to the undercarriage and other projections liz was listening to them with them she felt the seething of the sun and heard their cries then their sighs as one by one perhaps thankfully they let go and went fluttering down the sky striking the sea from that height would be similar to crashing down on concrete none would live through it but in any case she didnt stay with them that long in the sea kings belly lardis lidesci wrapped the girls head in a jacket from one of the nbc packs while trask spoke to the pilot and asked to be patched through to invincible on a spare headset captain mckenzie sounded much subdued i saw something of what went on below decks he said and it seems i owe you an apology as for those poor lads my marines god only knows what i owe them but trask ive got to know what was so secret that i couldnt be told i tried to tell you trask answered and in fact we did tell your marines but they had their orders as i had mine said mckenzie so why couldnt the admiralty tell me i mean a plagues a plague but that had to be something else again it was said trask and it is but listen you wont be blamed heads higher up might roll but not yours and while it wont be much consolation we did get their bloody specimen it cost the lives of my boys said the captain quietly and probably saved a million more trask told him really this thing could have wiped us all out trask said and i do mean everyone until that ship is on the bottom it still can just tell your pilot to keep that chopper out of the way said mckenzie and ill have my gunnery commander take care of that right now good said trask and then you can have a party ready in nbc suits to wash the chopper down when we land and well also need access to your decontamination chambers all six of us and your pilot too and and a large airtight plastic bag for the specimen roger all that said mckenzie following which trask and his people crowded the sea kings windows it took but a minute the cruise missiles came in low like purring shortfinned flying fish over the winecoloured sea swift and deadly in the gloom of twilight their colour a dull metallic grey they carried death in their bellies though nothing so terrible as their target in the final seconds before they struck home just six feet above the plimsoll line on the evening stars hull trask remembered what ian goodly had said the shiptoship missiles going in the explosions the stem going up in the air and the rapid slide backwards off those rocks and as usual the precog had been right for that was exactly how it was the massive thunderclap explosions that ripped the stars hull open cracked her back and lifted her stem into the air twin fireballs going up amid a shower of twisted wreckage the fires raging within the vessel and all along her decks and finally the shuddering slipping and sliding of all those tons of metal as that onceproud ship keeled over backwards and began her last short journey to the seabed then there were only the fireballs rising still and a few scraps of burning debris drifting over the island and fires in the sea itself where fuel had spilled and ignited and perhaps among those fires some splashing but that wouldnt last for too long first warning after some wrangling with the greek authorities the minister responsible had sent a private jet out to the military airport in kavala on the greek mainland it was sitting on the runway its engines ticking over when one of invincibles helicopters dropped trask and his agents off a little after midnight along with the plane was a british embassy official and two specialists from porton down the former was there to lend substance to ebranchs claim to diplomatic immunity if necessary obviating any lastminute difficulties that might have arisen with the airport staff namely the greek military the porton down people were there to take charge of the specimen mr teale was a small bald middleaged bespectacled microbiologist of an apparently nervous disposition and mr kline was his young pimplyfaced assistant aboard the jet when the old lidesci presented them with a girls head in a plastic bag inside a steel pot with a clampdown lid from hms invincibles galley teale came very close to having a heart attack he had been bursting with questions since first meeting trask and his people on the runway none of which had been answered but now what in gods name he protested i was assured that you people would obtain a living specimen a person you mean trask answered him coldly obviously porton down hadnt been told everything or at any rate the people they had sent hadnt been told everything teale and his assistant still seemed to believe they were dealing with a mutant strain of the chinese plague an infected person yes said teale in a harmless sedated or comatose condition we have with us certain respiratory items and a fullbody protective suit in essence a body bag in which we intended to convey this this absent specimen trask wasnt in the mood for this and answered well you see she wouldnt come under those or any other conditions and since she had the will and the power to infect every single one of my team everyone on hms invincible and eventually everyone on this planet we decided her head would have to suffice and before teale could reply listen trask went on as patiently as possible myself and all of my people were sort of tired im sure you know how it is the last day or so hasnt been too easy on us now we were told to bring back infected blood infected flesh and a little brain tissue preferably alive well here we have infected blood and likewise infected flesh as for brain tissue weve brought you an entire head but alive teale scowled where he sat towards the rear of the jet with kline and took up the plastic bag all bloody and smeared within from inside the steel container the specimen was supposed to be alive preferably alive mr trask at that point trask might have lost it but before he could explode alive the old lidesci grunted taking the bag from teale and dangling it in front of his face so you think its dead do you but if i were to take this machete of mine and cut this bag open and if you should perhaps get a little of this blood in your eyes mouth nose or any other of your bodys openings then in three days time youd probably change your opinion anyway its all yours now but do take care of it wont you and dropping the bag back into the container he ambled back to his seat up front with the rest of the team and if i were you said trask i would make sure that lid is clamped down just as tightly as it will go and i would keep it that way all the way back to porton down for as my friend just told you its all yours now and believe me were very glad to be rid of it then without another word he trailed the old lidesci back to his seat near the front of the executive jet where the rest of the ebranch team were already falling asleep and from then on there was no more conversation with the people from porton down at gatwick airport teale and kline and the specimen were whisked away in doublequick time in a police helicopter while trask was met and collected by the minister responsible himself in another chopper courtesy of the ministry of defence at hours on a wet early november morning this was a rare privilege indeed and when they were under way trask asked to what do i owe the honour the minister responsible looked surprised what no shouting match he said no cursing or demanding to know what the hell i think im doing no questions about whats been going on over here while youve been swanning around in the med swarming said trask beginning to bridle its a joke the minister told him though how i managed it at this time in the morning and under these circumstances is a mystery even to me and suddenly trask noticed how drawn the minister seemed how pale and holloweyed so im not the only one whos been having a rough time of it he said anyway im too tired for shouting matches cursing and all that and as for the latter i dont much go along with it unless its used under considerable stress its a sure sign that a mans vocabulary is on the blink reallysaid the minister well right now i dont think ive ever heard so much silly fucking shit in my entire life which was more than enough to give trask pause and looking at the minister more closely now he said in your case it has to be considerable stress so would you care to tell me whats up and as the minister sat there turning it over in his mind getting his thoughts in order trask continued to look him up and down studying him more closely yet for already his talent was twitching away telling him he was about to become privy to certain truths that he could well do without the minister responsible a man who usually kept himself to the shadows who over the course of trasks thirty years in the mindspy business hed only met face to face on half a dozen occasions and always in emergency situations even in the corridors of powerwhere obscurity frequently ruled the ministers duties his responsibilities were obscure he migbt be someone in civil defence he was probably a boffin from the mod he takes care of things that no one else has time for i think in low whispers in those selfsame corridors of power that was how trask had frequently heard the ministers presence explained away for except to the very top people in successive governments he was literally a man with no name no precise portfolio even to trask and likewise to various heads of departments almost as secretive as ebranch he was simply the minister responsible he was in his midsixties small and dapper his thinning dark hair brushed back and plastered down in a fashion at least forty years out of date he wore he had always worn patent leather black shoes a dark blue suit and light blue tie and a waistcoat with an oldfashioned fobwatch his onceround open face was thinner now and deeply lined and his forehead creased with the worries of far too many years his bright blue penetrating eyes which was how trask would always remember them were a little rheumy his lips were turned down at the corners and his shoulders were weighted slumped and weary his general aspect was harried but you must have wondered what the hell was going on back here he began what with this porton down thing conflicting or very ambiguous orders and old uncle tom cobley and all trying to get into the act you must have thought that id let you down i considered it trask admitted but then i gave you the benefit of the doubt actually i was coming around to the same conclusion myself conclusion that perhaps we should get in some help with this thing trask explained that while in the past weve somehow muddled through perhaps those times are past and what we really need is some new blood if youll pardon the expression coming in on this someone or some outfit with new ideas a new perspective instead of trying to kill the disease at source maybe wed do better seeking a cure and if that were the case then who better than the porton down crowd they have always understood the secrecy thing the security aspect and theyve had many marvellous successes so if they could beat aids and come up with a jab against the new bubonic why not this too very understanding of you said the minister responsible but i think i should tell you that ive always been more than satisfied with your work ben it may not have seemed that way at the time but but we did get results said trask taken aback by the ben thing indeed you did said the other and personally i would be perfectly happy to let you go on getting results but somethings come up and its something that could take this entire thing right out of my hands and make me just another player in fact ive got a meeting with well all sorts of people heads of the national health service security civil defence chiefs of the army navy air force the police you name it in just half an hour so since were only fifteen minutes from ebranch hq where ill be dropping you off id better get on with it im all ears said trask and shivered because right out of nowhere he had gooseflesh he knew that this was going to be very bad youll still be our main man of course the minister continued the man who knows it all who has done it all the man with all the field experience you and all your people but from now on therell be a great many more people involved yes well keep as tight a lid on it as we can but sooner or later and probably sooner the public will want answers oh well do as we have always done lie to them but unless we get to grips with it our lies will eventually catch up with us that is of course if its what we think it is trask was beginning to feel frustrated now fine he said trying not to snap but as yet ive no idea what youll be lying about okay i can tell youre not really stalling so what are you doing why dont you get to the point i was giving you the background said the minister letting you see that we havent been sitting on our backsides doing nothing since this thing broke since the first couple of cases were reported cases that was the catchword and trask repeated it cases something has happened while weve been gone what in the last twentyfour hours cases of what even before youd gone the minister answered there was a handful three days ago another halfdozen leading up to your leaving and ten that we know of while youve been away but at first it didnt connect i mean i didnt tie it in with your work with what youd told me about that thing under london at which the truth hit trask like a hammer blow forthat thing under london could only refer to szwart the destruction of his lethal fungus garden in an unknown abyssal roman temple deep under the city but before he could voice his suspicions weve given it a name of course said the minister the symptoms suggested it weve also ascribed a cause we borrowed it from the american experience in new york in the fall of right on the turn of the millennium greyfaced trask nodded i think i remember that the hot summer and rains brought up a swarm of socalled killer mosquitos out of the sewers and underground systems they carried a bug that invaded the brain and several new yorkers died of it and weve had the same problem this past summer with mosquitos here in london yes said the minister so weve blamed them and weve called it a kind of sleeping sickness encephalitis letbargica but thats a lie too or we think it is though wed rather it was the truth for the fact is we cant be sure what it is but you and i we can take a pretty good stab at it right trasks thoughts were flying he thought of millie cleary and of jake jakes debriefing after hed rescued millie from szwarts subterranean lair and felt his blood cooling in his veins as he recalled the final part of jakes story i was barely in time szwart had opened a flue to the surface some kind of natural conduit for a wind blowing up from hell and that nightmarish mushroom garden was about to spawn one by one the blackcapped domes of the mushrooms were flattening out their gills opening and their first redcoloured spores beginning to drift free by the time szwart showed up a stream of red spores was floating in his direction carried on a draught of that foul stinking air but after i tore down that wall and let the methane in and after id lobbed my grenade well obviously i couldnt hang around waiting to see what happened next then the minister was looking at trask asking him whats on your mind jakes report said trask faintly almost to himself the minister nodded and remember ive read that report too so when i heard about these cases would you believe in the bloody newspapers midday yesterday and when id checked their locations how they were all clustered close to old underground railway stations then i saw the connection after that well i wasnt taking any chances i couldnt afford to simply wait and see the responsibility was just too great even for a minister responsible an epidemic is one thing ben and even a plague but a plague of vampires so you see i had no choice but to advise and then to seek advice since when ive been on the move nonstop or to use an old army expression my feet havent touched the ground what are the symptomssaid trask his head full of pictures of millie stumbling about in a dark cavern breathing red vampiric spores how does it affect its its victims god let it be something else they sleep the minister shrugged they cant be got out of bed or barely theyre sluggish slowmoving tired sleeping sickness ben thats what its like but for how long and then what that remains to be seen it will either stay go away or change into something else and meanwhile we have them in isolation wards but who takes care of them trask gripped the ministers arm are they in close contact with their nurses theyre in isolation wards ben the other said again i mean im no doctor but ive been given to understand its all rubber gloves and face masks and and isolation for goodness sake lord i hope so trask muttered biting his top lip but is that it nothing else no other symptoms maybe were simply starting at shadows shadows said the minister himself starting and giving himself a shuddery shake ah yes stupid of me hub maybe i could do with a good nights sleep myself and his eyes seemed more deeply sunken yet as he nodded and said yes there are other symptoms for one they dont much care for daylight and trask prompted him and they very quickly go off their food trask licked his lips his mouth felt bone dry desiccated but their doctors must have examined them he said what was their prognosis before youd voiced your own theory that is flu said the minister sleeping sickness malaise malingering and then after youd spoken up i mean what did you tell them to look for what did i tell them to snorting the minister slumped back into his seat when his wry chuckle came it was barely audible and more than a little hysterical ben now tell me just how big is one of these bloody spores does it invade the lungs or some other organ when its in the host body does it infect the blood first then the brain or both simultaneously how do we detect a metamorphic organism that can fuse with human flesh and blood how long does this metamorphism or mutation take we dont have any answers ben and you want to know what i told them to look for so what are they working with trask was licking his lips again how are they working trial and error god i hope not this is just too fucking dangerous for common or garden laboratory experiments common or garden said the minister not at porton down ben theyre the best in the world but this shit isnt from our fucking world trask said the minister sat up straight again and said i supose ill have to put that last down to considerable stress right trask ignored that and said ill ask you again what have the scientists at porton down got to work with i mean apart from what weve just sent them they have a whole specimen the minister answered but a dead one of course an old tramp who spent his last few months wandering in and out of kings cross with a brown paper bag and a bottle of methylated spirits huh said trask they asked me for alive one to make comparisons i suppose said the minister but a dead one trask was suddenly worried or rather he was more worried than before how did he die he was found asleep on the station they couldnt wake him up took him into hospital he died a few hours later when was this trask said anxiously now he was one of the first said the minister knowing his lifestyle there was no need for an autopsy theyd begun looking for someone to claim him when i dropped my bombshell after that porton down asked for him so by now hes been dead for for what something like three days maybe but trask had placed heavy emphasis on the word dead something like that yes then you had better have another word with the porton down people said trask grimly if they havent already started to slice him up they should watch his body very carefully on the other hand if they have cut into him then maybe they should start watching each other dont go over the top with this thing ben said the minister i know how bad its looking but weve called our best in on it and as i said its all rubber gloves and face masks and what have you which wont help one little bit said trask if this old gentleman of the road wakes up and starts biting people point taken said the minister and i will speak to porton down from your place before i go on to my meeting trasks mind was racing ahead now okay he said so im in the picture now what do you expect of me and mine well said the minister ive had more time to think it over than you and i do have a couple of ideas such as our gypsy friend from the vampire world said the minister ive been given to understand he can somehow smell these creatures out right lardis lidesci isnt just our gypsy friend said trask in his own world he was a chief who in his time was very much feared by the wamphyri as for smelling them out no one can be that certain but there are tests that can be applied yes on the other hand i dont suppose they go much on witchcraft down at porton down except it isnt witchcraft but alien chemistry so if its a surefire litmus test theyre needing tell them to try silver and garlic yes the minister nodded and at once slapped his knee in anger damn it all why didnt i think of that its just that it all seems so way out so over the top ive been your minister responsible all these years and still its as if your work has been some kind of fantasy i just havent got the imagination for it but yes ill tell them that too and then we have your locators mindsmog said trask that may be more difficult uncertain if these people have been infected with vampirism it may take its time showing maybe a group of them in close proximity would register on david chungs mental screen i cant say but we must certainly give it a try and then what supposing we do find a vampire plague brewing in these poor people well i can tell you what the old lidescis answer would be to that yes i know said the minister quietly it might yet be our answer too if the microbiologists dont come up with something in very short order he paused a moment then went on anyway as for you and yours thats all that will be required of you at this time but as soon as youve rested up or even before that i want you back out in the field doing what you and your people do best here at home well deal with whatevers coming but your job is the same as always to deal with the ones who have brought it upon us you are our avengers and despite all the menaces in a way i envy you trask looked out of the window they were descending toward the lights of central london like a vast bright spiderweb the citys wetly gleaming electric network spread out in all directions rotating with the helicopters motion and seeming to rise to meet them behind those swimming lights dwelled all that was known and human while in the darkness between them lurked something utterly inhuman a different kind of spider in the manmade web of the city and indeed of the world there are many millions of people down there said trask quietly how is it such a small handful of us have become responsible for so many not easy is it said the minister and now you know how i have felt and for more than thirty years millie cleary and paul garvey both telepaths were at the helipad on the roof to meet trask and the minister responsible the choppers down draught turned the rain aside blowing it horizontally at millie it grabbed at her umbrella and turned it inside out then flattened her blouse to her upper body and her skirt to her legs highlighting her trim shape in the strobing beams of the landing beacons she didnt seem to mind getting wet trask and the minister vacated the chopper and ducking low ran for the roof shelter with its stairwell leading down to the topfloor complex that was ebranch hq trask caught up with millie along the way and paul garvey took the ministers elbow guiding him in out of the rain behind them the helicopters pilot remained on board slowing his machines big fan to a tickover whop whup whup while waiting on the ministers orders on their way down the stairs millie dug her heels in dragging trask to a halt in order to hug and kiss him slow down she said then look the minister has put us in the picture as much as he was able and were doing what we can not that there was much we could do with you and the others away and now that youre back theres nothing much you can do either not tonight and not by way of work so will you please please stop forging ahead at least until ive told you that that it feels very good to have you back trask knew that last to be an understatement the way millie was pressed to him told him that much without his talent so much as whispering it millie upon a time shed been like a kid sister to him he had always had time for millie shed been here even before zek but always in her kidsister role and because of zek and the job of course shed never let trask know how she felt about him not until recently millie was in her midtolate forties but looked five years younger a very attractive blonde her hair was cut in a fringe low over her forehead flowed onto her shoulders and framed her oval face while partly concealing her small delicate ears her eyes were blue under pencilslim golden eyebrows and her nose was small and straight millies teeth were very white if just a little uneven in a slightly crooked frequently pensivelooking mouth five feet six inches tall amply curved and slimwaisted shed always made trask feel big and strong and sometimes clumsy he had always liked her a lot indeed a great deal and now knew that he loved her which made him feel a little guilty his wife zek had passed almost three years ago but she had been such a huge part of his life indeed trask had sometimes believed she was his life that it still didnt feel like she was gone it felt like she was still there and maybe watching and the last thing trask wanted was that millie be seen as someone who was filling a gap it was his loyalty that was all it was the truth of his love for zek an undying love that had yet made room for another he held her at bay for a moment then said come on weve work to do you and i the rest of the team are on their way in by limo from gatwick theres not much traffic on the roads so weve got maybe an hour before they get here by then i want to be able to delegate tasks from tomorrow morning at first light weve going to be working overtime as never before behind them as they reached the security door where trask blinked rain from his eyes before positioning his face in front of the retinal scanner they heard the ministers very audible sigh of relief hed obviously been listening to what trask and millie had said to each other and as he and paul garvey caught up with them shes right mr trask he said its always very good to have you and your people back and even though things are more complicated now its also good to see that your is enthusiasm the right word that your energy is undiminished but here in front of the minions as it were trask noted that the formalities were in place again smiling to himself however wryly he said thank you minister and then to paul garvey as the steel doors hissed open and they all four passed through into the hqs main corridor see that the minister gets to use one of our secure telephones will you paul and then hell be needing an escort back up to the roof then as garvey and the minister turned right for the duty officers room and millie and trask went the other way toward his office at the very end of the corridor the minister paused and called out oh and mr trask theres one other thing that seems to have slipped my mind youll find youve a rather important visitor normally wed accommodate and er look after him elsewhere but it seems hes intent on staying with you so since your hq is probably as safe as anywhere in the city hes all yours im sorry about this that in addition to what ive already handed you im dumping this on your plate too but in the current situation he could only offer an awkward shrug trask had halfturned back now who he was about to ask but millie knew what was on his mind and preempted him hes in your office she said and he seems a very nice man well considering some of the tricks hes had to pull to stay so long in power and trask knew the truth of it at once his visitor could only be premier gustav turchin himself he said as he and millie reached the open door to his office and the man in question stepped into view to meet them upon a time turchin had seemed an unshakeable rock of a man blockily built square of face and short in the neck with a shock of black hair bushy black eyebrows darkly glinting eyes over a blunt nose and an unemotional mouth hed been a veritable bulldog but that had been some years ago since when the russian premier had faced up to many problems in his vast everturbulent postcommunist homeland some of these problems when they had coincided with ebranchs had served to bring the two men together in several mutually beneficial endeavours the understanding between them and the respect they had for each other were still very apparent but as for turchin himself his physical appearance there had been changes he was much thinner less bright and sharp of eye and his hair had turned an iron grey the last time trask had spoken to him in person in australia only a few weeks ago even turchins voice had lost something of its former authority the intellect was still there but the dynamism was failing seven years of political power in a bankrupt country teetering on the brink of anarchy had taken their toll of him when things went wrong which they had and frequently then he had become a prime target for every disaffected disillusioned citizen some of whom were powerful members of the oncemighty military the one thing that had stood him in good stead was the fact that he had inherited control of what was left of the opposition trasks term for ebranchs russian equivalent the leftovers of a oncepowerful mindspy organization with headquarters in moscow the original soviet outfit back in the s had been leonid brezhnevs baby and very effective at first but successive failures most of them down to the highly effective activities of the necroscope harry keogh had disenfranchized the organization almost to extinction turchin always the visionary had given its members his patronage when no one else wanted anything to do with them in their turn they now gave him their support but even the opposition hadnt sufficed to save him from his current dilemma trask was privy to what had happened close to retiring a russian army general mikhail suvorov had learned that a parallel world called sunsidestarside was a huge opencast goldmine compared to which the klondike had been a worthless bag of frozen dirt also that beneath the perchorsk ravine in the ural mountains a manmade singularity or gate the result of a failed nuclear experiment would provide access to all of this previously undreamedof wealth and also a possible invasion route into an entirely new and defenceless world as the cinc of two military gulags at beresov and ukhta punishment garrisons straddling the urals east to west general suvorov had been perfectly placed to take charge of perchorsks decommissioning when turchin had ordered the place flooded but the soldiers hed sent in to do the job had been other than the team of military engineers that hed made them out to be in fact they were hardened longterm criminals and he had offered them the choice of serving their sentences or serving him thus after theyd stripped the massive lead shielding from the complexs power plant and after the legitimate engineers had moved out suvorovs crew had stayed on as caretakers at perchorsk having then drained the complex to allow the general and a team of geologists and soldiers passage through the gate these men were still there waiting on his return and the rich rewards hed promised them but they would have to wait a long time for in fact mikhail suvorov was dead on starside where nephran malinari of the wamphyri had sucked him dry of all knowledge of earth and of the gates and of life itself however when general suvorov had entered starside despite the fact that gustav turchin had let him proceed unadvised of the dangers that might be lurking there but suspecting that such might be the case he had not been so naive as to simply step off into a parallel universe without some kind of lifeline or at least a connection to his homeworld and so hed told a handful of military cronies that he was onto something big something so big that it could even change the course of history and elevate russia to her former might as a world superpower but in the event he was gone for too long then they should start asking questions of the premier recently they had been doing just that and now it seemed turchin had had enough of it ben he said reaching to engage trask in a none too firm handshake and then a little nervously well and here i am and it couldnt be at a worse time trask answered looking around his office i see they somehow managed to leave you on your own with all my little secrets turchin lifted a bushy eyebrow and followed trasks gaze to a large wall screen then to the filing cabinets the computer the intercom and other gadgets on his desk and ah he said but no for your mr garvey switched them all off from his duty office anyway i was not alone and in any case how could you even think it is there no honour not even among mindspies trask allowed himself to grin youre an old fox gustav he said indicating that the other should take a seat too old turchin answered and now i have gone to ground or rather ive been driven to earth oh and incidentally when mr garvey turned off your toys it seems he also turned off the central heating ive been feeling the cold a long time ben even before i got here and now im tired of it this charming lady was helping me warm up a little i was doing my bit to entertain the premier millie said indicating the glass of whiskey and a halfempty bottle of wild turkey standing on a corner of trasks big desk yes said trask and warming him up with some of my best booze at that but do help yourself then he noticed turchins overcoat and fur hat hanging from the horns of a coatstand just inside the door they were still wet and so am i said millie in that new very disconcerting way of hers her telepathy with which she read his mind something shed previously kept under control or at least trask had always assumed she kept it that way and when he remembered some of the things he had thought about her backside and occasionally when hed been thinking these things the way shed looked at him in that less than innocent way of hers now as she headed for the door he saw that she was blushing but she covered her confusion by saying i think perhaps i had better change out of these wet things anyway i suppose you two have plenty to talk over in private ah privacy said trask drily yes i remember that personally said millie as she stepped from the room i think it should all wait till morning youll only manage a few hours sleep ben and mr turchin looks very tired too the ministers people delivered him to us only a few minutes before you arrived and i gather his getting here was a bit er circuitous after shed gone turchin said the lady in your life and unless i miss my guess a telepath at that the slightly purple bloom under her eyes gives her away i think you are very fortunate my friend is it that obvious said trask the telepathy no the other thing ah yes very said the premier well then said trask uncomfortably and now lets get to whats not so obvious what exactly is going on gustav and what if anything have you brought with you only please dont tell me youve brought trouble because right now i have plenty of my own turchins tradeoff the sleeping and the undead still on his feet trask said first lets get things back on line shouting down the long echoing corridor he called for paul garvey to reactivate his office and closing the door and seating himself face to face with turchin across his huge desk he said there and now we can be more comfortable then as grilles in the skirting boards began blowing warm air and various small lights flickered into life on the office equipment he took out another glass from a desk drawer topped up the russian premiers drink and poured a double for himself and okay he finally said now i can hear you out i take it i am not being recorded turchin was still very nervous almost everything is in this place trask told him pressing a key on a small console but now were not no good said turchin next and in the event things dont work out can you guarantee me safe haven political asylum trask raised an eyebrow i dont see a problem with that on the other hand the if things dont work out bit tells me you dont intend to stay here not if you can help it so obviously you have plans but before we get to that who knows youre here your minister said the other at once and you and your people im supposed to be attending another earth year conference in paris it starts tomorrow and my talk is scheduled for the day after that which means that in about thirtysix hours time people will begin to wonder where i am how did you get away from your er minders in australia trask had experienced some small problems in getting to see the premier in private so his defection should have been even more difficult after that little diversion you created in australia the other answered causing those exkgb security men to lose me i took the opportunity to accuse them of gross incompetence and sacked them i still command or should i say commanded that much power at least as for my new minders as you call them i contrived to choose them from among my own people the opposition turchin shrugged lets call them minor talents shall we tomorrow night they will announce my disappearance and in their turn apply for political asylum in france so it will take your opponents back home some time to figure out where youve gone thats part of the plan yes trask shook his head you really are the fox arent you but i wont ask you the details of how you got here ill just take millies word for it that your route was circuitous and tiring and very boring said turchin but take it from me if i left any trail at all it wont be an easy one to follow oh they will trace me eventually but i think it will take several days and then theyll want to know why were hiding you said trask why were protecting you and what from or far worse theyll want to know why weve coerced or kidnapped you so in offering you political asylum we could be about to initiate a major international incident you are covered turchin said at once for if our plans fail then i shall announce my own defection on television the bbc if you like but on the other hand if we succeed we said trask and our plans i would not have come to you if there was any way i could do it by myself turchin threw up his hands but it seems you have a short memory ben out in australia didnt you give me to understand that if i helped you you would help me well i tried to help you and for my trouble got a man killed by that slimy drugrunning dog castellano in sicily also i promised to discover what i could about the current situation in perchorsk and i have done so in short ive attended to my part of our agreement in full indeed when you see what i have done youll agree i have more than fulfilled my commitment all very well but now i need your help you should remember ben trask that i could have done as suvorov did and knowing the dangers i would have stood far more chance of success instead i chose to go along with you and nathan and protect sunsidestarside you should remember these things calm down trask told him i havent forgotten im just calcualting the odds before i place my bet thats all and the odds are good lets face it with all the border disputes the anarchy the infighting between various moscow mob families which amounts almost to war on the streets and the rest of the problems you have in russia right now mere political shenanigans cant mean all that much why your enemies may not even notice youve gone missing and then realizing how that must have sounded i simply mean that i know what you mean turchin cut in that im not even a figurehead any more merely a puppet and there are plenty of other toy premiersinwaiting just looking for the opportunity to jump onto the strings yes and you are right so if i cant be important in russia if i cant help guide my homeland into true and lasting democracy then let me be of assistance here believe me ben if you want to close the perchorsk gate and close it forever so that it cant be reopened you need me and if we can do it my way according to my plan then ill be able to go home in triumph with all the political er shenanigans behind me i do want to close the perchorsk gate said trask yes i desperately want to close it and for good even though its like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted the horse said turchin bolted explain okay said trask now listen you already know what ive been doing you know my problem you know about all three problems because i told you about them in australia but you dont know whats gone on since then and how bad things have got so what if i were to tell you that all of the troubles youve left back home dont hold a candle to the real threat and then suppose i told you that its no longer a mere threat but a reality and that its happening right here and now turchin gulped at his drink stared hard at trask and said it is here and now a plague of vampires capable of creating monsters such as those that once invaded perchorsk eventually they could definitely said trask and its more than likely they will once theyve created sufficient of their own kind now turchin gasped and said but what are you saying are you telling me theyve come out in the open are you saying theyre recruiting oh theyve been recruiting ever since they first got here trask answered but always covertly in secret in hiding a gradual stealthy very insidious infiltration but that was then and this is now now its as if they dont care who knows about them and in a way its my fault or ebranchs your fault turchin frowned and trask nodded you see weve been too successful i dont follow you turchin was plainly lost how could you be too successful by destroying everything theyve been working for trask told him by taking everything away from them until now they have nothing left to lose and you have done that then briefly trask explained about malinaris vavaras and szwarts fungus gardens how theyd been destroyed first in australia then on the greek island of krassos and finally in a forgotten subterranean vault under london except we may have discovered the london garden just a little too late he finished off and yet again explain said turchin attentive as never before and trask told him about the strange new malady in london perhaps in the world and also what he feared it might be then after a moments dumbfounded silence but is it under control i mean can you contain it turchins face was very pale now what are you thinking trask said that perhaps youve jumped out of the frying pan into the fire no turchin shook his head and continued give me some credit ben my thoughts dont always revolve about myself but frying pans and fires huh actually i was thinking about this entire world going up in flames my thoughts precisely trask nodded which might explain my coldness and why ive been less than the perfect host indeed said the other quietly as for containing it trask went on thats not going to be my problem its already in hand or so im informed by my higher authority and im to continue tracking down our three invaders so even if your defection works out to be a temporary one still its come at a bad time i could have used your help gustav with your agents as colleagues or even comrades no longer the opposition they could have come in very useful you can still count on my help said turchin my people have been working on it ever since we er joined forces in australia as i said ive kept my word my espers are not without their resources which i set up for them a long time ago and they will be able to pass on information well as long as i am here to receive it in person that is then what more can i say said trask except that youre very welcome good said turchin and now if youve finished bringing me up to date i think its time i explained my plan okay said trask lets hear it best to have all of our cards on the table turchin nodded and steepled his hands in front of his chin a moments thought and then he began im sure youll remember the trouble we had with chechnya twelve years ago when poor old boris yeltsin was in power of course i do said trask the western world gave russia a hard time because of its heavy handedness yes but as i recall russia was no more heavyhanded than nato was over kosovo turchin replied then waving a hand dismissively anyway please lets not argue about it the point is the chechens have never forgiven us and less than a fortnight ago there was a chechen raid on one of our missile sites oh yes weve retained a few one of my agents i suppose youd call him the russian equivalent of your mr chung is nuclearsensitive on a worldwide scale and when he became aware of a weapon or a lethal amount of weaponsgrade uranium on an unscheduled move across the russian countryside specifically toward moscow that was when i had my people step in to cut a long story short i prevented a raggletaggle chechen suicide squad from trying to destroy moscow heads might have rolled in the military but i kept quiet about it for two reasons one panic among the civilian population and two i had my own idea how this bomb might be used er need i say more on that point i dont think so said trask even a small nuclear explosion inside the perchorsk complex would be enough to bring down a million tons of rock and if that wont block the gate then nothing will correct said turchin and so i gave back the missiles casing and engine but secreted the actual warhead away until i could devise a means of smuggling it into perchorsk naturally the major in charge of the site more properly a dump was delighted to accept my suggestion that the purloined missile had never been equipped with a warhead in the first place it was either that or his would be one of the heads doing the rolling said trask indeed and between us we kept the whole business hushed up where is this warhead now trask inquired and for that matter if we could get it into perchorsk how would we arm it obviously it was designed for an aerial delivery system as to where it is dont ask said the other even with your talent you probably still wouldnt believe me and i have already seen to its conversion even now or especially now there are still plenty of outofwork scientists in russia who will do almost anything to avoid starvation as for getting the bomb into the perchorsk complex the premier looked at trask in a certain way his eyes narrowed his manner conspiratorial but nothing is impossible eh ben where theres a will theres a way eh a will or a skill whatever meaning said trask knowing perfectly well what turchin meant that even a job like that wouldnt pose much of a problem for a man who could access the most inaccessible places at will someone such as a necroscope for instance but unwilling to reveal anything unnecessarily this early in the game meaning turchin frowned and glanced away for a moment then narrowed his eyes more yet and said meaning exactly what i said that if one wants it badly enough one can usually find the means to an end to any end but for now let it suffice to say that i dont think it will be a problem or rather that i hope it wont be a problem and leave it at that as you wish said trask keeping a poker face and hiding his pleasure at the fact that turchin looked more than a little perplexed and wrongfooted now and anyway we need to get on so is that it your plan to get this bomb of yours into perchorsk and detonate it there i can see how that would solve one of my one of our major problems but i still dont see how it will get you reinstated and strengthen your power base back home leave that to me said turchin as long as its done on my mark believe me all of my personal problems will be solved my position will be unshakable and dйtente will reach heights never before realized which will be of benefit to both of us personally and most certainly to our countries our world trask nodded and said thats assuming our countries and our world are still ours i understand said the other but at least no more vampires will be coming through the perchorsk gate nor the gate in romania said trask which was blocked when malinari and the others came through and that will leave our hands free to deal with the invaders who are already here said turchin with them and with whatever theyve spawned here well make that our priority its already been my priority for some three years now trask answered and will continue to be until i until im finished with them then i think we are all done here said turchin except i have brought you a small gift he took out and opened up an oldfashioned silver cigarette case with a spring clip holding in place twenty cardboardtubetipped russian cigarettes then held it out over the desk toward trask i dont smoke said trask nor do i said turchin well not these filthy things with which he spilled the cigarettes into a wastebasket not now that i can get some of your excellent british and american varieties and then he pulled on the clip to remove the waferthin scrolled silver plate in the tray of the box and there coiled in that secret place like so many black pubic hairs lay roll upon roll of microfilm and carefully replacing the plate he snapped the case shut and passed it across the desk to trask trask raised a querying eyebrow and the perchorsk schematics said turchin that place is a vast underground complex a veritable maze im sure that when the time comes to go in you wouldnt want to lose anyone down there especially not with an atom bomb ticking off its countdown eh standing up trask put the case in his pocket my people will be arriving shortly he said ill need to talk to them before letting them get a few hours sleep or maybe millie was right and i should leave it till morning theyve had a fairly stressful time and need a break and so do i and after all theres very little we can do tonight pressing an intercom button on his console he said paul i take it youve arranged accommodation for our guest ill meet you in the corridor garveys voice came back as they left his office trask took turchins arm and said just one other thing you said wed have to wait to deploy the bomb on your mark can you say why and when that will be shortly said the russian premier expremier or premierinwaiting whichever believe me i too am eager to see this thing finished but ask yourself this what use to spring a rat trap if the rats are not inside it again trask raised an eyebrow but turchin put a finger to his lips and said ask no more questions my friend my plans are laid and it would do you no good to know any more in the kremlin we have a saying ignorance is innocence while knowledge is culpability we have the same saying trask replied but it comes out a lot less obliquely than yours and from a very different viewpoint what you dont know cant hurt you precisely said turchin and for a brief moment his dark intelligent eyes glinted as brightly as ever they had in former and perhaps better times a brightness cold as the cutting edge of a razor that boded ill for somebody or bodies along with paul garvey trask saw turchin to his room nothing less than a hotel room because ebranch hq occupied the entire top floor of what had once been an hotel and saw him settled in in the morning he said well make sure youve got some of your favourite booze and whatever else you need to make your stay comfortable you are very understanding said turchin one last thing said trask go where you like in the hq except where you shouldnt go its not that i dont trust you but the place is full of alarms i shall go nowhere that i am not invited said the other as trask and garvey returned along the corridor towards the duty officers room garvey asked do you really trust him youre the telepath trask answered what did you sense me i couldnt detect a single untruth in anything he said the mans as happy as can be to be avoiding all that deep political shit back home actually he was thinking how much he owes you said garvey but he was also wondering how much be can trust you in his shoes said trask id be doing the same thing the elevator monitor showed an ascending cage the rest of the team members had arrived but suddenly trask felt too tired for briefs debriefs or almost anything else in the wee small hours of the morning what good would it do anyway ill want an o group at he quickly said as garvey made to enter the duty office make sure they all know will youand then on second thought better make that whats an extra hour anyway youve got it said garvey and before the elevator could stop and its doors hiss open trask put on a little speed and made it to his own room inside he was about to switch the light on when millie said we dont need it why dont you take a shower freshen up and then come to bed while im still awake but better hurry because i cant promise ill stay awake too long she was already in his bed he showered then called paul garvey and said if anything happens before morning let it youve got it said garvey again indeed i have thought trask getting into bed and millies loving arms she was still very much awake and oddly enough trask discovered he wasnt all that tired either not yet dont you ever sleep trask asked the minister responsible at this morning for about an hour said the other gruffly what are you complaining about ive allowed you as much time as i could oh in preparation for what ill need you and your people asap specifically a telepath and a locator and trying to think ahead the precog trask was awake now and making a poor job of getting dressed while cradling the phone between his cheek and his shoulder well it wouldnt hurt to know what were in for wouldnt hurt me either said trask so whats happening some of our sleepers are starting to wake up the minister answered they look more or less normal a bit pale and they still dont much like daylight but other than that garlicsaid trask as millie came out of the shower and stood looking at and listening to him and silver said the minister weve tried both with no positive reaction as yet trask breathed a sigh of relief so what youre asking for is what confirmation that these are just people and we were barking up the wrong malady or do you think we should start looking for mindsmog yes i can see that it would explain why you want a locator and now that our specimens are waking up it might also be a good thing to know what theyre thinking said the minister and to know if theyre answering our questions truthfully trask nodded which involves me and my telepaths he said okay but i have an o group in twenty minutes fine said the minister but id advise you to make it a quick one therell be a chopper on your roof in an hours time with seats for four id suggest your mr goodly mr chung yourself and a telepath of your choice me millies sweet mouth silently framed the single word while she continued towelling her hair where will we be going said trask bleakstone in surrey what a prison for madmen psychotic murderers arsonists rapists and lots of other very irresponsible citizens is that where youve put the sleepers where better said the minister i told you they were in isolation they have a wing to themselves where theyre in the care of a very specialized staff see you on the roof said trask and put the phone down me said millie again out loud now and determinedly and trask couldnt see any reason to deny her it wasnt as if thered be any real danger not this time except therell be some pretty sick thoughts floating around in that place he warned her oh really millie answered as she began to get dressed well its very obvious youre no telepath ben trask i mean if you really want to know sick why dont you come with me on a walk through the city some time but i mean sick sick said trask yes said millie and so do its not the ones on the inside that ive ever felt concerned about not until now anyway bleakstone was on the south downs not far from arundel a relatively new institution the medical authorities had weathered a storm of protest during its planning and building but that had been nine years ago and in the interim bleakstone had earned a reputation as a second alcatraz not one inmate had ever broken out were landing half a mile away near the road into petersfield said the minister as their helicopter passed high over the grim grey prison walls closer than that we might disturb the delicate equilibrium of the place the last thing i want is to excite its regular inmates there are some really twisted types in this place right said trask looking down on the fortresslike complex with its towers exercise yards and frequently windowless cell blocks the worst said the minister down in the guts of bleakstone literally underground thats where they keep the truly menacing ones they feed them keep them as clean as possible sedate them when theyre not behaving and watch over them for the rest of their lives until they die naturally thats about all they can do but frankly having read some of their case files if it was up to me id speed that latter process up a little youd take out the dying naturally clause said millie a little coldly causing the minister to glance at her and i fully understand why you would find that objectionable he told her and ordinarily i would agree that its a drastic solution please dont think im some kind of heartless brute miss cleary but consider yourself fortunate that you havent read those case files they were picked up on the road to petersfield by a uniformed prison guard in a vehicle that looked like an ambulance on the outside and a reinforced cage on the inside and driven a halfmile farther out into the countryside and down a private track to bleakstone prison one hundred and fifty yards from its entrance they passed through tall electrified gates and a barrier operated from a security post where on both sides of the road triplecoiled razor wire stretched off into the distance following the contours of the land by which time the general mood was ominous in keeping with the gaunt aspect of the high walls that loomed ahead how about it trask asked chung as massive steel doors opened inwards allowing them access but the locator could only shake his head there are too many distractions he said i mean this place was frightening enough from the outside and theres lots of steel in here and a hell of a lot more concrete im thinking about how grim it is instead of concentrating on what it might contain maybe when we actually get to see our suspects and you trask looked at goodly as the vehicle came to a halt the precog was as cadaverous pale and sunkeneyed as the stylized undertaker he always seemed to epitomize there is a very definite atmosphere here he said but its as david says it conjures up pictures of its own so that i cant even be sure my talent is involved i see pain a lot of it but im not sure that the pain i feel isnt mine yours said trask as the driver opened up the back door of the van to let them out you mean youre hurting it could be just the atmosphere said the precog i mean the now atmosphere or it could be tomorrows pain or the day after that or any future time i cant say if its significant in this place said their driver who could have no idea what goodly was talking about everyone hurts sooner or later and if you work here its sooner you need eyes in the back of your head which wreaks havoc with your bleedin nerves but if youll accompany me gentlemen the doctors should be waiting for you he led the way from the exercise yard through an arched entrance with the legend west wing carved into its keystone down a long clinically tiled and antisepticsmelling corridor that reminded trask of nothing so much as a recently disinfected toilet in londons mainly defunct underground rail system past several security doors to a junction of passageways lined with various offices laboratories surgeries and storerooms here at least the place was starting to look more like a conventional hospital finally they were shown into a room under a sign that said simply psy and millie murmured now if that was psi i think i might feel a lot more at home two men in casual clothing presumably psychiatric specialists were seated in swivel chairs before a reinforced observation window or oneway viewscreen as their visitors filed into the room one of them quickly rose put a finger to his lips and cautioned them be reasonably quiet if you will although these rooms are soundproofed the patients sometimes sense vibrations vibrations trask glanced at millie thinking perbaps it should be pst after all or someone cant spell very well she answered and that sign should read psylence pardon said the man on his feet looking from one to the other inquiringly i do apologize said trask but vibrations ah said the other i meant in the floor when there are a number of people in this room they sometimes feel vibrations in the floor the patients that is he indicated the screen then while trasks team moved carefully toward the screen the minister responsible produced a governmental id card which served as his introduction and indicating trask said my good friend and his team here are experts or the closest thing we have to experts in the recognition of this er malady and he quickly added always assuming that is that your patients are indeed carriers hearing what he had said trask was appreciative he didnt want his or his agents names bandied about in public the anonymity of the branch was everything and if or when things broke he didnt want to be quoted as any kind of source so now he and his espers were simply experts he turned to the doctor who had introduced himself as doctor burton offered his hand and said i take it that you and your staff that is bleakstones staff in general have been fully briefed in this matter i dont want to sound overbearing or come on like some kind of witchfinder but if this is what we think it might be then i honestly cant put enough emphasis on the potential dangers youre facing here doctor burton was tall young and goodlooking with a wide forehead and intelligent blue eyes now as he took trasks hand and shook it his forehead wrinkled up and he said weve been briefed yes but i have to tell you sir that what weve been told sounds more like the mouthings of some of our inmates than the legitimate i know trask cut him short i know just exactly what you mean and that is the greatest danger of all that you find it too incredible has anyone given it a name not up front said the other but we arent simpletons the alleged symptoms and method of transmission speak for themselves you do understand that im a doctor of psychiatry yes i see that you do well this isnt the first time ive met up with vampires neither myself nor my colleague here but on those occasions they came to us looking for help they werent brought to our attention by well by experts and of course they were only sick people said trask sick in their heads yes doctor burton nodded and do i look sick in my head said trask do my people does the minister here no of course not not at all then please take my word for it trask nodded and treat these patients of yours with extreme care at least until weve found a way to clear them or not the second psychiatrist small thin and fragilelooking was on his feet now introducing himself as jeffrey porter and offering his chair to millie he stood with his colleage at the back of the group while trask sat beside millie with chung and goodly on their flanks the minister responsible hovered to one side keeping silent he left the rest of it to his experts now it was millies turn but trask knew he didnt need to say so like a waft of sweet air she was in his mind something he would never have noticed except that he had come to recognize the feel of her but in the next moment the sensation passed as she left him to go probing elsewhere and hes not thinking anything very much she said but what thoughts there are seem a little frightened also angry and concentrated i believe its mainly anger and frustration but trask wanted to know concentrated as in forced as in deliberate frustrated as in trapped what do you reckon she glanced at him out of the corner of her eye you mean is he trying to throw us off the track but if he doesnt know were here i dont see how he can be anyway doesnt that presuppose a certain talent she meant telepathy trask frowned this early in his development it seems unlikely he shook his head the he they were talking about was a youth seated in one of two easy chairs in the room on the other side of the screen the room wasnt much larger than a cell and was sparsely furnished between the chairs stood a small round table with an ashtray a packet of marlboro cigarettes and a box of matches plus a cake stand decked with cheese biscuits and a small selection of hors doeuvres mainly small sausages and cubes of cheese on miniature skewers in one corner a door stood open displaying a washbasin and toilet while the actual door to the cell was closed and fitted with a small barred window although the furniture wasnt screwed down or in any way secured the windowless walls were padded the mirror must be a dead giveaway trask murmured to no one in particular and doctor burton who was still trying to work out what trask and millies brief very cryptic conversation had been about answered it isnt a mirror but a pastoral scene very tranquil as for the furnishings they rather depend upon whom were observing and since there is no real evidence of aggression in these sleepers he let it taper off then added oh and in order to comply with our briefing the ashtray is of silver and those hors doeuvres contain plenty of garlic good said trask but the lighting is artificial true said the other but since the day is overcast there was nothing we could do about that and anyway we think it likely that this photophobia is a natural part of the awakening no one is partial to a bright light shining in his eyes the moment he wakes up it could well be a symptom of the real disease i mean in the event your suspicions are erroneous trask said nothing but thought they dont believe and millie murmured who can blame them the youth in the room was fidgeting a little looking this way and that his expression was trapped bewildered annoyed angry as millie had said maybe eighteen years of age he was dressed in casual mismatched clothing and badly scuffed shoes he was pimply and spikehaired with an unevenly cropped beard that gave him a goatish look where did we find him trask wanted to know he was one of these socalled aggressive beggars on one of londons mainline stations doctor burton answered weve had him for three days now but hes only recently awoken hes been in this observation room for about half an hour which probably explains his fidgeting has he eaten said trask synchronicity because even as he spoke the youth took up a skewer clenched his uneven teeth on a sausage and a piece of cheese and began chewing now trasks agents leaned forward intent on watching what would occur next which was nothing the youth finished off the skewer and took up another and doctor burton sighed heavily saying ah well and so much for that theory it wasnt hard to detect a heavy note of sarcasm in his voice hiding his annoyance but also sighing his relief trask said how many sleepers do you have here sixteen in all said the doctor but so far only four of them have woken up and then as the door with the barred window began to open here comes another right now we desired to see how they would interact so we chose two entirely different types or classes perhaps this will be more interesting and we know for sure that this one is a smoker hes also a lawyer by the way and hes been threatening lawsuits since the moment he woke up messing with the mechanisms the lawyer was as tall pale and almost as cadaverous as ian goodly that was where any similarity ended for while in the precogs eyes there was a warmth belying his looks in the lawyers eyes there was only a cold malicious glint and he too was angry shown or rather ushered into the cell by two burly whiteclad interns who then left and locked the door behind them he stamped his feet brushed himself down then whirled and hammered on the door shouting who the hell do you people think you are dyou think you can get away with this do i look as if im suffering from some mutant bug some new strain of of this asiatic plague i had my bloody shots the same as anyone else maybe theyre what put me down so do i have to sue the bloody national health service too god damn his pinstriped suit was crumpled tie askew shirt collar flapping loose and he hadnt yet shaved three days stubble made his chin look blue against the pallid parchment of his hollow cheeks now he whirled again this time to face the youth who sat there looking at him and who are you he snapped dont you go takin an attitude with me mate said that one it looks like were in the same boat they said as how i might ave contacted somebleedinthing meself i dunno what theyre on about thats contracted said the lawyer as he flung himself into the empty chair and what theyre on about what theyre up to is holding us in isolation against our will certainly against mine here if youre in need of representation once were out of this place contact me by god but these bastards are going to make me rich well i could certainly use some o that said the other pocketing the card and reaching for a third skewer then the lawyer patted his side pockets shook his head in disgust and pointed to the cigarettes yours naw said the youth elp yerself the lawyer lit up then reached over and drew the ashtray to his side of the table his contact with the silver was only momentary because it didnt need to be any longer but his expression never wavered he showed no sign of pain or revulsion whatsoever except at being detained in this place and so much for that theory too said doctor burton on the other side of the screen well trask looked at millie and beyond her at the precog where he stood then turned and looked at chung is there anything do we have anything at all they said nothing looked undecided which he took to be a negative but then millie said and how about you youre the one who can usually tell the difference between true or false so are they on the upandup or what trask shook his head and frowned worriedly im stymied he said maybe its because im looking too hard or it could be that im relieved it isnt obvious but in any case this is getting us nowhere and weve other things to do so thats it were finished here do you people always talk to each other in code doctor burton inquired as he showed them out into the corridor where their driver was waiting er weve worked together for many years trask told him im sorry if we appeared to be rude not so much rude as weird as bell thought burton who had seen some weird ones in his time but then millie turned to him with a curious expression on her face and said and were also sorry if we seemed weird people are always accusing us of that the two doctors accompanied them to the exercise yard as the team was getting into the back of the van goodly paused turned to burton and said please remember what you have been told this visit hasnt proved anything thats true but it hasnt disproved anything either you should watch all of those sleepers very closely and the longer you detain them the more closely you should watch them if things are to develop at all it may take some time can you say how long it will be said the other i mean before we can clear them this facility has its priorities you understand we do have other work to do and the minister responsible replied of course we understand but especially in a place like this you must understand that public safety and the governments priorities come first ill let you know as soon as im able until then nothing has changed as you will said burton a little sourly on the way back to the chopper trask turned to the precog and asked were you having second thoughts back there i was having thoughts certainly said goodly which is more than i can say for myself said millie and i got a kind of i dont know mental fuzziness said chung but nothing specific nothing i could put a finger on but it didnt feel right right said trask all three of them could only shrug and look blank and the minister responsible said i do hope i havent made a terrible mistake or rather i do and trask said but best to err on the side of prudence and still unwilling to let it go he vent on well it didnt feel right to me not at all and turning again to ian goodly what do you mean you were having thoughts i mean i was wondering about something said the precog we know what effect the vampires bite has also what happens to a victim who is totally drained of his blood and even what occurs with the introduction of a leech into the human system all such things are well documented but where spores are concerned we know so very little go on said trask when i was a boy goodly went on my uncle had a farm in yorkshire in the woods nearby was a large pond where the lower branches of the trees trailed in the water i remember watching moorhen chicks hatching out in their nest the first thing they do these little fellows after theyve broken free of the eggshells they jump in the water and swim said trask i think i know what youre getting at so do i said millie the devious nature of the vampire is it inherited is it instinctive in them from the very beginning do they know to protect themselves without knowing why and is that what happens to these sleepers while theyre unconscious do they become aware if only partly but that lad ate garlic said the minister maybe the changeover isnt complete yet said trask and the lawyer touched silver but briefly said trask then sighing he sat back the simple fact is he said that we dont know but one thing is for sure we do know we cant take any chances just as soon as you get the opportunity i think you should call burton and his colleague and make your point a lot more strongly for example i didnt like the way those two interns just thrust that lawyer chap into the observation room that was contact and it was very close contact i certainly hope the boffins at porton down are being a bit more careful so do i the minister nodded and the precog said one other thing im simply hazarding a guess of course but that sensation of pain that i was feeling what about it said trask well said the other considering the sort of place that bleakstone is and also the volatile nature of its more regular inmates if anything ever did break loose in there the result would be a whole world of pain for someone said trask very quietly yes i see what you mean in the observation cell in bleakstone the lawyer was quieter now he stood up took three paces to the large picture on the wall pressed hard with his fingertips against the glass that covered it and said hmm bulletproof and its not simply a picture its very odd but do you know i sensed them there watching us they seem to have gone now i know said the pimply youth i knew they were there too but i dont know how i knew something is telling me that we should watch ourselves said the lawyer returning to his chair we must watch what we do and say or we could find ourselves in big trouble but if we play it cool said the other sooner or later theyll have to let us out the lawyer nodded then cocked his head on one side in an attitude of listening and said ah those doctors are coming back so lets be patient until we find out whats happened to us and whats going on here until we know why those others were what frightened of us suits me said the youth and as the lawyer reached for the hors doeuvres dont theyre not not right for us really said the lawyer as he paused and picked up the cigarettes instead this time he left the ashtray alone there was a burning in his thumb and forefinger and there was something about the ashtray that he didnt like but now they had to stop talking for the doctors were back in the room beyond the pastoral picture then when the youth stood up the lawyer asked him just where do you think youre going thats between me and ma nature said the youth closing the toilet door behind him and all unseen as quietly as possible while shuddering in every fibre he emptied his seething burning stomach into the toilet bowl back at ebranch hq in the afternoon trask called liz merrick into his office and told her to close the door and sit down and without pause how are you getting on with jake he asked her as well as can be expected she answered just a little stiffly and he hasnt been looking at all sleepy if thats what youre asking no said trask and neither has millie thank god but if youre worried about them liz said pointedly then surely you should be even more worried about me i was with vavara and her women for quite a while and for part of that time i was unconscious yes and ive been with you most of the time since then said trask and i do trust my own five senses not to mention my sixth youre okay liz im sure of that but surely you must understand my concerns about jake and im not just talking about szwarts vampire spores but weve been over this before said liz and jakes ready to take whatever tests youve set up for him hes more than ready hes eager thats not the whole thing said trask look i dont want to get personal but i mean i dont quite know how to put this you dont have to put it she answered youve already put it youve been trying not to but youve been thinking it ever since i walked in here no we havent slept together not yet but dont think i dont want to trask relaxed a little and said liz im sorry but you know were into this too deep now to let personal feelings get in the way its just too important and believe me there are no words to express how relieved i am that youve had the good sense to good sense nothing she said hotly i want him more than i ever wanted anything and now she was flushed and there was the silvery gleam of tears in her eyes jakes the one who is holding back he is the one whos got all the common sense the guts fortitude and bloody pride oh jake wants me and goodness knows he could have me but not while koraths there not while that damned godawful leering vampire thing is there sharing his mind with him that in the main is whats holding him back the fact that he wont share me and its why we have to see that he gets rid of it but only one of the reasons said trask for me right now its the only reason i need said liz yes i love him dearly and just as you love millie just as you have millie so i want jake and suddenly trask felt guilty here he was warning liz off jake but hed spent last night with millie and liz was right the danger was the same on both sides standing up he moved round his desk took her in his arms and as she sobbed a little said its all a matter of priorities isnt it sweetheart maybe my priorities have been wrong and ive put my head before my heart but i thought my reasons were good ones oh they were they were she said into his shoulder and maybe ive been selfish too trask went on gruffly i just didnt want to admit not even to myself that millie might be that she could be in trouble too liz drew away to arms length and said whats next ben i dont want to search your mind for it im frightened what i might find in there so just tell me what are we going to do to hell with the tests he told her then they can wait i dont think they would prove anything anyway i saw that this morning so this time lets get the priorities right we have a job to do and i need my agents on it in full force which includes millie and jake but an idea has been growing in me its a kind of a kind of prayer ive been saying to myself over and over again ever since those damned things came through the gate from starside if only harry keogh were here oh god how i wish the original the real harry was here but he isnt said liz no but he could be said trask something of him could be through jake cutter lizs jaw fell open a little jakes been in contact with him once or twice but but he couldnt handle him said trask didnt understand him let him go and now her eyes opened wide you think we can somehow get harry back enlist his aid we can try said trask excited now indeed we have to try and you know liz weve done some very marvellous things here in ebranch he released her pushed her towards the door now get out there and whistle me up some agents chung goodly and millie and jake of course see to it theyre all together in the same place he glanced at his watch in fifteen minutes time in the same place she repeated him but where in harrys room trask told her where else were only missing zek trask said when the specified agents had convened in harrys room those few words in addition to the location which in ebranch was the holy of holies served immediately to quell any speculation among those gathered there except for jake cutter everyone present now knew more or less why he or she why they as a group were here were missing zek and nathan ian goodly corrected trask they were powers those two and especially without nathan our task will be that much harder but we can make up for them in numbers at least with liz and millie so whatever it is you have in mind ben and since this time were not attempting to move a world it strikes me we have a good team jake cutter was mystified er dont i fit into this somewhere he said i mean whats going on jake there are some things we need to know trask told him questions we have to ask but the real expert the only one who might be able to answer our questions with any kind of genuine authority is no longer available no longer with us we do know though that harry keogh was irresistibly drawn to you that he found an affinity with you and your mind we know that for sure because of what youve experienced what youve become a necroscope said jake with precisely the kind of naivety that conjured pictures of the young harry keogh himself the necroscope trask answered him the only necroscope on this planet anyway so you want to know where you fit into this youre the focus the magnet and this room is the genius loci or maybe youre that too i dont know uncertainly jake glanced from face to face finally found lizs and paused there she nodded eagerly and said it could clear a lot of cloudy water jake and tell us a lot of things we badly need to know that is if we can help you to find the original necroscope or him to find you and now he got it so this is what some kind of experiment part of those tests we talked about in a way said trask i suppose you could say that yes but thats not all it is we want to know about vampire spores without finding out the hard way since harry was converted by spores who better to ask wed like to know whats happening in sunsidestarside where nathan and other friends of ours are fighting the selfsame battle against vampires also were interested in harry himself where is his principal focus now and if youre his legacy to us does he intend to carry on his work through you and how and last but not least wed really like to ask his advice about your unwanted tenant for you see jake we believe that harry was once in the same fix that he was possessed by the spirit of faethor ferenczy and so might be able to suggest a way to get rid of this korath creature but jake was accustomed to it he ignored it nodded his partial understanding of what trask had told him and asked so how will we go about it do you intend to play gadgets and ghosts again where harrys the ghost and im the gadget there is no other way trask answered youre our only connection with harry you and this room which was once his can you smell the musty air in this room jake harry breathed it so if there was ever a place where his essence lingers on this is it when he first discovered you he brought you here not once but twice its like a nexus binding whatevers left of him to our world genius loci like i said his spirit of place said jake and yours now said trask as to how well go about it this isnt the first time weve done this sort of thing as ian hinted a moment ago the last time was on starside then we had zeks and nathans help and without nathan we couldnt have done it at all we moved a world jake turning it on its axis until the sun shone on starside the end of vampiric life throughout all the vampire world so we thought huh but this time were not looking to move anything merely to attract something its like recovering a lost file in a computer we are the disks so to speak and also the power source and harry is the lost knowledge said jake and im the monitor screen but can it damage me i mean what if it blows my chip what if my mind overloads or something in our experience said trask the mind of a necroscope of the necroscope is a hard thing to overload without wanting to put you down i have to tell you that you dont know half of what harry knew or nathan and they didnt know half of what the dweller knew youre young your brain can accept a lot of knowledge yet so i dont believe theres any danger in it for you indeed it could well be your opportunity to grow to learn the rest of it but i cant make you do it the decision is yours let me think about it said jake just give me five minutes to think it over or rather to talk it over with korath said liz reading it in jakes mind surely you know hell try to talk you out of it she was anxious now yes and i fully expect him to jake answered but often as not koraths word games and arguments supply as much information as they conceal they let me learn things for example if he wants me to do something then its invariably to his advantage and if he doesnt its usually to mine i only need a few minutes and go right ahead said trask well give you some privacy and when youre ready you can call us back in he indicated to the rest of the team that they should leave was last to go and closed the door behind him then jake pulled a wheeled chair out from under an ancientlooking computer console sat down in it and looked around the room he looked around harrys room and wondered why it looked and felt so familiar for what was it after all but a small and outdated hotel room oh it had been fitted out with a computer console but that had been a long time ago in harrys time genius loci well maybe on those previous occasions when hed been in here he hadnt really had the time to think about it but now on his own with nothing pressing nothing pressing said korath apparently or ostensibly astonished these friends of yours want to call up some freak out of space and time some ghost who has already tried to take over your mind more than once and you dont feel any pressure what are you insane youd swap me for him but why should you when im nothing more than what trask called me an unwanted tenant thats all i am jake a tenant to whom youve let a room for which youre now sorry while im very grateful but as for this harry how do you know he doesnt want the whole house oh and by the way i beard what you said about me about my word games and arguments but of course theyre to my advantage naturally they are isnt that the very nature of arguments jake shook his head and chuckled however wryly he couldnt help it and you know something korath he said if malinari and those others hadnt rammed you into that pipe if you had somehow managed to die a natural death do you know how you would have ended up youre so twisted they would have had to screw you into the ground ab a joke said korath while considering my expulsion your exorcism jake corrected him you find room for crude jests be warned jake whatever else you do dont make an enemy of me and remember this that whatever trask says about the human minds capacity its mechanisms are delicate things the mansion of your mind is furnished and i am in here with all your treasures suppose i should er stumble and bring sometbing crasbing down ah who can say what damage such an accident would inflict upon you treasures said jake a little warily memoriesss korath hissed habitsss instinctsss and what of emotionsss for example can buman love become lust ah but the dividing line is narrower than you tbink far narrower than the centuries separating you from barbarous ancestors so then what if i were to pick the lock on the primal you the avatar that lies buried in your genes to let him loose youve been reading over my shoulder again said jake but so illuminating said korath so fascinating and oh so revealing of your current penchant all those great heavy books on psychology were required reading said jake if i were carrying a tapeworm id need treatment medicine a physical solution but in your case since youre a mindworm the answer has to be metaphysical some kind of exorcism yes but i wasnt about to let anyone else mess with my mind before first reading up on it myself and it was useful i learned quite a bit and i have been learning about you said korath darkly but then as if afraid of divulging too much he quickly continued as for the books the reason for my interest is simply stated since you sought an answer to me i must seek an answer to the answer but see how low i am fallen how are tbings come to this that i am now considered a mere parasite but you always were said jake you and every other vampire who ever existed so stop playing with words and listen to me do you know why im bothering to talk to you at all to torment me to gloat over me perbaps for the last time before these mentalist friends of yours attempt my removal ah but what if they fail wbat then of our relationship our partnership jake do you think ill ever trust you again about as much as i trust you said jake but in any case youre wrong im not gloating not yet for i know well enough that you wont be a pushover but on the other hand if they do succeed in banishing you back to that black sump where malinari left you well i just want you to know that i wont let you rot there thats why im talking to you hah said korath another joke for i bane already rotted there i meant said jake that im not about to let your bones lie there in the dark i wouldnt sentence anyone not even a rabid dog to an eternity of night and despite that youre a loathsome parasitic thing you have saved my neck several times over for that well i owe you a decent grave at least and ill see that you get one you can take that as a promise and after a moments silence your vow said korath wonderingly yet with something in his voice that hinted that jakes offer hadnt been totally unexpected my vow yes jake gave a deadspeak nod and frowned for he was just as surprised at himself as korath should have been what said korath trying not to gurgle his pleasure which by all rights should have been his astonishment are you really offering to take my bones out of there but why and whats in it for you as to why jake shook his head im not at all sure you can put it down to my ridiculous probably illfounded sense of fairness i suppose fair play korath a human folly yes but if i befriend you if i show you mercy maybe the teeming dead will give you some leeway too who can say in time they might even review your case maybe they wont exclude you ah said korath and now i think i understand for you have known the misery of exclusion too though never to the extent that i knew it before you discovered me in my sump indeed the great majority are wary of you still thanks to you said jake but compassion goes a long way with the dead if i can show a grain of mercy even for a creature as terrible as yourself then they will think well of you said korath yes i see do you see said jake with a frown for now suddenly it seemed to him that korath was supplying logic for feelings and emotions that he himself didnt understand oh yes i see several things said the other his deadspeak voice hardening again but mainly i see a clever ploy to quell my fighting spirit making it easier for your friends or this harry keogh to cast me out hah for if a man believes in heaven he will die that much easier alas jake but the wamphyri their lieutenants and tbralls have no such faith even if there were a heaven thered be no room in it for them no you shall do your worst im sure and i shall resist you with all my strength no matter what you promise i expected nothing less said jake with a shrug but if they do find a way to kick you out ill keep my word anyway as you will said korath but if they should fail which they will do not expect leniency on my part for i am what i am and above all else tenacious then thats it said jake conversation over im out of here and with a bit of luck so will you be and very shortly let the battle commence said korath with no quarter asked and none given i fight for my existence with whatever weapons are to band as you will said jake equally resolute but i mean in the event of my failure which isnt going to happen but if they actually do find a way to cast me out jake gave a sad shake of his head and before he opened the door to call trask and the rest of the team back into the room sighed and said no need to concern yourself korath speaking for myself if only for myself a promise is a promise how did it go said liz much as i expected jake answered he doesnt want it to happen but on the other hand i dont think hes too afraid of it either even if you get harry back here if you can manage to invoke him korath doesnt think hell be any real problem if he did im sure he would have argued a hell of a lot harder but no while hes not about to take any chances korath really doesnt believe harry can expel him frankly neither do for the fact is that harry keogh is less than korath oh he was a power in his own time yes but now hes scattered diffused thinned out while korath however incorporeal is real and embedded in my mind i should know i invited him in after all of your own free will liz nodded in order to save me whichever jake shrugged but hes in there and you did er talk to him said trask who for all his time as the head of branch and despite all the evidence of his six senses still found the concept of the necroscope fantastic so that he had to force himself to accept it yes i did said jake and i went easy on him made him a promise i told him whichever way it went that when i get an opportunity ill shift his bones out of that sump and give them a decent burial you were trying to bargain with him said ian goodly no said jake but he has my word on it anyway the way i see him the way i remember him when harry first introduced us is as a frightened creature trapped in a nightdark place for ever soulless but sentient and totally lost and alone the great majority wont have anything to do with him his thoughts go unheard madness brings no relief i cant imagine any worse torture and its neverending so im going to bury his bones where i can go and talk to him now and then i dont understand said trask this creature is ruining your life he has to be the ultimate voyeur theres no privacy with him in there no thought you can think that he wont eavesdrop as long as hes around you cant ever have a life of your own i wouldnt have a life of my own but for him said jake and not just me he looked at trask and the others pointedly trask shook his head in disbelief man youre even beginning to sound like him cant you see what a word game this is its a circular argument jake you feel you owe him because he saved our lives but it was korath who put our lives at risk in the first place when he messed with your numbers maybe but i still think he can teach me things jake was as stubborn as ever and millie came in with are you saying you dont want rid of him after all of course i want rid of him said jake while yet wondering if that were really so but then he looked at liz and said damned right i do but i want him where i can access him in a place where i can still talk to him but on my terms you see of all the great majority he is one of only a very small handful wholl have anything to do with me i mean whats the good of deadspeak if i cant use it at which trask relaxed a little sighed his relief and said you know jake you really had me going there in fact i think you had all of us going but as trask spoke suddenly jake noticed the selfsame look on all their faces a worried look fading now that said for a moment there they hadnt known what they were dealing with and he could understand that well enough for hed just this moment realized that neither had be known what he was dealing with feeling weak and cold jake reached for the chair to steady himself i im not myself he said as he sat down with a bump not at all myself and he absolutely meant it liz was there beside him at once her hand on his shoulder what is it jake she said trying to probe him his shields immediately went up turning aside her telepathy and millies too for all five of them were focusing upon him now the precogs weird talent attempting to scan his future chung like a lodestone and ben trask doing his best to read the truth of it whatever it was but none of them getting through because his shields were that good and the only trouble with that was that jake hadnt raised them it was something he said to me he choked the words out his face writhing korath liz gripped his shoulder harder still what did that bastard say to you he hinted he could mess with my mind jake answered and that could be why hes been keeping so much to himself recently hes been practising and now i think hes actually doing it messing with your mind trask snapped how he called my mind a furnished mansion jake growled and said hes inside with all my treasures my memories habits and instincts he wanted me to consider what would happen if he had an accident that brought something crashing down and he wondered what the result would be if he released my primal avatar the basic instinctive animal meeee jakes lips had drawn back from his teeth in an utterly uncharacteristic snarl glaring his hatred at his his what his tormentors he thrust liz away from him came surging to his feet which was when trask hauled off and hit him and the lights went out calling harry keogh on coming to jake found himself bound to the chair with computer cable and with his jaw still aching from trasks knockout blow and likewise his head where it had slammed into the wall the last thing he needed was koraths deadspeak voice hammering away at the back of his mind didnt i warn you what friends of yours these people the very first time you act as your own man attempt to regain something of your independence and what happens this trask who everyone holds in such high regard strikes like the treacherous dog he is after all you have done for them no after all we have done for them to knock you unconscious and tie you down and now perhaps youll stop this ridiculous charade come to your senses and begin to fight back and i shall be with you all the way but fully in the picture now jake brushed korath aside and looked up groggily at the people surrounding him three of them wore wary watchful expressions one other was very obviously concerned she was dabbing at jakes lip where hed bit it when he was hit while the last ben trask looked as mean as jake had ever seen him and for an old man jake mumblingly told the latter you hit pretty damned hardy consider yourself lucky trask growled after what i saw just five minutes ago its a wonder i didnt shoot you dead but you didnt because you recognized the truth of it said jake barely in time trask nodded before you got completely out of control it was what you said about your primal avatar the basic animal you also what you said about not being yourself i didnt see the truth of you because your shields were up but i could still read the truth of your spoken words damn right you werent yourself that was him pulling your strings hes done it said jake found a way to get at my mechanisms knows which buttons to press which means that from now on liz said youre going to have to keep a very tight grip on yourself if anything doesnt feel right doesnt feel like you thatll be him and youll have to fight it all the way it means a lot more than that trask growled unless we can shift this bloody thing or find a way to block it jake is going to be useless to us and to himself in fact he wont be himself theres no way were going to work with someone whos likely to turn on us at any moment most probably at a crucial time also it strikes me that this time this first time korath wasnt in complete control that he was clumsy i dont know maybe he was desperate and pushed too hard on the pedals but if hes only just learned how to drive and if that was the result how soon before he memorizes the owners manual and gets it down pat the one thing hes not short of is memory said jake he got it from malinari whose talent is eidetic thats how korath remembers the mobius equations those numbers which i guarantee would baffle any of you if harry keogh hadnt passed on well whatever it was to me theyd baffle me too which in turn means that what were attempting here has to be now or never said trask it seems to me weve caught this just in time before its had a chance to really take hold but on the other hand if we should fail he looked at jake and his expression was bleak and jake said ill spend the rest of my life in a cell try in a straitjacket said trask and strapped down to a bed whatjakes jaw fell open figure it out for yourself said trask a mind under the control of a vampire a mind like yours capable of doing the things only you can do running completely amok not a hope in hell jake madness and the mobius continuum just dont mix if you got loose we could never take you again and we could never know what youd do next or who youd be doing it for you see you see i was right korath howled but only jake could hear him are you blind cant you see i was only protecting you you must not let them dabble jake you cant let them fool with your mind im embedded now melded witb your inner being apart of your very identity if they attempt to rip me loose who knows what else might go with me have you forgotten what you said about prefrontal lobotomy mightnt this work out the same and if so will you ever again be yourself oh why dont you shut the fuck up jake groaned then shook his head wildly bared his teeth and began to rock to and fro in his chair its korath again liz gasped going to her knees beside jake its him i dont know what hes saying or trying to do but i can feel him there raw and ugly like a running sore festering in jakes mind are jakes shields down trask yelled as the precog and the locator grabbed jakes arms holding him still and yes all four of his espers answered as one person hes fighting with korath said liz a mental struggle as if with himself hes fighting to keep his shields down so that when we find harry he can let him in but apart from that its a complete and utter shambles in there millie said falling back and leaning against the wall his thoughts are spinning like a wall of whirling numbers a mathematical cry for help but his aura is awesome said chung hes a giant dynamo running wild and his future his immediate future is ahhh the precog staggered clutching at trask with one hand he held on to jakes arm with the other but the hand and arm that held jake were vibrating as if from an electric shock what do you see trask barked i see i see i see harry said the precog and suddenly jake was still and everyone in the room knew instinctively what he or she must do jakes chair stood central the ebranch team closed in on it joined hands and made a circle around it and as on several previous occasions they acted as a body or rather as a mind one mind willing it to happen chung was the locating force his probe went out searching for a once wellknown nevertobeforgotten psychic signature trask clung to the truth of things willing that it come true and sought to dispel all lies and evil millie and liz linked minds as well as hands and followed the locators probe where it washed out from him on its mission of discovery and goodly held them together carried them all forward second by second into the everdevious future jakes eyes were wild wide bulging his teeth were clenched in straining jaws sweat dripped from his chin the bastard is hes fighting me he groaned but he isnt he isnt going to win and in his mind no ah no nooooooo korath howled his denial then fell abruptly silent for something had come something was here jakes eyes closed every straining muscle went slack his head fell forward onto his chest the light in the room dimmed the temperature fell in the space of mere seconds the room was cold but it was more a psychic than a physical chill and jake was no longer jake or rather his outline in the chair seemed to have taken on a different shape harry chung breathed where he almost hung between trask and millie his signature was faint but unmistakable he came speeding from oh from far away and i cant say if it was space or time or both or neither i mean he was here and yet he wasnt isnt i mean i dont know what i mean from space and time said the precog looking as gaunt as ever in the sudden gloom from a different space perhaps and a time between but on the other hand he has always been here this was his place said trask in an hoarse aside to liz on his left she being the only one present who had never actually known the original necroscope and i knew that if we were to find him it would have to be in here but how can we be sure its him said liz her voice shivery in the eerie hush of the place what if its korath making fools of us all i can be sure its him said chung and me said trask now tell me liz millie is jake in there or not he was asking them to probe the apparition telepathically the apparition that was the only way to describe it on the one hand it was jake tied to a chair but he was scarcely solid his outline shimmered lit from within by the only real light in the room and superimposed in jake seeming to drift or hover within and around his slumped figure the neonblue foxfire outlines of a boy were plainly visible his young features picked out in the glow from within he was a threedimensional transparency a hologram a faint but otherwise perfect computer image in outline consisting of myriad luminous traceries he was like an electric etching on glass or water all of him drifting within and without the host body so that now jake really was the gadget for the moment at least inhabited by a ghost tentatively liz and millie had attempted telepathic contact but their first instinctive thought had been simply who even knowing who still they had asked the first question that entered their stunned minds the boys face he would be maybe eleven or twelve years old had been contemplative lost in some reverie it was as if hed been daydreaming as if he hadnt known he was here at all or barely until theyd spoken to him but now his eyes blinked behind his plain prescription spectacles focused and gazed translucently out of his hologram at the people surrounding him even so it would have been difficult to say whether he saw them or not until he said no need for that just use your natural medium of speech now that im here ill hear you anyway even as you hear me he said it and they heard it all five of them heard it as clear as crystal but his lips hadnt moved at all telepathy but so advanced it left them all agog awed in the presence of a boy this mere boy who spoke with a childs sweet voice a mans authority and a supermans skill in all five of their minds simultaneously and harry said trask sure yet unsure the young boys face turned toward him frowned for just a moment and concentrated its nearimmaterial gaze then smiled its recognition and said but surely ben you of all people know that i am or was or that i will be then he turned his face again turned his whole body yet without moving a luminous limb or twitching an immaterial muscle to look at the locator david chung he said more certainly now you sent your probe to guide me home home said the locator still astounded by what hed achieved knowing that while it was a team effort his talent had been their mainstay their carrier wave your home home to you this now this place said harry only one of many homes then sensing a query he turned to millie and smiled i remember you well he said you were always sorry for me and i for you we were both looking for something that couldnt be found but how could you expect us to recognize you millie asked him wonderingly the harry we knew was older harry looked down at himself at his scruffy threadbare illfitting secondhand school jacket and seemed puzzled by what shed said or perhaps by what he saw he fingered a shirt where the top button was missing and tugged gently on a frayed tightly knotted tie bearing a faded school crest the harry you knew he murmured frowned again and asked of no one was i older but then the outlines of his empty eyes narrowed in dawning understanding and ah yes he said of course its just that being as i am or not being it gets confusing and different times and places i mix them up there are so very many times and places millie the myriad universes of light are full of them and i well i have to be here and there but rarely all here and never all there so tell me now is this better his last three words were spoken in an entirely different and far more mature voice but one strictly in keeping with the metamorphosis that was taking place the schoolboy harry with his ignis fatuus freckles neonrimmed eyes and starry spectacles gradually faded and another later harry took shape this one the one they knew suited jakes figure much better which was probably why their picture of him seemed that much more clearly defined they saw the neon outlines but they also saw what they desired to see what they remembered best or perhaps they saw only the image that harry wanted them to see the one that he projected the figure superimposed on jake was the same boy for sure but hed be twenty or maybe twentyone years old now of a wiry build he would weigh somewhere between nine and a half and ten stone and stand seventy inches tall his hair springing from a high brow and roughly brushed back was the same sandy rebellious mop as before and despite that his nose and jaw had firmed up and were now more angular in keeping with cheeks that were hollower still his boyish freckles were visible as a handful of luminous dust motes high in the contours of neon cheek bones more than any other feature harry keoghs eyes were especially interesting looking at the ebranch team they seemed to see right through them as if they were the revenants and not the reverse but they had been ohsoveryblue those eyes even unnaturally so so that one might think their owner was wearing lenses not the electric blue of this neon image no yet somehow the neon reinforced the memory and for all that the apparition was in the main a hologram memory of the harry that trask and ebranch had known still there was something in those eyes that said they had seen a lot more than any twentyyearold had any right seeing this then was the man himself or what remained of him the exnecroscope but in fact theyd known him far more intimately in his second incarnation when harry had revitalized and inhabited the braindead body of alec kyle in short he was as they seemed to remember him those of them who were fortunate enough to have known him but liz hadnt known him only what shed read and heard of him his gaze had gone from trask to chung and then millie and skipping the precog it now settled on liz and a new one he said new to the inner circle weve never met before or after this is the one time the one place its a real pleasure and for me she answered tremulously and then no we never met but i could sense you there when you were talking to jake he is the reason weve called you here because he needs your help jake and again the apparition frowned your focus liz told him your your genius loci ah jake harry let his electric arms float wide looked down into himself and said this jake then he looked at liz again and so we have met after all i remember now his mind was full of you and of one other but she was only a memory and now theres only you i wish there was only me said liz and she almost broke the circle by starting forward but theres korath too korath said harry but this time while his lips didnt move his eyebrows came together in a grim frown yes i remember him too and how i warned jake not to have anything to do with him but are you saying that korath is in here now trask spoke up saying harry jakes problem is only one of the reasons we brought you here an important reason considering whats happened between you but only one of many and korath isnt the only vampire were having to deal with in fact we could be about to suffer a plague of vampires which is why there are things we still need to know about them about those three who came through the gate with korath but jake was there with me when i talked to korath he knows about them all of their history except that was while he dreamed are you saying it didnt take he didnt remember it took eventually said trask he did finally remember it all but malinari vavara and szwart theyre only the start of it or rather theyre the source of what could end up being the real problem they have been at work here in your world in this world in what was my world intent on trask harry was leaning forward now half in and half out of jake and his neon eyes were brilliant in their passion right now theyre running wild trask nodded we did a lot of damage wrecked three years worth of what they had been doing here now it looks like theyve gone on the run and they dont care what havoc they leave behind them also we mightnt have been as successful as we thought what have they done harry growled now what corruption have they spilled here and trask told him about szwart his cavern under london his fungus garden the spores that he might have sent drifting up into the citys night air then harry groaned and his neon outlines wavered becoming even more indistinct before slowly firming up again and trask commanded his people hold on to him all of you hold on yes harry nodded other times and places call other worlds and other hosts so you had better ask your questions ben while im still here to answer them spores trask said what do you know of them i fell victim to spores said harry faethor ferenczys spores hed been dead a long time but it made no difference i made the mistake of thinking i could simply talk to him because he was dead and gone so how could he possibly harm me also i slept where his fats had rendered down in a fire but his metamorphic filth was still there lying dormant in the ground his vampire essence knew i was there it put up black toadstools i breathed their spores and the rest you know you were one of the last to see me in your world you zek and poor penny this was the closest the exnecroscope had come to reality to making real sense and trask believed he knew why dispersed throughout all the universes of light still his basic instinct was to do what hed done in life and in life he couldnt abide the thought of vampires this was what had taken him to jake in the first place a task left unfinished in life and jakes vendetta with luigi castellano had provided harry with an opportunity to put things right the scarlet vampire lifelines that hed seen merging with jakes blue human threads in future time which was now recentpast time had been those of castellano and his gang and despite that harry hadnt remembered the lost years when hed destroyed castellanos vampire forebears at le manse madonie still hed sensed something of the continuity of their evil but vampires are vampires and they all leave the same crimson trails in mobius time the exnecroscope had confused luigi castellanos trail with malinaris vavaras and szwarts for which reason he had taken jake to visit korathoncemindsthrall where malinari had murdered him these thoughts were only semioriginal to trask who previously hadnt been privy to all the details but as he thought back on what he did know so harry read his mind and was able to fill in the blank spaces and my lost years he said and so at last all is explained in my lifetime it would have destroyed me and the teeming dead knew it so they protected me for my minds sake however mistakenly it seems theyve gone on protecting me as he finished speaking he wavered again rapidly fading to a neon mist and trask cried for gods sake keep him here we may not be able to get him back and as his espers concentrated on harry so he once again firmed up spores trask gasped then we need to know about them what more can i tell you harry shrugged but not negligently after you were infected trask pressed him did you fall asleep did you sleep for any length of time for that seems to be whats happening here we have these sleepers also did you know you were infected were you aware and did you try to protect yourself from that time forward as a vampire its all so very hard to recall said harry this world this life this existence one out of many but did i sleep i seem to remember that i was made to sleep drugged it didnt last protect myself i remember feeling threatened certainly i suppose i must have protected myself but since i was preparing to go up against janos another ferenczy surely that was only natural i meant said trask did you try to conceal yourself to hide what youd become from men not to any great extent harry shook his head but then how might i conceal myself from ebranch from david chung no way from poor darcy clarkes telepaths impossible my vampire signature was written in my mindsmog but darcy i did protect myself from him yes how could i know it would lead to his death you see said trask becoming frustrated now i need to know is there any way to detect a spores infection i mean in the early stages are there any positive symptoms how can i tell if a man has breathed mutative vampire spores and is commencing to change and how long does that change take in short how much time do we have a lot of questions said harry wispy again and i dont have any answers not as gospel i can speak only from personal experience then that must suffice said trask how was it for you how long after breathing faethors spores did you know for certain that that you were in trouble just a few days said harry but without the mobius continuum i might not have suspected it for quite a while in fact the actual condition came on quite slowly its symptoms as you call them my love of the night a liking for raw meat and the redness in my eyes were things that came later and as you know ben i fought them for us said trask and for myself said harry for if id submitted then i wouldnt be here or there or anywhere now no for you would have seen to that but you won said trask we all saw it how you escaped into the myriad universes of light i wondered if you would said harry i tried my hardest to show you and you all of you your talents did the rest but the continuum was my medium and in the end it was my saviour too but escaped no i died and went on the mobius continuum said trask returning to what harry had said earlier you said that it gave you your first indication of your condition how exactly when i disposed of faethor along the futuretime streams harry answered i stood at the threshold of a futuretime door and watched my blue lifethread unwinding out of me but it was tinged with red there was that of the vampire in me and it was growing trask grasped the concept immediately grasped the truth of it and said jake has access to the continuum of course said harry looking puzzled for i gave it to him in your world your now jake is the necroscope but just like you in your time trask continued he may have pushed it too far come too close i see said harry slowly and now you would like him to test himself by following his thread into the future and checking that its colour stays true but if jake is in fact infected do you think thats wise and in any case it may be pointless how so because korath is in him at the moment suppressed as is jake himself by my presence let me explain before i got rid of faethor my lifethread was tinged red we both supposed this was his fault that being a part of me his presence was tangible made visible in mobius spacetime but i tricked him into leaving my mind and when he left i erected impenetrable shields still he clung to me but i dislodged him and sent him into the loneliest future any creature has ever known but while faethor was gone my thread was still tinged red i suppose it had been his plot to usurp me entirely which is possibly koraths plot too this time with jake as the vessel so if jakes lifeline is red said trask thats because of korath you wont know for sure until he gets rid of korath said harry but in any case your advice to jake should be to avoid trying to read the future at which ian goodly said as you avoided me he sounded a little hurt the future is a devious thing said harry turning now to the precog oh i know that your talent has often stood you in good stead but you of all men must surely be aware that it can also let you down i wasnt so much avoiding you ian as finding you hard to read in many ways your mind is much like mine it wont stay fixed in one time i cant help what i am said goodly nor should you apologize for it the other answered but as for myself i was wary of the future i only rarely followed future timestreams and then not to the end and as it happens this was a wise precaution because if id known the end of it i might very well have ended it myself and much sooner you would have saved yourself a lot of pain said goodly believing that he understood and saved the pain of others said harry having me as a friend was a dangerous business the apparitions neon outline was wavering again his blueneon filaments fading trask cautioned the others to leave the questioning to him urged them to concentrate instead on keeping the exnecroscopes revenant focused in the here and now and returned anxiously to his previous theme harry you said we cant be sure of jake whether or not hes contaminated until he gets rid of korath is that possible i mean bow can jake rid himself of this monster and if he cant could you perhaps do it for him and beside him trask heard lizs fervent prayer oh yes god yes please let it be so harrys neon glow was an intermittent pulse now like some failing light source he came and went and similarly his telepathic voice in their minds fading and strengthening moment by moment but never coming back to its full strength the lure of this spacetime was weakening and likewise the teams hold on him and as he retreated from them psychically so their needs retreated from him his answers took longer and his responses became more vague listen everyone trask snapped you have to concentrate as never before else all our efforts go for nothing keep him here and then to the fading image harry can you hear me can you answer me harry said the other queryingly like a faint echo from far away you want to speak to harry but there are or have been or will be a great many harrys which one is it youre looking for its you we need trask cried but im in so many and so many are in me said the apparition so take your pick is it the one you see or and the boy was back elbow on knee chin in hand strange eyes staring into some illdefined distance this one he said in his boys voice which trask was gratified to note was a little stronger now or maybe one of these harry said in a barely remembered voice as he metamorphosed into a startledlooking alec kyle a previous head of branch his guises his incarnations or host bodies in however many worlds and times came and went in rapid procession a brawny blackhaired szgany youth with strangely familiar features an old whitehaired mage a baby in a crib in a garret room with a sloping ceiling a gaunt crimsoneyed spectre of a man in mummy wrappings a thing with tentacles and a naked throbbing threelobed brain a furry wolflike creature with triangular eyes whose hands were those of a man a burned smoking figure in the shape of a crucifix tumbling endlessly head over heels in darkness until finally or perhaps this one harry grunted in the obscene but far stronger sardonic tones of the wamphyri and there he sat as trask had last seen him in the flesh the monstrous vampire lord that harry had been before departing earth for starside for comparison jake cutters central outline the shape of a fullgrown man was like that of a child a waif within the things neon framework harry was wearing an entirely ordinary suit of illfitting clothes that seemed at least two sizes too small for him and his upper torso sprouted massively from the trousers framed by a bulging jacket that was held together at the front by one straining button the wedgeshaped bulk of his ribcage was hugely muscular his opennecked shirt had burst open at the front revealing the ripple of musclesheathed ribs and the powerful depth of his chest the shirts collar stuck up from his jacket like a crumpled frill made insubstantial against the corded pillar of his leaden neck his flesh gleamed a sweaty greyblue while his face was the absolute embodiment of a waking nightmare harry looked at trask through halogen halloween eyes that seemed to drip sulphur and smiled at least in the alien world of sunsidestarside especially starside it might have been called a smile but here on earth in london at ebranch hq it was a writhing of thin scarlet lips a flattening of convoluted snout a slow gape of mantrap jaws that face that mouth that crimson cavern of jagged teeth like shards of white broken glass and no trask croaked from a suddenly dry throat no harry we dont need that one never that one good god almighty liz gasped from beside trask physically repelled by the sight of the thing in the chair her hand jerked out of trasks grasp as she backed away and the apparition began to fade faster yet guttering like a spent candle but behind trask and liz the door to harrys room had just that moment opened and now a sixth figure joined the five it was lardis lidesci and filling the gap between trask and liz he grabbed up their hands and growled i felt called here by my seers blood it told me be was here harry helllander and the threedimensional neon hologram at once firmed up the vampire harry morphed back into the twentyyearold harry his hollow eyes fixed themselves on lardis and he said its been a long long time old chieftain and trask breathed a sigh of relief the image was as firm as ever and perhaps more so reinforced by lardiss presence it was proof indeed of a seer ancestors blood still coursing in the old lidescis veins and lardis no stranger to strange things knew what he was doing here the fact that this apparition had spoken to him hadnt thrown him at all still you come and go in that weird way of yours the old man grunted nodding his head but weirder far now because i saw you die at the gate on starside you karen and the dweller along with shaithis and shaitan and all that was theirs true said harry but death isnt like that and i have gone on gone on and gone into said lardis and is this really you here and now gone into jake you did me and mine no harm harry helllander not even at your worst and i cant believe that youre seeking to usurp this poor lad nothing of the sort said harry for i was called here even as you have been called that of me which is now in jake its for the good or so im given to hope and this image you see is just a facet and transient and then to trask but i cant stay here indefinitely you asked me something ben and i may have the answer and eagerly now trask said the answer to jakes problem how he might expel this korath the other shook his immaterial head theres no way he can do that not while korath clings like a leech to his inner mind it was the same for me i couldnt dislodge faethor ferenczy i had to trick him out into the open and then keep him out but i did manage to shut him down i blanketed him trapped him in an empty room in the manse of my mind and so excluded him from my affairs you could do this at will trask licked his dry lips and harry nodded the mind has unsuspected mechanisms for which it has no use like the appendix theyre mainly obsolete redundant or perhaps theyre as yet undeveloped anyway while i cant say whether theyre atavistic or futuristic in certain psychically talented people such as you and your agents theyre very strong you call them shields and jake cutters shielding mechanisms have enormous potential despite that i was drawn to him that he was to be my successor as it were his shields were so strong that for a while they defied even me jake knew instinctively how to use his shields externally to keep telepaths and other psychics at bay but theres at least one more trick that he hasnt mastered perhaps i could show him how to turn his shields inwards to isolate the thing within him freakish as the concept was still trask managed to grasp it precisely said harry its the same principle that lets us switch off unpleasant or traumatic memories which after all have origin in our minds its just that the switch needs turning up a little or tuning to a higher degree and liz broke in can you really do that i can try harry told her which might confine korath said trask but it wont get rid of him harry nodded it can only be done step by step but assuming that jake does find a way to expel korath theres another even finer mechanism he might employ again a kind of shielding is involved but shielding carried to the nth degree and even though korath has managed to gain access previously hed never get in again harry paused to look at trask expectantly and i think i may have seen something of this mechanism this talent at work said trask narrowing his eyes thoughtfully and so you should said harry upon a time in ebranch there was just such a man by virtue of his talent the fact that no one could get at him he was even the head of branch albeit briefly but he was a traitor a double agent whose actions gave him away and you caught him before he could kill me i think you remember him well enough ben norman harold wellesley said trask a psychic blank he couldnt be read couldnt be located he was quite literally a zero in the psychic aether the same said harry well when he was dead he tried to make amends for his past misdeeds by offering me this metaphysical defence mechanism i accepted it and in my turn now offer it to jake to use at will except now please harry liz cut in her anxious grip tightening on trasks and lardiss hands dont make conditions but if you can do these things please do them now except harry went on if he is in fact infected then it will make him stronger still said trask his face suddenly gaunt and ashen at which everyone looked at him for this was his decision and for good or bad ben trask had never been afraid of making decisions starside a wolfseye view trask looked right back at his agents especially at liz and said i know that in the end its my decision and that its now or never but now as never before i need your input each of you in turn and as quickly as possible but remember this if we let harry do this and if jake is other than he appears to be then baron frankenstein will have been a veritable saint compared to us what well be making might well be indestructible jake is the necroscope yes but what if hes a vampire too or even wamphyri immune to our talents invisible behind norman wellesleys shields wed never be able to read or locate him and he knows almost everything there is to know about us you really do need to consider that he paused to let it sink in and finished off thats it enough said now we have to get done with this so starting with liz well work right to left whats it to be people and almost before hed finished liz was speaking jake is jake she gasped he isnt anything else no one knows jakes mind like i do and if there was something wrong with him other than this korath then im sure i would know it also this is jakes last chance korath knows his minds mechanisms and from now on when harrys finished and gone from here hell be able to control him theres only one way to fight korath by taking those controls away from him giving jake the power to lock him away to exclude him from his thoughts and actions if we dont well have lost our greatest weapon and if thats the case if thats the case she was almost sobbing now and on her left the precog took over from her well be taking a chance he said but its a chance we have to take and enigmatic as ever always remember this whatever we say or do the future is laid out for us what will be has been millie spoke up im with liz and anyway weve no choice if we dont do it korath will have jake and then then wed have to kill him dont misunderstand me jake saved my life in szwarts hideous garden under london hes saved all our lives but still theres no escaping the facts yes wed have to kill him for with korath in command it would be just like ben said jake would be if not truly then virtually a vampire with the incredible powers of a necroscope and access to the mobius continuum so i vote we ask harry to do whatever needs doing it passed to chung who said from the moment jake came to us i felt that the necroscope was back i mean the necroscope this one apparently sitting here the one who held us together through some of our darkest years in jake there was nothing of darkness rebelliousness yes but then he had a mission of his own how i see it if we had left him out of things he wouldnt be in this mess now and god knows we owe him i mean millies right wed all be dead without him so let harry do his thing im with liz and then it was trasks turn so its fairly obvious he said that even if i was against it id be outvoted not only that but as a team wed be finished a classic case of united we stand and all that but in fact im for it just listening to you people listening to your hearts speaking way over your heads reminded me that this isnt the first time ive had to make a choice like this he looked pointedly at harrys neon image and harry replied the last time it was me right ben and you took a chance with me well maybe your luck is holding as for jake consider it done all it took was a tweak here and there consider it done liz repeated him you mean i cornered korath in an empty room and locked him in said harry and if some time in the future jake can find a way to expel him then hell be able to lock him out permanently but thats a maybe for no one can secondguess the future then his eyes went to lardis lidesci and he said old warrior these people are in your debt without you i might have drifted free of my focus and slipped away moreover im personally in your debt following the battle at the dwellers garden my son and i relied greatly on your strength yours and your travellers also it was your people who took care of me when my son after my powers when they failed me it seems to me i owe you and i sense a great need in you a need to know i drew on your strength now you can draw on mine lardis nodded and said my thanks harry helllander but there are needs and there are needs theres a seer ancestors blood in me thats true but it cant let me see into another world you spoke of the battle at the dwellers garden all of us here have seen some battles since then i suspect that even now theres a war going on in sunsidestarside your son but this time a son you never met is fighting it or maybe its too late over and done and you never will get to meet him a son of mine said harry oh ive sensed him sensed tbem upon a time or times but if im in him then hes in me and not so distant after all how long since you saw him this son of mine three long years said lardis since the day he left me here i cant think other than that hes dead and the war lost one of them is dead said harry the dark one i sensed his departure but the other ah no he lives on nathan lardis gasped alive but how do you know ive been in many said harry once again and there are many in me do you want to know how its been these three long years in sunsidestarside lardiss jaw fell open do i want to he gasped only tell me what i must do sit down said harry all of you on the floor hold me here in your minds and concentrate and if theres that of me in sunsidestarside some child of me or mine and if it can speak ill find it and you shall hear it and as they all sat down he looked from face to face with his hollow hologram eyes and said are you ready now yes i see that you are good for now we go which was all the warning they had before the darkness set in then after seconds or aeons of searching voices at first faint and far distant but gradually swelling out of the darkness and the darkness itself brightening to a grey opacity a gruff mans voice speaking szgany but the translation was instantaneous through harrys telepathy misha lass you need sleep youre so thin and weary that if he ever comes out of this he wont recognize you anyway do you see that look in his eyes no you dont do you those strange eyes of his you could fall into them for ever but there isnt any look in them any longer theyre just vacant it was a hell of a hard knock on the head he took its still a wonder to me it didnt split his skull and let his brains out since when weve done all we can for him until theres nothing left now its up to him six months a female voice answered six months ago and the war against starside finally won and then this had to happen for all that nathan is and all that hes done why is the world so cruel to him can you answer me that andrei romani maybe thats the way of it with his kind said the other his father and his brothers nestor and the dweller they didnt have much luck either a necromancer the one and necroscopes the others none of them came to a good end its such a terrible thing to be able to talk to the dead and conjure them from their graves now he talks to no one and conjures nothing oh he walks however dazedly eats sleeps and perhaps dreams but its you who clothe him each morning who walk him feed him and tend his every need and youre the one whos paying for it let her be andrei said a second female voice it isnt intentional i know but youre just a blunt man and your words are hurtful cant you see her pain i talk this way because im tired of seeing her pain the male voice answered there are plenty of others including myself who would share her duties but misha wont let them she does it all herself oh and is that so strange said the voice of anna marie english ecopath and if you were in nathans shoes wouldnt i do the same hes her husband and she loves him but all to no avail the other protested does he hear see know anything at all thats going on about him its been six months now he makes so little progress and misha suffers me im only a blunt man if you say so but id gladly share her suffering and plenty of others like me but what can i do the best thing you can do is leave them alone said anna marie misha can cope and if or when she cant ill be here hub andrei snorted see whats become of the clan lidecsci now with lardis away a romani is chief but who will give heed to a chief whose own wife turns a deaf ear eh and a wife of alien spheres at that his words might sound severe but it was just his szgany gruffness well then so be it ill leave you women to it but the moment you see any sign of improvement in the lad any sign at all i want to know about it meanwhile ive a town to rebuild else when lardis gets back im in big trouble that last was as szgany as a man could get like a bit of old irish in annas world but it was meant as encouragement for with the necroscope in this twilight state an almost total amnesiac the old lidesci never would be back in speaking that way andrei had put the cart before the shad which was just his way of saying that all things were possible anna marie english understood this well enough and after he had gone she said pay no mind to my husband he means no harm why he loves nathan as much as lardis himself hes a worrier thats all oh i know that said misha but between the two of us andreis not alone in his worrying i mean this is my nathan and look at him does he hear anything do you think and does he see anything i mean really see anything hes not blind i know that because he steps aside if things are in his way or is it merely instinct that keeps him from harming himself like that deaf dumb and oblivious whats to become of him anna marie hes to get better thats all said the other and now that the war is over and the vampires defeated destroyed you neednt fear that nathan will come to harm during his recuperation if we had access to my world to its physicians but no thats ridiculous a forlorn hope nathan was our access the opacity had cleared a little and was comparable now to a heavy swirling fog in the fog two roughly female outlines were visible one of which was seated while the other moved to and fro wringing its hands trask and his team had determined from the conversation that they viewed the scene from nathans point of view and through his eyes likewise they supposed he must be hearing what was said for they could hear it but did it make sense to him did he understand it the voices of anna and misha seemed deadly monotonous as leaden as the foggy medium that carried them nathan might just as easily be tuned in to some strange form of muzak as to speech and when the shrouded figures moved his eyes scarcely followed them at all and now harry spoke but only to trask and his people for this was some fantastic probe that he was using a combination of all their talents while the real harry was here at ebranch hq i understand how they must be feeling he said for his mind is a blank to me too its completely rundown out of order its polarity reversed if an intelligent thinking mind might be compared to a dynamo nathans has spun to a halt been deactivated i feel that im standing in a deserted house where nothing works or at best works in a rudimentary fashion its possible we might learn something else from the conversation between these caring women but apart from that wait lardis lidesci growled oh said harry my seers blood said lardis and this is my world that were looking into i sense something coming i sense it too said harry and i see it they all saw it it entered the picture from a lighter patch of fluffy grey background brushed against mishas legs as she reached down a vague hand to fondle its ears came to a halt central of their arc of viewing misted triangular eyes gazed in what seemed a doglike concern and a grey tongue lolled and for a moment if only a moment the picture cleared up somewhat it seemed nathan saw this one in just a little more detail perhaps it was a form of recognition lardis knew at once what or who he was seeing while trask chung and goodly took a moment longer then they remembered but they would have known anyway as soon as misha said so then blaze you faithful one youve come visiting us again to follow your uncles progress and sit with him awhile but as for progress alas its a slow slow business not much to report im afraid and lardis breathed blaze a wolf one of the leaders of sunsidestarsides grey brotherhood a wild thing come down out of the barrier mountains ah but never such wolves as this one and his brothers or his brother as it turned out there were three such upon a time blaze dock and grinner thus named by nathan the wamphyri took dock with his stumpy tail those bastards they had a craving for wolfheart livers and tripes and trask said nathans nephews still hard to crediteven though i was there and saw it for myself and my grandchildren said harry wolves of the wild now i understand the last time i saw my earthborn son he was more wolf than man he was forgetting what hed been and being what hed become and advised me to do the same burned by the sun reduced massively he saved himself by devolving to a creature such as the one that had converted him vampirized by a wolf he became a wolf that was shortly before i died he died too said lardis but not before he mated with a great white shewolf the three brothers nathans nephews your grandchildren came out of her but as nathan once told me their minds were far in advance of wolfminds mentalists they talked to nathan and each other over great distances and necroscopes they could even commune with their human grandma brenda calling her the gentle one under the stones lardis paused abruptly then went on apologetically but forgive me harry i was forgetting that that you were taking me back too far said harry to times and places where ive no desire to go no for my death released me from all of that and then musingly and changing the subject so then this is a child of my child indeed said lardis for you are in many even as many are in you lardis said harry you are a very wise old man and of course something of me must be in blaze too moreover if anyone knows whats been happening in sunsidestarside and if we accept that a wolfs viewpoint will probably be very different then who better to tell the story eh and is that you in there uncle did something stir are you returned to us from the darkness he senses me said harry and he has shields of his own which he raises just a little a wolfs natural caution but hes curious too blood of my blood he cant obstruct me nor would be want to if he knew my purpose who is it blaze whined and retreated a little his muzzle writhing back from wetly gleaming teeth causing misha to ask why what is it old friend but since she wasnt telepathic blaze couldnt answer her and meanwhile there said harry its done like scenes in an experimental motion picture moving from monochrome to colour from viewpoint to viewpoint in the space of a few frames the scene at once changed but since this was no motion picture but remote viewing and because the change had been unexpected arid abrupt its effect was dizzying suddenly trask and the others found themselves looking up at nathan at nathan himself seated on a woven chair in a shaft of late sunlight from the open door of a log cabin anna maries shadow fell partly on his pale vacant face and misha moved to kneel at his side frowning as she reached out a hand towards towards them towards trask and his agents no of course not she reached out her hand towards blaze for they were seeing her seeing misha nathan the entire picture now in sharp colourful definition seeing it through the eyes of a wolf as that fact dawned so blaze became simultaneously aware of a stranger an intruder someone other than his brother grinner or his uncle nathan in his mind at which he was galvanized and everything devolved into a wild panic flight the wolfs speed was astonishing as he raced through the szgany township called settlement even from a wolfseye view low to the ground and despite that the place showed signs of recent battle or of preparation for siege with hurling engines everywhere on top of the massive timbered perimeter walls and fortified rocket emplacements in strategic areas where sections of the wall could be moved aside on rollers and imitation wamphyri warriors over staked firepits still trask goodly chung and especially lardis remembered and recognized it upon a time they had fought what theyd thought was the final battle here blaze went through settlement and out through the west gate in a headlong rush setting all of the townships domestic dogs barking and snarling as he passed by it was only after hed reached the forests rim where the trees gave way to rocky ground and the foothills rose umber in the early evening light that he eased off for a wolf of blazes years the run had been a great effort but the longevity and strength of sunsides grey brothers was legendary by the time blaze paused however even his heart was hammering and his four limbs trembling while the stiffened ruff of fur along his spine had only just subsided a very little still very nervous he came to a halt in a patch of gorse turned and looked back at settlement then settled down on his haunches to catch his breath wisely harry had waited till then before trying to talk to this extraordinary wolf again and dont run blaze he said as calmly as possible for in any case you cant outrun me but tell me why do you fear your own kith and kin blaze was up on his legs again in a moment his teeth bared and the hair along his spine all spiky but this time he didnt run my own kitb and kin he growled is that wbat im supposed to think you were in my uncle natban yes but youre not him some lord of vampires perhaps who has usurped him wbicbever youre neither kith nor kin to me so begone old wolf said harry you cant run for ever and im not your enemy but a friend indeed im a great deal more than just a friend and anyway didnt i hear the woman called anna marie say that the vampires are no more aye and ive beard that one before blaze snarled and for all that no one was there he showed even more of his teeth so now leave me be for my mind is my own and private he tried to raise his shields but harrys probe was stronger nathan is my son said harry then as was nestor as was the dweller who sired you and as for the gentle one under the stones do you still converse with her she was my wife my mate your grandmother for long moments then there was confusion and mental agitation then disbelief until finally blaze barked his denial it is of old legend among the grey brotberbood that my father the dweller died fighting the wampbyri at the starside gate at the time of the great white light likewise his father with him no youre not my grandfather what you the one called harry not so for his ashes are long since vanished in the past all blown away on starsides winds and so they were said harry my ashes certainly vanished into the past but not my mind cant you see were of a kind cant you tell were of one blood who else may speak out of the beyond or into it but a necroscope i am your grandfather and now blaze knew it was so whining low in his throat he said i feel it now not the lying thoughtthief probe of some rabid vampire but deadspeak you are a spirit its true gone from us into another place nor do you speak falsely for while we never met before still your thoughts are familiar were of one blood said harry again but what do you here the szgany have friends in what was once my world harry told him and they have been worried about things here in sunsidestarside he showed blaze images of trask and the others i know them the wolfs ears sprang alert the old lidesci aye and some of the others too olden allies against the wampbyri i even know something of their strange world as told to me by my brother grinner who ventured there with my uncle and then theres that too said harry your uncle nathans problem if i can i would like to help him do you think you can we were cubs together and while he is my uncle he is also my friend his mind is all askew said harry it has taken a knock and the pictures all memories knowledge have slipped from view except i thought that perhaps he recognized you however vaguely other than that your uncle is a blank space that needs filling in but im not without certain skills if youll walk us back to that township back to nathan maybe i can help him and along the way you could tell us how its been with the war and all that way all our needs might be served blaze stood up shook himself down and said hub the tame dogs back there saw me run they may have thought i was running from them and some even dared to mock me but never fear ill snarl at them as we pass to remind them who they deal with an excellent idea said harry should curs come snapping at you bite their tender noses if their teeth cut your flesh cut theirs deeper an eye for an eye i can see theres much of me in you so it would seem blaze answered inclining his head but i am not displeased grandfather and now we must go my uncle natban is in need of your certain in harrys room at ebranch hq six psychically endowed agents sat in a ring around a seventh who was temporarily possessed by an eighth the revenant of a man who had been arguably the greatest psychic talent ever to listen to a tale told by a wolf in an alien world in ebranch this was probably one of the weirdest of all this then was the way of it blaze began while ambling back towards settlement a good halfmile away after a time when the world turned back again and the northstar shone on the boulder plains as before when our silver mistress moon sped on high in her accustomed orbit and the waters of starsides shining lake were all drained away then the wamphyri returned out of the far forbidden north as mange is to a wolf so are the wamphyri to sunsidestarside feeding on the goodness until everything dies they waged war on the szgany of sunside all settled now in towns and war with nathans people the lidescis who were the fiercest warriors of all but this was when my uncle was well and it proved to be a fatal mistake on their part there were three of the olden wamphyri come back from the icelands at first they had been secretive in their recruiting striking only at remote traveller encampments so that for long and long their presence went unnoticed they took of starsides trogs too for their labourers and began rebuilding among the tumbled stacks of olden starside my uncle had been away visiting the thyre for many sunups and at first didnt know what transpired in starside he wasnt neglectful of his duty with the szgany but had a sister among the thyre called atwei not a true sister as you are surely aware grandfather but a sister of the heart and spirit with whom he visited anyway when he returned and found out what had happened then nathan moved entire tribes into the furnace deserts of the south the greatest traveller of all moving in that unfathomable way of his and travelling in a single instant to wherever he desired he took hundreds of the szgany to safety in thyre territory where the watering holes and underground colonies of the desert dwellers offered sanctuary how may i state this for a fact because we were there because my uncle made myself and my brother grinner privy to all his works at that time and because as once before the grey brotherhood sided with the szgany against the wamphyri becoming nathans watchers in the heights of the barrier mountains but the szgany are proud and this was not like the olden times when the wamphyri were awesome conquerors and could not be defeated no for the szgany had knowledge of alien things my father the dweller had brought weapons of great destruction into sunsidestarside and while he was long dead and gone still his human brother nathan had discovered the route back to your world grandfather for more of the same he went bringing weapons he was given and others that he stole back into sunside and the lidescis spread the secrets of black gunpowder guns and rockets among all the szgany tribes so that their men could stand and fight for my uncle knew that hiding among the thyre in their furnace desert colonies wasnt good enough there were creatures other than men that the vampires could kill for their blood and flesh the wild things of sunsides forests and the barrier mountains such as wolves aye and nathan couldnt possibly save all of them also the thyre were his friends and he would not place them in jeopardy knowing that sooner or later the vampire lords would seek them out he would not have their blood on his paws but let me move quickly forward for i sense that you know most of these things that i have told you that youve had this story from some other source and anyway what more is there to tell of how my uncle finally defeated the wamphyri and in his triumph even as he celebrated of the accident and injury that shook his mind from its orbit both of these things very well they came about in this order when first nathan had found out about the resurgent wamphyri he had gone up against them on his own as one man albeit a warrior with superior weapons unwilling to risk the lives of friends he had ravaged among the vampires on lone forays along routes not of this world but as they learned what he could do so they began to lay traps for him and then my uncles hitandrun guerilla tactics became ever more dangerous by then the olden wamphyri the three from the icelands had long since fled his wrath leaving all theyd made behind them and oh they had made some cruel vampires and monsters out of men now these bloodlusting lieutenants and thralls vied among each other to see who would be lords in their turn this had left them weaker than ever though never weak in the human or wolf sense you understand no for they were still terrible creatures anyway my brother and i and other leaders of various wolf packs we had seen these aspirant lords fighting one another on the boulder plains we had witnessed their skirmishes and small but vicious bloodwars in the ruins of shattered aeries and all such had been reported to nathan who was then prompted to make a plan it was time he said to end this thing and finish them off for good in one last surprise attack one final battle to be fought on their own ground how bold to confront the vampires of starside in starside itself impossible for the szgany on their own too terrible to consider the distances involved and movement in the open over a pitiless boulder wastelend and the mindless monsters waiting there ah but by use of nathans instantaneous mode of travel by no means impossible in the hour when the sun rises over the mountains to shine across the territory of the vampires nathan armed great bodies of men and moved them to the mouth of the pass into starside of course the sun hangs low in sunsides sky so that when its rays sweep over the mountains they never touch starsides floor but even so sunup to vampires is as the darkest of dark nights in a wild unknown place to men or a deadly sliding scree avalanche to a wolf a very terrible thing to contemplate which is why they burrow in their holes when the sun is up shutting out the light sleeping and dreaming their horrid red dreams leaving only their monstrous guardian creatures awake and watchful but even they stick to the shadows of starsides boulder mounds and crumbling ruins shrinking from the sunlight as best possible of course they do for they too are the stuff of vampires so then in that same hour when the sun turns the mountain peaks to gold myself grinner and other pack leaders had gone creeping out onto the barren boulder plains to locate the positions of the last of our enemies and having found them mind to mind with our uncle we reported their numbers whereabouts and fortifications to him fixing their coordinates in his mind at last he could move on them and he did in his special way transporting his teams of arsonists up close he burned the warrior creatures when they were only half awake scorched the grounded flyers membrane wings to immobilize them brought the rest of his army forward into the battle area and all done in a trice szgany mirrormen in the barrier mountains reflected sunlight down into the areas where they saw flames rising others on the ground trapped these rays in mirrors of their own turning them on the vampires as they rose up from sleep grenades and bullets cut them down men moved among them with machetes and axes even the most dire battle gauntlet was useless against scything metal shards and silver shot even nathan was surprised at how quickly the last remaining monsters caved in and for all of that long sunup the szgany gathered up vampire debris and burned it on the boulder plains in the ruins of the old wamphyri stacks and the smoke and stink of their fires went up to the sky so that when night came again even the illomened northstar was partly obscured but other than the smoke and the dying fires nothing else moved in all starside it was over and not a man of the szgany or wolf of the brotherhood lost or even wounded in that final victory which makes nathans injury that much more poignant it came during the celebrations in settlement the lidescis built great bonfires in the foothills to signal the utter destruction of the vampires the end of their reign of terror they danced feasted and sent off such rockets into the skies that they rivalled the light of our mistress moon but alas such explosive devices were crude things and by no means reliable and one such that flew awry exploded close to nathan he was hurled down by the blast his skull struck a rock unconscious he was taken to mishas makeshift dwelling and there he has stayed in the care of his mate that was many sunups ago even as many as the toes on two wolves and then some since when there has been small improvement after a while he walked but it seems that everything is an utter mystery to him he remembers nothing or so little it makes no difference and when ive looked into his head all i have seen is emptiness those baffling numbers that once were there where are they now and where the uncle i loved as a cub and love as a wolf fullgrown if you can help us find him grandfather all sunside will be for ever in your debt arriving back at settlement blaze paused and composed himself then advanced stifflegged in through the west gate the szgany who saw paid him no special heed a familiar of nathans blaze came and went as he saw fit as for settlements tame dogs the look in his yellow eyes warned them off so that he had no need for snarling skin graft clay pigeons and red herrings misha was on her own now and as blaze paused whining at the door of her house she looked up saw him and welcomed him in so youre back she said smiling however wanly what was the big hurry did you have a thorn in your paw or something such an undignified exit he understood her words which rang in his mind as well as in his ears wagged his tail a very little and made for nathan where he sat in his chair and again the young exnecroscopes deep yet vacant eyes seemed to focus if only for a moment on the wolf before they once more glazed over and bere be is grandfatber harrys changeling descendant whined again low in his throat he bas no sbields as sucb so you can be in witbout him even knowing huh but of course you can for be knows nothing alas you wont find him at bome i have been there said harry and i know youre right my son isnt home his house has no furniture and the fire is out in the hearth it is as if it were inhabited by some blind ghost which looks out now and then through the windows of his eyes seeing nothing surely i can do no harm there the least i can do is bring a little atmosphere into the place wben you leave me for him will you ever return blaze had sensed that this visit was a singular probably unique event i doubt it said harry this time i answered a call but there are many calls and i have been too long away too long away said his changeling grandson who in his way was wiser than most men i think i understand and anyway it isnt my place to ask from where grinner who has seen strange far places might know and i must speak to him of it but when or wherever you go know that we shall wish you a long continuance you know that i appreciate it said harry but even your brother grinner hasnt been where i shall go how long is time eh where is any or everywhere and how far is away farewell then said blaze and harry was gone from one to the other in a moment gone from that sharp wolf mind with its astonishing repertory of scents and sensations back to the greymisted place the empty house called nathan in there in that deserted echo chamber of a place with no one else to hear except the minds of his psychic explorer colleagues from earth trask spoke once more to harry what will you try to do and how will you go about it its just an idea thats all said harry but you know how a skin graft works of course said trask a patch of skin is taken from an undamaged healthy part of the body and planted on a burned or flensed area to facilitate new growth right said harry but perhaps its a poor analogy after all for where a body has suffered one hundred per cent burns theres no hope said trask but in this case there must be some hope at least im sure that on the two occasions weve witnessed nathan recognized blaze if only momentarily but still i can only do so much said harry i have only a short time left to me other places are luring me then get on with it said trask do whatever you can for him and it wont only be sunside thats in your debt and harry got on with it not skin but memories first of blaze reinforcing nathans picture of the wolf who was his nephew then memories of people nathan had known people theyd both known transmitted from harrys memory banks into those blank spaces that were all that was left of his sons it was done at incredible speed harry played the part of a neurosurgeon working with a laser tool but rather than slicing or splicing nerves he welded patches of memory back in place on the bare walls of nathans mind pictures of misha taken straight from what hed seen of her through blazes eyes pictures of trask chung lardis and goodly a group once wellknown to nathan and again pictures of blaze himself faithful lifelong friend and finally saved until last harry conjured a fantastic numbers vortex a whirling wall of mutating symbols and cyphers the metaphysical equations of mbbius mathematics to spiral like background static in the otherwise aching void of nathans mind and then his time was up something had happened to nathan and misha didnt know what to make of it she didnt know what to make of blaze either wolf he might be but she knew of his relationship with nathan the fact that he was actually a relative and also that he was far more than just a wolf of the wild right now he danced skipped and yipped his tail was a frenzy of sidetoside movement his ears were up intent turning this way and that but always ending up pointing at nathan seated in his chair now he got up on his hind legs forepaws on nathans knees blackshining muzzle inches from nathans nose and stared into nathans eyes it was nathans eyes now yes but a moment ago it had been his movements actions actions of a sort anyway galvanic and by no means definitely the product of intelligence or awareness still he had moved lifted an arm to point at something opened his mouth as if to speak but only gurgled not much of a miracle in itself but in a man who had done absolutely nothing for a sixmonth without prompting and guidance and made no attempt to utter a single word it was astonishing so much so that for several seconds misha hadnt been able to move when it had started she had been standing in the open doorway catching the last warm rays of the sun as it sank down ohsoslowly beyond the forests rim then very clearly shed heard the stamp of a foot but a foot not a paw and blaze the only other creature present blaze and nathan startled misha had looked back into the dusky unlit room to see what was happening and what shed seen had frozen her rigid for several long seconds nathans twitching his pointing his meaningless mouthing as if he heard something saw something remembered something and his wolfnephew blazes frantic capering reinforcing the fact of it letting misha know that she wasnt dreaming then shed cried out rushed to his side gone down on her knees alongside blaze both girl and wolf staring into nathans eyes and light in there no longer the emptiness of the spaces between the stars but the light of reason it was there for the space of a breath two three before slowly fading but it bad been there and before it had vanished entirely nathans mouth had jerked open again this time while it had been something less than a whisper misha knew that he had spoken only one word but a word that brought her to laughter and tears in the same moment misha and just as shed seemed to sense weird presences this last halfhour or so so now she sensed nathans presence knew that he was in there and that this was the start of his recovery there was no sensation of movement never had been through any of what trask and his people had experienced but still it was a shock to every system to find themselves back in harrys room at ebranch hq from which theyd never in any case departed but all of them knew that harry had gone now even if like blaze they didnt know where jake stirring in his chair and blinking even as the six blinked back at him was as a man just this moment woken from a dream he frowned looked alarmed or at least puzzled seemed uncertain of his reality a dream he said as simply as that was i dreaming but as the six espers disengaged and stood up stiffly no it wasnt said trask and you werent can you remember anything at all of what it was about jake thought about it looked from face to face as the six crowded around him and shook his head i feel different he said but other than that and he shrugged and korath said liz is he still there oh hes there jake answered sourly but contained following which he sat bolt upright and his jaw dropped what in the i mean how in hell do i know that instinct said trask something you had without knowing you had it and using harrys terminology there was a certain room in the manse of your mind which youd never had cause to visit harry went there and found it dark and switched the lights on thats all then nodding curtly to chung and goodly i think you can untie him now harry was here said jake as they set about freeing him from the chair he took you over liz nodded quietened you down if he hadnt korath would have been in charge maybe for good or for bad jake licked lips as dry as dust then got to his feet swayed a little and grabbed liz for support whoah he said i feel like ive just had three or four rides on the worlds biggest fastest nastiest roller coaster two worlds trask told him sighing his relief and then hardening again but its not over yet ohjake looked at him trask nodded putting it bluntly harry or whatever it was of him told us a thing or two that might help us to clear you you and millie both this was the simple truth which despite sounding cold came out naturally knowing the drawbacks of his talent however trask glanced at millie apologetically but she understood took his arm reassuringly made no comment so whats next said ian goodly and despite that it was a serious question coming from him it lightened the moment considerably and with a wry chuckle trask answered now heres a thing the precog wants to know whats next at which footsteps sounded and there came a sharp knock at the door it was john grieve the duty officer two things he said when trask opened the door turchin has had a call come in or scrambled and the russians have just broken the news that hes gone missing from the earth year conference no accusations as yet and the word defection hasnt entered into it hes just missing thats all wheres turchin now trask came out into the corridor waiting outside ops said grieve the techs wouldnt let him in without your sayso turning to lead the way he added oh yes and theres some kind of problem with the decoder it seems that the codes turchin gave us are incomplete trask spoke to the rest of the team to work people and jake dont go experimenting or anything until were all ready to sit in on it with you youre on trust but not so much on trust that youre to leave the hq im sure you understand the thing in your head may be under control now but id like to be absolutely sure it i stay that way ian youll er keep jake company millie liz will be looking after you its seems only fair and and i mean oh what the bell personalities and other considerations aside its simply a matter of bloody security not much for swearing nowadays still on occasion trask found it the only satisfactory solution jake and millie glanced at each other and she said dont worry about it ben we both understand sure that they did understand but hating the situation anyway trask let it go and followed grieve to the ops room turchin was waiting anxiously outside the closed door with one of the techs a prematurely bald young man called jimmy harvey apologetic but rock steady and for all that he was only five foot five or six harvey was blocking the door denying access to the bulky russian premier its okay jimmy said trask as he approached let him take his telephone call in fact well be going in with him sorry about that boss harvey told turchin opening the door for him for a moment the russian scowled at jimmy at his lush red sideburns and bushy eyebrows which tried desperately hard to make up for his baldness then brushed by him saying dont concern yourself mr harvey we all have our duties to perform just as long as we havent lost what could be a most important connection and then he was into the ops room but if trask had expected turchin to be taken aback by the complexity of the place its communications equipment computer consoles decoding devices variously coloured telephones wall screens charts and other gadgets galore then trask was the one who was taken by surprise the russian premier barely paused but headed straight for a desk where another tech held out a telephone to him more than just a telephone its function was to descramble messages onto a screen if the correct code had been tapped into the keyboard on the phones console the code that premier turchin gave us is incomplete the tech at the console explained the message onscreen repeats but its still a mishmash turchin glanced at the screen at its jumble of meaningless repetitive characters scrolling in endless procession nodded and shrugged his heavy shoulders since i could not be absolutely certain how i would be received here he explained it made sense to keep a little something back utterly ridiculous to give my all if i was getting nothing in return understood said trask just a little peevishly but do you think you might like to complete the code now before your man on the other end gets fed up and stops sending simplicity itself said turchin shooting his cuffs it only requires my initials for authentication russian language said trask but this keyboard has the british alphabet im aware of your several shortcomings turchin smiled a foxs smile at him and made allowance for them in moscow my own decoders keyboards are onscreen and carry fourteen languages you simply tell the computer which one youre entering the code in enormously useful when er assisting foreign dignitaries but as i said i anticipated your how should i put it embarrassment the confirmation uses british letters then he spoke into the combiphone turchin here and a desk speaker answered in russian saying voice recognition confirmed are you receiving i am now turchin answered tapping keys g and t the jumble on the screen at once reassembled itself and a printer purred into action and commenced delivering the message in englishlanguage hard copy it took only a few seconds and then abruptly the screen went blank and the printout ceased thank you yuri said turchin into the phone in russian and now youd better get off before they trace you im sure they already have said the other dont worry by the time they get here ill be long gonethe phone made a beeping sound and the line went dead john grieve standing beside trask had translated for him repeating turchins and his agents conversation he too fell silent as trask put a hand on turchins shoulder saying just assuming someone back home was eavesdropping youve slipped up and told them who to look for this yuri fellow indeed said turchin assuming that was his name but it wasnt and raising his eyebrows quizzically youve never been a conventional field agent have you ben meaning espionage as opposed to espionage ah but for me being a politician in the old ussr that was experience enough trask grimaced and answered you live and you learn and i thought the wamphyri were devious then he tore off the printout and read the message the clock strikes twelve the pyramids point upwards the bats are hanging upside down the pigeons are in flight the moon shines silver the waters will find their own level the dog bites trask read it again twice looked at turchin and said i hope this means something to you because its utter gibberish to met as it was designed to be said the premier but in fact it is very simple seven short statements but only the middle one means anything the birds it refers to are made of clay clay pigeons said trask targets precisely which my people have lofted to be shot at by my enemies but these pigeons might as easily be cured fishes red herrings trask inclined his head inquiringly now we are getting somewhere said the premier red yes like the colour of the old ussr and also of todays greatest enemies yours and mine both ah but my enemies are human and now i must beg of you to please forgive my cautious nature but since we need to discuss this further i would much prefer the privacy of your office everyone here is trustworthy said trask i dont doubt it turchin answered but the more people who know our business the more who could talk about it er if the right pressures were applied in the right places but thats to anticipate falling into enemy hands trask said which in turn is to assume action behind enemy lines but wasnt that always the plansaid turchin so maybe its happening a little earlier than expected thats all and now can we talk in your office and five minutes later alone together in trasks office talk trask grunted very well said turchin before leaving the earth year conference i told one of my people back home to let it slip that i had become privy to vital information concerning wealth beyond all dreams of avarice this was done in accordance with a previous arrangement but you really do have just such information said trask sunsidestarside is one huge opencast mother lode that makes el dorado look like the back yard of the local poorhouse indeed turchin nodded which my powerful military enemies already know about thanks to mikhail suvorov or should we say they know he was on to something if not its nature or its location yes said trask impatiently i havent forgotten these things it was some kind of vindictive safety measure that suvorov took before he went er adventuring beyond the perchorsk gate correct said turchin perhaps he suspected i knew more about the parallel world than i was saying in which case he was right which was why he told several of his military cronies that if he didnt come back to cut them in then they should come to me for the answers the bastard yes i understand all of that said trask and now that theyve started asking questions youve come to us rather than tell them about the vampire world all very laudable but it doesnt explain why were in here talking in private or why suddenly i have this feeling that i dont know everything everything ive told you so far is true said turchin right said trask but that doesnt mean youve told me everything its this damned talent of yours turchin burst out and threw his arms wide since i couldnt lie to you you didnt bother to tell the whole truth said trask but i would have believe me i would have said turchin beginning to sweat now if only there had been time i promise you i would have eh time what do you mean i mean said turchin that ever since that greedy swine mikhail suvorov took charge of perchorsk ive had a spy there i mean that six months ago something very terrible came through the gate something so utterly terrible that if it hadnt been half dead it might well have raged through the complex killing everyone it found there but suvorovs criminal crew were lucky and it died when they burned it and finally i mean that those heavily armed very dangerous exconvicts in the perchorsk complex have grown tired of waiting for suvorov to return and its only a matter of time now before greed overcomes fear and they pluck up sufficient courage to go through the gate looking for him for the general and for whatever else they can find trask frowned and shook his head and there youve lost me surely if this gang of criminals at the complex has had to deal with a crippled warrior creature left over from the war in sunsidestarside the last thing they would want to do is go someplace where they might bump into similar things possibly of a fightingfit variety a warrior yes turchin answered from its description thats what it was a nightmarish thing like i dont know like a primal dinosaur all armoured and bristling with fiendish chitin weaponry but having the face of a man albeit a face with fangs built to go on four legs to do battle on the ground it had the trappings of a mount a saddle stirrups a bit in its mouth and reins and thats where the trouble lies for all of the metal parts bit chains stirrups and such were of massive gold said trask beginning to understand gold yes said turchin heavy beautiful gold suvorov had promised to make those men rich and now they know what he was talking about and where it was going to come from so why havent you told me this before said trask and what is it youre still not telling me the premier flopped back in his chair sighed and answered well then now that the pigeons are in flight it seems i must tell you all trasks talent helped him with that one which sounds like youve started wheels turning that cant be stopped right turchin nodded my plans are laid they are in motion and theres no going back on them so whats the bottom line said trask what is it youve done and what is it you want first what i want said turchin these enemies of mine there are three of them one exmilitary and two serving highrankers except they are not only my enemies but yours and all the free worlds too hardliners with communism expansionism and world domination stamped into their every fibre only supply them with the means precious metal enough to fuel their ambitions and start that terrible crushing engine up again he paused and shook his head then quickly went on what do i want thats easy i want them dead for several long seconds trask sat and stared at his guest his expression cold and inscrutable but turchin scarcely required any special talent to know what the other was thinking im not a murderer ben he burst out but no less than your vampires these people are should i tell you what theyre capable of plans so monstrous that if the west had known about them when first they were broached it could easily have started world war three hah you dont know the half of it you think the cia have hatched some feverish plots in their time this or that assassination that didnt quite work out but these people im talking about are capable of genocide theyd think nothing of destroying entire countries and as he paused for breath go on said trask im listening now turchin was sweating freely he mopped his forehead and said and so i have arrived at the point of no return defection is one thing but these are my countrys best kept secrets and i am trusting them to you they must go no further if ever they got out no one would ever trust russia or gustav turchin again i would remain your guest for the rest of my life which probably wouldnt be a long one im still listening said trask one of these three men said turchin should we call him admiral x you can work it out for yourself is responsible for dumping our fleet of decrepit nuclear submarines and other radioative waste in international waters this same man in the late s through the s when he was a lowly apparatchik in the ussrs defence department proposed to change the worlds weather patterns by detonating enormous atomic devices deep under the arctic ice the melting ice fresh water you understand as it flowed into the atlantic ocean would permanently reverse the atlantic conveyor bringing siberian temperatures to western europe and a mediterranean climate to the russian heartland madman that he is i know he still harbours such schemes and that he has the fanatical will to bring them into being all he lacks is the finances the means perchorsk and the vampire world would furnish such a means though first he would have to cleanse that world of men and monsters alike ah but with his perverse penchant for nuclear devices i cannot see the mere destruction of an alien world as too great a problem well except for our friends the szgany that is and trask nodded i think i can see why youd want rid of that one and i can also see where youre making a big mistake but go on tell me all air defences said turchin the original plans for our answer to ronald reagans sdi his marvellous mythical strategic defence initiative are extant still moreover a certain scientist and senior officer in the russian air force believes that if he were able to generate and contain sufficient energy he could make the failed perchorsk experiment work all that he needs to go ahead is the funding gold ben just think of it an invisible umbrella shielding an entire country neutralizing all incoming weapons of mass destruction after that what could the west refuse us eh in any war an impregnable force must conquer but even if there was no war the west would go broke trying to duplicate the umbrella total chaos whichever way you look at it finally the army my third and last great enemy is an exgeneral now an industrialist a former close ally of suvorov he has been is and always will be a hawk to the bitter end if you think that the american general patton was a militarist or your own bomber harris who reduced dresden to a fiery hell then you havent reckoned with this man when president reagan made his joke about nuking moscow this man moved a regiment of tanks into the countryside commandeered a missile site and sat there waiting with his finger on the button he had to be taken out of there by force how fortunate that on both counts gorbachev had a sense of humour he ignored the first maniacs gaffe promoted the other and privately awarded him a medal of honour as turchin fell silent trask said is that all of it are you done one last word said turchin these three men are intent upon discovering suvorovs secret mother lode his fabulous el dorado and i have set them a trail to follow nothing can satisfy them now except that they follow it to its end and its end or more properly its beginning is in perchorsk and already in perchorsk theres a small army of thugs just waiting to be led into the vampire world so then the stage is set and now we have to take action trask thought about it for a moment and answered in australia when we talked these things over you led me to believe that your principal interests were the same as mine to stop any more vampires coming through into our world to help me to get rid of those that are already here to block the perchorsk gate permanently and in so doing to secure the parallel world for nathan and his people that was what i wanted then turchin answered and its what i want now but it doesnt make these enemies of mine any less real they arent going to go away and if i can kill two birds with one stone or three as it happens well so much the better as to your enemies said trask youre trying very hard to paint them as the worlds enemies too all these dreadfulsounding threats the atrocities theyd enact if they had the financial means in the form of gold from sunsidestarside but the fact is that even if they went there and dug up a mountain of the stuff and if they were able to shift it still theres no way they could ever bring it or themselves back the gate itself would stop them for it can only be used in one direction its a oneway ticket to hell and as for the other gate at the romanian refuge thats already blocked you have misunderstood me said turchin i did not mean to imply that they could do it but that given the opportunity they would its the thought that they migbt that drives me to distraction ben there are many great sources of wealth other than sunsidestarside my exarmy thug industrialist friend for example he is already a multimillionaire and when hes a billionaire what then very well said trask lets have it understood i know what i and my people have to do and thats exactly wbat well do given an opportunity but as for these political enemies of yours theyre your concern if they should happen to cross our paths however but they will said the other i guarantee it then thats different trask went on but only if we have to deal with them in order to complete our mission in perchorsk in answer to which the premier said you can be absolutely sure of it and the way he nodded his head his grim expression told trask the rest of it those wheels youve started turning he said this false trail youve set for these people its not so much a red herring as a carrot for three donkeys right and it will lead them straight to perchorsk not directly said turchin but theyll get there eventually when eventually in maybe three or four days what trask was stunned is that all weve got but why did you do it why couldnt you wait a while longer before laying this trail of yours you said you would have told me everything if there was time would a day or two more another week have made much difference i have problems here at home and we still have to track down these three great enemies of our own but youre forgetting something said turchin my spy in perchorsk there are some three dozen desperate men up there in the urals they know that theres gold on the other side of the gate and three nights ago they voted to give mikhail suvorovs party one more week to get back with their share if he doesnt and he wont because hes dead and couldnt anyway because as youve pointed out the gate is a oneway ticket then they intend to arm themselves with all the weaponry in perchorsk and go through the gate themselves but we know they cant win the same dreadful fate will befall them as befell mikhail suvorovs party then as before their vampire murderers might start wondering where these aliens came from and who can say this time instead of three of them coming through the gate as they did at the romanian refuge why there could be an entire army of them tbats what i meant when i said weve run out of time trask groaned he leaned forward put his face in his hands and stared down at his desk and slowly he shook his head oh said turchin anxiously what have i said wrong now trask looked up at him and said gustav it looks like you and i have been working at cross purposes or perhaps not i suppose it couldnt be helped i only found out about it myself a few minutes ago eh what are you talking about found out about what found out that there are no more vampires in sunsidestarside said trask the war is over all of six months ago and nathan won it there wont be any more wamphyri invaders of earth as for that crippled warrior that came through into perchorsk obviously it was a victim of the war it knew it was finished and was looking for somewhere to die as trask spoke the look on turchins face changed from one of utter astonishment to dismay then anger but i didnt know this he jumped to his feet slammed his clenched fist down on the desk all i knew was what you told me in australia that there was a war in sunsidestarside and as a result of mikhail suvorovs expedition three great vampires had come through into our world now you tell me the wars over and there are no more vampires in starside but my thinking was that when these enemies of mine went through the gate then then then theyd find themselves face to face with the wamphyri trask finished it for him end of story and definitely the end of your enemies you couldnt have devised a more cruel trap for them if youd tried for them or for anyone else turchin thought about that and protested but its like i said i thought to kill two birds with one stone some vampires were bound to die in the battle with perchorsks criminal element which could only help nathans cause less of the monsters for him and the szgany to deal with surely you can see that i can see that we have problems said trask but personally ive so many problems my head is spinning with them its getting so i dont any longer know where to start i dont even want to think about them any more but you have to said turchin and anyway i cannot see that this changes anything it only means we must act that much faster instead of waiting until these three most dangerous men have joined up with the perchorsk convicts and invaded sunsidestarside which would mean a confrontation with nathan and the szgany and more bloodshed we have to destroy perchorsk while they are still in situ for while vampires are one thing these men are something else and remember under the command of military tacticians the perchorsk convicts and their weapons will be far more effective than anything nathans szgany might bring to bear even with his weird powers still it will be bloody bloody trask shook his head no it will be a lot worse than that for theres something else i just learned nathan is out of it injured in some kind of mental limbo so the way i see it those wheels youve set in motion will be rolling over people who have done us no harm friends of mine and at least one of yours nathan himself and i cant help but think that this is all for you that youve done this for yourself for myself turchin pulled in his chin and tried to look hurt well partly yes but mainly for my country and yours and for the world at large and for sunsidestarside what said trask sneeringly you think you can convince me that turning a gang of goldcrazy convicts loose in nathans world is good for the szgany theyve just finished one bloody war and now you would give them another but i didnt know turchin protested again beginning to stride to and fro across the floor and ive already supplied you with the solution surely we are agreed that the gate must be closed if only for the safety of nathans world of course trask answered man i wish to god the damned thing had never been created the point is there shouldnt have been any immediate need to close it not with the war won again youre forgetting something said turchin his fist rebounding from the desk no matter what i have done despite what ive done that need now exists those convicts in perchorsk will go through the gate with or without the leadership of any enemies of mine of course they will from the moment they saw the gold trappings on that warrior creature it was inevitable the only wonder to me is that they havent already gone well trask stood up whats done is done from here on any argument would be circular biting at its own tail and if i thought i had things to do before well now i really have things to do arrangements to make youll please excuse me but first turchin said as he got between trask and the door first i have to know you have to tell me that you do have a new necroscope im at least correct in that assumption yes and trask saw no point in denying it now for soon hed be putting jake to use yes he answered fortunately for you me everyone we do have a necroscope he has his limitations a few small problems but we do have him the premiers sigh of relief was quite audible then this time they have earned their keep he said they trask paused at the door my espers said turchin when they told me of a certain heavyweight in the psychic aether the one signature that was present every time in every location where luigi castellanos organization suffered devastation i knew it must be so and so it is said trask stepping out into the corridor we may have slipped a little behind with our gadgets but our ghosts are still second to none submarine sabotage the threat of the threads it was early evening trask and his people had been back from the mediterranean for less than a day and a lot had happened in that time yet it seemed to the head of branch that time was at a nearstandstill and everything was moving in slow motion he knew he shouldnt be here but out there in turkey hunting for malinari and vavara and szwart what about szwart was it possible he had survived jakes subterranean blast and if so would the three of them team up again so many unanswered questions and so much still to be done as for turkey trask would get a team out there as soon as possible and meanwhile the locator bernie fletcher was in situ somewhere looked after by a couple of special branch minders policemen he had worked with before and thank goodness for them trask had been a little concerned for bernie ever since hed sent that message from invincible the trouble with bernie was that while he was good at following trails close up he wasnt nearly as good as david chung his talent wasnt in question on the contrary one could even say it was too effective which was why normally trask liked to keep him busy in the branchs headquarters bernie fletcher yes as trask strode the hqs corridor towards the duty office he pictured him in his minds eye a burly middleaged fivefooteight redhead fletcher was an intuitive hunchman whose talent made him an ideal target for spotters in that it worked both ways he could locate and track the object or enemy in question friend or foe for that matter but he himself could also be located the fault lay in his shielding which was almost nonexistent at close range telepathic members of the branch and indeed most of trasks espers had little or no trouble homing in on bernie to them his mental activity was like magnetic north to a lodestone as trask had once put it lets face it bernie you stand out like a sore thumb in the metaphysical nether man you glow in the dark yet now hed sent the same man into turkey to begin tracking down two of the most dangerous creatures who had ever set foot on earth on the other hand bernie knew his limitations and hed be watched over by the closeprotection specialists who were out there with him and anyway thats what ebranch was all about danger was no stranger to trasks agents and in the current situation all of them were at risk but still trasks heart was beating a little faster likewise his footsteps as anxiety steadily mounted anxiety about almost everything he hadnt been exaggerating when hed told turchin that it was getting so he couldnt even think but he knew that he must and he thanked the lord for the others here who occasionally did it for him busy from the moment hed got back to london he certainly hoped somebody had been doing the thinking and as he strode in through the everopen duty office door the questions were already spilling from his lips john where are we at and where are we going whats happening out there has bernie fletcher called in his location yet when are we due to fly out have i decided whos going yet and if not has anyone else and finally are there any messages for me john grieve looked up unflustered from a mass of paperwork on his desk and answered finally i wouldnt bet on it but to answer your questions in that order we are where were usually at muddling through a crisis but were going on whats happening out there is all sorts of things but most importantly theres some stuff on premier turchins microfilm you should know about fletcher has called in we do know his location it appears hes picked up a couple of alleged friends along the way youre due to fly firstclass on a british airways flight tomorrow morning you gave a vague or tentative forecast of who would be going with you which is likely to change when youve seen some of the stuff that turchin brought us and finally theres a gang of our people in the ops room waiting for you waiting for me trask tried as best possible to take in all hed been told jake cutter millie and all your main men said grieve im not sure what theyre up to but jake told me to tell you theres something that he and millie want to get done with this evening right now in order to put everyones mind at rest or not also in ops that stuff of turchins is on screen and so to return to your earlier question i would hazard a guess that thats where youre going to the ops room im on my way said trask and over his shoulder optimistically book a table for two downstairs will you that only gives you fortyfive minutes grieve told him will you make it i hope to said trask but as he headed for ops he more than suspected it all depended upon jake and millie trask was right about what hed suspected was going on in ops the rest of his agents had told jake what harry had said about red threads in mobius time how they showed up among the blue and how an infected person might display a pink stain a telltale reddening in his personal lifethread he arrived in the middle of some kind of argument with the precog ian goodly looking as heated as trask had ever seen him i can only advise you not to goodly was saying in that piping voice of his whose pitch climbed the scales whenever he was excited the future can make fools of us it has more than once made a fool of me and im supposed to be the expert even nathan got it wrong when he tried to forecast his future i was with him we were in starside and things were looking bleak so we looked to the future he took me into the continuum where we followed our blue threads through a futuretime door followed them to a place a time where nathans thread came to an end but ive just been told that nathans alive exactly said goodly his blue thread had seemed to come to an end on sunside but that was only because he was going to step out of that universe into ours how were we to know that a little further down the timestream after he had returned to his own world his thread would stream on as before that was something we discovered later but at the time what else could we think but that his life was about to end so what youre saying said millie joining the argument is that you saw something bad that turned out good so wheres the harm in that youre not listening goodly threw up his hands how can i explain it to you you cant mess with the future even harry tried to tell you that his best advice was dont mess with the future and the reason is quite simple if you do see something bad you might be tempted to try to change it and in so doing cause something worse to happen the future isnt really a different time but a different place again he threw up his hands god give me the right words then seeing their unchanging determined expressions seeming to sink down into himself as he turned away but whats the use for i can see youll do it anyway he said so i cant any longer argue with you in any case maybe its meant to be what will be has been not necessarily said trask stepping forward not while im in charge of ebranch and then to jake dont i remember telling you that you werent to go experimenting or trying anything out unless we were all a part of it all agreed on it all meaning you right said jake well we were waiting for you and now youre here he was looking defiant again that attitude of his taking a deep breath trask stepped forward and millie got between them ben she said im with jake im with him all the way he has gone along with you been willing to do whatever youve asked of him so now you should go along with him and with me this is something we need to know its something you need to know too ben and again they were all looking at him liz lardis david chung ian goodly millie and jake of course trasks espers and even the techs sitting at their machines everybody he looked at goodly youve advised them not to right the same way harry advised us the precog nodded but i cant say that im right to have done so or even if i bad the right to do so call it a gut feeling i have this thing about the future as you know maybe its because i sometimes wish i couldnt do it that i wish they wouldnt do it but if we dont jake spoke to trask then youll never be able to trust us me ive just got to know if you were in my shoes wouldnt you sure you would and this way well all of us know whats going down so thats that theres no other choice if you stop me now if you could then as soon as i get the chance ill do it anyway on my own if necessary trask looked at millie then tried his best to look stern but she wasnt backing down ive got to go with him ben she told him for lets face it i was down there with szwart in that loathsome fungus garden a lot longer than jake and if some of those spores have been able to reach the surface we dont know that yet trask cut her off but if she came back then isnt it equally possible i might have been infected too at which liz came in on it saying in any case we really do have to know dont we if millie and jake are in the clear which im sure they are then we can move on and and what if theyre not trasks voice almost cracked up his throat was so dry he knew how liz felt about jake but it was millie he was thinking about if theyre not the old lidesci repeated him in his usual growl then well be able to give them well whatever help we can and they all knew what lardis meant trask shook his head nothing like that he said gruffly turning on lardis man what are you thinking this isnt some szgany encampment on sunside and lardis shook his head no he said not sunside but it could be the same problem trask didnt much like where this was going he didnt want to scare millie and couldnt afford to give jake any ideas so very well he told them if youre that set on it lets do it here and now and have done with it there was something else in the back of trasks mind something he tried hard not to think about keeping it firmly screwed down jake looked at millie and together they climbed up onto the stage or dais standing central in the ops room with the exception of trask the rest of the team sat in chairs close together where they could look up at the rostrum and trask said jake millie weve been some strange places today but none stranger than where youre going now jake you take care of her jake looked down at him their eyes met and for once there was no animosity between them no discord worth mentioning and jake said you too ben i mean you take care of of whatever so maybe trask didnt have it all that well screwed down after all then putting his arm around millie jake said hold on to me youve been there before but briefly this time it will be longer because we arent just going somewhere but sometime and well be seeing whatever there is to see i think thats how it works anyway as what hed said sank in suddenly it dawned on trask that while jake was certainly the necroscope still his talents were very new to him did he really know what he was doing starting up the rostrum steps he might have asked that very question except jake and millie wouldnt have heard him for they werent any longer there dart guns trask said even as he felt the breath of air that rushed in to fill the space where jake and millie had been in the armoury the same kind of tranquillizers they had on invincible i want them in here now and liz gasped and said you dont think its my job to think trask told her you think this is ebranch hq right now they are on their way to find out whats what that means were about to find out too me i dont want to find out the hard way no i dont think theyd rampage not unless we put them under pressure the darts are a safety measure thats all to make sure there is no pressure but if they were to come back in a nasty mood and god knows jakes quite capable of it well need i go on and stop looking at me as if im some kind of monster i happen to be in love with millie no less than you are with jake one of the techs brought the dart guns trask gave them to chung and goodly why us chung wanted to know who better trask snapped i was beginning to think that things were getting on top of me but now it seems im the only one whos still awake here if those two get back knowing that theyre in trouble wont you know it wont you at least be able to sense something of it too you know you will so for christs sake get yourself in gear do what you do best and be on the lookout for mindsmog he turned to goodly as for you im to try reading the future right said the precog but do you think i havent been doing that all along the fact is i think im losing it ben and its been getting worse for weeks now ever since we went out to australia the more i pressure the future the more it resists me yes i know trask nodded and ive been having problems with my talent too and so have we all but as long as you can apply pressure to your trigger finger i wouldnt start worrying about it right now so just get up on that dais and be ready i would do it myself but theres something else i want to look at while were waiting as he left the dais and strode across the floor towards the big wallscreen liz caught at his arm bringing him to a halt surely you dont intend to dart them out of hand trask looked at her shook himself loose then glanced back at chung and goodly on the rostrum they looked just as uncertain as liz and for that matter as uncertain as trask himself torn two ways he said the hell with it ill leave it up to you see what you think the moment they step back out of the continuum onto that stage then he reached the wallscreen where a tech set the great mass of information it contained scrolling for him in the main it was a blueprint a detailed schematic of the perchorsk complex in its ural mountains hideaway but trask knew there had to be far more to it than that according to john grieve the duty officer there was something here that would make a difference to the team he wanted to take out to turkey with him fast forward it he growled and the flow of information at once picked up speed but as the perchorsk schematics rolled up out of sight something very different emerged at the bottom of the picture rapidly taking shape as it elevated itself onto the screen and trask recognized it immediately it was a skewed blank map of northern russia and europe from severnaya zemlya at the far right of the screen through the kara barents and norwegian seas up to and including the british isles in the west or rather it would have been blank if not for a handful of tiny concentricringed targets centered with bullseye dots all of which appeared to highlight deep and occasionally not so deep oceanic locations glancing at the tech trask raised a hand and said hold it there at which the screen froze with the map on centre stage and then the flesh at the nape of trasks neck began to creep he had seen similar charts before and knew precisely what he had here that the bullseye targets were deepwater sites where a downatheel russian navy had already scuppered several of its supposedly decommissioned but still highly radioactive nuclear submarines revenants of its cold war fleet lacking the financial or technical clout unwilling or incapable of detoxifying these lethal hulks whichever somebody in the russian navys top brass probably one of gustav turchins enemies had been dumping them on other nations doorsteps david chung never better than when he was tracking nuclear or illicitdrugs sources had been keeping tabs on such activities for years now and quite obviously hed have to be on this one too that was what john grieve had been talking about the locator wouldnt be going out to turkey with trask and the rest of the crew because hed be working on this and it didnt take a genius to work out why one of the small targets was missing its bullseye centre either the bullseye was missing or the target had not as yet been hit which probably indicated that it was a scheduled dump site a theory that seemed corroborated by a much heavier freehand circle with which someone had highlighted the site in question as for its location that was the really worrying factor it lay in the northern atlantics rockall deep one hundred and fifty miles west of ireland which according to some oceanographers was a major junction in the atlantic conveyor system a region where the balmy surface waters of the gulf stream collide with cold water flowing from the arctic sink about face and join a submarine current flowing back the other way and in the event some lunatic in the russian navy dumped a clappedout and highly toxic nuclear sub there given sufficient time it could poison the entire conveyor carrying deadly russian waste all the way back to florida and the bahamas and eventually depositing its lethal radiation along every atlantic coastline well the atlantic ocean is a big thing and even a massive nuclear vessel is small by comparison but that wouldnt be the way that greenpeace and all of the other powerful environmental bodies and lobbies would see it especially in earth year when the ecological balance of the whole planet was under discussion east to west and pole to pole and with russia many billions of dollars in the red and increasingly dependent on western funds it would be condemned as indefensible the worst kind of pollution at the worst possible time in the history of planet earth compared to the meltdown at chernobyl a terrible accident a human error which in the main had been paid for by its russian authors this would be seen as something else again seen for what it was the deliberate act of despoilers on an unthinkably massive scale which was why premier turchin had released this information here now this was a weapon he could bring to bear against his russian enemies simply by presenting the wests environmentalists with the means to prove what theyd been saying for years he could denounce the author or authors of this thing and have them removed from office prosecuted and locked away for good it was turchin covering himself for in the event that his perchorsk scheme should fail he knew that this one would succeed trask turned to the tech at the screens console is there a legend something to describe whats going on here its in russian the tech answered bringing it into view on the screen we think its a timetable enciphered but nothing we cant crack its being worked on right now however we do have a date a date trask repeated him yes the other nodded and in all innocence whatever it is thats going down here its all set to happen in three days time and now trask knew for certain that the locator david chung wouldnt be going to turkey with him no for hed be following this up instead indeed the locator and perhaps greenpeace or some similar organization together with a whole gang of people from the government would be doing their best to ensure that it didnt happen oh theyd let it develop gathering proof of it along the way but at the last minute theyd step in and put a stop to it that was how this kind of thing usually worked anyway in total darkness a darkness whose like had never been experienced anywhere on earth or under it or in the spaces between the stars millie gripped jakes hand as tightly as she could and floated or drifted alongside her physical guide in the metaphysical mobius continuum and in a hoarse whisper she began to say jake theres nothing dont jake at once cut her off as her spoken words gonged like cracked bells and caused her to give a massive start where he held her and as their echoes gradually faded away you only need to think whatever it is you want to say and ill bear you anyway telepathy she said you no he answered welt between liz and me theres something between us for sure but not with you its the continuum thats all i thought all you people had read up on it you did she answered i mean i have yes but the reality of it is something else the last time we were here we were in and out there was no time to look around or to talk or anything theres nothing here jake reminded her the mdbius continuum is the big empty we arent supposed to be here not you or me or anybody so anything we bring here or do here or cause to happen here is alien a foreign body or event almost a calamity except theres no one and nothing here but the continuum itself to experience it its like when youre the first person in the pool on a dead calm morning the water is still perfect like crystal until you jump in and ruin everything so that it cant ever be the same again when you speak out loud youre simply adding to the splash thats all but even thoughts have weight in the mobius continuum which is why we can bear them thats like i dont know like poetry she said sounding surprised its a side of you that we havent seen too much of i would have liked ben trask to hear tbat oh really yes sometimes i think he thinks youre soulless oh and well said jake thats what were about to find out isnt it but i didnt mean i know you didnt he reassured her and to change the subject have you seen all you want to see but thats what i was trying to say before she answered i mean there isnt anything to see or to feel or anything oh but there is something jake told her except you have to remain still and quiet to experience it do you want to try yes millie answered at once but it isnt easy being quiet when there are so many questions i want to ask questions i probably cant answer said jake ruefully but okay fire away only while youre asking keep still and try to feel the continuum she kept very still unafraid with her hand in jakes and said if theres nothing here why isnt it cold and how can i breathe and why dont i why dont we explode i mean this has to be a vacuum the mother of all vacuums following which she shivered before slowly continuing yet now suddenly i do feel cold and i dont want to explode and my breathing my breathing seems a lot more difficult but its all psychological he answered giving her hand a squeeze and psychology and parapsychology dont mix youre a telepath and in ebrancb its common knowledge that the unexplained really does exist its just that no ones explained it yet thats all but listen jake said youre right theres absolutely nothing here no time for you to suffocate in no space you can explode into this is like a place before god or if thats a blasphemy then maybe this place is god the mind of god where the only influence we can bring to bear is that of willpower see nothing happens here except we will it after all thats all there is here you and me and our free wills i know its heavy stuff but in a place where even thoughts have weight surely our free will our concentrated efforts of will must be heavier still anyway it works for me and you may believe me when i say im so very glad it does millie assured him breathlessly and a moment later oh what was that he felt her small start and asked knowingly is there something yes she whispered shrinking down into herself a little just then i thought i could swear that i felt something me too he told her that was the continuum its moving us along it wants rid of us since we havent exercised our will we must be thoughts without a purpose which tells me its time we moved on and she could actually feel them moving now as if she were in tow and jake heading in a certain direction but as for left and right forward and back up and down breeze in her face or a wind at her back there was none of that the mobius continuum made no allowance for physical points of reference yet there were coordinates and knowing them jake was able to move with a reassuring certainty of purpose and direction in short millie knew that they were going somewhere you know a lot about it dont you she said all inherited he told her and the more i use it the more i seem to remember i dont have harrys genes but whatever it was that made him tick its ticking in me too and before she could answer him were there the timedoor had no frame it was simply a hole in nothing but beyond that hole there was something an incredible something that gave it a frame of reference if nothing else and jake and millie they came to a halt on the threshold past time he told her then and even his mental voice was quiet humbled by the very concept thats the worlds entire past that youre looking at fts the entire human race all of it everyone who ever was or who is now right up to this very moment had his or her start back there its where our hominid ancestors came up out of africa where they became men maybe half a million years ago thats what youre seeing back there our ancestors their first huh million years back there was the most awesome place and perhaps even more so than the mobius continuum itself for as jake had said it was mankinds past from a primordial cradle to modern times it was birth and life and death and it was blue from beginning to end blue lifethreads sprang like neon umbilical cords from jakes and millies middles sprang away into the past where they twined and wound gradually fading into all the years gone by mingling with and losing themselves becoming indistinguishable among a million a billion six billion other threads just like them and every one of them a life and way back there where all of those myriad lifethreads the timetrails of humanity back where they converged in a far faint neon nebula half a million years ago that was where the human race had its origin mankinds big bang since when it had expanded was still expanding like the universe itself not only in space but in time back there yes the beginning of us all it seemed to millie that she could hear a sound a protracted orchestrated sighing an ahhhhhhh as if an angelic chorus were sending its onenote hymn its hum its resonance out into the mobius continuum but an ahhhhhhh without end hearing that thought jake told her no its just that it should be there i dont think anyone could look at something like this without bearing it we have pictures of what should be in our minds we think we know how things should taste smell sound and what you think youre hearing is the sound that goes with this i can bear it too millie thought she knew exactly what he meant like falling stars hissing across the sky she said thats right said jake we only imagine we hear them by the light of the past millie could now see herself see jake too floating in a blue haze on the timedoors threshold and reaching down her free hand she hesitated for a moment before passing it through the pure blue thread that connected her with her past that thread was milliei it was her very being perhaps her soul that propelled her into the now and then wonderingly unable to help herself she looked at jakes metaphysical umbilical he was looking at it too staring at it and before millie could say anything when i came here with harry he said my thread was as blue as yours was as blue as yours and then he fell silent but didnt we explain that millie said her eyes like his fixed on his lifethread no longer entirely blue but tinted tainted in its core with a single thin pale but undeniably red filament didnt we tell you what harry told us that crimson stain is korath its the thing in your mind jake trapped in your mind now but its no more the real you than than a metal filling in a tooth when it shows up on an xray plate maybe said jake but still its there and it wasnt there before his thoughts were very grim now halfconvinced of something so monstrous it didnt bear dwelling upon so that millie found herself seeking hard for a way to convince him otherwise to try to dispel the worst of his fears when you get rid of him she said when koraths gone that red stain will disappear with him but no said jake shaking his head back there at ebranch hq you and liz and goodly and chung you said harry told you that it should disappear with koratb and thats if i can find a way to get rid of him but meanwhile how can i be sure that this is just koratb you were there millie down in that bellbole with me and you saw szwarts mushrooms opening up the spores set free to drift in that wind from the pit yes she turned to him gripped his rough hard hand in both of hers and i was there longer than you id been at the mercy of that creature and of his dwarfish hunchback companion yet my thread is blue you cant let this throw you jake its not the end but simple proof of something we already knew that you have this monster in your head but now youre controlling him and not the reverse he cant touch you while hes locked away and you will find a way to be rid of him i know you will she couldnt be sure hed been listening his thoughts were somewhere else working at something else and finally he said if im infected i mean if i did come too close down there in swarts lair then logically i might expect this red taint to be getting stronger right i really dont know millie answered and if it really is koratb jake went on nothing more than that damned vampire thing his presence his taint then it must have started when i took him on board i suppose so said millie wonderingly i have to know said jake and theres no time like now or rather there is time now past time hold on to me which was all the warning millie got before he launched himself through the door and back along the pasttime stream jake she clung on for dear life terrified as the blue streamers hurtled past her like neon rocket exhausts but faster yet for they were heading into the future while millie was going in the opposite direction its okay he told her i only need relax my will and well be pushed back the other way but youve never done this before have you no he answered but somehow dont ask me it feels like i have harrys legacy i suppose jakes mind his answers felt rocksolid and likewise his grip on her so that soon she was able to calm herself and look about then oh she said these neon stars suddenly bursting into life theyre such a bright beautiful blue bursting into life he repeated her yes youre absolutely right only theyre not stars thats childbirth youre seeing that separation from a more powerful neon source its the moment the infant becomes a person in its own right another lifethread moving into its future she saw that now and said which means that the ones that go dim and blink out right again jake said and where they blink out en masse in clusters those are human disasters airplanes crash bombs explode buildings fall down trains collide whichever just like that she said and thats life said jake and looking at her limned in humanitys blue light he asked why do you keep f inching i keep thinking ill collide with someone she answered at which he had to smile and said but you cant collide this is a trail youve already walked youre simply walking it backwards in your own footsteps if you like but a moment later jake millies voice was a gasp a mental exclamation a warning red threads he saw them too many hundreds of them expanding out of the past like a writhing horde of scarlet snakes and seeming to turn the entire horizon to blood and there could be no mistaking the fact that as he advanced to meet them so the scarlet vampire lifethreads were closing in on him problems past present and grave conversations for a moment taken by surprise and unable to explain the swift approach of the red threads jake shrank down into himself and in the space of a heartbeat they were upon him both jake and millie threw up their free hands to ward off the speeding horrors only to see them blink out of existence even as they drew level for it was only then when he had the chance to think that jake understood what had happened it could only bave been the evening star be gasped anotber human disaster or maybe i should say an inhuman one but at least it tells us wbat to expect next up well be seeing luigi castellano and his creatures get theirs followed by or in real time receded by malinaris victims that will be jetbro mancbester and his family wbicb was wben i gave korath his initial route of access to my mind huh you know i still cant believe i did sornetbing like that of my own free will anyway thats what im bere to cbeck out for if you and harry and the otbers are right tbats wbere my lifethread picked up its additional splash of colour but a purely mental tbing in no way physical in which case ill begin to feel halfway safe again but still only ha lfway jake was right in short order a further doublehandful of red threads some still showing traces of blue converged out of the neon haze of the past only to terminate in violent bombbursts as jake drew level and now jethro mancbester jake said as he and millie continued to plummet into the past that poor old billionaire and those otber poor bastards on his vampire island holding on tight millie said and you say thats where you agreed to let korath into your mind on manchesters island no jake shook his head i didnt actually let him in but i did give him access he could come to visit but i didnt have to answer his knock didnt have to lay my soul bare to him if you see what i mean he didnt reside in me just yet that came later after my showdown with castellano but koratb was creeping up on me yes there was red up ahead and jake was slowing down now and yes ive actually seen how be has crept up on you said millie thoughtfully look your thread is as blue as mine again she had no sooner spoken those words when the latest crimson arrivals two of them flared out of existence and as jake came to a halt he said that was manchester and the bastard who vampirized him martin trennier i was more than a little sorry to see manchester go he fought his contamination to the bitter end knew be couldnt win but kept trying as for the other i didnt give a shit for him then glancing at his blue thread he went on after theyd died that was when i knew liz was in trouble i beard her telepathic call from malinaris casino the pleasure dome in xanadu up until then i was in the clear in the black you might say or maybe the blue said millie he nodded and that was when i did the deal with korath if i hadnt liz was a goner so if we move forward a ways just a few seconds from here there the first red tinge sprang into being sullying his lifethread then turning around and looking to the future again jake said so now you can see my problem this is where i got myself contaminated yes but its obvious that the taint isnt nearly so bad back here as it is forward of this point here the stain is barely visible but as we move towards our own time thats when youll go from being in the blue to being in the red millie answered without a trace of humour but jake i dont think you could have been watching your thread as closely as i have its possible i know why your taint gets stronger as we move forward into the future oh yes i noticed it when you crossed swords with castellano now he frowned when i crossed swords with what do you mean what are you talking about what did you motice move forward she said excited now move forward in time back toward the present i mean our present but this time keep your eyes on your thread he did as millie suggested and soon found himself paralleled by converging red threads castellano and his people again he said sourly which was when i noticed something millie told him coming backwards in time i saw some of the red go out of your thread which means that as we venture forward this is where it should take on more colour jake saw what she meant suddenly the moment after castellanos gang exploded into scarlet bombbursts the taint in his lifethread was a deeper far more noticeable red and he came to an abrupt halt as it dawned on him exactly what was happening here this was the second time liz called for me he said but by now koratb knew my affections that id risk almost anything to keep her from harm that was when she was under threat from vavara on krassos said millie and and that was when i let koratb in all the way jake finished it for her i had to he had the equations to the mdbius continuum well so did but i didnt know it for every time i tried to use them without recourse to him he interfered causing you to think you couldnt do it jake nodded so i let him in it was this deal we had he was only interested in helping me helping us ebranch to destroy malinari vavara and szwart and he said that after we had done that then hed go back down again down into the true death in that sump under the romanian refuge but somehow i dont think he will he wont go anywhere not unless i find a way to kick the bastard out and so you will said millie but thats not the point the point is that the more koratb takes bold the more red gets into your lifethread a metaphysical condition yes but thats all it is physically you arent affected you arent infected slowly nodding jake moved them forward again back towards the now and snorting derisively he said now theres a pleasant thought the more this bastard encroaches on me the redder i get but not any more said millie and not in the blood or the flesh only in the mind its his contamination not yours the reason we see it is just as i explained its like a metal filling in a hollow tooth we might even forget its there until it shows up on an xray and when the tooth is pulled and again jakes nod as he answered thats a much happier thought but it doesnt change the fact that red is red what i mean is is my red all koratb or is some of it something else you see i remember something left over from harry things that be knew keep corning back to me for instance i know bow be got rid of faetbor you do jake nodded yes harry bad him cornered just like i have koratb trapped in his mind but be tricked him into the open where faetbor couldnt bang on then be told him to leave actually gave him a chance to go back down into his grave faetbor refused so harry took him down a future timestream the necroscope knew that he could come back because be had a thread be could reel himself in but faethor had no thread and was sent hurtling into the future down a mobius timestream and for all i know hes still going and millie answered couldnt you do the same with koratb not a chance said jake for koratb knows that story too he isnt about to let himself get lured out of my mind anyway thats not the point the point is that even after harry dumped faethor still his thread was red it must have been because by then he was a vampire too and i just cant shake a certain picture i have in my mind of swarts lair and all those freedrifting spores then as a mobius door loomed up out of future time millie said jake what can i tell you what more can i say other than ive already said she shook her head i can only state the one simple fact that i was down there in the darkness in swarts dreadful fungus garden a lot longer than you were and im in the clear it was meant to reassure him but didnt not quite but it was appreciated and crossing the threshold to the now floating in the mobius continuum jake said ben trask is one lucky man to have someone like you by his side why thank you said millie but i think were all far luckier to have you after a moment he answered lets hope you are anyway and changing the subject but now theres something else i want you to see before i take you back millie knew what it was the only thing it could be and might have protested but they were already there a futuretime door she said gazing out on the vastness of all the worlds tomorrows the awesome expansion of humanity in the mobius timedimension billions of blue streamers intertwining thinning with distance becoming a haze like a faint blue wash on a cosmic canvas and thats us jake said as they stood on a very different threshold indeed the opposite of the first but once again a door whose unseen frame could only be determined by the panoply sprawling beyond it there go our lifethreads into the future our snailtrails in time out along there is the answer to everything out along said millie its just a quirk of mine he said we have left and right up and down front and back to and fro but time travel is something else and out along is how i see it thats all why not just forward said millie it seems youve accepted backwards in time so why not forward backwards because its already happened he replied i mean because its history and immutable but isnt the future also immutable said millie according to ian goodly it is maybe jake nodded but where humankind has experienced the past were not given to see the future its a hill we havent climbed yet untrodden ground millie shivered then and said we shouldnt be doing this i know said jake but i look at my polluted thread and im tempted to see if its going to stay red forever you see even now the future isnt showing us everything were only allowed to see so far ahead we certainly cant see forever jake she looked at him and he saw her puzzled expression her features picked out in neon blue and is that an hour were looking at he asked her then a day a montb a year out along that tbread of mine the answers are waiting for me to catch up to them but where otber men have to wait it out i can do it faster i can travel faster than life millie felt him preparing his mind intent upon the future his muscles bunching and his figure leaning forward across the threshold another moment and jake would be over that threshold heading out along the future timestream but dont she said or if you must go then first return me to ebranch hq i dont want to know the futurelake the present has problems enougb for what seemed like a long time he stood poised on the rim of the unknown leaning forward at an everincreasing angle as if hed heard nothing at all of what shed said then he leaned back regained his balance and gave his head a wild shake as if to clear it and as the tension gradually eased off as millie sensed his hesitation so she was prompted to argue the point further ian goodly thinks its a bad idea jake and until now hes rarely seta foot wrong hasnt harry keogb himself warned us off the future you know be has now jake was himself again almost as he answered yes and i know what happened the last time i ignored his advice so you win and i wont go wont look not now anyway im so very glad he heard her sigh her relief and jake she quickly continued at least you know your thread is no more tainted now than it was after you first gave korath full access to your mind it doesnt seem to be getting any worse but that was only a few days ago said jake what a week is that all millie sounded surprised it feels like a very long time since we were down there in the dark with swart but maybe thats because im trying bard to forget it and maybe that comes easier for you said jake with a touch of bitterness in his voice because in your case you dont bave anything to remind you then he took her to a cafe he knew overlooking a deserted rainswept beach in cannes where they drank coffees in silence before returning to london or rather before jake returned millie to london as millie stepped from the mobius continuum back onto the dais at ebranch hq she staggered a very little ian goodly at once lowered his dart gun and took her elbow steadying her but she had seen the gun anyway and looked at him and at david chung with an expression that was something more than accusing then ben trask came up on to the platform with them taking her in his arms or trying to backing away from him millie transferred her silent accusation to him and even if he hadnt been what he was trask would have known the truth of that look in her eyes theyre just dart guns he said tranquillizers i wasnt going to hurt anyone but i wasnt about to let anyone get hurt either well as you can see im hurt anyway she answered just what is it you think jake would have doneand before he could answer ill tell you what he would have done if he had been contaminated he would have given himself over into your loving care he would have asked ebranch asked you for your help then why hasnt he come back with you trasks logic his overwhelming concern for the branch for people in general overcame the guilt that he felt is he is he hes okay said millie at least i think so and then relenting as she saw the hangdog look on his face she told him and the others gathered there everything that had happened as she finished ian goodly said so jake didnt go scanning the future after all the precog was visibly relieved no but he was tempted millie answered perhaps he was afraid of what he might find but i dont think so i think he was simply heeding all the warnings hes had so wheres jake now said liz merrick whose anxiety for the necroscope was such that she was almost in tears and trask came in again with you say his lifethread was stable that it hadnt got any worse since he let korath mindsthrall into his head so whats he afraid of why couldnt jake come back with you he said he wanted to go to some place or places and think it over work it out millie answered then she looked at liz and smiled but he also said youd know how to find him i dont understand trask shook his head and i hate it when i dont understand surely he knows we need him and especially now and millie looked at him looked at him hard and steadily and said jake thinks hes in the clear but still he cant be absolutely sure have you ever stopped to consider that maybe he thinks a whole lot more of us than weve given him credit for this could be his way of protecting us by keeping well away from us and come to think of it jake reminded me of something that applies to me as much as it does to him such as said trask frowning that its been only a few short days since he and i were down there deep under london with lord szwart millie answered how long does it take for the spores to take hold fuse with us and begin to mutate our systems if i were as brave as jake if i thought i could face the future on my own maybe i wouldnt have wanted to come back either youre brave enough trask told her then as finally she allowed him to put an arm round her waist and as for szwarts spores if those sleepers are infected which is something we just dont know yet then why arent you the same why didnt you sleep i mean if you were infected she could only shrug and answer thats a whole lot of ifs and whys ben far too many and i dont have any answers only a handful of prayers youre not short on faith i know he said his voice low and husky now and faith like that is bravery in itself no i think you would have come back even if your lifethread was as red as hells fires thats how brave you are millie cleary you too she thought to herself as suddenly she felt the urge to cling to him to this unswerving rocksolid dedicated man you must be brave ben trask for the fact is you cant be sure either not of jake and certainly not of me yet you know where youll be sleeping tonight and with whom but lets face it you dont know what youll be sleeping with and to be honest neither do i zekintha foener later zek simmons and later still zek trask was one of only a very small handful of the teeming dead who had ever spoken to jake on his behalf she played devils advocate with the great majority attempting to woo them to his side also zek had told jake that all the worlds knowledge was down there in the ground or blowing in the wind and that there were plenty of dead people who went on in death to perfect what they had left unfinished in life who might be able to help him with all kinds of problems and situations if only they could be persuaded to converse with him it was chiefly koraths fault that they couldnt life they understood for it had once been their condition death too for obvious reasons but undeath a place between the two and a fearful threat to the living who were their descendants that was something they avoided with a will of iron only those few members of the great majority who had been close to the original necroscope harry keogh would have anything to do with jake and even they were cautious fearing excommunication from their worldwide cemeterieswide church of souls but on the other hand there were those among the great majority who would never be alone who within their own small body their own exclusive group feared nothing except fear itself zek foener was one of them and the man whom shed loved in two worlds jazz simmons was another on the mediterranean island of zante more properly zakynthos from which zeks name derived she and jazz simmons had built a house and a life together following their adventures in sunsidestarside but no one lives forever and jazz had succumbed to an incurable illness zeks love of the island and also of jazz had drawn her spirit back there on numerous occasions and she was no longer a prisoner of the romanian refuges dark gurgling sump unlike malinaris exlieutenant korath who had been a stranger to the outer world of men before inveigling his way into jakes mind zek had developed a certain mobility and since she had been a telepath all her life shed discovered no great difficulty in contacting jazz where he now lay at rest in a little cemetery overlooking the sea in zante familiar with the coordinates of the house near porto zoro and having returned millie to ebranch hq jake took the mobius route to zante emerging from the continuum on the pebbled path that led to the door of zeks oncedwelling others lived there now but he knew that zek was as likely to be here as anywhere he could of course simply call out to her using deadspeak to discover her whereabouts but that wasnt his way or rather it hadnt been harry keoghs way whose esteem for the dead was such that it wouldnt let him shout after them but caused him wherever possible to present himself close to their final resting places as a necroscope the necroscope that had never posed a problem and what had been good enough for the original was good enough for jake now he stood beneath mediterranean pines under a night sky flecked with wispy clouds and looked northwest at the lights of zakynthos town where their glitter showed through the tangle of hanging branches the sweet night air laden with the scents of late flowers herbs and resin was still misty from a recent shower but the air wasnt jakes medium as he softly inquired zek are you here jake the answer came at once from not very far away yes but not at the house im with jazz am i intruding he felt awkward unusual for him it had to be more of harry keoghs alleged humility rubbing off on him not at all zek answered in fact we were talking about you can you come to us her deadspeak voice was a beacon that jake could home in on as easily as lizs telepathy and a moment later he stepped out of the continuum at a location on the oceans rim between porto zoro and argassi the clouds were clearing and on a rocky promontory a small white church gleamed like alabaster in the light of the stars its image reflected in the waters of the bight between the beach and the dark silhouettes of gnarled pines where they stepped down from the contourshugging coastal road a small graveyard was laid out in neat regularly tended plots well hidden from the tourist beat in as tranquil a spot as anyone could wish for only the gentle bush hush of wavelets on sand and pebbles disturbed the place and then only like a heartbeat compensating for all the silenced hearts that were buried here jazz simmonss plot would probably seem unremarkable to any other visitor but jake was drawn to it as an iron filing to a magnet and as he stepped closer jake said zek this is jazzs place and this is jazz she could have shown jazz as hed been but didnt and jake understood that they were beyond such vanities now it was sufficient that they were here its my pleasure he said wondering if hed chosen the right words but apparently he had mine too said jazz his deadspeak full of sincerity its also my pride youre the fourth jake and theres not many of us get to meet all four of you all four of for a moment jake didnt quite understand but then he did and said you met all of the others too yes i did jazz answered zek and me both but she knew them better than l did i met harry and the dweller on starside where we all joined up against the wampbyri in the great battle for the dwellers garden and i was with harry and ebraneb out here in the med when we went up against janos ferenezy i might have missed harrys boy nathan but zek brought him here so he could help us sort some things out that wed never got round to while i was alive and now theres you so if theres any way i can id like a chance to settle any outstanding debts debts said jake see said jazz i figure i owe all of your what predecessors all the other necroscopes i owe harry for zek the dweller for bringing us back to earth from storside and nathan for oh a good many things but i never got around to squaring it with them so if theres anything i can do for you just mention it you can collect on their behalf and zek said i feel the same way about it but you already know that so why are you here jake i can feel that something is troubling you and i really cant see why since its obvious youve managed to get rid of koratb tonguetied until now on hearing that name jake snapped out of it oh really he said you cant any longer sense koraths presence previously youve said he was like a dark shadow that i was carrying with me something like that anyway thats right said zek i could sense him dark and secretive against your warmth and openness but no more what did you do to get rid of him and jake sighed and admitted i didnt harry keogh did he locked him in an empty room in my mind put him someplace where he cant do any barm and then he told the pair all about it when he was finished zek said well thats a start but it isnt whats bothering you or if it is its only part of it and jazz said get it off your chest necroscope maybe thats it jake said then this necroscope tag okay so i use the mobius continuum and yes i do have deadspeak but with me it really is a dead language i mean what good does it do me if the majority of the great majority wont listen to me if they cant help me necroscope an instrument for conversing with the dead but theres only a small handful of you who want anything to do with me it makes me feel i dont know like im guilty or an impostor or something like im not worthy of you makes me feel i cant possibly get up there with them the real guys like im some kind of fake miming to the music and jazz said well if youre a fake youre the best damn imitation i ever spoke to and then to his companion in a somewhat puzzled tone zek didnt you tell me you thought jake was a little er brash in your own words a rough diamond yes and i told jake so too zek answered unrepentant but wonderingly and so be is or was as for the cold side you mentioned jazz went on i have to admit i can feel that but there was that about all the others too cold as steel sometimes yet warm as the fires that forged them to tell the truth if you hadnt told me this was jake i would have been willing to swear it was harry himself and there said zek to jake thats a rare compliment it seems youve made another convert but jake shook his head and said not really its plain to me that youd already been working on jazz which reminds me i remember what you said that you two had been talking about me so dare i ask about your topic of conversation other than my er brashness roughness and coldness et cetera have i offended you zek was at once anxious even contrite no jake shook his head and then he smiled in fact i even liked the rough diamond bit but knowing that youre on my side i mean knowing the trouble youve been having with the great majority i thought that maybe you bad some news for me something i might find useful zeksighed and said im sorry to have to say this jake but despite everything youve achieved still you havent moved the teeming dead i dont know why but theyre unimpressed everything ive achieved all that jake could remember was a hell of a lot of violence and destruction but as always his thoughts were deadspeak and jazz answered them that too he said but surely the end justifies the means as a result of all that violence you and ebranch have rid the world of a monstrous plague or at least youve started to zek quickly corrected him and jake said you know about all that of course said zek for thats what we were talking about when we felt your presence all those undead who are now truly dead no longer a threat we felt them come over onto our side a great many of them most were immediately excluded the great majority will have no truck with vampires which in a nutshell said jake wryly describes my problem precisely and he sensed zeks nod until youre completely rid of the thing inside you until our council leaders our spokespersons can be absolutely sure of you nothing much is going to change but jake was frowning now you say most of the creatures we killed were excluded so what about the rest which ones didnt you exclude there are always exceptions that prove the rules zek answered and because deadspeak often conveys more than is actually said jake knew what she meant that was in krassos he nodded those poor nuns that vavara defiled you saved some of them and most of the children off that ship too said zek they were simply well dead but not all of them as for those nuns a lot of them were too far gone into vampirism still it seems unfair said jake musingly what does said jazz that while theres room even for vampires in the afterlife jake answered or redeemed vampires if you like ivegot to remain a pariah i mean this is so frustrating what do i have to do to prove myself get rid of koratb zek replied hes the last hurdle jake and once bes gone im sure the dead will accept you in fact i really cant understand why they havent already but then i havent been around as long as some as a comparative newcomer what weight can i add to the wisdom of centuries which suggests said jake gloomily that maybe your spokespersons know more than theyre putting out for general consumption this was speculative and there could be no real answer to it but zek tried to provide one anyway the great majority fear contamination she said that much has to be obvious so perhaps when you and ebrancb have dealt with the invaders from starside and jazz said youre still with ebranch arent you i dont know jake was frank about it being with an outfit like ebranch is about as frustrating as trying to talk to the dead er present company excepted i honestly dont know what goes on in their minds or rather i do the trouble is they have their suspicions too theyre suspicious of me hub said jazz i know what you mean its a long time ago but i still remember when the branch recruited me at that time they might as easily have called it dtbrancb because thats what it was all about dirty tricks and when things went wrong it was usually their own agents who got sbafted i should know because thats how i ended up in starside since then well zek has been trying to convince me that its all different now but it sounds to me like things havent changed too much ebranch youll need to watch your step with those people jake get the job done and then get out thats my advice and jake said youre saying that the job comes first you shouldnt have to ask said jazz i mean were talking about the wampbyri right if it was anything else id tell you to get out now but like it or not you are the necroscope and even if the dead dont appreciate you your powers were given to you for a reason harry gave you them to fight the wampbyri so what else do you need to know believe me you wouldnt want to live in a world of vampires if youd seen starside youd know what i mean jake nodded i already know what you mean ive seen enough in this world let alone starside so when youre done here said zek you will be going back is it that important to you jake asked her he sensed zeks nod you see she said despite that jazz bad some problems with ebranch a long time ago i know ben and his people are the best sort im sure of it because there once was a time when i worked with the wrong sort also i know that what happened to me wasnt their fault so if i could help them i would and so should you for goodness sake jake thats why im trying to help you but i havent really left them jake answered i might possibly keep out of their way and also out of harms way for a while stand off and see bow they get on but im not walking out on them no theres someone with them who who knows how to keep in touch good said zek and now what are your plans right now right now said jake frowning with his mind as well as his face theres someone else i want to talk to but not here from jakes suddenly grim tone of voice zek guessed at once who he was talking about korath she said her own tone apprehensive do you think it wise hes one sleeping dog you should let lie until theres a way to dispose of him for good i mean bes sure to play his word games with you and you dont need reminding what happened the last time you tangled with him no i dont jake answered but where word games more properly mind games are concerned it seems ive become something of a player in my own right ill feel far more confident in my dealings with koratb now anyway i know that if he gets out of hand i can always lock him up again youre sure about that said jazz i reckon jake nodded see i can feel him in there banging on a certain door but faintly so that it doesnt bother me and theres a window in that door that i can open and close he cant escape unless i open the door for him and until then the window lets me talk to him but why would you want to said zek because if theres anyone who knows what our three wamphyri invaders will do next said jake it has to be korath the last trick up his sleeve and its high time he played it but remember jake no more deals no false partnerships you have my word on it jake reassured them no more deals no more partnerships no more bargaining not if i can help it anyway so where will you talk to him said zek and as jake conjured a mobius door he smiled a gaunt grim smile and answered in the place thats most suited to him the place where we first met him you and i a place as nightblack and soulless as koratb himself and the only place i know where hes the frightened one and i have the advantage the sump under the romanian refuge said zek shivering got it in one jake replied before saying a brief farewell and making his exit the romanian refuge or rather its subterranean ruins jake had been there once before in something that had been a great deal more than a simple dream the revenant of harry keogh had taken him there to speak to malinaris exlieutenant korath but jake had failed to heed harrys warning and now korath was locked in his mind almost but not quite a part of him yet sufficient of a presence that he was gradually ruining jakes life in the dream jake had scarcely understood the principle of mobius coordinates he hadnt known that from then on he would automatically store such coordinates in his increasingly metaphysical mind but now it had become as simple as moving from one familiar room into another it would have taken just a fraction of a second to step into the continuum at jazzs graveside and out again into the gloom of the sump whose hydraulic energy had once powered the refuge and yet jake exited the continuum warily slowly feeling the way before him and ready at a moments notice to return to the nothingness of the mobius dimension the reason for his caution was knowledge of the sumps system the fact that it was fed by water flowing off the carpatii meridionali the transylvanian alps to the north for the seemingly endless european summer and its drought was finished and the rains had returned with a vengeance while the gate in perchorsk stood open and dry still water from the mountains might have flooded the sump but jakes concerns were illfounded the water was no deeper than before the explosion that had destroyed the refuge had opened fresh outlets for the resurgent waters through which they now flowed into the nearby danube jakes eyes took a little while to adjust from the velvet dusky starry night of a greek island to the gloom of the sump but gradually he was able to make out his surroundings and he saw that nothing had changed it was just like the first time even though that first time had been in a dream the cavedin ceiling sagging in places and in others bulging upwards from the furious force of powerful explosives the collapsed stanchions great tangles of shattered metal and concrete cratered from the blast and blackened by fire and back there along what had once been the course of the subterranean river the way completely blocked where the original caverns ceiling had succumbed to manmade convulsions and its own great weight of fractured rock up to his calves in darkly gurgling water carefully jake made his way to the solid twelvefootthick reinforcedconcrete wall of the dam that contained the dynamos and sensitive equipment which had once supplied and monitored the refuges power the oncesmooth face of the dam was gouged cracked and fireblackened in places but it was intact built to withstand the pressure of waters in flood it had also survived the pressure of the blast down against the wall of the dam where the water seemed to gurgle more blackly and viscously yet the dully gleaming curved upper rim of a steel pipe projected some seven or eight inches above the swirl one of the conduits that had once fed the dynamos from its curvature jake could see that the pipe would be maybe fifteen inches in diameter a child or an incredibly thin man or perhaps a circus contortionist might just be able to crawl or slither through it as for korathoncemindsthrall he had been none of these things but a grotesque hulking lieutenant of the wamphyri yet in order to attract attention to the sump and thus effect their escape nephran mahnari and his vampire colleagues had exerted their combined strength to cram korath alive and screaming head first into this pipe like so much sealant into a leaky cistern and in order to do so theyd broken the bones in his shoulders hips and lower legs and folded his feet in after him koraths flesh had long since sloughed away but his naked bones were still in there endlessly swirled and rounded by the action of the water polished as if theyd been boiled jake backed away from the conduit got up onto a dry ledge of concrete that had fallen from the ceiling used the flats of his hands to squeegee water out of his trouser bottoms and sat hugging his knees while he considered his approach in the end however there was nothing to consider nothing left to do but open that window in his mind speak to the monster and try to convince him to return to his watery grave while jake told himself that this was his principal reason for being here he knew it wasnt the only one there was also the matter of malinari szwart and vavara what they would do next now that their initial plans were in ruins for even without their fungi gardens still they were monstrous invaders from alien spheres with powers enough between them to turn the earth into a wasteland that would rival starside and whether jake liked it or not he accepted that harry keoghs legacy had become his burden like an invisible force from within it powered him and it would not be denied romania and korath london and liz turkey and bernie fletcher and friends jake listened to a place inside his head concentrated on one of the many rooms in the mansion of his mind the vampire was in there his mental stench was unmistakable but he was no longer banging on the door he could be asleep but jake didnt think so and koratb he said as he accessed that secret inner region i think its high time we talked you and i but since this could be the last chance you get to talk youd better watch what you say and you should most definitely watch what you do or try to do for you can bet your life i shall be watching i bet my life a long time ago korath answered sulkily and i lost the bet so what do you want of me now jake cutter and where where have you brought me with that last question a certain disquiet had found its way into his deadspeak voice slowly turning his head knowing that korath would see what he saw jake scanned the collapsed cavern then quite deliberately he directed his gaze toward the sullenly gleaming rim of the conduit that looked like the open mouth of a great metal fish breaking the surface of the swirling water that place korath gasped then and the vibrations in the psychic aether were the equivalent of a shudder youve brought me back to that place jake nodded and answered knowing that youre uncomfortable here makes me feel that much more at ease gives me the psychological advantage and on the subject of psychology a warning dont go messing with my emotions back at ebranch hq you very nearly had me you almost took control of me but that wont happen again only let me feel a tweak the smallest tweak and ill close this window lock the door and weld it shut on you after that i can guarantee therell be no more visiting days huh korath snorted his bravado but it came off sounding a lot less than derisive do you really think itll be that easy well it wont be you may have power over me now but it cant last for ever you have to sleep sometime and when you do when i do jake cut him short nothing but nothing is going to happen and settling himself a little more comfortably on the rough concrete slab he explained you see korath its an automatic thing this new trick of mine is as instinctive as breathing i dont even have to think about it from the moment i break off talking to you and close this window youre locked in shut down deaf dumb and blind and me i can carry on living my life as if youd never existed in the first place why i might even forget youre there he let that sink in waved a hand negligently in the direction of the morbid conduit and went on you want to know something youve no idea just how fortunate you were in that pipe you could always eavesdrop on the thoughts of the teeming dead you were never completely isolated you were at least conscious of your own loathsome self but locked in my mind out of touch with everything bow long do you think youd last before you lost even that degree of consciousness selfawareness how was it for you bow did it feel these last few hours youre locked in the smallest isolation tank in the whole wide world koratb and it isnt about to get any bigger not a pleasant prospect said korath gloomily but then he brightened however we know it isnt going to happen its not what youre about for if it was you would have done it without recourse to me no youre not the type to bring me here simply to threaten and torture me jake oh yes i can see the psychological edge that this hideous place gives you but answer me this why would you even require such an edge if youre as powerful as you pretend so then enough of all this and lets cut to the chase simply tell me what you want of me and what im to get in return seeing his advantage slipping away jake gritted his teeth and said when im finally rid of you i think ill really miss these little sessions of ours youre a truly remarkable creature and in certain ways i cant help admiring you you havent a snowballs chance in hell but still you wont give in wampbyri you came pretty damn close and i reckon malinari knew it you would have ascended soon enough its true the other readily agreed i bad outlived my usefulness and malinari feared i might usurp him at least he was aware of the possibility or so i pride myself in any case he chose his moment of treachery perfectly and found a lastminute use for me to boot but theres more than mere flattery in what you just said indeed by introducing malinari into the conversation youve revealed your real reason for speaking to me part of it jake answered my entire reason for speaking to you is to make you an offer give you a choice isolation in my mind or freedom well of sorts in this sump in return for which youll tell me what malinari and his invader friends will do next hah said korath and this is a choice i remember malinari gave just such a choice to a slothful noisy thrall he could either leap from a high window or be thrown for being idle and noisy aye korath snapped thralls are for working not for chattering and definitely not for thinking malinari loathes noiseeven the whispers of secretive perhaps renegade thoughts as much as he loves soft or plaintive music in his great aerie in starside he was wont to use the one to drown the other thus achieving a tolerable balance but as for his own balance that was a very delicate thing you mean hes a madman said jake of course he is said korath as were most of the wamphyri i thought that was understood jake nodded i remember your stories of starside now which you told to me and harry keogh in this very spot at that time however all of this was new to me and i wasnt paying too much attention your loss said korath and too late now you wont wheedle any more starside stories out of me what my very existence what little is left of it under threat and heres me giving away valuable information you must have been practising jake your word games are much improved but be that as it may nothing has changed still i ask you what is this for a choice to be locked in your mind or returned to this dreadful sump bah you wont tell me what these invaders the selfsame creatures who murdered you will do next not even if i knew said korath for my days of doing deals with such as you are over our socalled partnership which you have betrayed is as dead as i am jake couldnt leave it at that and said are you trying to tell me you dont know what theyll do next but cant you even guess perhaps i could said the other but i wont ive done you my last favour jake cutter and now jake got angry favours youve done me no favours korath the only reason you got into my mind in the first place was to usurp me as you would have usurped malinari you planned to take over my mind gradually squeezing me out until you were all that was left your filthy mind in my body well it didnt work and now youre in an even tighter squeeze so well leave it at that for now ill let you think it over and maybe just maybe give you another chance later later said korath with a coarse chuckle is there to be a later then youll return to make me a better offer perhaps now that this one has failed oh ill return said jake trying not to snarl in an hour or so or maybe a week or a month ill return and if by then theres anything left of you if you arent completely out of your mind perhaps youll see sense and get out of mine while youre still able sensing that jake was leaving korath rose up defiantly and cried go then and dont bother to come back until you bare an offer i can live with oh hahabaaaargh but his mad laughter bounced back on him for jake had shut him in conjured a mobius door and taken his leave he had gone yes but with nothing achieved for even now hed been obliged to take korath with him jake had left some money items of clothing and other personal odds and end in his room at ebranch hq now he would go there go directly there along his own special route pack a suitcase leave a brief explanatory note and remove to somewhere to just about anywhere else since he no longer headed europes mostwanted list the world was his oyster with all of his old haunts available to him and yet he held back from returning to london telling himself that the night was far too young ben trask and his agents would be working late thered be people coming and going jake might well find himself tempted to tell liz merrick what he was doing which would be a neat trick because he didnt himself know what he was doing and so forth liz yes it was mainly liz hed probably bump into her no he would definitely deliberately bump into her and that was something he didnt want oh really oh he wanted it all right he would be crazy not to want liz but he knew that it would tie him to the branch and that trask would probably try to tie him down the man would be intrusive to say the least what was more it could prove dangerous to liz what could prove dangerous sex with jake if he should get lucky because then liz might get unlucky damn it all to hell and with his frustrations mounting jake went over it again his red thread was it just korath or something else something much worse trasks main men at ebranch seemed convinced that jake was in the clear but trask himself was unsure and he was the one who should know the truth of it wasnt he but then again how could he know what jake himself didnt know what he was scared to find out and yet for all trasks caution tonight he would be in bed with millie cleary but why not since hed already jeopardized himself it was common knowledge in the branch that he and millie were lovers and that theyd been lovers before and since the episode in szwarts toadstool garden so that even before millies trip through mobiustime with jake trask had accepted that she wasnt infected or at least hed accepted the risk that he was taking but as for liz as yet she was definitely in the clear and jake wasnt about to do anything to alter the status quo or so he kept telling himself but on the other hand and according to millie so was jake in the clear the red in his thread was korath it reminded him of something out of an ancient danny kaye movie the tint with the taint is in the vassal from the castle while the blood thats good has a hue thats blue such was jakes odd not exactly humorous train of thought as he wandered a lonely beach in the algarve where the sand was still warm then the boulevards of paris in the dusk of evening followed by the dreary raindamp promenade in marseilles until eventually it was night not only in greece portugal and france but right across europe and far out into the atlantic by pm jake had consumed three or four brandies too many in a smoky oakbeamed pub in the heart of london just a tenminute walk from the hotel that housed ebranch because of the proximity hed kept his psychic shields firmly in place a precaution he intended to maintain when he rescued his belongings from his room or at least that was what hed told himself but after hed made his mobius jump to his locked room and as he packed his suitcase jake a voice out of nowhere but not deadspeak and shit he said and literally reading his mind you werent going to let me know you were back it was liz of course not too far away and hurt and indignant it seems your talent is improving all the time he said in her own mode either that or our rapport is getting stronger which is a whole lot more than can be said for our personal relationship she came back at him he sat on his bed sighed and told her i want you like mad and i feel im going mad because i reckon you want me too you know bow i feel about you of course you do because of the way youve always been able to read me but youve got to admit it liz theres a pretty good reason why why we shouldnt not according to millie she answered ive been talking to her and she says that from what she saw in the continuum youre safe that in itself would be enough for me but theres more more jake could tell from the tone of her telepathic voice that over and above her resentment still she was excited about something youre safe jake she told him you really are and if you hadnt been in such a hurry to clear out but where are you close i know but can you come to me that was what he had wanted to hear jake realized that now it was why hed relaxed his shields so that hed to be able to sense liz close by smell her scent on the psychic aether but could he go to her lord yes if only to find out what she was talking about it was one of the shortest jumps hed ever made and it was only now that jake discovered just how close shed always been that in fact her room was at the back of his and only a flimsy partition wall separating them but now as he homed in on her and stepped from the continuum into normal space nothing separated them lizs bedside light was turned down low and she was sitting up in her tousled bed she wore a shirt of some gauzy material open in a long v in front and the light shining through from the side silhouetted her left breast almost as if it were naked the hollows under her eyes wore the telltale purplish bloom of a telepath who has been hard at work and there were also signs that shed been crying no need to ask what liz had been doing obviously shed been scanning for him but hed been too far away and too well shielded he sat down on the foot of the bed shrugged helplessly and said what can i tell you of course i wanted to see you want to hold you want us to be together and want to to but i dont trust myself i mean i trust myself but not the thing inside me or the thing that might be inside me korath she said but hes locked away now isnt he and after staring at him for a moment in that searching way of hers no i see now that you dont mean korath korath is locked away good and tight jake answered oh he would have enjoyed playing the voyeur but thats beyond him now im not so much concerned about him as this other thing of mine this crimson stain and i thought that was what you meant when you said something about my being safe but thats exactly what i meant she said leaning toward him so that her shirt fell open she followed his gaze saw her nakedness and her first instinct was to cover herself which she ignored and jake she said her voice so thickened that she could barely speak his name jake even if we didnt think you were okay still i would want you our minds are already as one or they would be if we worked together in full cooperation and theres no longer any reason why our bodies shouldnt be as one too he leaned towards her felt love in his heart and lust in his loins then snatched himself away shook his head and got to his feet you dont know what youre saying yes i do liz said im saying id take a chance just like ben and millie are taking a chance but that its such a remote chance now that it no longer merits our concern youd better tell me what youre talking about he said and please do it quickly whats been happening here come here she said holding out her arms to him he couldnt any longer resist her stepping quickly to her side he sat down on the bed and took her in his arms but the way he held her so tightly that she couldnt move was simply to stop this thing from going any further until shed told him everything and now she did just an hour ago we got a message from the minister responsible relayed from porton down it was about that specimen you got for them the plasma in it was it was still alive it wasnt quite dead as we understand death if you see what i mean and they had found similar activity in other specimens cells were regenerating the blood wasnt coagulating and the flesh god was still fresh it was all too deep for me and went right over my head anyway after carrying out all kinds of tests and trying various agents on it they discovered that plague bacteria kills it dead plague bac jake released her just a little you mean that new strain of the bubonic out of china the same liz nodded whatjakes jaw fell open he let go of her sat back let it all sink in but in another moment he shook his head despairingly lifted his eyes to the ceiling and gave a harsh barking laugh and taking her by the shoulders he said well isnt that just bloody wonderful and surprised by her frown her puzzled expression liz what is it with you havent you forgotten something some small perhaps insignificant detail like out in australia how we all had shots against the plague every bloody one of us and by now just about everyone in the world how can you be so happy sitting there telling me weve discovered another way to kill vampires just a couple of weeks after weve immunized ourselves against that agent but now she was laughing too bringing his outburst to an abrupt halt and you didnt let me finish she said those jabs we took were made of dead plague bacteria dead to us but undead to the undead from now on if they suck on us on anyone who has had their shots they just wont be able to take it the agent will reactivate in them nothing of their filth can get into us and anything of us that gets into them will kill them it was too much for jake too sudden and now they were both laughing but really laughing almost hysterically laughing as they collapsed in each others arms then jake grew thoughtful sat up and said then the tint with the taint really is in the vassal from the castle it has to be in him and him alone what she said stroking his neck with one warm hand and unbuttoning his shirt with the other no wait he said drawing back again somethings out of whack here it isnt right in fact its very wrong what is she fell back against the beds headboard im talking about those people on the evening star jake answered what about them they must have had shots yet they became victims and it doesnt seem to have affected malinari or vavara one little bit oh that liz said well ben asked the minister responsible the same question it seems that porton down didnt have the capacity to manufacture enough of the antidote for the entire population so they tendered it out to other manufacturers and of course it was all done in a big hurry also a decision was taken to only innoculate people who were entering or leaving the country if you remember thats what the australians did too at ports and airports et cetera i remember jake nodded so the evening star cruise was a package holiday liz went on all the passengers had flown out from heathrow where they were given their shots to limassol where they boarded the ship but certain batches of the plague antidote were defective they were harmless enough to the people who got them but they just didnt work and the heathrow batch was one of them she had begun to unbutton his shirt again but jake wasnt happy with this as yet okay he said but the crew of that ship werent all brits no liz answered but trask speculates that just as you would be turned off by the smell of rotten food so might vampires be able to detect inedible people he also said something about pheremones that malinari and vavara would probably feel repulsed by people who werent right for them she had finished unbuttoning his shirt and was shrugging out of her own pheremones said jake looking at her ample breasts her delicious stiffened brown nipples only inches from his hands his chest his mouth well i dont know about vampire pheremones but right now mine are working overtime mine too liz answered and the blood thats good still has its blue hue jake said ready now to believe it moreover the vassal is locked in my castle what liz said turning back the covers nothing he said huskily ridding himself of his clothes and trying to reach for her all at the same time and a moment later when they were both naked and she opened her arms to him between the sheets everything else was forgotten as they came together like human magnets but warm flesh as opposed to cold steel then riding that wildest ride they lusted and loved and lusted again deep into the night there was little or no foreplay and there were very few words only sounds of endearment for when bodies and minds join like that the sensation itself is joyous beyond any such requirements several rooms and many walls away from liz and jake ben trask was preparing for bed as he left the bathroom and entered the bedroom millie sat up straight in bed and said ben theres something id like to tell you a situation but first you must promise not to do anything about it he looked at her a little suspiciously cocked his head on one side and growled its been a hell of a long day millie cant it wait yes but if it waits until tomorrow youll be mad at me no i wont he answered not unless its earthshattering in which case youd have told me already but okay since you insist i wont do anything about it what is it jakes back she said then bit her lip as trask came to an abrupt halt beside the bed he took a long moment to think about what shed said then asked her where back hes here at the hq with liz millie answered i mean you know hes with liz again trask thought about it and slowly got into bed but in a little while good he rasped making it sound anything but good really millie seemed delighted perhaps cautiously sceptical certainly surprised a mixture of all these things yes really trask put the light out then folded her in his arms because she needs him in order to in order to be whole i suppose the way i need you and i need him we need him because hes the necroscope so if liz has got him ive got him but on the other hand i still think harry could have made a better choice and the same goes for liz he felt millie stiffen in his arms whatshe said but we know harrys reason now unfinished business luigi castellano and his organization those vampires we knew nothing about who were survivors of harrys lost years jake and harry they shared the same agenda which made jake the obvious choice as for liz you cant blame her for being attracted to jake hes a very attractive man hes a bloody obstinate man said trask he thinks only of himself and right from the start hes been a loose cannon but now well now hes our cannon millie snorted and pushed apart from him and is that it is that how you see it just another ace card up your sleeve before he could answer she broke their unspoken rule searched his mind and saw the truth which was as integral to trask as his blood and bones and so thats it she said now that were together liz has taken over my kidsister role and nobody not even the necroscope is good enough for your kid sister hub trask grunted then he shrugged and said well maybe youre right maybe im being overprotective but one things for sure if liz were really my kid sister you wouldnt catch me playing at peeping tom when she was entertaining a guest in her room millie crept back into his arms and said me neither but their shields were down and they were so very well very that it was almost unavoidable like psychic fireworks i mean its an oddson bet that by now the entire hq knows that jakes back and theyre together voyeurs the lot of you but still trask had to chuckle not really she said and actually its sort of nice what is to know were not the only ones not the only lovers she gave a small shrug something like that anyway and you know even though i was only there for a moment just long enough to detect their togetherness i know its still flowing out of them like like a river of sweet wine on the psychic aether trask lay still for a moment then turned more fully toward her and said me i cant feel a thing not from them anyway but its pretty obvious that you can yes millie breathed into his neck and its very infectious which was something that trask made no attempt to deny bernie fletchers psychic shielding had always been something of a joke to the rest of his colleagues in ebranch ben trask wasnt the only one who occasionally took the mickey accusing bernie of glowing in the dark but while it wasnt as bad as all that still at close range fletchers aura the waves he gave off into the psychic aether would be clearly visible to most espers just as fletcher was able to locate other talented individuals so could he be located which was why trask had tended to use him as a tracker in situations where he could keep his distance while pinpointing the target that was how hed worked out in greece and bulgaria when he and lardis lidesci had been tracking the old gypsy vladi ferengi fletcher had guided lardis and his minders unerringly to the gypsy encampment and then lardis had gone alone into the camp to talk to the travelling folk in short bernie had always played the part of radar or asdic to ebranchs far more potent flak and depthcharge units the ones who followed up with fire and fury on this occasion however fletcher was himself the man a lone field agent whose mission was to get as close as possible to his target and remain in situ until his backup squad arrived to do whatever was necessary not that he was entirely alone his minders had worked with him before and were specialists in close protection they knew something of what ebranch was about and had been sworn to secrecy right now one of them joe sparrow was sitting just inside their hotel rooms door reading a book and his colleague cliff angel was out in the town trying to find a place to buy some cigarettes at this time of night fletcher suspected hed be out of luck the town was that what this was a town looking out of the bleary window fletcher could think of a couple of hundred places where he would rather be for sirpsindigi on or close to the borders with greece and bulgaria was just about as drab as it got a town well it had roads buildings and a main motorway running close by but as for anything else forget it and turkey itself from what little fletcher had actually seen of it which he had to admit hadnt been too much in the flurry of travel arrangements and bumping along thirdclass roads in a hired boneshaker and what all well at least theyd got that one right by no means a misnomer oh fletcher knew that the country was rich in antiquities archaeological treasures and the like he was aware of the fact that istanbul was a mecca for tourists and that plenty of turkeys mediterranean beaches were a match for anything that the greek islands had to offer but but sirpsindigi was where his trackers nose had led fletcher and his minder colleagues and here the trail had fizzled out no beaches here no treasures and no more mindsmog that puzzled him because the scent had been so strong he had known where to go it had been as if this place and not bernie himself glowed in the dark or rather in that corner of his mind that housed his esoteric talent and so hed homed in on the glow and come here only to discover that the beacon had been doused while he was still en route it could be of course that his aura had been detected by someone or something perhaps like a bloodhound hed been baying too loudly alerting the fugitives and causing them to lie low bernie didnt know for sure so all he could do now was remain here try to pick up the trail again and wait until trask and co arrived when with any luck theyd improve on his findings before moving on to the next location and meanwhile he was stuck in this godforsaken dump this twotaxies town on the edge of nowhere that looked like nothing so much as a barely postindustrialrevolution way station just a handful of stops up the road towards civilization take away the cobbles and street lights ignore the mopeds rickety bicycles and foulsmelling threewheeler vans throw in some mud a batswing door or two and a couple of tumbleweeds it could easily be something out of one of those old western movies except they had atmosphere and this hadnt youre looking down in the mouth bernie said joe sparrow who had stopped reading and was now cleaning oiling and fitting together a carbonfibre reinforced cermet mm automatic invisible on airport xray machines finishing up and slapping in a clip he waved the gun at fletcher and said i cant understand why your people dont use these things those brownings of yours are hard to smuggle and make far more noise than these cermets right now i dont even have a browning fletcher answered dolefully too risky trying to get it in what with the continuing border disputes and tensions with greece then he managed a grin thats one of the few reasons im glad to have you and cliff along true you fart a lot and clutter the place up but you do have the firepower he looked out into the night again down onto the street where a trio of figures with their coat collars turned up against the drizzle were just approaching the hotels entrance one of them looked like cliff angel but what with the darkness the bleary windows and the rain it was hard to say for sure and jesus fletcher commented shaking his head its like a night at the ends of the earth out there shit if cliffs addiction doesnt give him lung cancer hell die of pneumonia anyway then he looked at sparrow again and told him the reason we dont use those keramiques is simply that our ammo has a low melting point and would wreck those barrels in no time but our modified brownings are custombuilt and suit us to perfection he didnt mention that the ammunition ebranch used was made of silver while his minders knew something about the branch they didnt by any means know it all if they had known well it might have been a lot harder to find men whod accept this kind of work there came a triple knock at the door for a moment neither sparrow nor fletcher moved then they jerked to their feet and looked at each other through widening anxious eyes a triple knock only three taps when there should have been four and they both knew that cliff angel wasnt the kind of man whod be playing stupid practical jokes on them fletcher crossed the floor to sparrow in five long strides and whispered i saw three men come into the hotel sparrow nodded his understanding and called out loudly to whoever was outside that you cliff hang on just a mo and under his breath to fletcher answer the door but nice and casual ill be back here as sparrow took up his position behind the door fletcher shrugged down into himself roughed up his red hair as if hed just woken up tried to make himself smaller then he took the chain off the door opened it and at once took a step backwards his green eyes going wide in shock that was only partly faked the first face hed seen out in the corridor had been cliff angels but it was pale and drawn flanking him and close behind two slightly taller thinner men who by their looks might well have been twins or even clones each held one of angels arms and one of them was pointing a gun into the room as fletcher backed off he noticed that the strangers were looking as nervous as he was feeling and as they began to bustle angel into the room so the minder shrugged himself free of them held up his hands before him placatingly and said its okay cool it his escort immediately came to a halt at which angel breathed a sigh of relief and said come out from behind the door joe its okay i think but even as angel spoke so his voice had hardened and his stiffened left hand sliced down striking the wrist of the man with the gun with sufficient force to send the weapon flying a moment more and fletcher had stepped forward grabbed the mans collar and numbed dangling wrist in a judo hold turned on his heel and used his shoulder as a lever to hurl him far into the room fletcher was no slouch when it came to unarmed combat meanwhile joe sparrow had loomed into view from behind the door stuck his keramique into the side of the other strangers neck and told him move slow really slow and i wont kill you not yet anyway and dragging him into the room he slammed the door then gave the frightenedlooking man a shove that sent him reeling causing him to trip over his colleague where he lay sprawled on the floor cliff angel had snatched up the fallen weapon aiming it at the dishevelled strangers he said okay and now you can tell me your story again and this time well see if my friends here believe it sirpsindigi and london double detente the two men who if looks were anything to go by were white europeans sat gawping at fletcher and his minders apparently stunned by the sudden reversal of fortunes yet fletcher wasnt certain about that and joe sparrow had found the encounter way too easy with his eyes narrowed sparrow said cliff what the fuck is going on here glancing at angel he kept the muzzle of his keramique trained squarely on their captives did these people jump you or what they did and they didnt said angel they came from an alley as i walked past but if they really meant to take me it was the work of amateurs i think i could probably have made my break turned the tables before we got back here i considered doing it but then they mentioned a few things that left me undecided if what they said was true then i didnt want to fuck things up apart from which and to be honest i didnt much fancy the odds not with a gun in the small of my back they mentioned a few things sparrow repeated him frowning about what what kind of things hold your horses joe angel answered lets observe the priorities like first i want my gun back and the one with the mole has it the mark that hed mentioned a small dark mole on the jaw of one of the strangers was for the moment about the only way the pair could be told apart for it was now apparent that they were in fact almost identical twins angel approached the man in question went to one knee and reached inside his overcoat came out with his keramique next he brought out a wallet and flipped it open then standing up he said well what do you know at least part of their story is true russian id and this ones called er vladimir androsov said the man with the mole holding his arm awkwardly and grimacing then looking at fletcher he flinched and slowly added is very possible you are dislocating my shoulder dont worry about it fletcher answered i was a physio in my time and can probably pop it back again in fact i might even enjoy it switching his gaze to the other twin fletcher jerked his head inquiringly and raised an angry red eyebrow ah yes androsov carefully painfully stretched his neck inclining his head to look at his colleague this is venyamin my brother he is not speaking the english very much you will please excusing his quiet listen you said angel checking his weapon and cocking it his voice a low growl please excusing my impatience my quickly getting pissed off and tell my friends here what you told me androsov nodded grimaced again and said very well you are the british ebranch we are from russian ebranch gustav turchins men our listening stations are picking up the story about the evening star we are on the same case turchin has said that if we are meeting up with you we are the allies and no longer the opposition so venyamin and me we are locators twins we magnify we multiply each others skills that is good but when we apart we dont working so well we following the trail to this place sirpsindigi is not so difficult we have the safe house in bulgaria just across the border but when we are getting here the trail disappears said fletcher starting forward and then to sparrow and angel these people are on the level he moved to help vladimir androsov to his feet but before he reached him angel said wait so why the rough stuff why didnt they simply approach us even try giving us a call this is turkey androsov shrugged and winced again the telephones are bugged because of the trouble with greece also the separatists and fifth columnists are on the rise today the turkish man trusts no one you are lucky you got in but turkey needs the tourist money ah but if you are questioned why are you in this filthy sirpsindigi why are you having the weapons what troubles are you making we could not taking the chance to come to you in daylight in the open but at night said angel to jump me out of an alley androsov tried to look apologetic we are not field agents but locators we are finding nuclear submarines or tracking the usas mobile icbms but now this thing is starting gustav turchins agenda has changed he is saying that the whole world not just russia has the big troubles he looked at fletcher you are a locator we know that your shields are well he let it tail off and bernie reddened i glow in the dark right and thats how you found me no because we looking for you said androsov diplomatically but your friends are what the special policemen he shrank down into himself we not kgb not trained in their techniques we do not know how they will be receiving so how to approaching we do it like you see a big mistakes amateurs said angel so i was right and now be helped androsov to his feet bernie fletcher had been looking the russians over by no means a difficult task for in checking out one androsov he got an image of both sixfooters they were thin as rakes and angular in their features darkhaired greyeyed and lightskinned to the point of being pale they would be in their mid thirties they certainly didnt look dangerous office types fletcher concluded deskbound greenhorns who much like himself had suddenly found themselves thrust out into the wider far more sinister world of the field agent he found himself feeling sorry for them at least hed had a little previous experience okay said joe sparrow so what happens now i mean are we all on the same side or what yes fletcher answered and this could be the break ive been hoping for working with these fellows i might be able to pick up the trail again a bonus for trask when he gets here meanwhile angel was frisking the androsov twins apart from the one gun hed picked up from the floor a tokarev tt they were clean examining the tokarev he commented will you look at this outofdate piece of crap world war two shit a stopper at close range but thats about all and vladimir androsov said why spending money on sidearms when icbms are making them obsolete your philosophy comrade said angel cold war philosophy androsov answered they the hawks and militarists considered the space race more important but the american sdi was a myth and myths are elusive pursuing it weakened us anyway that was then and things are swiftly changing for the better i thinking in current situation you and i are no longer at war these people are what they say they are said bernie fletcher its like back at hq in london i can feel a certain kinship with them im in the presence of espers locators you can give him back his gun sure said angel and handed it over after removing the clip androsov had seen him do it and nodded trust is coming slowly he said fuck it said angel pacing the floor im out of cigarattes nicotine deficiency im on edge thats all and standing up venyamin androsov took out a pack of marlboros offered it to angel and shrugged why you no saying i smoking plenty american blend black market very expensive angel looked at him and a slow grin spread over his craggy face you mightnt speak english too well he said but you certainly pick the right things to say following which relations rapidly improved in a little while fletcher and the androsovs got down to it in front of the special branch men fletcher didnt use the term vampire and fortunately the russian espers didnt know what they were tracking only what little turchin had told them that these mutual enemies were exceptionally dangerous like fletcher himself theyd been advised only to locate the source of the alien aura then to stand off and contact or wait for ebranch to arrive which turchin had known must happen sooner or later sooner as it had turned out now at in the morning local time the three parapsychologists sat at a small table and concentrated on a map of sirpsindigi and the outlying district the maps legend was in turkish but venyamin compensated for any deficiency in his english with an excellent grasp of the turkish language at first vladimir androsov explained from bulgaria we are locating these strange how do you say it like your london when the vapour is coming off the river and all the peoples are doing the coughing these mental fumes yes mindsmog said fletcher at once i know exactly what you mean vladimir nodded the smog in the mind yes but then when we are coming here the mindsmog it quickly goes away we feel it fading until it has gone he stabbed at the map with a finger it was there fletcher looked at the map at a district already ringed in biro but couldnt make head or tail of it its about what half a mile south of here one kilometre vladimir nodded south and a little west then because the mindsmog is gone we are thinking is not dangerous to going there it is the better part of the town more better than here we passed through when we drove in said fletcher but i wanted to stay at a place that was less prominent understanding vladimir answered we are the same and joe sparrow standing close to the table came in with so what did you find there vladimir looked up at him nothings he said and then he frowned but there was i dont know somethings like a bad taste in the mouth but in the mind it soon went away cliff angel pulled a face and said you psychoids are very weird people you get results i know but ive never been able to figure you out believe me said fletcher looking up at him you really wouldnt want to figure this out and then to vladimir what about physically i mean was there anything about that part of town that especially impressed you or depressed you did you take note of where you got this bad taste its exact location and now venyamin androsov nodded turned to his brother and said something to him in russian fletcher caught just one word kino which he knew meant cinema in german so maybe it was the same in russian and kino fletcher repeated him the cinema what about it no vladimir shook his head this place is not quite the cinema films are showing there but is also the cabaret like the opera but not the opera ah the burlesque the political satire also the belly dancing yes especially the girls when they are dancing joe sparrow said i thought the turks were just as fond of little boys fletchers minders were far less than politically correct and cliff angel added like theyll fuck anything right vladimir nodded his head this way and that an impatient bethatasitmay motion and said possibly but better the naked ladies i thinking my brother speaks true this place is the bellydancing er scbauplatz he paused to seek confirmation from fletcher and recognizing the german word again theatre fletcher nodded good said vladimir this theatre was source of mindstink yes mindsmog fletcher reminded him and the russian shrugged his acquiescence so whats on said angel eh vladimir looked questioningly at the two minders whats showing at the theatre said sparrow ah said vladimir the ladies i thinking i seeing the posters very crude posters but girls certainly the english girls i thinking a revue said fletcher like a troupe out of england the twins glanced at each other but neither one of them could say for sure fletcher thought about it for a moment then said if you feel like it we could try locating something now like whatsaid angel stealing another smoke from venyamins pack on the table at this time of the morning do you really think anyone will be up and about and fletcher answered the kind of people that were looking for they do their best work at night then he held out his hands to the twins understanding the principle they grasped his hands and formed an unbroken chain around the table at that fletchers minders stepped back a pace while they werent entirely clear what was happening some sort of seance was as close as they could guess still theyd worked with ebranch before and knew when to keep out of the way and under his breath fletcher warned vladimir venyamin dont do anything rash or stupid and remember we cant linger over this were only taking a looksee just a glance and the moment we find anything we break it off we cant afford to alert anyone to our presence here is that understood da the brothers nodded curtly and all three espers fell silent but in another moment whoah fletcher exclaimed as he snatched back his hands and jerked upright sending his chair skidding and almost overturning the table and what the bell was that he said his voice and limbs trembling but his question was meaningless for he knew well enough what it had been the russians too suddenly their thin faces were even more drawn than usual their eyes wide and unnaturally bright a very powerful somethings vladimir whispered mindsmog but deep and dark and evil said his brother his english finally coming together when we are finding nuclear devices is not evil is made by men but is not evil in itself just devices this thing is different it is the people and it is the evil vladimir looked at him shrugged and said venyamin speaks now he is no more shy shy said fletcher is that all it was with him well i am shy very shy of whatever it was we just bumped into now tell me do you think it sensed us did it know we were here itsaid vladimir with a puzzled frown you are meaning other espers our enemies of course fletcher calmed down got a grip on himself he had noticed that just like the twins his special branch minders were frowning and glancing at each other too and yes he said yes of course i meant our enemies who may well be espers in their own right do you think they sensed our presence not knowing vladimir answered we were in and out just like you saying and fletcher sighed his relief then still a little shaken he sat down again and looked at the map it wasnt the theatre or scbauplatz or whatever er the mindsmog that is myself i thought i detected three or four separate sources all spread out around the town but none near us thank goodness likewise said vladimir but we venyamin and me we did feeling the faint mindsmogs in or near the kino and we are having the idea go on said fletcher is night said vladimir the kino is closed now perhaps this thing we feeling is how you are saying left over residual said fletcher residual yes vladimir nodded from the evening maybe is possible our enemies using the place going there during the day or in the evening times at which fletcher came bolt upright in his chair suddenly hed remembered something in ben trasks initial report on that evening star affair that vavara and malinari werent the only ones who had got off the vampirized ship there were also those theyd taken with them and girls he gasped the word out dancing girls that shipboard revue an entire bloody troupe of dancers eh whats that said joe sparrow girls tell us more said cliff angel leeringly fletcher put his brain in gear and thought fast trask had told him that if he ever got a definite fix if he was certain of his target to keep well away or face the consequences he bernie fletcher should keep well away because he glowed in the dark but his minders didnt moreover they looked the part they hadnt shaved since leaving england and with a day to go before the next performance by tomorrow night theyd be perfect they could go see the show and fit into the audience just like a couple of turks passing through the town on the way in fletcher had looked the people over the locals were shop owners in the main small businessmen and farmers the women hed seen had been few and far between odds were there wouldnt be any women in the audience at the kino also and as far as he was aware where turks were concerned belly dancers or any kind of female dancers for that matter would be irresistible the place would probably be packed to the rafters and his minders just another two faces in the crowd but if there was anything different about these dancers the special branch men might be able to spot it or one of them would for fletcher had remembered something else that trask had told him never to be on his own without at least one of his bodyguards looking out for him as for the security of whichever minder he sent hed be just one more man in a motley crowd with little or nothing to distinguish him from the rest and of course there was always safety in numbers making up his mind he told sparrow and angel the boss is supposed to get in tomorrow but if by tomorrow night he hasnt arrived with backup one of you is going to get lucky because i need someone to go and see that show angel looked at sparrow and said ill fight you for it but sparrow shook his head and grinned naw hell youre ugly enough already well cut the cards and then turning to the russians you boys play poker threecard brag blackjack get out your lira ladies the night is young count me in said fletcher but first i need to speak to hq let them know whats happening not a good idea said vladimir like i say turkish telephones not secure you will speaking in code of course fletcher smiled and answered of course well in a kind of code because he knew that in london john grieve wouldnt be too far from the duty officers telephone and working with grieve would be a lot better faster and far more secure than using codes devised by even the finest cryptographers the next morning back at ebranch hq ben trask was taking an early orders group as he was about to begin jake showed up and trask stopped him in the doorway to ops and asked what he was doing there was he in or out he should make up his mind trask was his usual brusque self jake said im in but ill play it my way it wasnt what trask wanted to hear and any other time he would have been angry about it he was angry but right now he had to concentrate on his briefing and since he really couldnt afford to lose jake he nodded and said okay and then as they were out of earshot of the rest of the agents who were already seated he asked how jake would play it by ear jake answered the rest of the gang do what the conductor wants trask told him and thats me he inclined his head into the room indicating the people seated in front of the podium you see jake this is something that doesnt work too well we havent got started and already youre holding things up so go and speak said jake and ill sit in but it cant be this way always trask growled gritting his teeth as he began to lose it it was always this way with harry jake answered coolly he did his own thing youre not harry said trask turning away and making to head for the podium jake put a hand on his arm and stopped him youre right he said im not but every day i know a little bit more about him and i havent been learning it from you or from ebranch trask looked at him shook his head in a mixture of disappointment and frustration freed himself and made for the stage again with jake close behind trask was fuming but he couldnt deny that he knew what jake meant the fact was that each time he looked at him the man seemed that much more like the original necroscope he didnt look like harry so much as feel like him but but he did feel an awful lot like him jake had taken a seat next to liz at the back of the gathering trask ignored his presence and the briefing went well when it was over however and the room began to clear jake approached trask again this time with liz in tow what is it now trask asked them and keep it brief for as you can see were pretty busy right now liz asked what we were talking about jake answered she wondered if i was coming out to turkey with you well im not but she can get me any time it seems that weve got it down to a fine art if she calls ill hear her i think ill be able to home in on her just about anywhere but it would be even better if you left her out of it altogether better for who said trask look shes learning all the time she handled herself just fine out in krassos and on board the star shell be okay shes in think about it without liz how could we get hold of you if we needed you that is and millie jakes deep brown eyes were staring unblinking hard as pebbles in a pool is millie in too his question was below the belt and he knew it but trask had a surprise for him shes in too he said because ill need all the help i can get the teams short a very important member our locator david chung that cant be helped because chungs the expert on this other thing thats come up hes been on it for years and even if i tried to pull him off i know the minister responsible wouldnt wear it yes i have bernie fletcher who appears to be doing a great job out there so far as you heard me say just a few minutes ago he thinks hes found the girls who went missing with vavara and malinari but there are occasions when he can be a liability too a danger to himself and the team both thats one more reason why we have to get moving get out there as soon as were able to give bernie support and yet again youre slowing things up cant you see its a case of if you arent actually with us then youre in our way at which liz came in with ben jake is with us its just that he has other things to do that we think may be at least as important and maybe more important than anything else you could have him do and jake said im not fighting you ben its you who has something going with me not the other way around i dont know maybe you think im undermining your position or something but if thats so then it isnt intentional its just that ive got some things to do and oh sure of course you have trask cut in bitingly and a man has to do what a man has to do and all that crap right so tell me what are these very important things things that are obviously far more important than the security of our world that you have to do wash your hair and get it braided again contemplate your fucking navel or maybe you came too close the last time and youve realized that lifes too precious right trask rarely swore and more rarely yet placed emphasis on his swearing but now he was angry beyond caring and his rage was infectious jakes eyes narrowed his jaw jutted and his fists knotted he stepped forward and just for a moment looked like he intended to knock trask down but he didnt a split second more and the anger that filled the space between the two men burned itself out but as jake turned to walk away probably for good suddenly liz burst out god how i wish youd stop it both of you taken aback caught off balance by lizs righteous rage their jaws fell and they looked at her in surprise flushed and furious her eyes almost seeming to flash sparks she turned to trask and snapped to start with i am not your little sister in my private life i can do without your protection following which she almost immediately softened but you and the branch you are like family to me and then turning to jake theyre like family jake and while i can be part of that ill always want to be in fact i believe thats why were here its our purpose in life yours and mine both hey im not arguing with you jake said shrugging but by no means casually i think its why im here too at least until this thing with the wamphyri is cleared up but if were to have any kind of future together i need to be truthful with you i still cant say if its me who wants to see it through or if its well something someone else whos in control once this wamphyri nightmare is over and done with i dont know if the drive will still be there if it isnt thats when well have to make some pretty big decisions when our paths might head in different directions trask looked at them sensed the uncertainty in them all the confusion of a devious future and felt something wrenching at his heart do you two love each other yes they answered as one and of course he knew that it was true he nodded took a deep breath let it out slowly and said then you wont let anything stand in your way youll work it out and dont think im just an old man who doesnt know what hes talking about because i do i knew the risk i was taking with millie i mean after shed been down in lord szwarts bloody dreadful garden and millie herself she even warned me off but you know something i didnt give a damn how could i give a damn what kind of love would it be if if i couldnt comfort the one i loved and anyway without millie i wouldnt want to go on either so thats how it was and how it will be for you two if you really love each other believe me theres nothing in your way that you cant move aside he turned to liz as for ebranch the branch is just the branch liz its not the beall endall that i used to think it was and its cost me way too much it was here before you and itll be around long after you move on i mean hell im not the first head of branch and i wont be the last itll be around long after ive moved on too then turning to jake trask said now you tell me what use are your powers if you let them set you apart from the one you love not much damn use said jake completely taken aback then dont let it happen said trask and to liz let me talk to jake alone for a moment will you and dont worry im all done with shouting and tearing my hair and after shed gone he said i dont care what liz says jake shes still my kid sister but okay so the responsibility is yours now and youre the one wholl carry that weight fine but whatever you do dont drop it ill always be watching and listening jake answered i cant do any more than that but in your world the world of ebranch it wont be an easy job then he grinned and said you know something i always reckoned you for a hard man but what you just said about you and millie and me and liz dont go reminding me trask held up a hand in mock protest and please dont mention it again what do you want to ruin my reputation they both laughed then growing serious again trask said i really do have to be getting a move on but before i go id like you to tell me what is it youve got to do on your own it mightnt seem very much to you jake answered but i want to catch up on all those keogh files that i still havent had time to read john grieve tells me theres maybe eight hundred crammed pages of files on the original necroscope i want to sit down with them in harrys room shut everything out and soak them up the reason is simple the more i learn about him the more yet i seem to know its like i dont know like im remembering him like im gradually understanding him that much better trask nodded and the better you understand him the better ill be able to do his job said jake and ive reached the stage where i want to do it as well as i possibly can then youd better get to it said trask because im all done trying to tell you what to do from now on youre your own man come to think of it maybe your not coming to turkey with us makes a lot of sense oh trask nodded youre a hell of a power in what we think of as the psychic aether jake with your talents you have to be and malinaris one bell of a mentalist the rest of us might be able to creep up on him we got away with it on krassos for a while but i dont think you could hed know you were there so perhaps its for the best that you keep your head down then come on like the cavaly when youre most needed thats the way its worked best up to now i think youre probably right said jake well then said trask those files are waiting for you and ive got to go without any hesitation jake held out his hand good hunting ben he said as they shook on it likewise said trask break a leg necroscope getting to know harry and ill met in turkey the team consisted of trask goodly paul garvey millie liz and lardis lidesci there were no techs this time around simply because they would have had nothing to do unlike the australian job thered be nowhere to hook up their equipment and no cooperation not with the turkish authorities also and especially since gustav turchin had come on the scene trask was becoming increasingly aware that the gadget side of ebranch was letting him down not the techs but the technology itself technology had been moving so fast in these last fifteen years that it had become too difficult too expensive even for governments to keep up and so trasks ghosts had come into their own and were now the mainstay of any operation his ghosts yes the talented men and women he controlled the espers who were ebranch the teams makeup was dictated by the situation with the addition of millie and paul garvey it could even be considered stronger than the team trask had used on krassos it might seem a little topheavy in telepaths but with good reason trask had learned from experience in australia and krassos he knew that up against a mind like malinari the mind it would take exceptional mental shielding to maintain security liz and millie worked well together and garveys shields might even be powerful enough to hide all three espers when they were working in tandem indeed in the notsodistant past thered been several occasions when trask would have liked to have had garvey working as a field agent but pauls personal situation had always deterred him tall well built and athletically trim despite his fiftysix years garvey had been goodlooking he bad been before hed gone up against one of harry keoghs most dangerous adversaries a psychotic necromancer and serial killer called johnny found and lost the left side of his face that had been twenty years ago between times some of the worlds best plastic surgeons had worked on paul until he looked halfdecent but a real face is more than just so much flesh scavenged from other parts of the body his reconstructed features had been built from his own tissues true but the muscles on the left didnt pull the same as those on the right and after all these years still the nerves werent connecting up too well paul could manage a smile with the right side of his face but not the left for which reason and even though his colleagues were accustomed to it he normally didnt smile at all and avoided all other facial expressions too since this was a purely physical condition however pauls disability hadnt in any way affected his work with the branch and it wasnt the reason why trask had usually kept him back at the hq in a rearparty role the real reason was this that two years earlier garvey had taken the plunge and married a blind girl which had made them the ideal couple receptive to his telepathic skills his wife had found a new lease of life in paul she couldsee through his eyes and with her he neednt any longer feel concerned about his looks he had found an outlet for years of trapped emotions this was why hard man trask had been protective of him but a week ago pauls younger wife had presented him with a baby daughter and now both mother and child were doing well in the care of her parents who lived close to a school for the blind that specialized in postnatal studies and practice since this would be the way of things for some months to come it was time for paul garvey to get back in harness and just in time too for trask needed him there was of course one other member of the team whose name hadnt come up on trasks list the locator or more properly human bloodhound bernie fletcher himself who was already in situ complemented by garveys and the girls talents bernies lodestone probes would be enhanced to match the requirement or so trask hoped as for goodly the gaunt stringbean precog had been having plenty of trouble with the future lately this was nothing new however and trask had frequently noted that when the going got tough ian goodly usually got going in his capacity as precursor of things to come hed rarely let trask down that left lardis lidesci and he was there he was there because he was lardis that nose of his his sensitivity to all things wamphyri his seerancestors blood and his invisibility the fact that he was able to hide within himself like all of sunsides travellers when rampaging vampires came too close for comfort and finally the brothers androsov gustav turchins men of whom trask had no previous knowledge no way as yet of checking their credentials or psychic potential they would seem to have had little difficulty in locating fletcher but was that a good thing or a bad thing all well and good as long as no one else located him trask could only hope that their shields were better than bernies he certainly couldnt fault the fact that one of them venyamin bore the russian version of his own forename and if the androsovs worked out as well in turkey as manolis papastamos and his men had done on krassos but that was for the future and the future was the precogs business which took trask looping back on himself to where he stood on the steps of a minibus in the street outside ebranch hq checking his people on board prior to heading for the airport liz was the last to board she was standing with jake just inside the anonymouslooking private entrance that was reserved for ebranch personnel only where they said their goodbyes and all of the things that lovers say when life intervenes to force them apart and trask sincerely hoped where she was reminding the necroscope to keep an open mind and be alert for any mayday call she might make seated at the front of the bus millie sensed trasks gathering impatience put a hand on his arm and told him let them be ben we have a few minutes to spare and now that youre on jakes right side well it seems a good idea to stay on it glancing at her trask sighed but in the next moment grinned adopted a mock scowl and in his old accustomed fashion growled god that bloody man while in the rear entrance to the hotel liz had just told jake im pregnant youre what he didnt quite believe hed heard her correctly liz hadnt meant to come out with it like that but in the middle of both of them telling each other to take care it had just popped out i think i have to be she said after last night i mean but how can you possibly he began and i just do she cut him short i know he looked at her for a long moment and finally said well youre a healthy woman and i have to admit that if youre not pregnant er after last night i mean then i dont know what it would take they both laughed and clung to each other but then he held her at arms length and was suddenly serious its all the more reason why you shouldnt be going she shook her head all the more reason why i should its our world jake and itll be his or hers too thats why we have to keep it that way why we cant give it over to invaders defilers from a different an alien world its why well avenge the pain theyve caused the damage theyve already done and get rid of them for good jake knew shed won the point that there was no answer to her argument and so said then youd better go just remember i love you both of you and bring yourselves back to me ill do better than that she said if it all works out ill give you a call and you can bring us back and if it doesnt work out then youll be hearing from me anyway i will be hearing from you he said lets face it you and the team will need weapons eventually so who else do you know who can smuggle them in like i can i hadnt thought of that she said but im pretty sure ben has he said to be sure and remind you to listen for me as if i wouldnt said jake im already missing you and youre not even gone yet but time i was said liz they kissed liz joined the team aboard the transport and jake waved to her until the minibus had rounded the corner and passed out of sight into the chilly london morning and he hadnt been lying the city was only just waking up beginning to bustle but already it felt empty back inside the headquarters jake visited the archives just a roomful of stacked shelves and filing cabinets where with john grieves help he chose an armful of the restricted keogh files grieve was the duty officer he kept the electronic key to the locked filing cabinets and better than anyone else knew his way around the system invaluable to the branch by reason of his teletelepathy and with the better part of his life spent in employment within the hqs four walls as a deskjockey where his talent had been put to its best use grieves many years of prowling the corridors of ebranch day and night through thousands of hours of duty shifts made him the best of all possible authorities and in his capacity as duty officer he also kept the key to harrys room but a real key this time not a corneal scanner or microcoded id tag but a piece of shaped metal that fitted the almost antique lock on the door of that very special room and letting jake in he said if you intend to sleep here youll need sheets and blankets for the bed i dont intend to go that far jake answered dumping the files on the dusty console of an ancient computer ill use my own room for sleeping its just that this place has i dont know a certain atmosphere grieve nodded a weird ambience i know what you mean we all know what you mean frankly i think it would put me off i dont think i could concentrate too well in here but its each to his own and and there he paused looking slightly uncomfortable and this is my own said jake is that what youre saying hey dont worry about it not too long ago i might well have argued the point but now well this place feels sort of familiar to me and in fact its exactly the atmosphere that i need where better to get to know harry keogh than in a room that he once occupied youre right of course said grieve its just that of all ebranchs ghosts this one was and as weve recently seen probably still is the most potent jake gave a little shiver and said its certainly cold in here yes said the do thats as normal or rather as usual i could have an electric fire sent in but i dont think youll find it improves things very much no everythings fine said jake and if i find that the place does bother me i can always take the files to my room suit yourself said grieve as for the files youve got stuff there that goes right back to the beginning of harrys association with ebranch i mean you even have the dragosani file including alec kyles first er shall we say interview but in any case our first meeting with harry the first time he came here in the fleshjake had just opened the file in question and glanced at its handwritten or rather handscrawled a pages laminated in durable plastic sleeves no said the do from where he now stood at the door i mean the first time he appeared here without flesh harry was incorporeal he was dead his first death that is frowning jake turned to stare at grieve opened his mouth to say something and closed it again how did one reply to something like that and before he could ask any further questions if you need anything else said grieve give me a call theres no intercom in here but the telephone is working oh and incidentally if you should bump into premier turchin anywhere in the hq please remember that those files are for your eyes only while turchin knows full well what the necroscope er the first necroscope did to the chateau bronnitsy and to gregor borowitzs opposition theres really no need to supply him with documentary evidence there are wounds enough mainly healed now so we dont need to start rubbing salt in them as jake nodded his understanding grieve went out into the corridor and closed the door behind him the keogh files it was all here everything that harry had been and maybe something of what he still was or what he had left behind and the more jake turned the yellowing pages and read the more he became involved the more he seemed to remember not real memories of course not but pseudomemories he would read a paragraph and know what was coming it was as if hed picked up a book from his childhood recognized the stories and knew at the end of each chapter what was coming in the next it gave new meaning to the terms dйjа vu and paramnesia which in turn gave jake pause as he read of harry keoghs reincarnations first in the mind of an infant son and then in the braindead body of alec kyle and now but no jake was past that stage he no longer worried that harry might be seeking permanent residence for if that were so hed had ample opportunity no there was only one man or creature intent on possessing his mind and the way things stood at present it was the other way around jakes mind possessed that creature and so he read on of harrys psychic ancestry his youth his championing of dead causes of his incredible battle with the russian necromancer boris dragosani and of his all but total destruction of the soviet ebranch first when he killed dragosani and again when the shrivelled maniac ivan gerenko was in command jake read of the taint that thibor ferenczy had transfused into the foetal yulian bodescu of the vampirism that developed in yulian as a youth and of his death at the hands of the teeming dead risen from a local graveyard he read of janos ferenczy vampire bloodson of faethor returned to life from an urn of ashes only to be reduced to dust in a battle with the original necroscope and a handful of centuried thracian friends he read of all of these people and things oh and a host of others and discovered to his amazement that he merely reacquainted himself as with that old book read as a child as he turned the pages the hours flew and as he became accustomed to the room so its ambience seemed to adjust to him and for the first time in a great many years it was no longer cold in harrys room lunchtime came and went but while jake recognized the need for sustenance he no longer had the time for it not right now while he was absorbed in his reading whether learning or remembering his stomach had to bide its time the late autumn day grew brighter outside then dimmed and the files gradually transferred from one area of the old computer consoles surface to another so that when the telephone buzzed and john grieves voice asked if everything was all right suddenly it was pm jake told the do im going out to eat ill be maybe an hour i dont suppose weve heard anything from the team no grieve answered we know their flight suffered something of a delay actually a long one but they did get off around pm by now theyll be in at the other end we cant expect to hear anything for a while yet maybe when they arrive at bernie fletchers location but that could be hours yet and even then trask might decide that the situation doesnt warrant his contacting the hq by my reckoning it will be late tonight or maybe even tomorrow morning before we hear anything well unless you hear something first so then well just have have to wait and see said jake im afraid so grieve answered here at hq the name of the game is patience but there was one piece of information that came in from the minister responsible i was able to pass it on to trask at the airport just before they left oh said jake yes its a police report it appears a body turned up in a disused conduit under a platform at waterloo railway station as youll know thats the starting gate for the eurostar the channel tunnel and paris anyway the body was so badly shrivelled it was almost a mummy it seemed to have been down there a long time which is very odd because dental records identify it or rather him as a businessman who went missing only a little while ago actually the night after you brought millicent cleary up out of the underworld szwart said jake our conclusion too said grieve police investigations have shown that this gentleman was on his way to paris but he never made it oh and another thing he was naked and everything hed had with him had been taken including his eurostar ticket for the night train of course that bloody thing could be anywhere by now said jake indeed said the do he could even be in turkey jake turned it over in his mind thought about it didnt like it but couldnt see anything that he could do about it so changing the subject he said right now im feeling starved i havent eaten all day how about you ive eaten said grieve and by the way have we given you a branch card for the hotel diner yes jake answered but i think i prefer a little place in the latin quarter and after a moments silence in paris where else said jake and after another almost imperceptible pause i shall be off duty when you return said the do in a tone typical of his upperclass english restraint ill still be here at hq probably asleep in my room i should think but one of the techs jimmy harvey will be standing in for me i come on again at am if you need anything at that time give me a call they really know how to get good value out of a man dont they said jake he sensed the others shrug as grieve replied i suppose they do but on the other hand theyre the ones who are doing the real work while as rearparty staff im comparatively safe here at hq and then snatching a breath and hastily following up on what he obviously considered a gaffe please understand jake that wasnt intended as a reflection on your own stance or status sure said jake but in fact and however it was intended john grieves comment had struck home and hed felt it before he could put the phone down however jake said the do i really would enjoy taking you up on your offer some other time my offer to eat at that little place in the latin quarter damn right said jake french onion soup steak tartare on black unleavened bread with a little garnish and all washed down with a glass of good beer i had fish and chips said grieve sounding almost human at last and each to his own said jake smiling as he closed the conversation in fact there had been more than a mere delay at the airport the vtol aircraft that trask and party had intended to take had developed a fault and been taken out of service they had been transferred to an older much slower plane thered been additional holdups with baggage arguments between airport staff and passengers and the usual hustling and bustling that was becoming ever more the standard in the packagedholidays trade but eventually posing as a party of historians and amateur archaeologists the party was airborne and heading for istanbul normally in a british airways vtol aircraft such a flight would have had a duration of less than two hours in the older airplane flying at a lower altitude avoiding greece by diverting over hungary romania and bulgaria it took almost three the turkish military authorities had put a ban on all aircraft crossing their borders from greek airspace then due to complications with altered schedules and the simultaneous arrival of a host of other incoming flights there had been delays getting through an overworked customs and a further holdup when trask had found that the car that was waiting for them courtesy of the minister responsible was a small fourseater hiring a minibus and waiting on its arrival consumed a further halfhour in a humid smelly airport lounge where the facilities were something less than acceptable we should have packed sandwiches and drinks millie said when at last they were underway out of the airport and heading for the northwestbound motorway to edirne and the border with bulgaria sandwiches trask growled scathingly theyd have gone a bit curly by now i think in another halfhour itll be dark i didnt realize you thought i was that mundane she answered archly knowing that in fact he thought no such thing i was joking ben well im glad someone still can he answered well pull over at the first service station where we can snatch a bite to eat and ill try to get through to bernie fletcher hes bound to be wondering where weve got to jake could have brought us firstclass said liz from the back of the minibus and wanted to bite her tongue when trask turned to give her one of his looks but before he could speak i know i know she quickly went on if we were caught without passports or with passports that werent properly franked wed have a hard time explaining it but more importantly trask began more importantly liz breathlessly cut him short you dont want jake making too many waves in the psychic aether not yet anyway not in malinaris vicinity or vavaras or lord szwarts trask nodded because for all we know they could all three be together again by now ten minutes later about pm local time the precog ian goodly pulled off the motorway into a service station where the team could buy some dubiouslooking sandwiches from a dispenser in an alleged cafeteria then too trask tried to call bernie fletcher at his hotel in sirpsindigi he got the hotel but the desk could only tell him that meester fledger and other mens are outside for thee eatings sorry my name is trask trask told the unbelievably slowsounding person on the other end of the line even spelling his name out for him please tell mr fletcher i called tell him weve had some small delays but were on our which was as far as he got before the line went dead and shit and damnation trask muttered slamming the door of the booth behind him back at their table paul garvey was studying a map its maybe a hundred and thirty miles to edirne and then we take a back road to sirpwhatsitsname if we dont linger over this disgusting cuisine and ian keeps us moving at sixtyfive or seventy milesper hour we can be at bernies hotel er the what the tundza said millie by a little after good said trask so lets not hang about people eat drink and be merry for tomorrow the food might be even worse said millie and actually said trask i think your sandwiches would probably go down a treat right now curly or otherwise at pm in sirpsindigi bernie fletcher lay fully dressed taking a nap on his bed his minders had an adjacent room with access through a connecting door but of course cliff angel was in bernies room as was vladimir androsov angel was seated on a chair just inside the closed door his chin kept lolling down onto his massive chest causing him to jerk upright whenever he caught himself nodding off androsov however was fully awake anxiously pacing to and fro in the small room every few minutes would see him pause at the grimy window to look out into the night street it had long since stopped raining but moisture clung to the windows making it hard to see out the street was poorly lit and mainly deserted and a dense ground mist was beginning to obscure the rainslick cobbles very occasionally a vehicle would prowl silently by its lights and tyres cutting tracks through the mist androsovs concern was for venyamin his twin brother who had accompanied the minder joe sparrow across town to inspect the girlie revue venyamin had a basic grasp of several tongues including turkish which would simplify the purchase of tickets and et cetera but the show must surely be over by now and the two men on their way back the trouble was that vladimir wasnt sure of that he didnt know it for a certainty twins the pair had been aware of each other since birth even before theyd been able to recognize or acknowledge the fact separated by a great many miles and even when sleeping still each man had felt comfortable in the sure knowledge of the others existence it wasnt telepathy but a facet of their joint talent they automatically located each other yet now for the last halfhour vladimirs mind his awareness had been void of all knowledge of his sibling espers whereabouts or even of venyamins existence and that was something that had never happened before now pacing yet again to the window vladimir cast a probe out into the wretched night at the same time pressing his face to the glass and looking this way and that scanning the street for some sign of venyamin and joe sparrow over there in a dark shop doorway something moved but it was only a woman perhaps a streetwalker waiting to make a contact but down there on this side of the road keeping well in to the wall and darker shadows two men coming this way yes their motion seemed odd unsteady was it possible theyd had something to drink perhaps it was the minder and venyamin but if so then vladimirs twin was employing his shields as never before putting so much effort into it that he even excluded his brother which could only mean that he had good reason and vladimir at once withdrew his own probe so as not to be detected by whoever or whatever it was that venyamin was striving to keep out vladimirs breath had clouded the window he rubbed at the fogged patch with his sleeve and put his face to the glass again no one was there not even the woman only the mist like a river of milk lying luminous in the street and suddenly the short hairs were rising at the back of vladimirs neck and he knew that everything was wrong it was an electric sensation a weird feeling that for many long moments froze the russian rigid but then he broke free tottered to the bed and gave fletcher a shake wake up english wake up eh what fletcher jerked on the bed sat up rubbed his eyes and stared at the whitefaced vladimir what is it but now the sensation of foreboding had gone away mysteriously vanished been replaced by a feeling that everything was okay i not know vladimirs face cracked open in a sick uncertain grin i thinks i see some men in street my brother and joe i thinks but is too misty maybe i mistaken eh misty said fletcher hiding a yawn behind the back of his hand as he got to his feet then his eyes narrowed and again he said misty but now the word rang in his mind like a cracked ominous bell of ill omen and pacing quickly to the window he said why in hell why would it be misty it is come from the river vladimir shrugged absolutely sure now that everything was fine is running close by hotel has the same name the tundza river said fletcher staring down on the street just a river but in fact now that he was awake he felt nothing out of the ordinary indeed and much like vladimir he felt quite sure that everything was perfectly in order wazzat eh eh cliff angel started awake did somebody say something it was just vlad said fletcher smiling almost stupidly at angel where he got to his feet near the door he thought he saw someone down there in the mist maybe it was joe and venyamin eh whatangel scowled are you okay pal before fletcher could answer footsteps sounded and floorboards creaked on the landing beyond the door and there came a knock four distinctive raps on the panelling that identified a friend its joe said angel suddenly sure of that fact as he unlocked and opened the door at which there came another knock or rather a thump but this time from the window three minutes earlier downstairs in the dingy lobby the desk clerk had been alarmed to see what at first hed thought was a thick carpet of white smoke pouring in under the door from the street was there a fire in the neighbourhood perhaps dangerously close by it seemed the only likely explanation a house must be burning if so he must alert the english party and their guests it would be a damned shame if his only paying customers in a sixmonth got burned up in their beds the semiinvalid old man had come out from behind the desk gone hobbling across the dusty lobby to the door and opened it to the night but even as hed limped through the mist so hed realized that it wasnt composed of choking smoke but a clammy oddly clinging vapour then looking out into the street his eyes had bugged in amazement for in all his years as ownermanagercaretaker and general dogsbody at the crumbling old tundza he had never before seen the likes of this in both directions a lapping inchesdeep carpet of greasy luminous mist for even though the night was damp and dark it was as if the mist glowed from within a rotten glow like foxfire that surged with the lazy ebb and flow of this filthily mobile stuff what had the river overflowed its banks but surely there hadnt been that much rain or was this some kind of industrial pollution or some noxious chemical that the bloody farmers had spilled ugh the old man had gone to close the door and shut it out but a tall cloaked figure had stepped or flowed into view from one side eh eh the old man had limped back a pace and the stranger had entered and then two more appearing silently out of the shadows behind the cloaked heavily muffled one and stepping close together moving awkwardly and robotically these two had ignored the old man and entered the lobby leaving the cloaked one to close the door behind them eh what the old proprietor had gurgled as the two zombielike figures made for the stairs one of them the one in front was known to the old man surely he was one of the english guests but his mouth was yawning open drooling from its corners and his eyes were starting from his head wait the old man had cried what happen here t he pair climbing the stairs had paused and the one in the rear had turned his head to stare at the trembling old man his eyes burning like fire in the lobbys faltering electric light the sight of those monstrous eyes had caused the old proprietor to stumble back a further pace indeed he had stumbled directly into the arms of the cloaked one then speaking to that one the one with the burning eyes had said be a good fellow will you and take care of things down here having spoken he had then continued up the stairs seeming to guide or propel the drooling one before him and in a voice that whooshed like a blacksmiths bellows the cloaked one had said old man nothing is happening here nothing that need concern you but something wrong the old proprietor had insisted standing straighter and turning to face the cloaked one the tundza she mine hotel and something very wrong then hed looked up up at the face of the one who steadied him but inside the high collar of the cloak where a head should have been thered been only a blob of inky blackness as if a piece of the darkest night were lodged there and the eyes that looked out of that blackness were a poisonous yellow that seemed to drip sulphur from their rims wrong that monstrous voice had come again accompanied by a soulwrenching stench only the light old fool theres nothing wrong here but the light and then an arm had gone up reaching impossibly reaching all the way up to the high pineboarded ceiling where a hand like a claw had grabbed at electrical wiring and yanked with irresistible force the lobby lights had sputtered out leaving a velvet gloom whose only illumination was that of szwarts festering eyes and the vile phosphorescence of his breath in the yawn of cavernous jaws in there too surging up from the depths of his throat a host of suctorial anemonelike tendrils had greedily uncoiled themselves fastening on the old mans head like some terrible maneating plant or a loathsome lethal octopus terror at the tundza the future writ in flames under vavaras spell the beneficent aura in which she shrouded herself and which extended invisibly outward from her the men in the tundzas upstairs room were taken completely by surprise slowmoving and slow to react they could only gape at what was happening as malinari propelled joe sparrow into the room ahead of him and vavara came in through the shattering window as to the latter when fletcher heard that first dull thump on the window he couldnt believe what he saw there that doughy leaflike hand the size of a dinner plate all covered with suckers that stuck to the glass and the face behind the hand rising up into view as vavara crawled like a chameleon up the wall by no means the mistress of metamorphic processes still the climb had required only a very small effort on her part and she had had plenty of practice on krassos when shed been obliged to scramble across precipitous cliff faces to escape the wrath of ebranch but that had been on krassos while here and now here and now all had gone according to lord nephran malinaris plan in order that no escape route or boltholes would be left open to the locators and their armed watchdog he and lord szwart had agreed to enter the tundza by the door while vavara would break in through the window with her hypnotic lying aura preceding her befuddling the senses of those within most of all the locators fletcher and androsov and while szwart dealt with matters downstairs doubling as a rearguard to ensure that no one fled the scene malinari and vavara would attend to the coalition of enemy forces overhead vavaras motive for murder which was what they were about was simple revenge revenge for what ebranch and its esper membership had done to her monastery aerie her sisterhood and herbeautiful garden under palataki on the island of krassos and similarly the lord of darkness the endlessly mutating lord szwart he would do anything to strike back at the ones who had destroyed his works under london malinari had assured his wamphyri peers that this was the best way to take out these people one by one using the ones they took as bait to trap the rest but as for malinari himself other than revenge his motive was knowledge knowledge of the one called jake cutter no ordinary man but a power in the psychic aether whose signature was an incredible whirligig of everevolving symbols numbers and algebraic equations the secrets in cutters metaphysical mind would provide malinari with everything he required to combat just such a power in sunside the awesome talents of the one called nathan for having failed on earth that was where malinari and his wamphyri colleagues were now headed back to the vampire world to sunsidestarside in a parallel universe beyond the perchorsk gate but not before malinari had got what he wanted here such were his thoughts as he thrust the now almost mindless minder joe sparrow ahead of him into the upstairs room sparrow his mind drained of what little knowledge of ebranch it had ever contained along with almost everything else who moved only by virtue of malinaris terrible hand inside his back its hairy wormlike fingers extending sensors into the spinal canal while others channelled themselves to the brain and loaned support to its dying motor areas sparrow a mere puppet now and malinari the puppetmaster sparrow had been brought along like this not as a hostage but as a key in case there should be problems since no such problems had surfaced he was no longer required and as malinari withdrew his hand from the gaping bloody hole in sparrows overcoat he caused the hairy filament extensions that were his probes to nip at the special branch mans motor areas and slice through the flexible tendon that was his spinal chord the main neural axis either one of which actions would have finished the job and utterly incapable of protest sparrow simply died flopped free of malinaris red hand and crumpled to the floor meanwhile finally fletcher had reacted to the thing that had used a sucker hand to wrench a pane of glass from the window and send it shattering down into the street hed reacted drawn back a pace and gurgled a barely articulate warning before the hand now recognizable as a hand reached in through the empty frame and groped for the catch but the window was jammed literally glued shut locked in position by multiple layers of paint and preservative and vavaras patience was all used up a warty sometbing a body as hideous as the head and face it supported drew back from the window to swing like a pendulum against the latticework of brittle mullions and transoms showering glass and splintered wood into the room and shaping herself in an alien contortion vavara followed the debris and flowed erect before fletcher where he staggered back away from her by then in the doorway malinari had lashed out at cliff angel a backhander with a difference for where just a moment ago malinaris hand had been a mass of writhing tubules crimson with joe sparrows blood now it was a hamlike fist whose knuckles had formed into inchlong chitinous thorns and with the right side of his face gouged to the cheek and jawbones its flesh hanging loose in a crimson flap angel had issued a bubbling agonized shriek and gone hurtling across the room all of this had happened more or less simultaneously and vladimir androsov having moved to a spot that was central in the room had seen accepted and finally reacted to it cursing and snatching out his tokarev tt he aimed it at vavara and jerked off a shot a bad mistake for as cliff angel had pointed out less than twentyfour hours ago the tokarev was an outdated weapon and as such it was liable at times to malfunction times such as now the gun might have been in perfect working order but the ammunition definitely wasnt perbaps perhaps the ammo was made at the same time as the gun and after hed squeezed the trigger a second time it seemed he must be right for this time there wasnt even a abut just a click as the hammer fell on a dud but there was a snarl of fury from the outraged vavara as she hurled fletcher aside reached up and plucked the offending bullet from her thinly sheathed boneplated skull and headed for vladimir with blood streaking her leathery wizened face this one she gurgled batting vladimirs gun aside and grasping his throat this one is a dead man i sincerely hope he is not the one you desired to interrogate malinari for if so youre too late he has caused me an inconvenience and now must pay for it be my guest malinari answered her hes merely a mentalist a locator from an outside organization but the ebranch locator is that one and he made for fletcher so far unscathed fletcher saw the leer the nameless lust on malinaris face and in his flaring eyes and uttering a cry of sheer terror he took two staggering steps toward the shattered window the locators intention was obvious since a handtohand fight with malinari or with any of the wamphyri was out of the question he would vault out into the night risking a broken neck rather than give himself up to whatever this monstrous being held in store for him but even as he put a hand on the naked windowsill malinari gripped the back of fletchers neck bringing him to an immediate abrupt halt and what said malinari the mind would you desert me then and disappoint me but no little man for there are questions only you can answer well for the time being at least fletcher felt the iciness of malinaris hands their alien cold and it was as if his brain had frozen turning around in what felt like slow motion he stared petrified into that leering face its furnace eyes and even though his life depended on it he couldnt do a thing to avoid what came next vaguely he was aware of a nauseating crunching and on the very periphery of his vision he saw the hag vavara biting pieces out of vladimirs broken skull but by then lord malinaris hands had shifted to fletchers head and an involuntary agonizing transference had already commenced malinari sucked at him not blood but thoughts memories secrets and the contents of fletchers brain werent simply duplicated but downloaded removed and wiped clean gone from fletcher for ever they left a void as bitter cold as the hands that stole them and absorbed by malinari they compressed the contents of his mind into ever tighter corners the brain is a marvellous vessel that no entirely human being has ever filled to overflowing but malinari the mind was no mere man and his was a terrible power yet even he had limits he had the memories of many dozens of men he remembered what they had known and also recognized them as the source of his fits of madness those spells that rushed upon him out of nowhere those shrieking rages that ever more frequently lay outside his control in starside that hadnt mattered too much but here on earth it was a problem only give himself over to his furies his enemies would at once take advantage aye and not only his human enemies vavara hated him with all her black heart and as for lord szwart but who could fathom him then again who could blame them they were after all wamphyri like all their kind they sought power over others and would destroy friends and foes alike murder them out of hand if the opportunity presented itself the time was right and the means to hand but here in this man fletcher such secrets were his as would frustrate the efforts of any and every enemy the secrets of ebranch and its members of trask goodly chung and especially of jake cutter and malinari must have them it might well cause him almost as much pain as it caused his writhing victim it was causing him pain a pounding in his temples that threatened to explode them outwards but he must go on and yes yes there it was jake cutter necroscope but what was this a man who could converse with the dead and call them up out of their graves a man who knew the runes of space and time who had the power to move instantaneously from place to place without physically covering the distance between not a magician no for there was no such thing but a man who a man who what until now engrossed in his own hideous absorbing of fletchers knowledge with his vibrating pseudopod fingers groping deep into his moaning victims ears suddenly malinari became aware that something had gone dangerously awry halfway across the room the witch vavara was halfwoman halfthing where she hunched like a great black bat over the broken corpse of vladimir androsov but beyond her against the wall another figure was getting to its knees rising up from the floor it was the minder cliff angel his ravaged face a mass of wet redness where malinaris blow had flensed it to the bone but in his hands a deadly weapon the keramique with which he was a marksman i dont know who or what you are you fucking thing he choked the words out along with blood from the torn corner of his mouth but the man who hits cliff angel like that has got to expect a reply nothing gets me back on my feet faster than being knocked down so i hope youre ready for this fuckface cos here it comes and he squeezed the trigger vavara had become aware of angel even as he spoke seeing his gun she gasped aloud flattened herself down then hurled herself headlong in his direction with her taloned hands reaching for him it was selfpreservation on vavaras part pure instinct but hurtling below angels line of fire her action had left malinari completely exposed and in the frozen moment of angels shot he had made a perfect target but in that same moment hed reacted to the threat and in a lightningfast movement with all the savagery and cunning of the wamphyri hed turned bernie fletchers head directly into the path of the bullet and once again cliff angel had been right the tokarev was no match for the keramique the bullet passed through fletchers right eye destroying his brain in its passing and taking out the back of his skull in a fistsized chunk blood and brain matter spattered malinaris face and his probing fingers felt the projectiles heat as it turned the subject of his investigation to so much jelly cutting short the stream of information the locator fletcher was now a dead weight in malinaris hands thrusting his flopping body away he gave a wild cry of rage and frustration and clapped his slimed hands to his head then no no no he cried his voice shaking with his passion such knowledge such secrets vavara all gone now these stupid stubborn people and then calming himself and pointing a trembling hand at the minder cliff angel lolling in vavaras taloned hands is that one finished for if not i shall do it myself but ohsoveryslowly vavara turned angels body towards malinari and showed him the pipes torn out of his throat does he look finished she grinned with jagged needle teeth and black leathery lips and her hags features flowed like liquid as they morphed into the face of a beautiful young woman and what of us she went on what did you achieve nephran did you finish i take it you did not malinari took a deep breath and stood up straighter take up that ones weapon he said we now have two such and they may prove useful as for being finished we are finished here aye but even though i failed to get what i wanted and despite that these people are dead and useless now still we can use one of them at least if only as a lure for the others for these were little fishes and the big ones are still out there you and szwart you shall yet have your revenge vavara and i shall have what i want and for now she was fully transformed now all aglow in her false loveliness for now lets get downstairs he answered lord szwart will be waiting for us and these ebranch people are not very far away i can sense them he sniffed the air their signatures are heavy in the aether they are using their shields but i can sense that too for i know them now these people over the reek of these cadavers still i can sense them very well go quickly and fetch our vehicle while i wait with szwart and attend to things here and when we go we shall leave our signatures behind so that ebranch will know who did this and so that theyll follow us she curled her lip what logic is there in that trust me vavara said malinari taking up bernie fletchers body tossing it carelessly over his shoulder and heading for the door i want them to follow us indeed i want them to follow us all the way to hell some twenty minutes later ben trask and his agents drove into the street where the tundza hotel stood central set apart from neighbouring buildings by narrow cobbled alleys that wound away into dismal backstreet regions but just as they entered the street ian goodly was obliged to pull over to the right climb the shallow kerb and come to a halt when an antique fire engine went clanging by followed by a police vehicle with its strobes flashing and siren blaring down the street a handful of people had gathered they were gesticulating and pointing excitedly across the road at a burning building a sign hanging over the entrance to the dilapidated place said tundza in two languages turkish and english coming the other way and narrowly avoiding the fire engine and police car a third vehicle a black estate car skidded past in a blur of rapid acceleration careened around a corner and disappeared into the night but as it went by what said liz merrick frowning can that be the tundza there burning thats how it looks said trask turning to smile at her and lardis lidesci seated beside liz and suddenly puzzled his wiry black eyebrows coming together in a look of amazement said eh eh have you gone stark staring mad both of you liz and trask feeling oddly buoyed up stared at him in surprise bordering on astonishment likewise the precog millie cleary and paul garvey and the selfsame thought was in everyones mind what on earth was bothering the old lidesci lardis saw it in their faces and snapped that must be the tundza yes and its where bernie fletcher and those bullyboy minders of his are supposed to be staying but it will be all right lardis paul garvey assured him straightfacedly cant you see everythings just just fine here but then he stopped speaking his eyes went wide and his jaw fell open and suddenly the atmosphere in the minibus was electric as the six espers felt the gradual abatement of vavaras aura and trask gasped no it damned well isnt nothings bloody fine and he was first out of the minibus hurrying past the deserted shops and dwellings toward the blazing tundza the rest of the team caught up with him when he was stopped by a uniformed policeman by which time the firemen were breaking in the hotels groundfloor shutters and the fire engines hoses were playing feeble streams of water in through the tundzas door but already it was obvious that the hotel was beyond hope flames were gouting from the windows on both main floors and smoke pouring from gables in what was presumably the attic trask was babbling to the policeman we have friends staying here they could be inside and while he explained millie was tugging on his arm trying to get his attention wait said the policeman holding up his hand please to wait mercifully he spoke reasonable english then he shouted something to the closest fireman who shouted back at him over the roaring of the flames and this fire she was set he said turning to trask smell the kero plenty kero these old places use the kerosine er for the generators bad electricity often the breakdown and he shrugged your friends if they there i think they coming out the windows no come maybe not there i boiling not there you stay at tundza he looked at trask inquiringly no trask shook his head we just got here to meet our friends we go to look at your er your ancient things ah the antitikkies said the other the what trask didnt at first understand but then he did and said oh the antiquities yes yes of course please excusing said the policeman please be waiting here and he went to use the police cars radio finally millie had trasks attention that black car the one that skidded by us just after ian stopped liz says it was them she says it was vavara performing one of her illusions trask knew immediately what she meant and said of course it was and who would know it better than liz shes been there and done that on krassos as for lardis hes szgany they have builtin protections against wamphyri mentalism and thats why it didnt work on him but wheres liz now looking back toward the minibus he saw liz leaning against the wall of a shop apparently propping herself up but when he saw how she held her hands to her temples he knew at once what she was doing damnation he gasped striding towards her but paul garvey and the precog got to her first and garvey said its all right ben well cover her shield her shes trying to track those alien bastards i know damn well what liz is doing trask burst out and i also know that if she carries on like that shell get herself in a whole mess of trouble millie was hot on trasks heels applying her telepathy and adding her shields to garveys she said its okay its okay hes not probing back i cant feel a thing out there only back here she was talking about malinari of course wherever he was now he wasnt using his mentalism there was no hint of telepathic intrusion but trask picked up on something else that shed said that there was something back here and now he snapped mindsmog is that what you mean where only back there millie glanced back at the tundza which was now an inferno apart from this fire they made no attempt to hide their hand in this that place stinks of them and ben he was here and she shuddered szwart millie nodded i couldnt be mistaken ive been too close to that dreadful thing once before his signature is a stench as she spoke ian goodly staggered and uttered a small warbling cry it was a momentary thing and he quickly straightened up but again trask knew what it signified what is it he barked taking the precogs arm and steadying him what did you see fire goodly gasped i saw bernies face a dead face ben surrounded by flames he was melting burning the tundza trask gasped turning and making to run back towards the blazing hotel but goodly clung to him and said no not there hes not there ben not any longer then where trasks face was ruddy glaring in the light from the fire i i dont know goodly said it was like a scene out of a nightmare and there were there were girls behind him back beyond the flames girls ben and they were laughing and dancing a weird frozen dance what trask shook his head in dismay what in hell does that mean but the precog had no answers he could only offer a shrug of apology and blink those sad undertakers eyes of his those eyes that shone with tomorrows light then the policeman came hurrying toward them i inspector burdur he said ali bey burdur i needing descriptions your friends their names and so on and so forth you are coming to police station with me but not worrying is not the big problem you will following my car on the way we make one stop trask introduced himself to the heavily built swarthy law officer and said yes of course well help you all we can but theres something we should tell you right now its possible weve seen the people who did this we believe they were in that car that was leaving just as we arrived burdur nodded the black station wagon i seeing it too perhaps the driver eager to make room for us and perhaps not but she was driving very fast again he nodded but very thoughtfully she said trask a woman you saw her a pretty woman yes mr trask but now maybe she has the troubles eh you are knowing this person no said trask as convincingly as possible even though he hated lying we dont know her but did you say she has troubles what troubles burdur shook his head and said no more questions now we go and quickly across the town is another fire he looked at trask a black station wagon is burning in the square near the town theatre ah i seeing your face you understanding my god said goodly under his breath his hand shaking like a leaf on trasks arm well follow right behind you said trask grimly as ali bey burdur turned and made for his vehicle and then speaking quietly to the pale shuddering precog trask said this time old friend you can take it easy ill be doing the driving by the time they got to the open square where the black estate car was on fire from nose to tail a second ancient fire engine had arrived and was just beginning to pour water on the flames in the car sitting stiffly in a rear seat his head lolling back on the headrest a human figure blazed like a candle his blue and yellow flames curling out through the heatshattered window it could only be fletcher for the precog had foreseen it and in situations like this ian goodly was rarely wrong a small mainly muted crowd had gathered despite the lateness of the hour and ali bey burdur quickly found himself an excited witness an elderly man who worked at the shabbylooking theatre just across the road there followed a rapidfire exchange in turkish to which the ebranch people were not privy and then burdur turned to trask and said this a very horrible thing the old man working in the theatre he working slow cleaning up makes locked the doors comes out he standing over there in the shadows in the doorway the car comes three peoples get out no one here but the old man the peoples pour kero in the car and outside the old man is afraid he sees a man in the car he wants cry out but the three are very strange one is woman he thinking then they set fire and go away is nothing else trask shook his head said nothing let his haggard looks speak for him but the precog was moaning poor bernie poor bernie these peoples who making the fires said burdur staring hard at trask your enemies ive already told you said trask obliged to lie again we only just got here we have no enemies here perhaps these people were thieves and this is how they cover their tracks and the one in the car this poor dead man hes our friend we think one of them we cant be sure but he looked like a man called bernie fletcher and goodly sat down on the damp kerb of the little traffic island in the middle of the square and said it is fletcher ben it is definitely bernie fletcher distraught the precog hadnt realized that trask was doing his best to extricate his people from all of this the tall one he seem very sure said burdur frowning trask took the inspectors arm led him away from goodly leaving millie and the others to comfort him and said you dont understand ali bey they were very good friends bernie and the tall one this is a big shock to him to all of us and this bernie came here with how many others to study the antitikkies with two other english said trask both men they came to find a cheap place to stay to use as a base well they finding it said burdur but in wrong part of town now i must try to finding them the others you are helping at the police station of course said trask good and then we find you a place to stay in right part of town i thinking lead on said trask the sooner we get done the better weve come a long way and were all very tired ben came millies cry of concern trask and burdur came to a halt looked back the car was a smoking blackened wreck now where very few flames continued to flicker all on the inside on the traffic island close by trasks people were assisting goodly who appeared to have collapsed trask went to them got down on one knee helped raise the precog up but before he got to his feet as he glanced once again at the gutted car the shrivelled silhouette within and the last few flames that persisted in springing into life from the smouldering back seat finally trask saw what goodly had seen saw what the precog had seen twice through the buckled empty frames of the cars windows the advertisement over the theatres entrance a poster seven feet high by fifteen wide showing the current attraction a troupe of scantilyclad dancing girls made up as vampires all of them laughing or smiling their sly vampire smiles and frozen of course in the crude poses that the artist had given them but trask knew differently knew that in fact they werent made up at all and they certainly werent posing ben trask dreamed in the last few moments before waking which is often the case he dreamed a kaleidoscopic flashback of all the events of the last twentyfour hours the journey to turkey and sirpsindigi by airplane and minibus the discovery of the blazing hotel tundza bernie fletchers horrific cremation and finally sitting in the dreary police station with inspector ali bey burdur preparing a laborious statement mercifully his statement just the one had sufficed in burdurs opinion the rest of the team had nothing of any great importance to add to what trask had told him then the inspector had spent a few minutes on the phone found an hotel where the english party could stay for the night given them directions and turned them loose but he might want to question them again in the morning and certainly he would want to tell them the results of the nights investigations so in any case they must not leave the hotel without first speaking to him in all hed been very helpful and considerate but throughout the dream that picture of the burning station wagon had kept surfacing with bernie fletchers cindered silhouette picked out against crackling flames and a backdrop of dancing laughing vampires and trask knowing it must have meaning that it was more than just a replay of a nightmarish event had found himself striving to understand and in that final moment before springing awake suddenly he did recognize and understand its inescapable truth then jerking upright in his bed in a cold sweat and thinking about it as all of those jumbled images except the one faded to background static in the face of waking reality he was annoyed at himself that it hadnt struck him sooner for now that he had fathomed the thing why it was obvious the telephone had brought him awake of the oldfashioned black bakelite variety its persistent ringing on the bedside table made a nervejarring clamour in the silence of the room yet trask let it ring a little while longer until finally he managed to get his thoughts in order by then millie had come out of the bathroom and she picked it up first its for you she said passing trask the handset as he propped himself up its that policeman inspector he spoke into the phone this is trask ah mr trask came burdurs thick guttural voice bad news i afraid we finding human remains in the tundza hotel five bodies well five remains you understanding one is downstairs probably the owner and four upstairs as for the man in the car he has the wallet outside burned inside not so bad there is a card in heatresistent plastic a restaurant card for the eating place it has his name b fletcher so your mr goodly he was right and the others trask was pretty sure he knew who two of them would be but there was still hope very badly burned said burdur also very dangerous no sooner we er extracting the bodies the floor collapse only way to check is with dental records those names you giving me also that telephone number in london they working on it i expecting the fax is good you having connections with british police they being incredibly helpful also they asking me please to be assisting you in any way i thought they might said trask there are er quite a few policemen in our archaeological society your society ah the digging people the ancient relics and so on and so forth and historians too said trask is funny said burdur with just a hint of sarcasm in his voice in my country the policeman is interested in the crime he has little time for the hobbies exactly said trask thinking quickly and we are interested in crime the crimes of er ancient invaders which was pretty much the truth for a moment there was silence at the other end until ali bey burdur said well is all outside my er your sphere of interest exactly and then so mr trask i keeping you informed you may going in the town if you wishing but please to telling the desk where you going and how long will you expect us to remain in sirpsindigi oh only a day or so thanks for your help said trask thinking nothings of it said the other and then before he broke the connection mr trask are you also the policeman some kind of policeman the investigator eh only in connection with well with strange old things trask answered things out of distant places and times of course said the other and trask thought he sensed a nod of feigned understanding and also the narrowing of suspicious brown eyes you are meaning the antitikkies yes yes said trask the antiquities and when there was no answer he put the phone down tracking the wamphyri the horror at the crossing by am all the members of the ebranch team were down in the threestar hotels dining room for breakfast the food was mainly acceptable the alleged continental breakfast consisted of croissants cheese preserves and coffee or tea but the tea wasnt to millies liking and the coffee was a cross between the murky turkish variety and an inferior instant brand the granules paul garvey commented with his normal lack of facial expression which made it difficult to tell if he was joking or not dont melt they just turn to mud in the bottom of the cup but he probably wasnt joking because it was true and also because no one was in the mood for humour anyway but at least its hot said liz and with a little sugar its even sweet im sorry about last night said ian goodly this talent of mine sometimes i hate it and what with bernie and all i just wasnt myself try to forget it trask told him and im not being callous but going on about it wont help also if youre feeling bad about fletcher well think how i feel i sent him and those special branch fellows out here and while its no consolation at least we know he was dead before they torched the car yes the precog answered i am positive about that when i first saw him i mean when we were at the tundza i knew he was dead but i dont understand why there were two separate attacks what was bernie doing out on his own i dont think he was out on his own said trask i think they killed him at the tundza along with his minders and gustav turchins men then took him to that kino place deliberately the dancing girls said millie reading his mind without even trying the troupe off the evening star yes trask nodded vavaras creatures now property of the wamphyri malinari knew we would find that estate car and fletcher said paul garvey and then that wed see the hoarding is that what you mean and again trask nodded hes so sure of himself so sure hes going to win this one that hes leading us on ill give you odds that when we check it out well discover that the show has moved on malinari wants us to follow him to go where hes going him and those other two freaks and those poor girls as to why i can only think that he intends to trap us but bernie was only one man and were many and forewarned is forearmed which raises the question said lardis lidesci forearmed with what a little garlic a little knowledge which in turn raises the question should we be doing what he wants should we be pursuing them you know we must said trask you know that this is one trail weve got to follow because were the only ones who can okay by now in the uk the minister responsible will be on it him and the civilian authorities all of the security services hell and for all i know the army too theyll be finding and confining sleepers thats if there are any more and we must hope there arent but if there are theyll be watching them and checking them out at porton down the microbiologists and oh a whole gaggle of boffins will be doing their thing looking for answers you see it simply isnt enough that this new bubonic plague out of china will kill the wamphyri out of the six and a quarter billion people on this planet some four billion havent even come in contact with the plague and its already waning dying out and at least half the population of the poorer countries havent even had shots so theres god food enough for these beasts whats more and as i believe ive said before its possible that theyll know who they can or cant eat pheromones said liz something like that trask nodded or perhaps common or uncommon sense wamphyri senses are vastly superior to those of ordinary people im sorry if it offends at table and what have you but would you kiss a man with breath like a sewer a sunken nose and scabby lips or put it another way dont you know when a piece of raw meat has overstayed its welcome in your refrigerator its not at all unlikely they can smell the plague these bloody creatures in which case said garvey well at least we know they wont be biting us weve had our jabs were tainted meat that may be true said lardis they wont be biting us but it wont stop them from tearing our arms and legs off what im trying to say said trask is that whats happening back home doesnt apply elsewhere of course the minister responsible will have passed all of this on to our friends in australia and with good old manolis papastamos on the case in greece who knows maybe the greek authorities will listen and take some kind of covert action to isolate krassos we must hope so anyway for after whats happened back home if its as serious as we suppose and i for one think it is we just dont know what else is loose out there any more but we do know the source said millie right said trask and we also know that it was out and about its filthy work right here in sirpsindigi last night so since right now we cant tell the majority of the worlds population whats happening the jobs ours said ian goodly his strange deep eyes afire now blazing as never before because we have the knowledge that almost everyone else lacks were it he looked at the old lidesci were the avengers lardis does that answer your question should we be going if not us who else malinari vavara and szwart theyve thrown down the gauntlet i say we pick it up and ram it right down their bloody throats which coming from the thin grimacing lips of the precog sounded that much more impressive and well then lardis growled that appears to be that for if what you just said wasnt a vow then ive never heard one so you ian goodly may now consider yourself an honorary member of the szgany lidesci and im glad to have you as for my question but thats all it was i was just very interested to know how everyone else felt about it thats all also and with regard to my own feelings i dont know why were sitting around doing sweet bugger all when weve come so very close to tracking these bastards down sweet bugger all said trask frowning at lardis jake cutter lardis growled i heard him say it several times when he was out of sorts in the hq is it offensive trask shook his head explicit thats all and as to why were doing sweet bugger all its because were stuck in this place until inspector ali bey burdur says we can go but were allowed out into the town which means there is work we can be getting on with for one thing we can find out if my theorys right and those girls from the star have moved on to their next venue god said liz but what a trio of roadies they have and then theres lardiss other point said millie we dont as yet have any weapons when we do finally catch up with these monsters i dont want to find myself in the same situation as last time what face to face with a thing like lord szwart and completely vulnerable that doesnt bear thinking about she hugged herself and shivered i had intended to weaponup as soon as we got settled in out here said trask theres more than enough of everything we need back in the armoury at the hq its all been set aside by now bagged up and ready to go as soon as i give the word but with ali bey burdur on our backs said garvey exactly said trask so well have to wait till were on the move again settled in our next port of call wherever that may be before we bring our secret weapon into play he looked at liz jake she said i came close to calling him last night at the tundza and again in the kino square trying his best not to scowl at her trask said drily oh joy his sarcasm dripped why yes what a marvellous notion i mean cant you just picture it jake cutter appearing right out of nowhere and probably with no id now that really would give our suspicious policeman friend something to think about i know liz bit her lip but i was jittery and we were so very close to those monsters im just like millie ben ive been close once before anyway i didnt do it no said trask you tried to track them instead which was almost as dumb because they were that close to us and you have to promise me you wont do it again not on your own anyway now listen liz when im ready to turn you loose when it gets up close and personal and i really need your talents believe me youll be the first to know all of you but it will probably be a concerted effort each and every one of us doing his or her bit and i want us all in one piece when that time comes they had finished eating not that anyone had eaten very much paul garvey poured a little hot water onto the dregs in his cup added a lump of sugar and asked so whats next i feel about the same as lardis now that were out here now that the games afoot im sure that too much inactivity is bound to get to me to all of us said trask okay this is what well do its daylight and were comparatively safe so well form two teams myself lardis and ian well pay a visit to this kino place and see if my theorys correct and if so well try to find out where those girls if we can still call them that where theyre playing next which leaves paul and the ladies bold telepaths all you three will go up to one of the rooms use a smallscale map of this region and see if you can pick up the trail then he frowned at liz and added but no deep probing thats out im talking about their trail the route they took out of here if in fact theyve gone i know youre not locators but working in tandem as it were lets see what you can do anyway and i just want to stress it one more time the moment you sense mindsmog youre out of there back off and leave it at that oh and theres one other thing in case ali bey burdur decides to drop in on you you might want to make sure youre up to scratch on the local antitikkies okay he stood up thats all for now people ian and lardis if youre ready and they were in the kino square the burnedout car had been securitytaped off and covered with a tentlike tarpaulin beneath and around which the members of a scenesofcrime team in masks and white smocks performed their gruesome tasks above the kinos double doors the display hoarding had been stripped and two men were busy on fragilelooking scaffolding where they were pasting up a new poster it looked like trasks theory was proven as much as possible trask and his two colleagues avoided looking at the tented enclosure avoided thinking about bernie and the method of his disposal and tried to make themselves inconspicuous as they mingled with a short queue of turkish men waiting in the kinos foyer at a ticket window the small crowd was in an ugly mood and trask soon found out why the revue had been cancelled arid last nights show had been the last of its kind the girls who had been booked for another three days had apparently quit and moved on and these men were here to get their money back at the window trask asked if it was known where the girls had gone what was their next venue the harassed agent in the booth didnt understand him became impatient waved him aside but a turk who stood next in line behind the ebranch group had heard trasks inquiry and said they gone no one knows where they just go is too bad was very good the show the sexy english girls the vampire ladies yes yes indeed trask answered the toothy grinning turk a great pity we missed them outside again the three could scarcely avoid observing the tented enclosure that stood directly opposite the kino but as they paused at the kerb a police car drew up and ali bey burdur got out ah finding you he said and trask asked him were you at our hotel was going there but seeing you here goodly nodded and said we were paying our last respects since we wont be here for the but there he paused the cremation said burdur i understanding one cremation is enough yes and that will be soon i hope said trask burdur nodded we having the identity is fletcher and is something strange he looked at trask quizzically oh trask tried not to sound too worried this fletcher he have no family distant relatives i believe said trask that explaining things perhaps said the inspector what things that they asking we cremate him here which you knowing about and that we do it soon which is you suggest also and again trask found himself obliged to think quickly in many lands he said people are burning the dead and doing it with dispatch because of the bubonic its becoming almost standard practice ah the plague said burdur but surely the poor bernie fletcher he had not the plague no of course not said trask but why take a chance he has no family hes dead its as well hes cremated here hmmm said burdur same conversation i having with your people in london but trask wasnt to be caught out so easily my people er i meaning the english authorities oh said trask then i can only assume that the authorities in england will make good the expenses too so i understanding burdur nodded thoughtfully and then quickly changing the subject one other things chief of turkish security in ankara the big boss peoples is speaking to me this morning he is saying me to giving all assistance possible to mr trask and his party you having important friends really said trask without having to act too surprised and tbank god for the minister responsible he thought for he had certainly outdone himself this time around quite obviously hed broken new ground and developed some kind of alliance with turkish intelligence isolated for many years now by reason of turkeys humanrights record and trask couldnt help but wonder how much information the minister responsible had passed on in order to achieve this level of cooperation yes really said the inspector but i asking to myself security big boss security now what having we here eh trask shrugged then said oh i dont think theres any great mystery its not unusual when an englishman dies abroad that our foreign office do their best to assist in every possible way ah yes said burdur but assisting the dead mans family usually is not so but wanting to have done with this now and answering the inspector perhaps a little too sharply trask said the point is will you help us or not ali bey burdur drew back a pace i having no choice he said but was hoping you could helping me too me help but how the proprietor of tundza he dead too said burdur and he is turkish the charity is beginning at home eh also the other englishmens and two more we not know at tundza finally the owner of this burned car the car he was stolen last night we finding the owner he dead murdered we thinking but is a very bad very strange thing how strange said trask he a young man said the inspector young strong with no sicknesses but we finding him all old and twisted how you say it he sucked in his cheeks and squeezed down into himself illustrating the word he was looking for and shrivelled said trask exactly and when trask said nothing please mr trask burdur went on listen i coming clean i having you followed when you leaving hotel you come here go in kino asking about girls for why i not believing your antitikkies storybut i not thinking you the criminals no i thinking you the special policemans is correct and i also thinking i needing your help if is bad something here in sirpsindigi i need knowing so will you telling ali bey burdur what going on ali bey said trask im not a policeman but i am concerned with security security of my country and occasionally of the world right now the security of the world i cant say more than that but me and my people we need to leave sirpsindigi if not tonight by tomorrow morning if you can clear the way for us perhaps ill have something more to tell you is good said the other tomorrow you going anythings you needing asking me good said trask and now were going back to the hotel you can contact me there early tomorrow morning burdur nodded i doing that for sure and if i not seeing you tomorrow he stuck out his huge hand trask took and shook it and found ali beys card in his hand he pocketed it as the turkish policeman turned away and then he and the others returned to their minibus back at the hotel trask and his group found paul garvey liz and millie seated in the foyer trask asked what was happening and was informed by garvey that theyd come down to escape the confines of lizs room get a breath of fresh air and stretch their legs this following their combined effort at picking up the trail of the wamphyri and garvey hinted that theyd found something here in the foyer however with people sitting about reading newspapers and drinking coffee and hotel staff coming and going garvey didnt want to say too much in the cranky elevator on their way back up to lizs room trask asked why everyone seemed so quiet and nervous and garvey told him earlier the telephone in lizs room went on the blink so i went down to see if they could fix it also to fetch coffee and sandwiches their room service is lousy there was this man in the foyer who couldnt seem to take his eyes off me well i knew he was watching me i could actually feel his eyes following me you know how it is yes said trask but not as well as you do your talent will give you the edge every time anyway i went to check him out said garvey i managed to get up close to him and tried to look into his eyes just a glimpse should have been enough but he avoided me and he was so intent on pretending not to be watching me why it was almost as if he was shielded so i thought maybe he was a thrall and that was scary but i took a chance accidentally bumped into him finally got to look him in the eyes in one way that was a relief but in another it worried you said trask but far better a policeman than a vampire thrall right as they got out of the elevator garvey said well youre obviously way ahead of me so now its your turn whats happening what did you find out at the kino and why are the turkish police watching us and probably listening to our telephone conversations i mean i know why theyre watching us of course i do but how much do they know whoah said trask as liz let them into her room youre not done yet what did you find out you gave me the impression that youd got something for me at which point millie took it up we think perhaps we do she said but if were right it presents more difficulties explain said trask as they all found places to sit and now it was lizs turn when i was vavaras prisoner on krassos she began i experienced this weird ability of hers i suppose we should call it her talent up close also i saw what lurks beneath that talent the wrinkled hag that she is in reality i learned something then something we all should have realized sooner but even then i failed to recognize its importance this morning however when we began our search suddenly it dawned on me when malinari goes abroad in the world he goes as a man which is no great effort to him because he is a man he scarcely needs to disguise himself at all as for that thing called szwart he lives with his condition of constant metamorphosis and its entirely natural to him he only wills changes in himself when its absolutely necessary but when the hag vavara goes abroad she goes as a beautiful girl or woman its that important to her a matter of vanity aye said lardis thats very true but she cant stand beauty in others which is why she mutilates her women especially the lovely ones and i think i see what youre getting at said trask vavara has to keep up appearances shes obliged to use her talent all the time she never lets up unless shes angry infuriated said liz ive seen her like that too and close up as i said it isnt a pretty picture you know her aura said trask youre able to recognize her psychic signature i think so yes liz nodded well something like that and now paul garvey took it up we sat at that small round coffee table there and bonded then we concentrated on various areas of the map where it lay in the middle of the table areas lying outside the town limits we were looking for mindsmog of course even the faintest trace which might perhaps indicate that the wamphyri had passed that way since they probably left by road i mean how else could they have gone thats what we concentrated on roads and crossing points crossing points trask repeated him and garvey nodded if you look at the map youll see were pretty close to the borders of both greece and bulgaria if the wamphyri have left sirpsindigi which were fairly certain now that they have they had a choice of going back into the turkish heartland or crossing into greece or bulgaria greece wouldnt be their best choice said trask looking at the map the borders with turkey are closed territorial disputes and what have you and anyway vavaras been there and done that and both she and malinari know now that we have good friends in greece that was our opinion too said garvey so we spent only a little time sweeping west but as for north south and east we covered them extensively and that brings us back to liz and millie the latter took it up there was something to the north into bulgaria that i didnt much care for said millie im much like liz and my time with szwart has left a kind of stain on my psyche i felt or thought i felt something of his passing by or through in my mind it was as if the northern area of the map lay under a shadow that was gradually clearing well as you can see for yourself the way north is a narrow route along a secondclass road and a turkish secondclass road at that that parallels the tundza into bulgaria theres a customs post marked on the map at the border if in fact they went that way they would have had to pass through that border crossing and you think they did said trask thats where i come back in said liz but before i say any more what did you find out at the kino it seems only fair that you tell us now ben have they in fact left or havent they i mean have we three been sitting here wasting our time and imagining things or what you mean you dont already know he answered and saw all three telepaths glance at each other with lowered eyes then he grinned albeit wryly humourlessly and said okay under the circumstances i accept that you couldnt wait so just to clarify matters yes theyve left and he quickly went on to tell them the story of the dance troupes departure and also of his conversation with ali bey burdur finishing up with so now go on liz what was it you thought you sensed about that northern route into bulgaria but thats precisely the point she answered its what i didnt feel in every other direction there was motion struggle the massed turmoil of people intelligences thoughts and paul and millie detected much the same thing the telepathic background the mental static of all those people our combined talents let us sense the backwash of humanity all their triumphs frustrations and disappointments but to the north that was different everything was peaceful ben and i knew that it was false vavara trask nodded the route shes taken out of here like some kind of slimy snailtrail thats how i thought of it too said liz but you know there are times when the sun lights on a snails track so that it can look quite beautiful in this case a hideous beauty and i cant be mistaken thats where theyve gone and thats where she is now in bulgaria and millie added i think liz is right its very strange but in combining our talents like that we seemed to achieve a great deal more than we could possibly have done on our own i know its an old trick among ebranch espers but this time it seemed to work so much better and i for one felt far more powerful my talent i mean me too said liz nodding her agreement there was a clarity to everything that ive never known before but it was the negative aspect that drew my attention north trask turned to paul garvey for the last word but expressionless as always garvey could only shrug its all down to the ladies he said i like to think i boosted their probes but the credit is theirs it must be as theyve said previous close contact has given them the edge and given us a brand new weapon from now on david chung must look to his laurels trask stood up said if those three monsters have stolen another vehicle the guards on that border crossing post might have logged its registration number why they might even know its destination if so i know someone who can probably supply us with both which brings us back to those difficulties i spoke about said millie our documents only allow us to travel in turkey i know there arent many restrictions on turks travelling into bulgaria but were not turks just guests in their country trask took out ali beys card from his pocket went to the antique telephone on lizs bedside table and began to dial the inspectors number yes he said thats a very good point and burdur might have the answer to that one too trask got through to a grunting unintelligible receptionist gave his name and asked for burdur following which you are fortunate to be catching me mr trask said the harassedsounding inspector a moment later when he was called to the phone i getting back here two three minutes ago and now on way out again i busy very please being quickly what is it you wanting trask told burdur what he suspected that last nights killers had probably departed turkey via a littleused backwoods bordercrossing into bulgaria and began to request documentation in order that he might pursue them but from the moment he mentioned the border post the inspector quit muttering to some unseen other in the police station and fell silent indeed he even seemed to stop breathing and before trask could finish you knowing the way to the crossing there was an undeniable urgency in the turkish policemans voice i have a map said trask i meeting you there burdur growled when trask was taken aback now packing your things mr trask you want leaving sirpsindigi leaving turkey maybe you leaving but i seeing you at crossing point burdur cut in driving quickly mr trask is very bad business trask immediately suspected the worst and said im on my way but the line was already dead the scenery is mediterranean said millie staring out of the minibuss window and the countryside sparsely peopled mainly farming communities the rain last night was probably the first of the season just see how its made everything look fresh nice climate said trask if the tundza was a sea rather than a river i might well believe i was on some aegean island its a pity the greeks and turks cant get along there are incredibly nice people on both sides mundane conversation said paul garvey its supposed to ease the tension but it isnt doing its job said liz instead the tension increases every time we take a wrong turning but all these farm tracks look the same to me and the map is too smallscale to be anything like accurate liz was in the front mapreading for ian goodly trask and the others were in the back all six were being jostled thrown about by a combination of their vehicles poor suspension and a badly neglected potholed road surface at this rate said goodly doing battle with the steering wheel it wont be too long before this old rattletrap shakes herself to bits suggestion said lardis lidesci hanging on for dear life liz why dont you just put that chart down and simply take us there you have the skill after all and ian surely you know or you can guess which tracks to take the future cant be all that devious trask looked at the old lidesci opened his mouth to speak then shut it again and frowned and finally he said you know he could be right liz put the map aside and ian just drive your choice hang a right at the next crossroads said liz and millie almost in unison but the precog was already doing it and damn he said but you know i think lardis is right they sped along a slightly better road past the small manmade lakes of a trout farm and crested a rise and there just two hundred yards ahead they spotted a wooden structure at the side of the road and a red and whitestriped pivoting barrier with a universal halt disc centrally situated two police vehicles were parked beside the border post and inspector burdur was standing there waving the minibus down as the team got out of their vehicle burdur came striding over and gripped trasks arm how you knowing he said that they came this way yes how you knowing that we believe they may be heading for romania trask lied and then wondered if it really was a lie for after all theyd come out of romania but why would they want to go back there you knowing plenty about these criminal peoples said the inspector angrily bringing him back to earth yet you telling me nothings first you tell me said trask whats happened here what happeningsaid burdur you wanting know you going inside then you seeing wiping sweat from his brow he nodded toward the open flyscreened door of the borderpost shack guarding the door one on each side two nervous trembling border patrolmen kept glancing inwards their eyes trying but not trying too hard to penetrate the shaded interior looking at them at these burly sidearmed yet badly shaken men trask paced to the door then paused to look back at his people they were watching him uncertain what to do then millie made to go to him but ali bey burdur held up a warning hand not for the ladies no he said gruffly and trask told garvey paul stay with liz and millie at which lardis lidesci stepped forward you said the inspector ive probably seen worse lardis grunted burdur looked deep into his eyes and nodded you thinking so i thinking so too you mr trask i thinking all of you seeing worse i think is part of your work but me i policeman thirtyseven years and not seeing worse never you still want going in for answer lardis started for the door and burdur followed on behind trask had meanwhile stepped inside disturbed by his entry a swarm of blowflies whirred past on their way out and several of them flew into his face and hair grimacing he brushed them away then passed deeper into the gloom of the place there was one small window looking out on the road and barrier dirty and flyspecked it didnt let too much light in a cubicle at the rear contained a toilet and washbasin the door to the toilet stood open and someone was sitting there with his trousers round his ankles half of the shack was hidden behind a slightly elevated counter where a second man was seated in a chair with his head laid back as if he were asleep trask knew he wasnt asleep however and also that the man using the toilet wasnt using it for while trasks eyes were still adjusting properly to the gloom of the place his talent had leaped ahead to register the grisly truth of what he was seeing and my god he said when finally it sank in his exclamation an explosion of sound in the silent stinking confines of the borderpost shack brought more flies swarming from the faces of the two corpses or from what had been their faces for the one on the toilet had no face just a raw screaming mask where the flesh had been flensed right down to the bone and his shirt all down the front inside his open uniform jacket was a sticky crimson mess where blowflies reluctant to give up their meal and their egglaying pursuits continued to swarm as for his colleague lolling in his chair behind the desk twin ballpoint pens were sticking up from his eye sockets his face was crusted with dried blood and his throat and windpipe had been torn free and were hanging on his chest from close behind trask lardis grunted they were here a completely unnecessary comment but what more could he say yes said inspector burdur from the doorway they were and now you are please telling me who was here i thinking you owing me that much mr trask the vampire hunters memories out of time feeling sick and more than a little dizzy trask followed lardis and burdur out of the shack the dizziness was probably due to the fact that hed been holding his breath from the moment hed caught his first whiff of the place blood and death were like that each had its own distinctive smell and violent death was even more distinctive and much more pungent and you couldnt get much more violent than this added to which both men had soiled themselves in the moments before they died but only one had been in the right place to do so well said ali bey burdur when they were out in the open again trask took the handkerchief from his mouth and put it away and coughed for a moment or two to clear his throat before trying to speak but the old lidesci who in his lifetime on sunside really had seen a lot worse than this and all too often strode across to the other members of the team and in lowered tones began to tell them something of what hed seen mr trask said burdur please i need to understanding i cant tell you everything said trask then its possible that my people back in london have already passed information to turkish intelligence in ankara but i still dont know what or how much if not telling everythings then telling somethings eh i must knowing mr trask those men in there they are having the families i understand trask nodded and ill tell you all i can which may not be much but should be better than nothing not about whats gone but what might be coming something coming said burdur anxiously i listening but first our documents said trask we need them stamped in order to cross the border if were checked in bulgaria without the proper authentication i can dealing with that said burdur these two men here are border officials they came here to relieving the dead men they will stamping your documents giving you the visas but i needing to know what is all about i needing it now then listen carefully said trask and when im finished ask me no more because what im going to tell you is all i can tell you the people who did these things no the creatures who did these things who killed fletcher and the others and who murdered these border guards and the man who owned that car they carry a disease but its a disease like none weve ever seen before and its extremely virulent a disease said burdur a sickness then must be causing the madness this disease no sane peoples ever did things like this thats right said trask they are insane and in their madness theyll cause others to go mad too and so it spreads thats why we have to track them down and destroy them what of the dancing girls said burdur they are having a part in this right they were victims said trask helpless victims but by now the disease is in them too and theres no helping them this is something to do with the plague out of asia said burdur a new development a new strain am i right no trask shook his head its far worse than the plague out of asia but how am i knowing this thing when i seeing it ali bey threw up his arms in frustration and is it in turkey now this horrible plague thing and trask could only answer truthfully for he felt certain now that it was in england it could be he said and then he had an idea you have rabies here dont you the rabies yes not so much now but still here what are you saying that this thing is like the rabies its like rabies said trask yes but it isnt carried or passed on by dogs so how is passed on burdur was insistent and trask had gone too far now to turn back how is rabies passed on he said eh burdur frowned and then he gasped you are saying that they are biting they are biting like the vampire like the old superstitions the old legends abbb his eyes bugged the antitikkies and trask said nothing is real burdurs dark skin was a shade paler can i believing this thing still trask said nothing but burdur knew by simply looking at him that indeed it was the truth and this happening in the night he said these many things they all happening by night the vampires they were here like your man lardis say they were here will you see to our documents said trask and give us a note to cover our lease on this vehicles use in bulgaria yes yes said the other his eyes wide and almost vacant in the contemplation of unthinkable things giving me the documents the stamping er equipments the rubber stamps are in there he looked at the shack and shuddered uncontrollably it lasted only a moment and snapping out of it he gripped trasks arms and said you and your friends what you are doing you are the brave peoples mr trask and i having somethings for you he went unsteadily to his car and trask followed him is here said burdur bringing out a thin manila envelope from the glove compartment this arriving by fax in the night big boss security in ankara is say me to expecting it i am to putting in envelope and sealing giving to you but i keeping till now to make bargain averting his eyes he offered an apologetic shrug now bargaining no longer required trask took the envelope and said from your people in london i thinks is coded you did look at it then burdur blinked and answered was the fax mr trask how i not looking but understanding decoding making into turkish i not doing i hope is helping or making easier your work so do i said trask but somehow he didnt think so ten minutes later as the ebranch party shook hands with burdur boarded the minibus and drove under the raised barrier into bulgaria distantly from the south the first mournful wail of sirens could be heard an ambulance in excess of requirements but at least a means of conveying the dead to the morgue was on its way plus a scenesofcrime team called in by burdur as for the inspector himself he stood on the road to wave them farewell until they passed out of sight in the minibus sitting up front with ian goodly trask opened the envelope glanced at the single sheet of enciphered paper and passed it back to paul garvey theres a decoder in my briefcase he said when we hit a decent patch of road type this up and see what comes out will you and while garvey worked laboriously and very uncomfortably at that trask turned to goodly and said what now whats in store for us do you mean the precog glanced at him out of the corner of his eye i can take a stab at it make a couple of guesses attempt to extrapolate if that will suffice but as for reading the future the more i think about it the more my mind shrinks from it and to be honest i think im losing it it could be deliberate maybe ive been in this game too long i think therefore i am maybe its a case of i think horrible things wherefore i dont want to think anymore huh trask grunted and is this the same man who almost gave lardis a tellingoff for questioning why weve got to get on with this no goodly gave a curt shake of his head this is a man whos sick to his stomach from seeing terrifying things knowing that theyre coming and not being able to do a damn thing about it a man who sees things but is often unable to explain them and who knows that one day he will see his own death and the deaths of his friends and having seen them will know that theyre inevitable and utterly unavoidable trask thought on that awhile then said i wasnt trying to be flippant and im sorry if thats how it sounded i just dont want us to stagnate on the job as it were i dont want horror to become commonplace i want us to keep working at it eventually to defeat it its okay goodly answered and you know im dedicated too its just that sometimes it feels like a nowin situation weve lost too many friends down the years ben too many loved ones and this battle were fighting it seems endless i mean after all weve done were no further forward normally we take two steps forward and one back except this time its beginning to feel like two forward and tbree back were not winning this one and from the rear of the vehicle which means weve got to try that much harder lardis lidesci growled no longer questioning but firm in his resolve england might be contaminated goodly reminded him without looking back and what of australia turkey krassos contaminated yes with a growing infestation not by the wamphyri not yet but victims of the wamphyri common vampires such as all those poor people on the evening star not by creatures who recognize the importance of remaining anonymous but by people who dont know what theyre becoming who cant possibly understand these strange new forces and emotions that they feel driving them ever more strongly hideously on and eventually when they succumb when they discover their unbelievable strength and monstrous hunger what then every man for himself said paul garvey still trying to type the encrypted message into trasks decoder and i am legend said millie quietly whats that trask looked back at her the title of a book i read a long time ago she answered it was science fiction or fantasy horror a nightmarish romance about the last man in a world converted to vampirism the oncehero was now the menace be was the legendary monster i think i can see that said liz on an island of mutant threelegged people the biped who gets shipwrecked will be the freak its a weird morbid thought that the longer we survive the more likely it is well become the freaks monsters from their point of view i mean too morbid said trask not to mention unworkable where the wamphyri are concerned therell never be a last human just as there can never be a last cow or chicken for us and anyway i was asking for ideas advice not for a bloody deathknell on the human race advice i cant give you said millie an opinion well perhaps go ahead said trask you were right malinari and the others theyre deliberately leaving a trail for us to follow maybe thats the idea to pick us off one by one while they still have the chance and before the whole world finds out about them for after all we are the greatest threat theyve had to face the only ones who know all about them the ones who know how to deal with them no one knows all about them said lardis not even me he wasnt boasting or putting millie down just stating a fact ive fought them all my days and i still dont know all about them but i do understand what youre saying if they get rid of ebranch thats half their battle won personally said liz i think its high time our minister responsible became responsible and told the powersthatbe his superiors exactly what were up against and that then his superiors should tell the entire world shout it loud from every radio and television screen because if ian is right and it is a nowin situation then the sooner everyone knows about it the better myself id rather have gangs of wandering vigilante peasants armed with flaring torches bunches of garlic sharpened stakes and silver bulletseven with all the mistakes they would make all the dark age witchhunts than see these monsters gradually secretly insidiously gaining ground in our world i hear what youre saying said trask and i wont deny you your opinion but youve hit the nail right on the head a new dark age yes thats where we could end up and quickly if we did start shouting it from the rooftops but okay well accept that were being lured and that theyre beckoning us on into some kind of trap next question what are we going to do about it call jake in on it said liz at once its too much for us alone but with the necroscope on the case with jake on the case trask broke in on her theyd have the advantage of knowing where we were certainly of knowing where be was almost all the time jakes psychic signature has to be the most powerful source of metaphysical radiation in the whole world surely youve heard how david chung describes jake like standing beside a psychic dynamo but jake also has those incredible shields liz answered thats not good enough said trask for we know how that works too if we cant find mindsmog we look for its absence in vavaras case we target the place that seems to be the most serene when jake puts the brakes on his aura im betting nephran malinari can smell his tyres burning on the far side of the moon buthe went on before liz could continue arguing her point thats not to say i disagree simply that ive tried to keep him out of it until the very last moment but not until our very last moment surely said ian goodly im concerned that the few warnings ive had in the recent past the few forecasts ive been able to make including last nights have been too shortterm in australia when we were on that monorail i got the warning with seconds to spare last night it was the same story i saw bernie fletchers funeral pyre even as they were setting it its like im catching up on the future and the next time what if im too late what if it is already happening and happening to us trask nodded and said very well ill accept the majority vote as of now at the first sign of trouble liz will call jake in on it he looked back at her in fact its probably a good idea if you can contact him the next time we take a break we still have to weaponup and i have this feeling that things will start happening sooner rather than later so while i wont ask him to join us just yet we can let him deliver our weapons alert him to the situation and request that he maintains regular contact with you say on an hourly basis the relief liz felt was clearly audible in her voice as she answered okay as soon as we take a break ill try to contact him then when the team fell silent for a while there was only the throaty throb of the minibuss engine and the muted electronic beep beep beep of paul garveys fingers on the keys of the decoder and finally when they reached a decent stretch of road where the minibus stopped swaying and bumping both sounds settled into a more regular pattern and the miles and the code commenced a rapid unwinding and the local time in bulgaria was am but the local time in england was two hours earlier when jake cutter came starting awake from horrific nightmares now what the bell he wondered his heart hammering and sweat sticking the bedsheets to his body where am i who am i what the fuck am i then gradually reality took over and he settled back down onto his pillows his dreams receding his breathing regulating itself but those dreams jake jerked back up into a sitting position and aware that there were things he should remember he tried desperately hard to focus on what hed seen felt experienced while sleeping but no use for most of it was gone erased from memory in that part of his mind where dreams are born and die and where theyre ground down again and become grist for future dreaming and the only things he remembered were the fearful whispers of the great majority and a conversation with a faint ever more distant and indistinct harry keogh out of which the single fragment that stuck in his mind was this i never stopped fighting it it was my stubborn attitude i suppose but in my time the threat was scarcely of these proportions i thought that i bad done all there was to do only to discover that the fight would continue in another world as for my world your earth it seemed to me a clean and decent place when i left it unlike now so your fight will be twofold remember this jake it takes a thief to catch a thief and if you cant fight them on your terms then fight them on but that was all as for the source of the horror in the dream its nightmarish aspect that had lain in the morbid whispers of the teeming dead in what theyd been more than hinting but while jake had known what had inspired his horror as he was dreaming it that knowledge too had now passed into limbo mere seconds had passed since jake sprang awake now once again the tentative knock came at his door reminding him of what had awakened him obviously he should answer it but instead he wished whoever it was would go away he or they were interfering with his train of thought and his vague and fleeting memories of the dream were fleeting that much faster and were gone a nightmare that was all it had been come in jake called out only to discover that his mouth and throat were as dry as dust which caused him to croak inaudibly clearing his throat he tried again at the same time casting his mind back to last night returning via the mobius continuum from paris he had found the bed in harrys room made up for sleeping probably by jimmy harvey the tech standing in for john grieve and propping himself up on the pillows jake had carried on reading through the remaining handful of keogh files that at least had been his intention but his meal had made him drowsy indeed in combination with his reading it seemed to have made him inordinately weary and the last thing he remembered was checking his wristwatch and noting that the time was just after seven so what was the time now and as gustav turchin and john grieve entered the room he checked his watch again then gave it a shake its ninethirty am grieve corroborated the time shown on jakes watch when i looked in earlier you were dead to the world but since there was nothing that couldnt wait i let you sleep now however its time you were up and mobile a bit of bumf has come in during the night that you should see and the premier here has asked to speak to you bumfjake mumbled trying to get it together premier gustav turchin said that one holding out a hand as jake threw the bedclothes aside and stood up a little unsteadily i much prefer informal meetings but if youre not yet awake coffee jake groaned taking turchins hand and giving it a feeble shake im low on caffeine thats all i never could get it together until the coffees done its work they may still be serving late breakfast downstairs said grieve i can tell them youre on your way down give you time to tidy up and throw some water in your face please do said jake excusing himself and going into the bathroom when he came out grieve was on his own turchin went down to the hotel restaurant he said hes waiting for you okay said jake ill see him there and thanks for getting me up i must have really knocked myself out all of that reading i suppose frowning grieve looked at him more closely are you sure youre okay caffeine deficiency jake tried to grin ill be fine very well said grieve but just be careful what you say to turchin hes been nosing around quite a bit ive already caught him in one or two places where he shouldnt have been and he hasnt held onto his job in moscow all these years without knowing one or two tricks so why should i talk to him at all said jake simple courtesy grieve answered ben trasks the only one around here who really knows him so while bens away turchin is more or less on his own also i know that turchin and ben are working on something together so i suppose we have to trust him that far at least and the bumf you mentioned it can wait till youve had breakfast nothing you can do about it anyway its nothing important then i didnt say that said grieve but at least it doesnt change anything not right now anyway and jake said okay ill come see you after breakfast i ordered for you turchin told jake a few minutes later as he sat down opposite the russian in an alcove exclusive to the branch what did you order ham eggs and hash browns oh and a pot of coffee naturally nothing natural about it said jake smiling despite his sudden headache its an addiction we all have them turchin shrugged with me its politics ever since i was a boy here in the west said jake we sort of look on russian politics as something of a bloodbath communisms aftermath said turchin a defunct ideology thank god and a pointless one because its obvious there will always be those who want to be more equal but it still has its adherents and thats one of the reasons why im here here at this table jake didnt think so here in england here with ebranch you have a problem with some less than democratic politicians back home right youre quick to catch on the premier nodded except it isnt just me but the world which sounds pretty similar to our problem said jake i know about your problem said turchin leaning forward a little and yours and mine disparate though they may seem pretty soon theyre going to come together then as their food arrived he fell silent but between mouthfuls why are you telling me whatever it is that youre telling me said jake because youre the necroscope said turchin at once and because youll be helping me us ebranch the world if you insist which you should and rightly so to put things back in order jake swallowed what was in his mouth pulled a face gulped some coffee down and sat back necroscope oh come come said turchin what am i a child i have met and talked with nathan kiklu who trask calls keogh son of the original necroscope and every time that ive passed you in the corridor or seen you in the distance ive felt that i was seeing him again no youre not him not anything like him but the feeling persists with liz merrick millicent cleary or john grieve i know im in the company of telepaths the bloom under their eyes gives them away and you what gives me away said jake you do turchin told him you have that quality not the bloom under your eyes no for thats lack of sleep or perhaps too much but its in your eyes certainly youve seen strange things jake cutter and the things you can do are stranger still jake shook his head im not buying that i look at myself and i see a man just a man surely i cant look all that different to you but you havent denied it said turchin and very well let me tell you last night i went to your room to talk to you you were out but the door was open jake nodded i forgot to lock it i understand said turchin doors are something you must forget about quite often considering you dont need them but let me go on i knocked entered saw the files dont worry i didnt read them but i did see what they were and i also know that ebranch has a fledgling necroscope so i left your room occupied my time with this and that and waited on your return when you didnt come back i thought to reenter your room er perhaps to glance but just a glance you understand at those files ah but there you were on the bed fully clothed just as i see you now and fast asleep well i did not want to disturb you but i am not without powers of reason jake and since you had left harrys room and returned to it without using the door two and two made four you had to be ben trasks new necroscope jake nodded and said he calls you an old fox turchin shrugged and offered a halfsmile but any fox who has even managed to grow old would have to be a very wise creature wouldnt you agree i suppose so jake answered he would have had to kill a whole lot of chickens along the way too again turchins shrug as he finished his food well such is politics but are you done eating jake pushed his plate away its tasteless he said with a grimace maybe i ate too well last night in paris in paris for a moment turchin didnt get it but then he did and his jaw fell open in paris an then i am right steak tartare said jake damn it was good jake please listen said turchin urgently as the necroscope refilled his coffee cup we must talk and seriously im listening said jake and turchin repeated his story the one hed told trask only two days ago so the problem is he finished off that while i now have the means to close down the perchorsk gate for ever under millions of tons of rock i do not have a means of delivering the weapon trask knows all of this he knows the time restriction too and i am sure that by now he would have requested your help in this matter if his mind was not concentrated on the evil that already exists but hes reluctant to tie my problems in with his own and fails to see the benefit of killing two birds with one stone er as it were he would prefer to seal perchorsk in his own time which is all very well but it still leaves me on the hook two birds with one stone said jake but i thought there were three of these enemies of yours three political or exmilitary types who are standing in your way turchin shook his head in anxious frustration but theyre only in my way in the sense that theyll put russia back thirty years and likewise dйtente and in your way in that the perchorsk gate will remain open and others will find out about it i still dont see it said jake if they go through that gate thats them gone theres no way back theyll no longer be of any concern no longer a threat to you thats only if they all go through together turchin answered and what if they take that entire criminal element that is now controlling perchorsk through with them and all of them armed to the teeth what then for nathan kiklus people and his vampire world yes these people would have to stay there and theyd probably rule there too i need to think it over said jake and in any case ill need trasks goahead which could take for ever the premier threw up his hands and time is short and we need to prepare i mean you need to prepare and i have to prepare you prepare mejakes eyes had narrowed turchin nodded you need to know where the weapon is and you need to know how to prime it do you know the layout of the perchorsk complex no then you need to know that too so that you can position the weapon to best effect myself i see these things clearly but ben trask he sees only the need to revenge himself for what these invader creatures did to his wife jake scowled and said sophistry eh said turchin who didnt know the word jake on the other hand knew it only too well in connection with korathoncemindsthrall a word game fallacious reasoning a plausible but deceptive fallacy and a perfect example of the pot calling the kettle grimyarse he said i dont follow turchin looked baffled you talk about trask and revenge said jake who accepted the principle of revenge well enough but at least trask has a real reason for doing what hes doing hes saving the lives of people perhaps all of us while youre planning to kill men for political reasons again turchin threw up his hands if thats how you see it then i cant any longer argue with you ill stay in england as a defector my enemies if not the three who know about perchorsk then others will take control in russia and the world will go to hell when more vampires come through from starside jake shook his head that isnt going to happen it seems that nathan has won the war on starside so ben trask has informed me turchin gave the impression of shugging it off ah but as weve discovered history has a nasty habit of repeating itself this wouldnt be the first time trask misjudged or underestimated the dangers of the vampire world jake had to agree you have a point he said yes i have the premier snapped and the point is will you let the gate stand open or will you close it for good its out of my hands now the problem is all yours i have the package and you can make the delivery but unless we work together the status quo and a very unsatisfactory status quo at that will prevail at least until were toppled into a worldwide disaster you sound just like korath said jake who oh an old friend of mine he was even more dangerous and much more convincing than you but hes been neutralized made safe well more or less turchin stood up were getting nowhere and im expecting a message from my people back home twentyfour hours after the message comes it could be too late to put my plan into action if youre able to contact trask i would like to suggest you do so now and see what he says about all this im waiting for trask to contact me said jake but like i said ill think over what youve told me well then for goodness sake think quickly said turchin first ill be finishing my coffee said jake then ill talk to john grieve and then ill think about it huh turchin snorted then turned and walked away jake took the elevator back up to ebranch hq and called in at the duty office after telling john grieve what had transpired he asked for his advice what do you reckon i knew trask and turchin had something going grieve told him but i wasnt too sure what it was not until now i did do interpreter on an iffy telephone call from turchin to trask but even with my talent it wasnt entirely clear what was going down i can well understand however why trask hasnt reached a decision yet it seems a very risky business what does said jake whose mind was already wandering in other directions ehsaid grieve frowning what does are you kidding and again he inquired are you sure youre feeling okay jake i mean doesnt it speak for itself exploding a nuclear device on someone elses territory now tbats what id call a risky business oh that said jake feeling foolish i thought you were talking about the other stuff him wanting to show me the bomb telling me how to prime it checking out the schematics for the perchorsk complex that sort of stuff the frown lifted from grieves face but slowly well as for the latter you can do that any time you feel inclined we have schematics going right back to perchorsks early days we got some of it from zek foener a lot more from ian goodly and trask himself after they spent a little time there courtesy of turkur tzonov and a great deal more from harry and nathan unless thereve been any big changes we have the complete layout yes said jake looking at grieve no looking tbrougb him as the duty officer now realized for jakes eyes were on something else his eyes and mind both they werent here and feeling fully justified grieve broke one of ebranchs oldest rules and directed a telepathic probe straight into the necroscopes mind jakes shields were down strange memories stirring not his but some otbers and scenes unravelling in his mind the percborsk complex yes but schematics no not a bit of it no draughtsmans blueprint this but the real tbing better far than any chart or plan drawn to scale this actually was or it had been perchchorsk itself had been in harry keoghs time but as jake noun remembered it grieve saw it for himself that huge area above the perchorsk dam with its incredibly massive lead shielding the dam itself which powered the complexs turbines great spouts of water jetting out from the dam wall and curving down into the old river bed the road through the perchorsk pass with a slip road winding down the mountainous contours to the complexs entrance where great metal doors stood open on their rollers and a fluorescent glow from within bathed the walls of the ravine in a blue light grieve followed jakes thoughts tracked his thoughts and harry keoghs memories into the perchorsk complex but a mere complex more a labyrinth surely roughly circular in plan and six levels deep why it might easily house a thousand workers which it had in its heyday before the experiment backfired and fried so many of them evidence of that backfire was everywhere in a gently curving tubelike corridor floored with rubber tiles the ceiling and arching walls were scorched black great blisters were evident in the paintwork and in places where the external bedrock had melted the ceiling had buckled and fractured letting molten rock squeeze through to solidify in great ugly lava blobs on the cooler surfaces of inner walls the rubber floor tiles had burned right through to naked metal plates many of which were buckled out of alignment in the first moments of the accident blowback meltdown whatever this area of the outer perimeter must have felt like a pressure cooker proceeding rapidly along the corridor grieve saw that a number of lesser conduits leading inwards like spokes from the principal corridor were hung with triangular radiationwarning signs or whiteonblack skullandcrossbones discs these were nogo areas hot spots where radioactivity was so intense as to be lethal so the heat here had been more than merely thermal indeed it had been an entirely different kind of heat as that thought occurred not to grieve but to jake and through jake to grieve so it conjured an instantaneous wrenching shift in locations to perchorsks magmass levels and grieve found himself drifting down a wide heavybeamed wooden staircase into a region of sheer fantasy where on every hand he peered into the dim recesses of a maddening confusion a weird chaos the lighting was only poor here perhaps deliberately so for what little could be seen was very disquieting and even frightening down through a tangle of warped plastic fused stone and blistered metal grieve passed where amazingly consistent smoothbored tunnels some two to three feet in diameter wound and twisted like giant wormholes through old timber except they cut through solid rock and crumpled steel girders and grieve knew even as jake knew that something some vast force had attempted to bring about an alien homogeneity here had tried to bring everything together in one similar form or else to deform it utterly it wasnt so much that the various materials had been fused by great heat and fire rather they seemed to have been foldedin like the banded ingredients of marbled cake or multitextured plasticines in some monstrous childs hands and grieve saw that it was getting worse beneath the timbers of a level walkway the floor was chaotically humped and anomalous where many different materials had so flowed into each other as to become unrecognizable in their original forms and through all the solid mass of this earthly yet unfamiliar material those irregular wormholeenergy channels ran like the indiscriminate burrows of rockboring crustaceans in the sea but on a gigantic scale now grieve found himself moving toward a dark region which he knew that he wouldnt much like but because jake had to look so did the telepath either that or break off contact at once but this guided tour as it were was so morbidly fascinating that grieve stayed with it and a moment later wished he hadnt for in a warped nightmarish cavern like a lunatics dream of hell suddenly he saw that metal plastic and rock were not the only materials that had fused together inseparably in the uncontrolled blast of alien energy that had wrecked the perchorsk project no for there had been men scientists down here too pompeii must look somewhat similar to this if only from a limited and perhaps paleontological viewpoint that of someone examining fossils but at least the tortured figures at pompeii had remained recognizably human not twisted compressed elongated or even reversed with all of their organs visible on the outside but such were the moulds in the magmass at which point the duty officer had had enough seated upright behind his desk grieve snapped back in his chair cut himself free from jakes mind like a piece of suddenly released elastic and jesus he said jesus and no sign of the exarmy officer the ohsophlegmatic english gentleman now you you you know that place he said and returned to the present of his own accord jake nodded yes he answered wonderingly his eyes wide and staring yes i do and i know the coordinates too was it in the filesgrieve pulled himself together it must have been in those files something of it jake answered but not like that that was the real thing little by little i seem to be remembering thats all remembering what harry knew it has to be said jake and then he too pulled himself together dont waste your time trying to figure it out john myself i gave up on that a long time ago anyway you said you wanted me to see something that came in overnight at which the duty officer opened a drawer and handed jake a decoded copy of the minister responsibles memo to ben trask news from porton down the end of things jake remembering at a bulgarian service stationcumrestaurantandrestrooms midway between topolovgrad and jambol still following the tundza in a direction due north ben trask and his task force had paused to take refreshment and dust themselves off the sun was high in a blue sky and the day had turned quite warm it was trasks best opportunity to read the minister responsibles deciphered message without the constant interruptions of the minibuss jarring motion or so he had reckoned but as for interruptions as his party sat down at a wooden table with a sun umbrella in the restaurants beer garden overlooking the river a waiter bustled into view and inquired do we having a mr trask trask answered im trask is there something telephone said the other smiling i having the number you should please be calling er a mr burdur trask looked at the others and said ali bey it could be important order something for me will you and then he followed the waiter indoors to the telephone burdur was waiting for the call the phone at the other end was snatched from its cradle at the first ring and mr trask ben is it you burdurs voice trask sensed his excitement yes what is it he said ben last night another vehicle stolen being seen heading toward border post i thinking this your er quarry good said trask do we have the make and number the number yes said burdur and trask quickly scribbled it down as for the make it is unmistakable forgetting the make my friend because you are certainly knowing this vehicle when you seeing it knowing it at once immediately it is the big black hearse a hearse trask repeated the inspector and pictured the vehicle in his minds eye a long broad black car indeed a limo with benchlike seats in the back for the pall bearers and windows curtained in black velvet such a conveyance would be ideally suited certainly to the needs of malinari vavara and szwart and it would be just spacious enough if a little cramped for their recent recruits the girls from the vampirized cruise ship then again if that troupe had been in any way diminished there would be more than sufficient room ben burdurs voice came again ben trask did you hearing me it is the funeral vehicle this stolen car i heard you trask nodded if only to himself a hearse and very much in keeping too i wishing you luck my friend said burdur then and i hoping my problems are going with and here his voice sank low almost to a whisper going with the vampires i hope so too said trask goodbye goodbye burdur answered and trask heard his telephone handset go down back at the table in the beer garden after trask had told the others about his conversation with burdur finally he was able to read the minister responsibles message and at ebranch hq in london jake cutter necroscope was reading it at almost the same time trask just in from porton down where they have had every available microbiologist working on it since square one the following information their initial assessment was only partly correct large doses of plague bacteria will destroy these creatures but only after an extended period the first tests were carried out on incomplete samples such as the one you obtained from the eve star and that was where the error occurred tissue separated from a carrier succumbs much more readily and totally the sleepers we saw at bleakstone one of them was a lawyer and rather than suffer his threatened lawsuit the idiot psychiatrists let him go he is still at large the other sleeper when he began to react to our recommended agents was sent to porton down making him the perfect test medium sorry if i sound less than sympathetic toward him he is in any case alive but highly dangerous now and caged unfortunately however he is not the only one at porton down as you are aware the civil authorities are on this now and in the last twentyfour hours have discovered a great many more sleepers and worse here once again however we were mistaken in our understanding of the problem some of the sick people weve discovered have not slept at all while others slept only after considerable amounts of time had passed since they were in the citys underground system where we must presume they contracted their conditions worst of all we now have our first cases of forgive me if i still refuse to use what must eventually become the official term transmission human to human they are biting ben and passing this thing on and not only in the uk ive been in contact with our australian friends and they are reporting cases too also mr papastamos has voiced his further suspicions about krassos i can only assume that eventually we shall hear from turkey and wherever else you are obliged to pursue the instigators but pursue them and destroy them you must for they are the source of this scourge finally with reference to note above until now we had thought we were safe with our anti pasteurella pestis shots this is no longer the case the presence of the antidote in your bodies may well deter the enemy but it wont stop him and it certainly wont incapacitate him moreover with regard to those shots they werent always reliable quite apart from the defective batches perhaps twenty per cent of people treated dont have a reaction they simply dont take the easy way to check is to think back and ask yourself did my shot raise an itchy blister and leave a tiny scar if it didnt then it didnt take and your blood is pure and delicious thats all for now i have nothing else for you if you have anything for me be careful how you deliver it not all of the world is as stable as we like to believe we are good hunting m res trask read it again this time out loud albeit in muted tones so that he wouldnt be overheard and slowly the implications began to dawn on him and on the others those of them who were still seated at the table wheres liz he asked then noting her absence and inclining her head toward the river bank millie said shes behind those trees there she wanted a little privacy in order to contact jake and here they come right now what said trask frowning as he glanced in the direction millie had indicated i dont see anyone neither do i millie answered matching frown for frown i dont see them but i do hear them shes no longer alone and as liz and jake came into view paul garvey looked at millie and said damn youre good but still frowning she didnt answer him they all greeted jake in as reserved a manner as possible and he took a seat with them liz had obviously explained something of the situation to him because the first thing he said was so youre hot on the trail again he sounded something less than enthusiatic about it very hot said trask and its time we weaponed up not here but in some quiet layby a little further up the road if you ride with us youll have the coordinates without having to rely on liz right said jake dully is something wrong liz said she wanted to read him but knew better he had asked that she respect his privacy before and anyway his shields were up in force but why were they up in the presence of so many friends in the next moment liz knew why guessed something of it at least when suddenly jake said did you get the minister responsibles memo trask nodded oh we got it he said grimly the world is going up in flames and all weve got is a bucket of water well at least were no longer alone slowly but surely everyone is going to have to be put in the picture and who can say maybe they should have been told right from the start jakes tone and expression hadnt changed as now he said so youve read about the shots then wanting them to know he dropped his shields and looked at liz millie and paul garvey since it was an invitation they looked and saw what was on his mind millie turned pale in a moment but in the next she said it still doesnt prove a thing jake and liz took his hand and told him dont even think it dont think what trask growled knowing that something was very wrong here jake opened his mouth to speak but millie at once cut him off and said jake let me tell him shaking his head he answered im the one who could have a problem so its my place to talk about it but youre not the only one who might have it she said and as simply as that a great weight was taken from his shoulders the weight of loneliness of being on his own for he knew what she meant which until now hed scarcely considered what the bell is everybody talking about the old lidesci snapped and trask said for pitys sake spit it out millie looked him straight in the eye and said those jabs or shots or whatever and the itching blisters theyre supposed to raise well mine didnt and nor mine said the necroscope finally trask saw the truth of it and supposed hed understood what they were saying all along but hadnt dared admit it not even to himself and even now now that it was out in the open he didnt intend to let it interfere with what they were doing here so whats that supposed to mean he blustered what does it change eh nothing so you believed you had a small measure of protection and now its gone so what nothing can guarantee complete protection against these ugly bastards thats not it ben said millie not all of it but only a small part of it and you know it and that was true too after she and jake had taken their first trip together in the mobius continuum theyd been informed of their immunity as a result of the shots theyd had jake in australia and millie in london that had given them peace of mind but now now it appeared their shots had been invalid likewise their peace of mind and probably everyone elses trask sank down in his chair a little also in his soul and said jake whats the damage have you checked it out jake nodded on my way here he said it didnt take any time at all not in the mobius continuum i stopped at a futuretime door looked through it saw my blue thread winding out of me into tomorrow and said trask and i dont know jakes hands made an ambiguous gesture my threads still blue but the taint the red stain i couldnt be sure it might have gained a little ground there isnt any sure way i can measure it well you were sure enough that you felt safe to come here to us liz burst out clutching at his arm and ian goodly said you didnt actually go in through the door did you you didnt venture into the future no jake shook his head i accept now that you know what youre talking about you and harry keogh both whats the good of looking for trouble if you can avoid it exactly said the precog no good at all but of course there is a way to put your mind at rest once and for all said millie or if not yours then mine at which trask knowing what she meant immediately came in with weve tried that once and it proved absolutely nothing and now for all that his voice was rough there was fear in it and even desperation but that was then said millie and enough time has gone by that it might be worth checking again i was trapped down in that underworld a lot longer than jake so its far more likely i would get infected than him another short trip in the mobius continuum with jake could put everyones mind at rest we could go take a look through that futuretime door again this time paying particular attention to my thread and if im still in the clear then surely jake must be at which goodly uttered a small inarticulate cry and rocked back in his chair which promptly gave way beneath him he went sprawling and garvey closest to him was quickly at his side helping him to sit up what is it trask was next to kneel beside the dazed precog what did you see goodly shook his head as if to clear it blinked at garvey and trask managed to get to his feet millie helped steady him into her chair and trask sat down beside him with his hand on the precogs arm you saw something i know you did he said what was it ian whats the future got in store for us now slowly the dazed disoriented look left goodlys face and he gripped trasks hand tightly but before he could speak the waiter came running with a tray of sandwiches and drinks ah the accident he said putting the tray on the table i am seeing it the faulty chair i am so sorry its okay trask told him hell be okay and when the waiter had left ian you did see something right yes goodly nodded still visibly shaken i saw the end of things ben i saw what was what was probably the end of me naturally pale now the precog was as sallow and sallower than trask and his people had ever seen him his face as gaunt as a funerary mask stripped of its gold the end of things trask repeated him of you what are you trying to say ian describe what you saw there were other tables out on the lawn a number of travellers had seen goodlys fall and were beginning to look interested in trasks team in these strange seriouslooking people at the crowded table we should take the food and leave said liz too many of these people are starting to wonder about us i can hear them me too said millie over there that group of four its a bulgarian policeman and his family the man doesnt much care for foreigners hes off duty right now but hes thinking about coming over and checking us out anyway things could get complicated damn it to hell trask muttered okay leave some money and well go moneysaid garvey looking at liz and millie curiously but without putting a strain on his illmatched features you mean bulgarian money we havent changed our turkish lira yet and paying in plastic will only slow us down but now the waiter was back and he saw trask staring at a bundle of turkish banknotes in his hand is good he said at once taking the notes counting off some small denominations and handing the wad back is no problem the exchanging thanks said trask giving him a little extra and in a few breathless moments which seemed to take as many hours they managed to bundle the precog out of the beer garden and across the parking lot to the minibus paul garvey drove with jake and liz sitting alongside and the others in the back and again trask asked goodly now can you tell us what that was all about ian what knocked you off your chair like that the end of things that sounds pretty ominous to me what exactly did you see exactly said the precog more in control of himself now it doesnt work like that ben not always anyway we were in a dark place or maybe not so much dark as confined to me it came over as dark as to what i saw oh i saw things all right but there were sounds too and even though it was jumbled it was all so real that i could almost almost smell them them trask grasped his arm the wamphyri goodly nodded but especially him malinari go on trask urged him i promise not to interrupt and the precog began telling what he remembered of it it was dark and enclosed or that was my perception of it but dont rely on that it could be figurative or symbolic i sensed that we were all there together wherever in close proximity but so were the wamphyri all three of them what about those sounds said trask his promise already forgotten what did you hear screams said the other from not too far away but distorted by by angles shapes anyway they were death cries ben the sounds of people dying in agony it was like like the gloom was alive but alive with death it sounds insane i know that but thats how it felt as if we were trapped in an unlit madhouse and all the maniacs running loose go on said trask as goodly paused to moisten his lips then things quickly changed said the precog glancing at liz and jake in the front seats there was gunfire but not ordinary gunfire it was loud deafening devastating malinari had liz she was struggling with him desperate to get away and where was i said the necroscope turning to stare at goodly wideeyed and apprehensive was i there at all you were there and you werent said goodly whatjake snapped fearful for liz his anger was mounting what the fuck is that supposed to mean either i was or i wasnt and if i wasnt then where the hell else would i be dont take it out on me jake goodly threw up his hands i didnt see it all and what i did see happened in i dont know in a weird fastmoving kaleidoscopic fashion its so easy to confuse the order of things i mean you cant read the future like a book the chapters can get all tangled and occasionally the first few pages come last jake calmed down and said go on anyway tell us more i i think szwart had got you trapped said the precog that was before you before you werent there you mean hed taken me somewherejake was frowning trying hard to understand maybe goodly answered maybe thats it i think so but i dont know it was all gunfire madness and mayhem like a very bad dream mentally exhausted he sighed and slumped down in his seat but they werent finished with him yet hey ian said paul garvey keeping his eyes on the road how did i figure in all this i know you were there said goodly and i think you were in some kind of trouble but thats all im sorry oh great said the telepath with a shiver in his voice and is that it said trask thats about it goodly answered the only other thing i remember is malinari again he called me a scryer laughed at me and said that for all my alleged talent i hadnt seen any of this coming i think he may have been bleeding but nothing too serious and he slopped some of his blood on me i think he hit me with something but hit or maybe bit i just dont know and after that darkness and then nothing nothing at all i must have passed out and thats when i toppled my chair christ said trask under his breath but jake wanted to know when you say szwart took me is that figurative or symbolic too or are you really saying im not going to survive this you cant ask me things like that jake goodly shook his head im sorry but i wont secondguess the future when said trask tonight tomorrow any idea at all i cant be precise said the other but it would have to be soon yes it would have to be very soon and lardis silent until now said was i there precog goodly looked at him and said yes all of us were there and now the old lidesci spoke to jake son ive liked you from the beginning you remind me of the other necroscopes oh youre different yet youre the same too the dead asked favours of them but apparently the dead dont know you as well as they knew harry nathan and the dweller so its me the living asking a favour of you now since youre the one who stands the most chance of surviving whats coming promise me this if you do get out alive youll tell my lissa how ive always loved her and always will for thats the way it is isnt it what weve done in life well continue to do in death but no one needs die ian goodly suddenly piped his normally highpitched voice even higher shriller we can bring it all to a halt right now turn around go back the way we came oh said trask grimly and is that the way it works did i really hear you say that ian you of all people the precog himself the one who has always insisted that what will be has been and what has been seen will be or is this sheer desperation and in the front of the vehicle paul garvey said we cant turn back now in any case weve already managed to arouse this fellows suspicions more than enough what said trask what do you mean whose suspicions looking out of the rear window millie answered for garvey and said its the policeman from the restaurant him and his family theyre behind us in that beatup volkswagen and hes still wondering about us i dont have my passport said jake and even if i did it wouldnt be franked time you were gone from here trask told him if we get stopped well plead ignorance about you lets face it if this nosy bastard counted seven of us and it turns out theres only six well obviously he miscounted okay said jake ducking down a little in his front seat but the next time you have liz call me make sure its a secure location and ill bring the weapons with me thats agreed said trask and however things go it will be before nightfall and now youd better get out of here that cars starting to overtake understood said jake crouching down a little more into a mobius door that hed conjured under the minibuss dashboard turning around as his body disappeared he looked up at liz who bent to kiss his face then she drew back as he passed beyond sight and much like the cheshire cat in alice the last thing to go was jakes halfgrin halfgrimace the ancient volkswagen drew up alongside and began to overtake its driver looking across frowning at paul garvey in the minibuss drivers seat garvey looked back at him pulled over a little waved him on and the car passed by accelerated and began to pull away ease off but gently trask told garvey let him go and millie said its okay hes satisfied that were not quite as weird and suspiciouslooking as he first suspected so jake neednt have left us said liz regretfully but trask relieved that hed gone told her its just as well we must be a big enough presence in the psychosphere without having jake along anyway and as ian has pictured it for us ohsographically jake will be with us for the big one at least part of the time anyway the big one growled lardis then i can remember another time when you knew a big one was coming trask nodded that was on sunsidestarside he said gloomily but then he brightened and added we didnt stand a snowballs chance in hell then either but we came through it and the precog said id be obliged if everyone would forget what i said about turning back youre quite right ben it was fear desperation i panicked and felt like a cornered rat i was instinctively looking for a way out despite that i know it doesnt work that way what i saw is how it will be maybe sooner than you think said liz from the front come again said trask up ahead said liz on a heading just a little bit east of north perhaps i dont know twentyfive or thirty miles in front of us thats where they are youre right said millie her eyes shuttered eyelashes fluttering and her brow furrowed in concentration its them all right and theyve stopped moving what said trask utterly perplexed what the hell is it with you two are you suddenly locators or what maybe its because weve done so much work in tandem liz answered looking back and that could be it said millie but whatever it is were definitely getting good at it and paul garvey at the wheel said i can see ill soon be out of business just a secondrater compared to you ladies at which trask felt a sudden chill a sure sign or symptom of his talent in action but he didnt know where it had come from or what it meant all he knew was that there was a truth here somewhere and that he shouldnt have missed it but he had perhaps because he really didnt want to recognize it in jambol there was a major y junction with roads heading off in both northwest and northeasterly directions this wasnt a problem liz and millie were as one in their decision and when garvey linked with them telephathically he readily agreed their choice of route the northeast fork it is he said trask looked at his map and said karnobat eh lardis lidesci grunted whats that you say the name of a town trask told him and it fits right in with the distance liz specified karnobat said garvey still driving not only that but its pretty descriptive too a carnivorous bat in fact three of them well thats where they are said liz and millie together and as for their mindsmog theyre not even trying to hide it they have to be laying a trail for us its as simple as that ian trask turned to the precog you said it was dark in your forecast i mean i said it felt dark said the other but that might have been my interpretation the colour of my mood the sheer terror that the vision inspired in me well to me dark is dark said trask so whatever it was will probably happen at night thats how i have to reckon with it youll excuse me goodly answered with an audible shudder in his voice if i dont want to reckon with it at all personally id like to forget it and you also said it would be soon trask reminded him but i cant say how soon said the precog it could easily be tonight said garvey without looking back suggestion even if we cant let jake stay with us right now it would be a good idea to weaponup asap thats already agreed said trask also assuming that millie and liz are right about the wamphyri calling a halt somewhere in front i think we should slow down and approach them with a bit more caution they could be resting up for the night ahead its possible that what ian saw was their plan coming to fruition so while i know the futures immutable that isnt to say we should ignore it completely forewarned is forearmed so then said liz if were also assuming theyre asleep right now er hitting the hay while the sun shines theres no reason why we shouldnt call on jake to deliver our weapons at our very next opportunity like in that copse thats coming up on our side of the road millie finished it for her and trask leaned forward tapped garvey on the shoulder and said pull over paul well make camp here finish those sandwiches we never got to start and take a decent break frankly im bone weary i didnt sleep much last night i dont think any of us did and weve all been shaken about in this rattletrap until were numb from head to toe an hour or twos sleep will do us all the world of good by which time garvey had pulled off the road and driven on deep into the copse finally drawing to a halt where a bank of dense brambles hid the minibus from view climbing stiffly out of the vehicle trask said boys and girls take a break as for me nature calls and i must answer but before that he took liz aside and told her liz ive had second thoughts about jake delivering those weapons now i know how much you love him but the time isnt right you know as well as i do that in daylight we have nothing to fear that means we dont need those guns just yet but she began to protest only to have trask wave her protests aside unspoken no buts he told her look at it this way weve already aroused one policemans suspicions what if we were stopped for some reason or had a breakdown or something what and the minibus loaded down with guns thered be no explaining it and if those three monsters are asleep we dont want to go disturbing their dreams with jakes psychic aura its a bit of a paradox i know but on the one hand were too close to them to call him in and on the other were too far away well need jake in our darkest hour and not before then so love has to wait then before going off into the trees he called out to the others ill be back shortly meanwhile i suggest you take it easy make yourselves as comfortable as possible and liz walked off on her own a short distance sat on the knotted stump of a felled mediterranean pine and despite knowing that trask was right tried not to sulk an hour earlier at ebranch hq in london jake had taken charge of the canvas sackful of arms that john grieve had put together for him then while waiting for liz to contact him again hed returned to harrys room where he was reading through the final batch of keogh files including ben trasks report on harrys departure from this world when gustav turchin knocked on his door what is it now he asked the russian premier after inviting him in turchin was in a highly agitated state that message i was waiting for has arrived he said time is running out i need your decision now i cant give you a decision said jake without admitting that hed completely forgotten about turchins problems in favour of his own its not my decision to give but its likely ill be seeing ben trask in just a little while and i promise you ill mention it to him then the one thing i can tell you theres no need to worry about perchorsks schematics i i believe ive sort of memorized them what turchin frowned youve memorized them since you and i last spoke and from those files is ebranchs intelligence really so good then jake smiled a crooked smile and answered yes it really is and i well i suppose im a quick study turchin had to accept it as the truth there wasnt a lot he could do about it if it wasnt and so he said very well then all that remains for me to do is show you where the bomb is and instruct you in arming the thing i take it the bomb is in russia said jake just how do you plan to take me there whatnow turchin looked confused but surely you would be taking me you are the necroscope you have the use of this this mobius continuum thing you dont know much about it do you said jake i know nothing at all about it turchin snapped i only know what ive seen that when nathan kiklu came to see me he emerged out of nowhere and that when he left he simply disappeared him and a lean slavering wolf out of starside that he called his nephew what should i know about mobius continuums gateways and necroscopes with wolves of the wild for kin im a politician not a bloody magician coordinates said jake calmly i cant go where i have never been because i dont know the coordinates im not talking about map coordinates or grid references they mean nothing to me im talking about coordinates that i keep up here in my head he reached up to tap his temple which means that since ive never been to russia im afraid i cant take you there i suppose we could do it by trial and error taking small mobius jumps one at a time but that could be dangerous and it would take time and im expecting ben trasks call which could come in the next ten minutes so youd better think again this is infuriating turchin threw up his hands at this very moment my enemies could be on their way to perchorsk my one chance to settle with them for good and the perfect opportunity to close the gate at the same time and trask is unavailable to me he promised his help i kept my part of the deal and he has let me down is there no honour maybe among thieves said jake but apparently not among murderers havent i told you it wouldnt be murder turchin snapped these are mad dogs i want rid of not true and honest citizens they are dogs jake and theyre shitting all over our world i gave ben trask the information that has sent your locator david chung out on his mission to save the ocean deeps from pollution to save your british fishing grounds the american coastline and all the waters in between i have made myself an outcast a defector to come here and bring you people warnings and important information i sent a man of mine out of russia into sicily to get himself killed seeking out luigi castellano so that you personally could take revenge have you forgotten these things these are the sacrifices that i have made so dont you talk to me of personal revenge for what of yourself and ben trask ah but that is different eh well i think not and why should i be excluded which gave jake pause not only what turchin had said about revenge but more especially what hed said about sending a man out of russia into sicily and sending him to his death georgi grusev had been his name and hed come out of his tomb to save jakes life in the cellars of castellanos stronghold and jake really had forgotten about all that in the light of more recent problems forgotten about it until now georgi grusev he said yes turchin nodded he was dead before you got to castellano you never met him but that doesnt alter the fact that he did try to help you oh but i did get to meet him said jake quietly he was dead youre quite right but still he got to help me and i owe him which i suppose means that i owe you turchins dark eyes lit up at once and he said youll do it then thats something i cant promise jake answered i dont know which way trask will move on this but we should certainly try to prepare for it one things for sure a nuclear explosion in perchorsks guts would very definitely close the gate turchin threw his head back and drew a deep breath common sense at last he sighed good so how do we go about it how do we use this mobius continuum thing jake shook his head and said the continuum isnt a thing as such but a place in fact its not even a place its everyplace everywhere and anywhen eh what i can use the mobius continuum to go anywhere jake tried to simplify it but i have to know where im going so wheres the bomb until i know that i cant do anything turchin licked his lips and said and so we get to it the location of the bomb is of course a secret if it gets out if the wrong people should get to know what ive done or even the right people then im finished but very well the bomb is at my dacha in zhukovka not far out of moscow zhukovka jake knew of the place hed been reading of it in the keogh files there are several dachas on a pinecovered hillock overlooking the moscow river youre not the first head of russias ebranch to have a dacha there gregor borowitz had one too he died there when boris dragosani murdered him but there the necroscope paused and frowned because turchins mouth had gradually fallen open while he was speaking now snapping his mouth shut the russian premier said but this is astonishing and indeed trasks intelligence is amazing gregor borowitzs place stood deserted until i took it over and refurbished it yes yes i have the very same dacha at which jakes head began to whirl and as if suffering an attack of vertigo he swayed dizzily where he sat on his bed as suddenly out of nowhere he remembered remembered remembered transitions gregor borowitz s dacha oh jake remembered it all right but now that he had this thing in proper perspective now that he knew definitely that these werent his memories at all but the original necroscopes and even though these paramnesialike attacks still brought about spells of temporary disassociation and giddiness in him he was finally able to accept them for what they really were which meant that he was no longer apprehensive about them and so was able to learn from them borowitzs dacba was fashioned in a style that gave it the looks of nothing so much as an austrian or swiss chalet approaching the timbered singlestorey structure along a winding pebble pathway jake occasionally glimpsed the sluggish swirl of the moscow river down below where borowitz had delighted in fishing illegally for stateowned speckled trout leading off from the track the path to the rustic oakpanelled door was paved in stone pausing uncertainly under the projecting eaves hesitating because something had warned him that what waited inside wasnt very pleasant jake sniffed at the fragrant blue woodsmoke from nearby dachas it hung in the bittercold air as if frozen there and he could almost feel the hairs crackling in his nostrils but of course for it had been winter when harry came here the door stood slightly ajar bracing himself jake entered passed along a short dark corridor through bead curtains into a small pinepanelled room at one side of the room under curtained windows that let in a little light natasha borowitz lay silent in her shroud in a polished pine coffin on a low padded bench gregors wife for many years she bad died naturally but at the other side of the room seated upon a couch the old general himself bad not died naturally jake stared at him and gregor borowitz stared back through unseeing glassy pusdripping eyes he sat there upright dead as a doornail showing all the signs of a massive heart attack and indeed be bad suffered one but it hadnt been natural the wallachian necromancer boris dragosani bad done this to him smote him with his evil eye in order to learn all the secrets of the then soviet unions ebrancb but jake bad seen more than enough be hadnt needed to see any of this except to confirm what be had already known that indeed be possessed the coordinates of the dacba at zhukovka he came out of itreturned to the here and nowwith a small cry not of fear but of amazement for suddenly it was plain to him that whatever harry had known he could know all it required was that someone press the right button stir the memories and set the mechanism ticking harrys legacy would do the rest and jake jake would know what is it said gustav turchin plainly concerned what happened just then your eyes your face you were somewhere else just for a moment why i thought you were someone else he was standing beside the necroscope staring down at him his hand on jakes shoulder and borowitzs dacha said jake looking up at him you did say that its yours now yes said turchin that rundown old ruin i had to have it refurbished my niece is staying there now what about it i know the coordinates said jake what the premier gave his head a puzzled shake how can that be you said youd never been there but i know ive known someone who has jake answered and ive only just remembered ah no said the premier wagging a finger no jake i saw what you did just then it could only have been telepathy you were talking to someone else someone who knows well something like that said jake but in fact i was seeing through someone elses eyes anyway i know the coordinates so then turchin was elated we can go there but can we do it now this very minute jake shook his head no he said but when i go back to trask and the team in bulgaria ill take you with me then you can plead your own case and you think that will be soon before nightfall im sure nightfall in bulgaria is two hours ahead of us said turchin correct so then in maybe four hours time or whenever trask calls said jake shrugging and you can hear trask when he calls turchin was finding himself swamped in ebranch talents i mean is be a telepath too my god no wonder you have left us behind jake saw no reason to deceive him however and said its liz merrick who calls to me she and i we have this thing but turchin held up his hands and said say no more i can only take so much very well ill go back to my room and wait but very impatiently dont forget me when liz merrick when she calls for you my word on it said jake a little less than an hour later jake finished reading the last of the keogh files titled but unnumbered he had read them out of order or in whichever order they came to hand and this final file was ben trasks report on the janos ferenczy affair that was when harry had fallen foul of faethor ferenczys deadspawn it was when he had been vampirized but now knowing the whole story jake also knew that harry had never surrendered to it hadnt succumbed to its inevitability he had been tempted oh yes but he hadnt given in and that was a fact that buoyed jake up gave him heart strengthened his resolve if just if the same thing should happen to him jake vowed that he would take his cue from harry no way jake cutter was going out without a fight to the finish as in life so in death he accepted that now but what of undeath and what of liz but these were morbid thoughts and jake wasnt about to go venturing down these roads either liz and millie they were his mainstays they were sure enough of him so why wasnt he but then they didnt feel the way he felt the weird alarming strength burgeoning in him and the thirst or was that just his imagination he put that thought aside too called for coffee and five minutes later david chung brought it on a tray davidjake said frowning as he stepped aside to let the locator in then watching him put the tray down on the computer console and pour black coffee into two mugs but i thought you were out chasing russian wreckers i was chung answered will be again in about an hours time when they pick me up our chopper developed a fault on the way out to torshavn in the faroes so we hobbled home to stornoway we were hoping to pick up our quarry coming down from the norwegian sea sort of harass him from the air let him know we were on to him give him the chance to turn around and go home and so avoid an international incident but thats out now so i got a lift down to edinburgh airport and flew in from there tonight well be back on the trail again this time in a coastguard chopper out of glasgow well be looking for our boy out near rockall if hes got that far by then but its a bit of a needleinahaystack scenario he has a load of antidetection devices on board ill be picked up from the roof by an mod chopper courtesy of the minister responsible jake was still frowning slow down a minute will you he said lets get this straight who are the we you keep talking about what kind of vessel is it that youre tracking and whats this rockall chung grinned we are the people who can bring the truth of the situation out into the open we can photograph this ship or ships providing incontrovertible evidence of what this lunatic in the russian navy is trying to do we can put down divers into the sea measure the radioactivity of this clappedout sub and ask what the hell its doing here when we were told it had been decommissioned and made safe ten years ago in the shipyards at severomorsk in the barents sea jake didnt quite follow and all of that without creating an international incident but it wont be for public consumption said chung the evidence will be delivered to heads of state including those in russias military hierarchy who havent been quite as forthcoming as gustav turchin and the hall will be firmly in their court the russians will then be given a time limit in which to clean up their act and if they dont the evidence against them will get a much wider release with very stiff sanctions brought to bear and what with their evercrumbling economy thats the one thing they can do without right now all nice and political said jake yes chung agreed and very effective as for the actual we the people involved in the operation well im the man they turn to when binoculars radio radar spotter planes and spy satellites dont work thats because i have this longtime hate affaire with radioactive materials my talent is that much better when im dealing with lethal radiations i thought it was drugs said jake that too chung shrugged poppies and plutonium pretty much the same to me and the others in your teamjake inquired naval intelligence said chung greenpeace a couple of highprofile ecological types a marine biologist and an american nuclear physicist so its that important said jake very important yes chung nodded you said ship or ships how many of these rogue vessels are there just the one the locator answered or rather just one on the surface but its the one below the surface that were really interested in youve lost me again said jake they have a special ship done out like an oceanic survey vessel said chung in the rear twin booms angle down into the sea with a cradle slung between them the sub sits in the cradle all unsuspected when they reach the spot where theyre going to dump it they scuttle the sub and release the cradle and down goes the baby cradle and all he made an attempt to sing the last few words and they told me elvis was dead said jake grimacing and chung said yes i know i should apologize right i never could sing worth a shit as for elvis his music is just as popular as ever you should talk to him some time tell him we havent forgotten jake put that aside and serious again said then theres this rockall its a rock in the sea a hundred and fifty miles west of saint kilda the locator answered but according to turchin its close to the route our wreckers will take rockall maybe they named it that way deliberately though personally i dont know why they bothered god knows theres rock all there humour again at a time when there was very little to laugh about and now for the first time jake got the feeling that the locators jokey attitude was hiding something else something a lot more serious behind that big grin he was nervous as a cat and whats going on david said jake quietly i mean you didnt take time out from this important stuff youre doing to come and spend a couple of minutes cracking me up so why did you come whats wrong chung looked at jake and gradually the nervous smile slid from his classically chinese face i dont know whats wrong he said i hoped that by coming here i might find out whats on your mind then said jake you are said the locator and to the exclusion of just about everything else explain said jake whats to explainsaid chung i mean how to explain its my talent jake it keeps pointing me at you at me jake didnt much like this at all like im some kind of radioactive source or maybe a heap of heroin what do you mean its pointing you at me just exactly like that said chung and yet not i mean youre there in the back of my mind always like a piece of me is an iron filing and youre the biggest magnet in the world and now jakes eyes narrowed mindsmog he said chung opened his mouth closed it looked away jake grabbed his arms turned the other back again and mindsmog he growled is that what youre saying no yes maybe said the other but thats always been there right from square one the moment you let korath into your mind except its worse now right said jake perhaps it is the locator gasped straining to free himself i cant be sure but it isnt just the mindsmog jake then what jake released him flopped backwards onto his bed if its not just the mindsmog what else listen said chung when i first met you the day you appeared here right here in harrys room for the first time i knew what you were knew that something of harry was here it was the same with nathan theres a certain something about all three of you as if you have your own psychic signatures different again from anything else i ever detected i mean trasks aura is scarcely noticeable only to those who know what he can do telepathic signatures are pretty much alike millie is like liz is like paul is very much the same as john grieve and its the same for locators any disturbance i cause in the socalled psychic aether will be very similar to what well to what bernie fletcher used to cause the only difference being that i was better at shielding myself but you yes said jake what about me and chung shook his head in a puzzled fashion yours isnt just a signature jake not any longer i mean its been growing you know i had an old hairbrush of harrys it was just a wooden oval full of hog bristles he reached into a pocket and produced a fourinch sliver of wood with a few bristles attached and said this is all thats left of it during the course of the last day or two its vibrated itself to pieces vibrated said jake but sure enough the broken fragment of hairbrush was thrumming in chungs hand shaking like a rattlers tail its my talent the locator explained in the dark ages they would have called it sympathetic magic its something of yours that connects me to you lets me know where and how you are when i take it in hand this is what it does its like a waterdiviners hazel fork he put the thing away but it isnt mine said jake it never has been thats right chung nodded but it was harry keoghs his influence over me is growing is that what youre saying hub jake snorted i could have told you that much without all of this but the locator shook his head i dont think its so much his influence over you as your strength as a necroscope youve become so much more than you were jake and the reason why the hairbrush shook itself to bits because every time i thought of you i couldnt stop from touching it thats how much you were on my mind and thats why i came back to see if everything was all right with you jake stood up sipped coffee that was starting to go cold and said everything is not all right with me im worried im very worried about me and i think all of you should be too chung looked at him standing there tall than he remembered and his hair white at the temples now and swept wolfishly back his hawkish nose and his lips so thin and cold but jakes eyes penetrating as they were thank god they were still a deep brown jake said chung then if anything has happened to you it wasnt your fault but ours when you first arrived here we could have let you go but it seemed youd be such an asset that that trask recruited me jake growled now that ive been involved and seen what were all up against i dont blame him nothing that has happened was his yours or my fault but harry keoghs he got me into this and hell get me out listen said chung backing toward the door when harry knew it was all over he did the right thing and before jake could answer he dipped into his pocket brought out the broken fragment of hairbrush lobbed it across the room jake snatched it from the air and said im not quitting david i know youre not the locator shook his head not without youre made to but youre like a dynamo jake and youre humming faster and faster louder and louder i wont need the hairbrush to find you from now on but but you may need it to find me ive had that old brush since harry left it bears my signature now if you just think of me im sure ill know it opening the door behind him he sidled out into the corridor why would i need youjake watched him go i know a thousand locations chung told him thats because im a locator theyre as fixed in my mind as your coordinates are in yours who can say the time might come when you want to go somewhere else why would you do this jake looked out into the corridor after him and chung called back we all loved harry jake but only ben trask had the opportunity to help him so now in the event things dont work out id like the chance to do my bit for me or for harry said jake as the locator headed for the duty officers room whats the difference said chung without looking back and finally best of luck necroscope a few miles west of karnobat in the mocurica hills lord malinari of the wamphyri stood in the dusty gloom of a circular room and looked out eastwards through a broken window the shadow of his tall crumbling refuge his vavaras and lord szwarts fell like a finger on the land outside a finger pointing east what are you looking at vavara was curious where she sat huddled in a dark corner away from the lances of sunlight that came slanting through knotholes in the westfacing wall im thinking he answered im considering our route out of all this what but as far as i can see there is only one way out she said and thats the same way we came in so then are you worried that were trapped here he shook his head this place is our trap vavara and im not thinking of our immediate exit but the one we shall be taking from burgas ah yes she said her eyes flaring in the semidarkness your great plan her sarcasm dripped like acid at least it wont get us seared half to death he snarled unlike yours which saw us adrift in an open boat unprotected when the sun came up the caique had a canopy she said we were mainly in the shade oh really malinari answered sneeringly mainly in the shade you say well as i recall we suffered grievously and in another hour or so if that vessel hadnt rescued us there would have been precious little left to shade indeed we would have been shades lost in the land of shades burned to cinders in a mutual true death and a very painful death at that well we survived she said our work has gone for nothing thanks mainly to you but we ourselves survived and i for one have learned a lesson from all of this several lessons one never to trust nephran malinari two never to let another great vampire into my manse not even of his own free will and three never to form alliances but to stay on my own even if its the death of me hah i would have been better off in starside but i let you talk me into coming here well i find this world loathsome all this sunlight and the nights so short if this plan of yours works i shall be very glad to see starside again and overjoyed to see the back of you the feeling is mutual i assure you said malinari scowling as he turned from the window and set the badly gapped floorboards groaning under his feet at which up in the rafters something stirred now see said vavara quietly putting up a hand to shield her crimson eyes from a trickle of dust youve disturbed lord szwart and as if to prove it why waste your time in argument came that wheezing rupturedbellows voice from roughly recently fashioned lungs and vocal chords as malleable as mud the sun is up and we should be down but vavara i have to agree with you this world is an abomination it is the light the terrible light theres altogether too much of it and there then said vavara under her breath are you listening malinari you should be for when one abomination condemns another youve simply got to take his word for it huh malinari grunted go to sleep both of you szwart wheezed wake me again when the sun is down and up there on a platform where rafters came together under the turret roof an oddly shaped flattened thing adjusted its outline to suit the space letting a flap of doughy protoplasmic matter hang like a sack over one edge for a moment a crimson eye formed and blinked open in the bulge of the sack stared down into the lofts dusty interior then shuttered itself and dissolved away hes right said vavara in lowered tones we should take respite then why dont you said malinari because when you are awake i like to be awake she answered then you must learn to trust me he said indeed for i need you yes and szwart too as much as both of you need me were all in this together vavara but when its over by all means lets be enemies again in it together aye she answered sullenly and all of us working to the same plan your plan thats what i dont like about it nephran malinari that were all following this scheme of yours but only you know the details so then lets be sure i have it right explain it once again if you will ah vavara malinari sighed you may not be tired but i am im tired of our cold war of running away from my enemies even of this earth which but for ebranch could have been oh a most wonderful place as for your distrust well im especially tired of that and when we are done here for yes i will explain it to you yet again then i at least shall take this opportunity to catch up on some sleep but im also hungry and so ill curl me up with those women down below perhaps sip a little here thrust a little there take a little and give some back you know and so slip off into pleasant dreams as you will said vavara what is that to me what were they but sluts in the first place kicking their legs and showing their breasts and buttocks and you a horny old vampire so go ahead be my guest suck what you must and fuck out your lust as that old starside saying goes but first yes i know malinari nodded and sighed again first my plan very well now listen the psychic aether is still now that means they are doing what we should be doing sleeping very wise of them they conserve their energies and a while ago i sent out a probe but a very gentle tentative probe to see if i might spy on their dreams without alerting them to my presence what dreams i discovered while yet they were vague were fraught with all kinds of terrors all manner of doubts and suspicions the much of which concerned ourselves of course other than that they were unclear muddied well all except for those of the girl liz she who was so very nearly yours on krassos her dreams were fresh as a breeze off sunside come drifting over the barrier mountains abbbb how very sweet and even intoxicating for she dreamed of her lover this jake cutter now vavara i know how it must pain you that she escaped your clutches on that island but in the end its for the best she shall be the lure for this jake he is a power hes like that one in sunside that szgany bastard who wrecked our every effort among the ruins of the old aeries for all we know hes still there doing battle with all that unpleasantness we left behind us our lieutenants our thralls and various monsters and so i ask you what good to return to a fight we cant win a fight we fled while the going was good no use at all not unless we return with superior weapons and what greater weapons than the ones this nathan brought to bear against us eh so then this man yes a mere man however unthinkable that may be this man who destroyed my garden under the pleasure dome in xanadu saved his companions from the funeral pyre i had prepared for them there and turned up yet again to ruin szwarts plans under london he is vulnerable he has a weak spot called liz vavara when she called for him in xanadu he came ben trask is ebranchs leader yes but jake cutter is his mainstay do you need proof of what i say do you think i have some ulterior motive do you doubt that this jake is the power that i have named him if so then ask yourself how this mere man invaded lord szwarts underworld which szwart himself thought impregnable and not only did he invade that secret place but he survived the explosion that destroyed it the sabotage that he brought about ah but he comes and goes in the blink of an eye this one he is there and he is gone just like nathan of the szgany and who can say what other skills he possesses we can say once we have him and when we return to starside his secrets will go with us stolen from his mind by me nephran malinari and each of us vavara you me and szwart alike all three of us with the zest and strength and tenacity of the wamphyri plus powers to match and outmatch nathan of the szgany just picture it we were losing the last bloodwar our battle with sunside but this time and he paused letting the question hang there and in a little while vavara said you paint pretty pictures nephran lets hope thats not all they are but in any case it will be worth it just to take possession of that girl again i had such plans for that pretty face of hers ahhh but remember said malinari hurriedly that she is to be the bait in the trap the lure to bring jake cutter out of hiding you may not harm her only damage her vampirize her and the game is over this jake kills vampires that is his purpose his reason for being yes and i am sure that he and ebranch would kill liz too if she were one of ours one of us and so hes in hiding then this jake cutter said vavara and does he hide from us not much of a threat there i think oh said malinari and did you see him on krassos no but he was there at the end i sensed him his signature its quite unmistakable and that girl liz you thought that she must be dead locked in the boot of your vehicle which you saw plunge into the sea after youd been thrown free now tell me this how do suppose she survived who do you suppose saved her i understand your reasoning vavara answered her voice purring now not from pleasure but from anticipation and vicious unnatural lust and you neednt fear on my account no for we shall make one last bargain you and i you shall have this jake cutter all according to your plan yes but the girl shall be mine in return i shall promise not to harm her at least not until were back on starside as for these powers which you say youll share with szwart and myself well make sure that you do only renege on your promise and youll have both of us on your neck you may have my measure nephran malinari but szwarts and the two of us together i doubt it so be it said malinari and with a slight bow from the waist he swept towards the timbered stairwell vavara watched him step down into the gloom below step by step lowering himself from view but just before he disappeared their scarlet gazes met and she read nothing in his thoughts to belie the things hed said and promised but then again he was malinari called malinari the mind and his mind was quite unique uniquely devious too and aye so be it vavara echoed him while doing her best to keep that thought and the next one to herself but let me down one more time and you may be sure it will be the last that is my vow nephran malinari mine and the vow of every creature yet to be invested with my many eggs i shall see to it but a little while later when she slept aye sleep malinari thought knowing that his thoughts at least were impregnable sleep vavara szwart and leave me to scheme in peace what you vavara with your hidden horde all waiting on your flesh to give them birth and you amorphous thing lord szwart you with your love of darkness and dread i should gift to such as you what is rightly mine no i think not i who bave discovered the truth of this jake will keep it for my own and ill use it to put all such as you from my sight in the past since time immemorial sunsidelstarside has suffered a surfeit of feuding lords and ladies too in excess of requirement just the one master nepbran malinari would have been sufficient and will be and then he sent out his mentalist probes once again this time to try and fathom something that was singular and strange beyond measure the fact that the ebranch signature was mutating growing stronger changing by the hour it could be of course simply that they girded themselves up preparing the way mentally for the effort to come the inevitable showdown or again perhaps it was that together in a group their talents were multiplied their metaphysical skills magnified whichever their shields were stronger certain of them anyway the girl liz and the other woman they were telepaths and their minds should be more easily accessible yet this was no longer the case in xanadus casino pleasure dome malinari had probed lizs mind sending her disinformation that caused her to fall into his trap alas but this was no longer possible even sleeping her shields were up and if her love dreams had not been so powerfully centred on jake cutter then malinari doubted his chances of reading anything of significance in them and likewise ben trasks woman this millicent she too had thrown up this this what this mental mist this fog against outside interference malinari could read the identities of these women and separate out their signatures both the women and the entire group but their minds were near closed as for trask himself he should be the easiest of all his mind knew the truth of things because truth was instinctive in him he was inclined to lay himself bare whether he willed it or not it went against his grain to cover anything up for incapable of accepting lies he found it irksome even odious to have to protect himself in that respect yet now he too was shielded and then there was that other that old unfathomable one whose signature was like woodsmoke that drifted this way and that disguising his identity and even his very being the last time malinari had come in contact with anyone like him had been on sunside during the hunt aye for the vampire worlds szgany were possessed of these selfsame skills well then perhaps he was a gypsy descendant of thralls out of sunside which left just two others the locator whose signature was new doubtless he was a replacement for that fool now dead in sirpsindigi and the one who scried on future times as for the latter oddly his signature had not changed at all neither his signature nor malinaris inability to comprehend its message there was nothing of the past there to hint of goodlys beginnings nothing of the present which might at least be indicative of current trends but only a swirl of inchoate halfformed images that failed to coalesce except when they occurred and they only occurred when they caught up with the future but even for goodly how could it be otherwise the future had ever been a devious thing three of these pursuers these avengers then had somehow been changed even four of them when one included jake cutter himself for while presently he remained distant in the purely physical sense still his aura his psychic signature was alive and more vibrant than ever in the psychosphere it was a puzzle with several possible solutions and malinari would be blind if he could not at least visualize one such but rather a fool than stretch his imagination to that extent surely for if that were so it would make a total nonsense of this chase and the leaders of ebranch would have far more important matters to attend to one of the girls stirred moaning in her sleep malinari reached out a hand to stroke her naked thigh and whisper calming words his leonine head lay in another thralls lap and he could smell her sex like a rare sweetmeat roasting in a starside oven for a moment he thought to have her even to have all of them but then thought again he might after all need his strength for what was still to come the trap he had laid for ebranch problems that might arise at perchorsk others that would very definitely arise later with vavara and szwart no it were better that he slept now while the cursed sun sank ever deeper in the west time to sleep recoup and dream of starside and all the time and the power still to come a time of conquest perhaps of two worlds and then of a vampire empire spanning both and powers beyond belief that would be his and his alone three hours later malinari woke up with a start sniffed at the air and sent a brief but powerful telepathic message stabbing in the direction of vavara and szwart darkness falls and they are coming then sensing his socalled colleagues stirring their mental awareness focusing malinari roused up the sleeping girls only six of them remained the others had been left for undead along the way known as vals vamps upon a time albeit in a very different world on a beautiful ship called the evening star now they were common vampires fending for themselves in turkey as for these others he doubted theyd be so fortunate and when the six were awake listen said malinari that time i warned of has come you know what you are what we have made you and also that the ones who pursue us will kill you if they can his words were greeted with sighs groans hisses of alarm naked flesh moved in the gloom they pulled on rags of clothing and stood up among the debris of rotten sacks and mouldy grain stood there like six strange dolls waiting for their puppeteer and their triangular eyes glowed a feral greenyyellow confirming their vampirethrall status they will kill you malinari said it again but only if you allow it ah but you are stronger now as dancers you were fit and strong and now even more so for our strength is yours given to protect you remember the blood is the life and likewise the strength if you would live and stay strong it is the only answer and these pursuers they are filled to brimming with good strong blood ahhhh came their reply their teeth gleaming white where oncesweet lips drew back turning their faces to sallow snarling masks now i go up to the others said malinari if our enemies get past you to us then we will know that you are dead but do well and you shall earn your freedom freedom aye to go out into the world and make it your own is all understood yesss lord came their answer in a concerted hissing as from one deadly throat very well said malinari good and now you must hide as best you can drape yourselves in those sacks there or merge with the shadows and cobwebs in dark corners wherever you may you should find it very easy for you are now and forever or for as long as you may live creatures of the night and so i leave you but you should know this that you have my blessing long may the night and the darkness be with you then as they melted from view and their feral eyes blinked out he went to the rickety stairwell and ascended to the uppermost level but in his black heart of hearts malinari knew that his blessing was a worthless blasphemy and also that the night and the darkness would not be with them for long tilting at a windmill almost unnoticeably the shadows had been creeping lengthening for an hour or more until finally they had merged into a smoky twilight in the minibus all conversation slight and muted as it had been had fallen off completely as evening drew in karnobat was just a mile or two ahead to the north a range of purple hills paralleled the road seeming to float on a fine mist traffic was very light and what few cars there were came up from behind flashed their lights pulled out and ghosted by in a weird silence even the clatter of the noisy engine seemed muffled and at the wheel ben trask was driving ever more slowly instinct telling him that they were very close now take the next left said millie suddenly alert where she sat beside trask theyre somewhere up in those hills then take the next left and stop grunted the old lidesci from the back of the vehicle just another halfmile and well be into that mist but there are mists and there are mists and i want to check this one out and now we should call for jake said liz her voice conveying the shivers that she felt despite that it wasnt at all cold we should definitely call for jake glancing back at her trask raised an eyebrow but said nothing indicating his intentions he turned left across the empty oncoming lane onto a rutted farm track bringing the minibus to a halt under a row of gnarled and ancient olive trees the mist coming down off the hills was thin here forming swirls of vapour about their ankles as they got out of the vehicle and stood in the gathering dusk with the light of day fading in the west millie was flushed liz too and trask inquired is everything okay with you two maybe the sun got to you youre looking a bit pink or perhaps simply rudely healthy that was a new one on lardis rudely healthy he queried is that when you fart a lot if so i have been rudely healthy for years now i think maybe the sun did get to me a little said millie back there where we stopped in that pine glade i did my best to keep out of it actually this cooler air is very welcome liz said nothing but trask couldnt help noticing that the two women had glanced at each other what speculatively paul garvey helped lardis get down on one knee and the old lidesci sniffed at the ground mist like a suspicious bloodhound before inhaling a great lungful but then standing up again in a creaking of bones he shook his shaggy head and said just a mist but when i see mist rolling down off the hills like that well it brings back memories best to be cautious where these bastard things are concerned ian goodly was looking at the low hills about a mile ahead windmills he said and fairly large ones at that derelict most of them at least by their looks trask followed the precogs line of sight and nodded they look typical of windmills in greece he said not surprising really were still very close to the med and closer still to the black sea said goodly they are ideally placed to catch the easterlies off the sea which they would if their sails werent in tatters it looks like only one of them is actually working the closest one of the four yes said millie quietly but the one that interests me in the furthest away and likewise said liz and both women were frowning staring narroweyed at the windmill in question its broken vanes hanging like some disjointed scarecrows arms the uppermost rim of its turret showing a last rapidly fading gleam of watereddown sunlight two high windows like a pair of blindly staring eyes and a third like a socket nose in the tapering facet that faced them but even as they watched the windmill became a silhouette in the fading light like trask garvey had also followed lizs and millies seemingly rapt gaze and now he agreed with them yes its them he said but best get out of there girls i sense their mindsmog thinning theyre coming awake and automatically shielding themselves get out now trask rasped taking the women by their arms and turning them away its okay ben said millie gently freeing herself you dont have to worry we knew what we were doing and in any case liz added if this is ians big one whats coming is coming and theres no way round it but as you yourself said we must definitely prepare for it so then do i call jake in on this now no said trask if malinari and the rest of them and i suppose we have to include those girls now if they are awake up there theyll know it the moment jake gets here jakes the one ace up our sleeve and i want to play him last when we get to that windmill if the mindsmog is still present thats when well call for jake but right now were just wasting time they got back into the minibus keeping it in low gear trask took it jarring and bumping along the deeply rutted track to the foot of the hills then branched off along another rising contourshugging track to the flattened dome of the hill the windmill stood behind gapped fencing in some four acres of dilapidated outbuildings and windblown weedgrown tracks and trask thought tberes no sign of life but plenty of signs of undeath said liz as he put the minibus in neutral bringing it to a halt in the long shadow of the derelict windmill i know he answered staring through his window looking out and up at the grim face of the ruined building i feel it too except this time its not working it isnt fooling me or rather she isnt fooling me benevolence said paul garvey then its radiating from that place in waves youd swear it was a holy place on the island of krassos it was a holy place the precog reminded him quietly or it had been it was supposed to be a monastery which is how it felt to us but in fact it was vavara her lying aura a mental mask protecting the grotesque horror underneath and thats how this place strikes me now a rustic country scene worthy of a pastoral canvas windmill at dusk by the lady vavara hub she would kill you for saying it said lardis even for thinking it lady no for this one knows better and spurns all such titles vavaaara was her name like the growl of some wild thing but no lady never your pastoral scene is a damned lie trask spat then and throwing the minibus in gear he circled the windmill in a cloud of dust only to skid to a halt again on completing the circle only one way in he rasped then through those leaning doors there and judging by those broken windows several storeys to climb to the top but this is one big place with lots of space inside so okay liz millie where are these bastards hiding and whats on their bloody minds theyre up there in the loft said millie at once its humming like a wasps nest up there behind the mindsmog i can smell fear panic confusion theyre like i dont know like so many rats in a trap i agree with millie liz nodded it looks like weve got them exactly where we want them but trask shook his head no he said its too easy i smell a different kind of rat here something is trying to tell me that alls well which in itself tells me that everything is far from well liz youve been wanting to call jake in on this for hours now through two countries i reckon its about time we need him and our weapons both everybody out they got out of the vehicle and liz called for jake at ebranch hq jake heard lizs call as clear and clearer than ever before almost as if she was in harrys room with him but the only ones with him were gustav turchin and john grieve jake was in his black gear lying on his bed with his hands behind his head when the call came jake we need you now also our weapons liz he said getting to his feet he had sensed her urgency knew there was very little time to spare turchin and the duty officer had been seated at the foot of the bed talking in lowered tones now as they fell silent the russian premier stood up and stepped forward is this it his eyes were suddenly wide apprehensive yes said jake grunting as he hoisted ninetyfive pounds of deadly weaponry up onto one broad shoulder this is it but it could be a dangerous situation and john grieve said sir youll find this easy to use i think lets just hope you dont need to turchin looked at him saw the modified mm browning automatic that grieve was holding out to him he accepted and pocketed it also three magazines loaded with silver bullets and jake said are you ready do you still want to come yes i mean no i mean what choice is there turchin shrugged helplessly then lets go said jake take my arm and hold on close your eyes and take one step forward and dont ahhhh turchin gasped a mere susurration that yet gonged in the mobius continuum dont cry out jake finished what hed started to say a fraction too late speecb is unnecessary in the continuum just thinking it is sufficient it conveys all you want to say telepathy turchin was quick on the uptake but as the head of russias ebranch so he should have been something of the sort jake answered the way i understand it in a place like this where theres absolutely nothing without that its brought here even thoughts have weight yet i dont have weight said turchin my god im in free fall not any longer said jake guiding him out through a mobius door turchin stumbled but jake held him upright and the premier opened his eyes the gloom of twilight following on the bright light of harrys room found him stumbling again this time ben trask was there to steady him barking jake what the hell is going on here gustav turchin whats he doing here it seems i owe him jake answered putting down the weapons and giving liz a hug and so do you we we had a deal turchin gasped im here to ensure you take care of your end of things and then he frowned some weird trick of the light seemed to be affecting his eyes or if not his theirs certainly trask millie and liz and especially jake their eyes were faintly luminous almost feral in the dusk or it could be an effect of the full moon drifting up from beyond the hills weve no time for this trask rasped turning from turchin to the necroscope jake the wamphyri all three of them we believe are up in that windmill probably at the top liz and millie say theyre feeling trapped there by us im not so sure i believe its a replay of malinaris game in xanadu but however it turns out were here to destroy them or at least to do our damnedest ian goodly has foreseen something of how its going to end however and while we cant say if its to be now or later we do know well all be in on it so for now you and me and ian and paul were going in that way we may manage to avoid being together and so avoid what the precog has foreseen i hope as for what we can expect inside those girls are in there too said millie staring up at the windmills darkly shadowed face theyre very scared very excited and extremely dangerous theyre malinaris first line of defence to get to him and those other two creatures youll have to get past the girls first but we cant any longer think of them as human and youll be doing them a favour so then trask nodded thats it lardis and gustav he paused to glare at the latter and said damn you you and your political objectives your bloody interference you can stay down here with liz and millie youll watch that door all four of you and if anything comes out that isnt one of us well know what to do lardis assured him holding a mm automatic in one hand and hefting his wickedlooking machete in the other and right then said trask picking up grenades and a specially adapted machine pistol lets go the others had all chosen weapons but as the four assault troops made for the leaning ominouslooking doors in the base of the windmill premier turchin called after them what about torches it will be dark in there are the laser sights on your guns going to be sufficient trask hadnt considered that hadnt really needed to for it didnt feel dark at all but speaking almost as one man paul garvey and the precog said hes right and goodly produced a pocket torch then the precog said oh and by the way it doesnt work like that whats that said trask leading the way toward the windmill what doesnt work like that trying to avoid the future said the precog but he followed on anyway and jake said as for it being dark in there forget it i have enough light for everyone right here and applying gentle pressure to the trigger of his flamethrower he demonstrated by sending a bright lance of fire stabbing into the darkness a moment later and with their weapons crimson laser beams crisscrossing probing the dusty dusky gloom ahead they were in through the doors all four of them up above malinari turned to the hag vavara minus her masking guise now and to lord szwart in a less than human configuration and said it worked worked even better than i anticipated and theyre coming up when the fighting begins just one floor down from here thats when we go down but on the outside down below thats where theyve left their weakest oh szwart used his brokenbellows voice and meanwhile what of their strongest i saw that one in what i thought was a cavern stronghold forgotten by men he had that devil nathans weapons and used them to great effect and this is the man you would take one of the four who are climbing towards us even as we speak take him i will said malinari but not here not now i have explained how well go about it is your memory so short that last was an error unwise to speak to one such as lord szwart like that in such abrupt demeaning terms and i remember your other plans szwart came flowing from the darkest corner looming large i remember centuries in the icelands the devastation waiting in starside when finally we went back there the ruination of all our works by nathan kiklu and our flight into this place what of those plans nephran malinari if anything my memory is too keen i think weve no time for arguing now malinari backed away the time of your revenge is at hand lord szwart but not on me the one who was largely instrumental in my downfall who assisted in vavaras and who was wholly responsible for yours in your cavern stronghold under london will soon be in our grasp and i assure you hell sacrifice his safety aye and even himself for the woman liz she is our target only the woman liz as for the others well weve set our trap for them and it only remains to spring it the smell of kerosene rises in the air down there yet we have blocked it from their minds and left them feeling almost invincible well with the possible exception of trask myself i believe they will survive it even as they survived xanadu but it should at least work as a smokescreen allowing us to slip away then when were prepared we shall reveal ourselves one last time at which this jake this necroscope will come after us to save his darling liz ahhh at which point vavara came in with and am i really trusting my safety to you two we are at a fearful height and i was never the adept where metamorphosis is a requirement only drop me i could be sorely broken oh well not drop you sister said malinari for well not be carrying you what she was at once alarmed but i understood wed be flying down from here which indeed we shall be said malinari lord szwart and myself but but speed is of the essence malinari cut her off we cant burden ourselves with you you must climb down after all vavara your skills in that department lack nothing whatsoever you managed those cliffs on krassos easily enough when you were hurled down in the sea and as for that hotel in turkey why you were like a lizard creeping up that wall bah vavara swept to the window the only lizard here is you nephran malinari and i wont forget this but what must be must be ill begin the descent now no said szwart blocking the way the ones who are waiting below might see you they have weapons they could swat you like a fly on a wall szwart is right said malinari when the fighting starts below then you can go lady mentalist bastard she hissed her eyes flaring where she pressed to the gapped boarding of the wall close to the window oh be quiet malinari grinned albeit nervously if you must do something then use those lying powers of yours to lure them on let them know were afraid send the acrid stench of our fear into their minds to buoy them up but whatever you do dont whine vavara for it only makes you that much more the great hag and mentalist bastard she hissed again all leather and bone and needle teeth where she crouched at the window trembling in her rage but she did as he requested for that way lay salvation down below trask and his forces had swept the ground floor and found nothing but several heaps of mouldy grain a stack of old and rotting sacks and some rusted ironwork and frayed belting relics of the forsaken mills machinery the rickety staircase however showed plenty of recent footprints in a thick layer of dust they pointed upwards none of them coming down again and there were at least three higher levels and sixty or more feet of staircase to go to the windmills top floor smell anything funny trask queried in a low voice as he began to climb the stairs just fear said the telepath paul garvey maybe liz and millie are right and those soulless monsters are panicstricken up there why do you ask what do you smell machinery engines oil trask answered im not sure i can feel the fear too but it seems to be masking something else maybe i smell lies vavara is good at masking things and malinari knows no peer in the art of mentalism but we do have their measure said the necroscope midway between trask and garvey with goodly bringing up the rear if theyre up there they have plenty to fear szwart knows what to expect from me and you certainly taught vavara a lesson or two on krassos and anyway were into this now but it isnt the big one said ian goodly this place is dark yes but it isnt the kind of darkness i experienced no for that was as deep and as dark as as a pharaohs tomb jake said trask quietly come up alongside me were up to the next level and im not sticking my head up there unless someones here to back me up feeling his way very carefully on the creaking treads jake moved up beside the older man and squeezed his weapons trigger to send a brief jet of fire stabbing ahead of them watch what you do with that said trask sniffing the hot reek of the thing the dust and spoiled grain in here could be a problem under the right conditions its just like methane goes off like a bomb and moving on up into the room he sniffed again and said maybe thats what i keep smelling exhaust fumes from your flamethrower jake stepped up beside him and made room for garvey and the precog again their laser beams cut through the gloom sweeping the wooden walls and floor there was more spilled grain a few mice leaping from their nests in rotten sacks and scurrying for the safety of mouseholes thick curtains of cobwebs everywhere but that was all ian said trask is there anything the futures a blank the precog shook his head but if i try too hard thats usually the way of it then youd better quit trying and concentrate on the here and now said trask by my reckoning there are two floors to go the interior space had narrowed down due to the windmills slightly conical construction central shafts in the floor and ceiling dark square holes which in the past had housed the belt drive now stood empty but as the team continued climbing the stairs so goodly swept the room one last time and saw a thin trickle of dust and yellow grain husks smoking down from the timbered ceiling lit up in the light from his torch the stream sparkled like gold dust as it fell from the central aperture look he whispered and the others saw what hed seen something stirring up there said garvey and from somewhere up above the creaking of a floorboard voiced its corroboration those dancing girls said trask his voice like a rustle of dead leaves millie said wed be meeting them first well as the saying goes its dirty work but lets do it and without further pause he went headlong up the groaning stairs jake was a split second behind him both men falling into a crouch where they left the stairs garvey and goodly were right on their heels standing over them their laser beams slashing at the gloom seeking targets but not finding any or at least not yet the precog swept the place with his torch he saw festoons of cobwebs dusty sacking hanging from crossbeams a pile of junk in a corner a heap of mouldy grain the eyes of mice reflecting the light of his torch and then other eyes feral flaring eyes that were too far from the floor too big and set too far apart to be mouse eyes and ahhhh came a gasp a sigh a snarl from above up there launching themselves from a crossbeam two halfnaked girls came swinging on rusty chains their mouths gaping open and their long teeth gleaming white and razor sharp paul garvey caught a thought it was a red thought and it steamed a human heart still beating raw red meat strength life bloooood the blood is the life and garveys reaction was instantaneous and deadly swinging his machine pistol up at arms length he triggered a burst that stopped one of the girls in midflight with a shriek that brought down streamers of dust she was swatted from her chain hurled backward by sleeting silverplated steel but her companion dropped down to the floor and came on at a lope hissing her hatred and reaching with hands like claws trask and goodly fired together twin bursts whose strobing flashes saved them from the worst of it the sight of the vampire girls head exploding like an overripe melon and away she went swept back out of sight and toppling into oblivion but no respite for the team for now it was as if the shadows themselves were coming alive and coming at them from every direction vavara was halfway down the windmills flank moving crabwise and so descending diagonally she turned a corner of the fivesided structure and thus passed from line of sight of the ebranch group below who in any case were preoccupied with guarding the door and in shadows cast by an overly bright moon she clung to warped often crumbling fascia boards cursed the arrogance of the mentalist maggot nephran malinari and vowed terrible vengeance on him in return for all the many insults and injuries shed suffered at his hands as for her colleagues szwart and malinari waited beside the empty windows from which when the stuttering gunfire from below ceased they would launch themselves out into the night experts in metamorphosis they would assume airfoils glide out and down and so descend on the unsuspecting group below black against the dark of night especially szwart they would go all unseen until far too late so it came to pass as the mechanical thunder fell silent and the smell of cordite came drifting up from below now said szwart and the two launched outwards their loose clothing ballooned their skin and very flesh stretched they formed webs between elongating arms and sides between their legs and even between the twelveinch fingers of lilypad hands like pterodactyl kites they flew their shapes streamlined their webbing belling in a breeze off the distant ocean malinari the most manlike was grotesque but lord szwart was a thing born of nightmare a scalloped blanket a bat shape without a bat body a leaflike life form with a whipping rudder tail and mantalike paddles in front be was a thing of dread and darkness they swept out upon the air turned swept back and down and the four on the ground didnt even see them coming it was lardis who felt the first rush of air who turned to look up and was felled as malinari reversed himself and rammed the old lidesci feet first lardiss weapons went flying likewise gustav turchins as lardis collided with him and both men went down the one winded and feeling the pain of cracked ribs the other yelping his shock his terror as he saw what had attacked them out of the night millie backed off backed into liz who was trying to fix malinari in the sights of her baby browning but before millie could bring up her own weapon szwart fell on her like a living blanket she knew his smell the greasy suffocating feel of him and screamed but nothing came out because he had wrapped her entirely cocooning her in his webbing and cutting off her air unable to breathe millie struggled frantically kicked tried to throw herself down but szwart held her there and tightened his grip and liz cursing under her breath while hopping from one foot to the other was unable to shoot at szwart for fear of hitting millie there was no knowing which one was which they were almost as one then three muffled shots sounded and szwarts blanket body flew open expelling millie who at once fell to the ground her smoking gun spinning from her grasp szwarts mantle was smoking too where her lasteffort shots had singed him all three of lizs friends were down and she herself left standing but both szwart and malinari were in her sights and her hands firm on the weapon she held at arms length it only required a twitch of her trigger finger or two or three or as many as it took to empty the clip but the opportunity was too fleeting and she didnt get the chance for vavara was there rising up dark in the darkness a hag out of hell with eyes like lanterns and a claw hand that almost broke lizs wrist as it struck the gun from her grasp and there my pretty that monstrous female croaked striking again this time at the side of lizs head and toppling her into a black well of unconsciousness and so we meet again enough said malinari quickly glancing all around lardis lay still where he had fallen gustav turchin was scrambling backwards silently mouthing his terror and holding one hand up before him and millie and liz were down and out we should finish them vavara snarled which would be a waste of time and effort said malinari for these are the weakest and pose no great threat but those others up there he inclined his head let his eyes sweep the windmills wall to its high windows they have the real power and that one that jake that necroscope in particular if he escapes this time then ill know for certain i am right and he can make us invincible wherefore theres time only for this and loping to the leaning door he reached inside took up a jerrycan of petrol from where it was hidden under a stack of sacking and lobbed it inside onto a pile of grain and taking out a keramique from his tattered clothing he backed away and took aim firing once and once again to get the range then a third shot directly at the target the force of the explosion surprised malinari by no means expert in the dynamics of combustible liquids he had splashed the walls and stairwell with a little kerosene and now used gasoline to ignite the whole the resultant blast wrenched the windmill to its foundations bowed two of its five facets outwards and hurled shattered boards in every direction the great door was blown off its rusted hinges by a huge lick of fire that erupted from the doorway and malinari and the others had to duck down and shield themselves from heat and flying debris inside the damaged structure fire raged everywhere billowing upwards climbing the wooden stairs glowing yellow red and orange through gaps in the boarding and there said malinari with a curt nod as he straightened up acting as if all had gone exactly to plan which in the main it had and now we can go bring the girl good said lord szwart the light of that great fire is painful to these eyes of mine and this flimsy structure could come tumbling at any moment so by all means lets be gone from here and he coiled up the unconscious liz in two ropy appendages but pausing near the minibus malinari grinned monstrously aimed his keramique and blew a gaping hole in the front right tyre a simple precaution he said and then moving swiftly round the vehicle he aimed at the rear left and fired again only to hear his gun make a clunking sound as the breechblock sped by an empty magazine huh vavara grunted by no means as reliable as a gauntlet eh nephran you have a point he said drawing back his arm and hurling the weapon away but no matter it served its purpose as they left flowing swiftly silently into the flickering shadows and then into the night lardis lidesci and millie were still lying motionless dangerously close to the burning building and the russian premier having hidden himself away in one of the derelict outbuildings was nowhere to be seen just three minutes earlier trask and his party had engaged the four surviving vampire girls but they hadnt survived for long under a hail of devastating firepower riddled by silverplated steel they had gone down one by one until the last of them had been found in her hiding place crouched in a cobwebbed corner despite that her terrified screams had been pitiful terrible to hear paul garvey had known better yes he pitied her but no he wouldnt spare her for her thoughts were bloody beyond redemption a single silver bullet from his gun had been utterly pitiless yet paradoxically merciful where it shattered her forehead and blew her brains out through her ears by which time the uppermost level of the windmill had been emptied of life or undeath but the men from ebranch hadnt known that and this time it had been jake who headed the climb up that final flight of stairs but very calmly coldly with a fragmentation grenade dangling from its ring in his teeth and his flamethrower hissing its readiness in his hands up there the night breeze had blown in through windows open to the stars goodlys torch had swept the room a much smaller room than the others red rays had crisscrossed seeking fleshandblood and inhuman targets and the necroscope had even sent a tongue of fire into the darkest corners for by virtue of the ventilation the air was less musty the atmosphere less incendiary here but there was nothing no one and it was then then that they had known trask hearing muffled gunshots had rushed to a window in the darkness down below figures moved collided sprang apart but more than four of them damn it all to hell trask turned to the others his face a parchment mask to me all of you jake quickly i want you to which was as far as he got before the floor lurched and the walls shook and dust and cobwebs came streaming down in answer to the blast from below scorching thermals rising from the inferno came rushing roaring whooshing up through the stairwell and central shafts shimmering jets of pressured furnace heat they bore a certain reek and clearminded at last trask knew what his mysterious smell had been kero or gasoline or maybe a mixture of both but masked by the aura of vavara and the mentalist mind of malinari jake was crossing the floor toward trask but he was moving quickly carelessly and stepped too heavily on a rotten board his right leg went through toppling him sideways and he cried out as splinters of brittle wood shot deep into the back of his thigh just above the knee joint a moment more to recover from the sensesnumbing agony and letting go his weapon taking his weight on both hands he tried to push himself up and free seeing jakes situation goodly and garvey went to his assistance but timbers groaned and once again the floor lurched throwing them off balance ben trask got to jake first and furious with himself the fact that hed let himself and his people be lured fooled and trapped yet again but at the same time panicstricken galvanized by thoughts of what might be happening below to the women and the others the older man let his passions fuel him took jake under the arms and hauled him up out of the grinding warping tangle of screeching boards his strength was phenomenal as he dragged the necroscope free and hoisted him to his feet so much so that he could scarcely believe it himself flames were now shooting up the stairwell and a pillar of fire leaped from the central shaft in a fat stem that hit the domed ceiling and splayed out and down opening like the blooming of some alien fiery orchid cringing from the searing heat of its red and yellow petals the four men crouched together and do it trask cried jake take us the hell out of here down to the others before this whole bloody place collapses all four they huddled together arms locked around shoulders and necks and jake conjured a mobius door now back away from me he yelled over the roaring of the fire as he pushed them out of the known universe instant darkness and weightlessness the sudden shock of drifting free in the one absolute void the great and infinite nothingness of the mobius continuum but a moment more found them stumbling their legs like rubber as gravity returned and jake actually fell for as his knees bent a little under his weight so a cluster of sixinch splinters like so many wooden daggers drove even deeper into the back of his thigh they were down on the ground between their vehicle and the burning windmill millie lay where she had fallen and the old lidesci was shielding his face from the blaze with one arm and hand and trying to drag her away from the fire with the other fortunately the night breeze grown to a wind now was driving the flames away from them but still the heat was unbearable paul garvey rushed to help lardis and as they drew millie from danger she showed signs of recovery trask was at her side at once asking millie what about liz wheres liz but millie could only lick her lips and stare dazedly into the night goodly was in the minibuss driving seat starting her up he called from his window get in all of you quickly the windmills going to topple and because he was the precog and rarely wrong they knew better than to argue with him revelations reservations resolutions last to reach the minibus paul garvey came staggering carrying jake in a firemans lift normally the necroscope would use the mobius continuum but such was his pain as jagged splinters raked naked nerve endings and threatened to sever his hamstring tendon that his mind wouldnt focus garvey reached the rear door of the vehicle in time to hear the precogs warning yell there she goes he meant the windmill and as eager hands reached from within and grabbed at jake there she went trasks earlier warning to jake that he be careful how he used his flamethrower was now seen to have been almost as potent a premonition as anything foreseen by goodly on the first floor of the windmill the heat had dried out the old piles of grain to set them swirling and as the perfect conditions were met so a second explosion blew out the walls of that floor and hurled blazing debris in all directions a heavy board came whirling whupwhupping through the air one end hit the ground the board flexed and bounced vibrating as it sprang aloft again before clipping the necroscope on the back of the head in passing so that when trask and the old lidesci snatched jake from garveys athletic shoulders and dragged him inside the minibus he was already out cold then with garvey performing a headlong dive in through the rear doors the precog hit the accelerator setting the vehicle fishtailing as he turned away from the burning building behind them the upper floors collapsed into the groundfloor cauldron and the structure fell on its side precisely where theyd been spilling blazing rubble over a wide area but the minibus was limping and ian goodly said as if we werent in enough trouble i believe we also have a puncture away from the blaze he drew the vehicle to a halt even as premier turchin came staggering waving his arms ghostly pale in the headlight beams lardis said trask stepping down from the rear do what you can for jake and millie paul and ian we have to change this flat the fire will be seen for miles around i dont want to be here when people come to investigate then he whirled on turchin you where the hell were you how come you got away when the others were in trouble and and what about liz he gazed wildly all around did you see what happened to liz liz was taken turchin babbled and yes he nodded i got away if i hadnt id have got dead i didnt know what you were up against trask i had no idea couldnt possibly have guessed what those creatures were like its one thing to be told about them but quite another to be confronted by them and i panicked i admit it what about liz trask grabbed and shook him and stockily built as turchin was he was actually shaken also staring at trasks face feeling the anger transmitted through his hands the russian premier visibly blanched they they had a big car he said a limo i think it was hidden in an outbuilding i heard the car start up saw it drive into the open saw them bundle liz inside by god trask that car was like a hearse it is a hearse trask let go of him and jakes hurt millie too and those blackhearted bastards have escaped me again and taken liz with them meanwhile garvey and the precog had removed the spare from its housing at the front of the vehicle and were working to get the minibus jacked up and as trask turned away in disgust from turchin so millie climbed unsteadily down from the back of the vehicle and almost fell into his arms thank god youre all right he hugged her but carefully like the ohsoveryprecious thing that she was and lord he sighed its bad enough liz has been taken a bloody disaster but if it had been you i just dont know what id have done not a second time liz carne a dazedsounding anxious mumble from the open rear doors i didnt see liz i thought maybe shed got away and then angrily ben trask is it you out there what about liz ben trask stepped to the back of the vehicle and looked inside at jake and lardis the old lidesci was sitting well away from jake sitting very quietly in a corner up front almost as if he didnt want to be noticed there didnt want to be there and the necroscope had ripped open the back of his black tracksuits right leg and was sitting there with his leg up on the benchlike seat opposite pulling long bloody daggers of wood out of the torn flesh above and behind his knee but the look on his face the very different look of him as he worked was something else jakes hair at the temples was almost white now giving him a sleek wolfish look where it was swept back into a short blackandwhite fourply braid at the back his face seemed leaner more angular and more angry beads of silvery sweat stood out on his brow and his lips were drawn back from teeth that were clenched in the righthand corner of his mouth but one by one as those long brittle splinters were tugged free and let fall to the floor he only sighed his relief and showed no other sign of the pain that he must be feeling or maybe he wasnt feeling it but staving it off and trask found himself thinking they can do that cant tbey and then there were jakes eyes his luminous eyes millie was beside trask she saw what he had seen thought what hed thought and looking at them suddenly sharply jake saw their expressions and nodded his understanding then grinning wryly mirthlessly he drew the last splinter from his raw red flesh and said oh really so youre thinking im looking a bit odd eh well let me tell you something you should see yourselves and trask and millie they both knew it would do no good to deny it it was the strife the fighting the passion that had brought it on gustav turchin had been standing nearby now very quietly he went to where goodly and garvey were tightening the last few bolts on the front right wheel and he couldnt help but notice that they too were looking apprehensive no they were looking hagridden where they worked with frantic speed yet much too quietly working together like this on their own had provided them with their first real opportunity to talk in private then as they finished up and wiped their hands on a dirty rag trask millie and jake appeared from the rear of the minibus and behind them the old lidesci holding his damaged ribs with one hand and his machete in the other people trask began to speak only to pause abruptly as garvey leaned into the front of the minibus and brought out two machine pistols one of which he handed to the precog and right said the telepath his voice trembling uncertain and very frightened you said people ben by which you mean me ian lardis and premier turchin we are people all right thats sort of plain to see but its equally obvious that you three arent not any more and were pretty damn sure that liz wasnt either as garvey talked the old lidesci gave the one group a wide berth sidling carefully around them to stand with garvey and the others and for several endless moments there was silence until millie said well go on then get it over with and she was so calm so quiet that her words sounded like thunder over the pop and crackle of burning timbers then lardis spoke up and said if youll just let me walk away i think i would rather do that and gladly trask looked at him and said you i would have taken bets that after all youve seen and done youd be the first to act and while i wouldnt like it id certainly understand it sheathing his weapon lardis answered aye ive known bad times but there were good times too and i remember harry he was different i remember harry too trask replied and i know he wasnt all that different not at the end but i let him live and then the precog spoke up all my life he said ive considered this talent of mine a curse until now and turning to garvey he went on put your weapon down paul you seem to have forgotten even as i had momentarily forgotten that were all going to be in this to the end all of us together but i want to stay the way i am said the telepath shivering for all that he could feel the warmth of the fire then read our minds said trask and if you discover any positive threat in what were thinking pull the trigger then he turned to millie hugged her again and asked her how is it you are so damned eager to die im not she answered but how will we live and if this is the end of us as we were and if we have to go then id like to go cleanly jake had limped forward a pace and disappeared stepping out of the mobius continuum slightly to garveys rear he snatched the machine pistol from him in a move that was one continuous blur the incredible speed of the wamphyri and taking out the magazine he looked at it frowned and growled empty thats right said the telepath as he backed off a pace because i was afraid i might use it without giving any of you a chance to well to explain whats to explain said jake but what i would like you to explain how come youd firemanslift me out of trouble if you were only going to kill me later and incidentally thats why i havent killed you and then looking at the gun again do you have a full clip yes said the telepath reaching into his pocket to show jake a full magazine there then said jake giving him the gun back no good having the ammunition if you dont have a fucking gun then he groaned went to his knees put a hand to the back of his head looked at his sticky crimson fingers and said people and i really do mean people all of you i think youll have to get by without me for a while with which he fell flat on his face concussed the necroscope lay in the back of the minibus cared for by goodly with garvey looking on while lardis sat hunched in a corner looking dour apparently drained of energy premier turchin slept where he sat his head lolling on his chest ben trask ever the indefatigable leader drove through the night lockedon like a missile to the hearse and its alien occupants how many miles ahead and guided by millie who sat beside him after a while the five who were still conscious conversed tersely at first but gradually falling into old routines patterns of longaccustomed speech that sprang automatically from years of knowing each other friendship and mutual trust that was how it had used to be anyway and while they werent forgetting couldnt possibly have forgotten the desperate nature of their situation they certainly tried their best as if from far far away jake could hear them but then he could hear diverse things discernible to no one else deadspeak whispers came rolling in off a sea of fog and there was a constant pounding in his head and faint cries of frustration despair even of mental degradation madness from somewhere deep inside but not jakes pain and not his despair his madness then no not that either though certainly his psyche felt like it was being torn in half with both halves pulling in opposite directions seeming to recognize various ethereal voices jake listened to the dead awhile the ones he knew were muted shouted down or whispered down by the great majority who were actually in the majority now for all of those who had been undecided about the necroscope were now convinced satisfied as to his failure witnesses for the prosecution and jake the one on trial about to be convicted for all of their worst fears had been realized and the one light in their everlasting night the single thread connecting them with what had gone before the world they had known had lost its blue glow and now burned red yet still zek zek foener zek simmons zek trask stood up for jake and keenan gormley and george hannant and the gravelvoiced exsoldier called graham sergeant lane who at different times had also stood up for harry and for his son nathan they all stood up for jake all of them yes pitiful handful that they were compared to the great majority and among them a small but determined voice a tiny tearful whisper from far away a graveyard in hartlepool in the northeast of england where harry keogh had grown up the necroscope was my friend she said cynthia who had died a child and remained a child despite that five cold years had slipped by jake didnt know her but nathan knew me cynthia told him and all the others had fallen silent now listening to her he was the necroscope she went on and i was a nobody i would have cried for ever but for him my mum and dad too they couldnt know there was this place couldnt know id go on and would wait for them always but nathan knew and he told them and they stopped crying and so did i he played at god the multitude erupted then it was the only thing he could do and anyway where is this god and more to the point wheres his heaven heaven is waiting for those who believe the great majority cried out against what sounded like blasphemy though many of them had long since stopped believing i believe keenan gormley shouted back at them and i would like to believe that the necroscopes are his angels dont deny jake as you denied harry dont you go making that same mistake again for if you deny jake he may deny you and your children and their children keenan is right and cynthia too what and has it taken the eyes of a child to see light in this eternal night you wonder all of you you have your doubts just like graham lane but unlike him you keep them hidden away in your secret hearts thats where you ask about the hell that we inhabit instead of the heaven we were promised but maybe its a test the final test and only the worthy will succeed and go on while the rest stay here but again the great majority cried out against her no no it isnt so we cannot side with vampires they are a plague on the living and a curse on the dead we accept of life and death but never undeath we cant place our trust in vampires but i can said little cynthia still only seven years old and never to grow a day older ill place my faith in this one anyway and reaching out of the dark reaching for jake she asked necroscope are you there he couldnt resist her maybe when it came to it shed turn her back on him and run perhaps face to face it would prove too much for her shed sense the darkness stirring there back off and deny him like all the others but in a way she was his last hope and for a fact she was their last hope and yes jake answered im bere but you really dont know me and perhaps theyre right and you should be afraid of me youre the necroscope she said drawing closer and so was nathan when he was here i cant be afraid of you you feel the same as nathan felt i dont care about the cold thats in you it isnt your fault and whats warm in you will smother it cyntbia listen to me said jake warningly then paused lost for words because suddenly he knew her remembered little cynthia without ever having met her and the necroscopes head whirled painlessly this time as a kaleidoscope of characters harry the dweller and nathan merged within briefly embodying every necroscope avatar in the selfsame moments and also their memories yet at the same time strobing in fragmenting overlapping patterns of day and night dark and light so that almost everything was forgotten even as it flew apart again almost everything but one of those memories remained and jake clung to it this one is for nathan said cynthia and jake felt it like a butterfly brushing his hollow cheek and this one is for you she kissed him again and was gone but jake knew that he would always remember even as he remembered it now the soft sad scent of soap and tears and innocence and he also knew how things were going to be felt his injured psyche mending bringing him back on course saw clearly now how easy and wrong it would have been to surrender and how hard and right to follow a childs suggestion to use whatever remained of that vital spark of warmth the spark that made him human to suppress and defeat what was cold and alien in him it was only a matter of will free will and no one more freewilled than jake cutter it was like a vow the necroscopes deadspeak vow and hed vowed it with such determination that the great majority backed off fell silent drifted out again into that great mental fog bank and retired to wait and see their verdict wasnt in not yet awhile but the teeming dead werent the only ones who were waiting to see jake moaned turning on his side where he lay on the vehicles benchlike seat held against falling by ian goodly but he was still hearing things vague voices that found their way through to him mainly the muted conversation of his fellow travellers like echoes in a tunnel but also the pounding and wailing of something or someone else the latter was the work of korathoncemindsthrall and the necroscope had had more than enough of it opening the window in that special door in his metaphysical mind jake said korath what the bell is it with you im suffering enough already without all this racket if hed expected an answer it wasnt forthcoming not immediately instead there was a snuffling a weeping an incoherent gibbering that even deadspeak couldnt decipher but since this was korath jake felt little or nothing of pity in fact he wondered if he was still capable of it and korath he said again if youre trying to get my attention youve succeeded but ive got to tell you the way im feeling right now i could do without it and if i were in your position id think twice before pissing me off any more than you piss me off already do you bear me the gibbering faded away the snuffling and sniffing with which it was interspersed too and for several seconds there was silence then korath spoke but his was no longer the voice of arrogance and incredible duplicity by which jake had come to know him before korath had been a distraction then a menace a wouldbe voyeur finally a creature bent on returning to a stolen life in jakes body having first removed jake from it now he was something else a something broken beyond repair not only in life but in death too a creature of darkness immobilized and lost in the impenetrable darkness of a secret room in the necroscopes secret mind worse than any padded cell it had no visitors darker than dark it had no light no colours no odours no tastes no touches no sounds it was total isolation it might as well have been the mobius continuum itself and when korath pounded with his screaming his screaming was all he heard in other words his own thoughts and when all one has is ones own thoughts it doesnt take very long for them to turn inwards on themselves and on the one who thinks them korath was going mad and he knew it do you know he said quietly when at last hed got himself under a semblance of control did i ever tell you that my oncemaster malinari the mind was wont to complain how he often felt that the tumultuous thoughts of others their constant babble would one day drive him insane well be did he did and be had to control them shut them out else for a fact he would be a raving madman with me he got on very well with me or so i prided myself however naively for being blessed with a modicum of shielding a natural and most useful asset passed down to me by my father i bad a measure of control over my thoughts and its no mere coincidence that i lasted longer in malinaris employ than any other thrall or lieutenant well with the sole exception of demetrakis who was by any standard a dullard but you saw him under the pleasure dome in xanadu and im sure you would agree that being crushed and drowned which was my lot was a far more acceptable fate than his having listened to all of this with increasing impatience jake now said lets get something straight korath i havent come visiting to listen to some interminable retelling of your life story i came to tell you to be quiet to stop rattling your cage i have problems of my own and you youve never been other than a gigantic bloody nuisance but it was as if hed said nothing at all or korath hadnt been listening for as soon as jake had finished yet now the dead and miserable vampire continued if only by virtue of my imprisonment in this place at last im able to understand something of malinaris problem though strangely and even paradoxically his is the very opposite of mine were at opposite ends of the spectrum do you see for where my master suffered from the myriad thoughts surrounding him i suffer from the lack of them and where he was plagued by all of those mental voices i hear only my own i used to enjoy eavesdropping on the great majority but no longer the walls of this room of yours are impregnable thoughtproof i used to argue with you and found our word games most stimulating but what stimulus is there now none whatsoever and so i argue with myself alas i am my own equal and the arguments go undecided in short given just a little more time alone in this place and i am sure that i shall go insane if im not there already and the necroscope said is it possible i feel some kind of proposition coming on you have won korath answered i almost had you on several occasions i thought that you were mine but i cannot any longer deny the fact that you have won and all i want now is out you feared that i would usurp you and so i would have but now my only desire is to be as far away from you as possible preferably in that detestable sump in romania for there at least i shall have something if only the cold murmur of water and the miserly thoughts of the teeming dead and now jake actually felt something of pity didnt i promise you something better than that he said to take your bones out of there and bury them in a field somewhere before theyre washed away entirely you did so promise upon a time said korath and i gave it some thought but in a field in this world where i would feel the sun beating down on me eight or nine hours in every day it would be worse than my sump then you must decide upon another place said jake instead of torturing yourself and annoying me let that be your stimulus while you wait eh said korath while i wait are you telling me you dont intend to release me now this very moment not just yet jake answered and for a very good reason we go up against the wamphyri koratb myself trask ebrancb a battle to the death and you might yet be of some assistance to me and if i refuse if i have gone mad when all of this comes to pass what then but the necroscopes voice contained a deadspeak shrug as he answered then what befalls me befalls you but meanwhile i want you to be quiet if you distract me youll only be placing yourself in even greater jeopardy so keep your wits about you korath and wait for bow long not long i think then i have no option and i can but try said korath so be it jake nodded but as he closed the window in the door in his secret mind already he could hear that ohsomournful gibbering starting up again damn it to hell said trask for the fourth or fifth time we know how it happened knew that it could happen yet still we ignored it and we let it happen said millie i let it happen when i should have denied you i wanted you all the more i think it must have been fear i swear i didnt know but i was so frightened i just didnt want to be alone ditto said trask gruffly and it was my way of denying that anything might have happened to you yes and it was probably the same for jake and liz jake and liz she answered they were young lovers what they did was no ones business but their own im not responsible for them but im certainly to blame for you no he shook his head if blame is to be apportioned it was both of us it was neither one of you said the precog from the rear of the vehicle it was szwart his spores yet you didnt seem to sleep millie its all very strange i wanted to sleep she said in fact i did sleep but we thought it was simple exhaustion following that nightmare under london and anyway i was fighting it determined not to sleep and liz said paul garvey same story millie answered she had been through a lot too so maybe sleep was perfectly natural and jake and liz theyd be hard to keep apart i wouldnt have tried to come between them but i should have said trask its in the past now said goodly but it was the future then so maybe its all one after all whichever it cant be undone and now the future is allimportant said lardis and as for me i cant believe i move among vampires lacking the will to strike them down but ive loved you people you are like you have become my own when this is over said trask assuming we win that is you and lissa must return to sunsidestarside through the perchorsk gate before we close it for ever and speaking of perchorsk said garvey has anyone given thought to where these bastards are heading i have trask answered and it fits with everything that we know about them their plans for earth are in ruins theyre no longer worried about their anonymity which is why they seem bent on leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake and since they came through into our world via romania the only way back to their own is through the gate at perchorsk millie finished it for him but many a mile to go yet said trask and soon theyll be into turchins territory if hes still in contact with members of what used to be the opposition maybe we can arrange an ambush or two along the way and slow them down and goodly said assuming that youre right its odd that theyve chosen this route what route said trask were heading for burgas on the black sea coast the precog answered and thats east not north so where land routes are concerned this is probably the worst possible choice they could have made perhaps they intend to take another ship said millie and if so they could be heading for odessa in the ukraine said garvey that might make sense do you really think well be able to follow them to hell and back if necessary trask growled huh the old lidesci grunted and thats very possible too the hell bit anyway and so were decided said goodly that come what may we really are in this together right to the end put it this way trask answered i may need blood or raw red meat to live yes and millie too but it doesnt bave to be human in another world another time there was this man called turgo zolte turgo refused to descend to that level and so did harry keogh they both went out fighting it and so will we you have nothing to fear from us i intend to use whats in me to destroy the creatures who brought it into our world them and no one else does that answer your question i didnt ask that question said the precog but trask only grinned however humourlessly and answered oh yes you did my friend now tell me have i ever doubted your talent no so why do you deny me mine very well said goodly but thats only you two theres still liz if shes managed to survive and theres also jake hes been okay up to now said garvey but how can we be sure hell stay that way thats a chance well have to take trask answered glancing into his driving mirror to pierce the gloom at the rear of the minibus where to him everything was as visible as in broad daylight but ive taken the same chance before and as youre aware theres a hell of a lot of harry keogh in jake cutter and talking about jake said millie hows he doing his wounds are healing said garvey the back of his thigh has formed a scab and the split at the back of his scalp is sealing itself and i have his blood all over my hands likewise said the precog at which lardis spoke up however gloomily as long as it doesnt get into your eyes nose or mouth you should be pretty safe jakes not that long a vampire his sexual juices are one thing theyre the essence of life after all but his blood shouldnt be infec er infectious not yet a while not on the outside of your flesh anyway on the other hand if youve been wounded picked up a cut here and there he paused and shrugged i havent said garvey nor i said the precog and in any case i think thats the least of our worries but jake he always was an obstinate occasionally perverse sort of fellow to deal with which could be a good thing said trask and as long as his obstinate side wins out over his perverse side im all for it as for healing powers obviously being a vampire isnt all bad news youre joking of course said millie but he didnt answer at once merely looked at her sideways through feralgleaming eyes until finally when she wouldnt stop staring at him he sighed and reminded her weve got a big fight coming millie i dont like being a vampire no but it doesnt hurt knowing we wont go down all that easily actually said the precog when youre more fully er developed you should be very powerful vampires indeed that might take some time but with your enhanced talents theyre already enhanced to a degree said garvey what the way liz and millie were able to track these creatures down they were as good or better than david chung longrange telepathy my own skills are puny by comparison and as for jake he is going to be well something else and lardis feeling a little less withdrawn and morbid now said do you really think you can fight it and win i mean is it possible youll remain avengers and go on to rid your world of others who arent as strong who follow the darkness instead of the light but if so then what is it thats different about you trask shrugged what was it about turgo and harry lardis thought about it and nodded they had always hated vampires he said eventually and what they did in life they continued to do in undeath something like that said trask and were the same all of our lives or at least it sometimes seems that way weve been fighting evil so why stop now lardis you spoke of avengers well and dont we have enough to avenge look at all the poor people who have paid and who are yet to pay the price of what malinari vavara and especially szwart have done for all we know the world may still descend into chaos and millie gave a little shiver and said for all we know were not even going to win the next one for us it could well be the last one but we are going to try said trask grimly myself ive lost too many loved ones to vampires malinari and those others theyre not going back to starside if i can help it damn right said the old lidesci especially now that we know nathan has won his war and my people are free i wont see them enslaved again and paul garvey asked but what about the others the ones in london and all the other sites whove been infected i mean cant they be special too cant they all fight it but lardis shook his head no he said youll find that it doesnt work that way in sunside for every one who tried to fight it there were three who surrendered at once and remember you knew what you were fighting lardis is right said trask the vast majority of people who get infected wont have a clue whats happening to them we know and thats our strength and then again there will always be a certain lunatic element not to mention a criminal element who might actually want to be vampires im not a precog but still i see a very dark future looming i mean think about it our minister responsibles latest communiquй wasnt exactly his usual phlegmatic response to a problem now was it no the world is in dire straits and once again well be the ones at the forward edge of the battle area so you see whats coming can best be likened to a skirmish the first round of a fight to the finish an opportunity to test our battle skills and garvey said then lets hope were all still standing when the bell sounds but suddenly as they approached a junction take the next left said millie theyre heading north now just moments before shed spoken the vehicles headlights had illuminated the legend on a motorway signpost straight on for burgas on the coast left for ajtos varna and and an international symbol that couldnt be misinterpreted it was a white airplane on a blue disk its nose pointed to the sky and as trask cut across the oncoming lane he knew exactly what was happening here reading his mind so did millie so theyre not going after a boat she said then and trasks voice rasped as he answered no theyre definitely not twenty kilometres up this road theres an airport thats where theyre headed and i dont think i need draw you any pictures so fasten your safety belts people because im about to ask this beast for all shes got with which he floored the accelerator the motor howled and the minibus leapt forward in response but trask was asking too much of the battered old vehicle and as the airport signs got thicker on the ground and the lights of an aircontrol tower appeared just three or four kilometres up the road so the minibus began to steam and shake the engine dunked and the power was gone and they covered the last few kilometres at a limp little better than walking pace so that long before they reached the airport slip road police cars from burgas and pomorie on the coast were already passing them converging on the place with wailing sirens and strobing blue lights it seems theres been some excitement said garvey nervously from the back of the vehicle ill say there has trask answered him and im betting it was bloody exciting at that and eh what gustav turchin came snorting awake my god i was having this terrible dream but when trask glanced back at him he stiffened and fell silent and garvey continued what do you reckon ben youre the telepath said trask as he steered the minibus onto the slip road where she limped the last hundred yards or so to a dilapidated car park ill give you one guess no dont guess get over there where the action is and see if you can pick a mind or two millie made to get out of the vehicle saying id better go with him but putting a hand on her arm trask stopped her and said not without a pair of dark glasses you wont and oh said millie in just a few minutes garvey was back breathless from running across the car park theres all hell going on in there he said when hed got his breath back three airport policemen are dead torn to bits and the pilot and copilot of a privately owned fiveseater vtol scimitar have been kidnapped and the plane stolen it took off ten minutes ago and immediately vanished off the radar screens it has to be flying way too low in order to avoid detection said gustav turchin feeling a little more sure of himself now trask turned to him i dont know if you were aleep in the back all this time or just faking it he said but we believe the wamphyri are heading for perchorsk in the urals in order to escape back into starside is it at all possible we can contact your ebranch alert your air force and have them intercept and bring these monsters down its not my air force turchin answered and in any case its out of the question ill let you into a secret in moscow the flight controllers havent been paid for months the only reason they are still at their posts is that theyll be shot if they leave them and thats moscow as for the rest of the airports civilian and military alike theyve been getting paid in cans of porkandbeans plundered from american relief aid to the breakaway socalled dagestan province electricity supplies are so bad that nine out of ten listeningstation computers and radar posts are inoperative and just six weeks ago a hungarian youth landed his microjet in the middle of red square so lets face it if these monsters are heading for perchorsk we cant stop them said trask maybe not said jake sitting up in the back of the vehicle but we can get there before them final preparations everyone got out of the minibus stretched their legs breathed the cool night air the airport was a small one of its kind and the weedgrown car park was correspondingly tiny sooner or later especially in light of what had happened here trasks party was bound to be noticed and the last thing they needed was a squad of suspicious bulgarian policemen crawling all over them how long will it take that plane to reach perchorsk said trask to no one in particular its maybe two thousand miles said turchin with a shrug two and a half to three hours i think thats about right but where will they land its a vtol trask reminded him they can land anydamnwhere they want to so then said the necroscope thoughtfully as he massaged his stiff right leg we dont need to be there for at least an hour and a half maybe two hours get there too soon we could end up with perchorsks caretakers that gang of excons up in arms and by arms i do mean the kind you fire bullets with and anyway its cold this time of year up there in the urals its cold up there period said trask who had been there and thats at any time of year so whats on your mind liz is on my mind said jake or she should be but isnt which tells me one of two things shes either either dead he almost choked on the word or shes unconscious if she was awake im sure shed be talking to me by now and id be able to get a fix on her location and of course youd use the continuum and go to her which might be the end of both of you said trask grimly but there is an alternative to death and even unconsciousness shes with vavara szwart and malinari they could be masking her talent interfering with her probes which is something else you might want to consider that they can use her as bait and choose the best possible time to haul you into their net i know that said jake and im pretty sure its exactly what they want why else have they taken her with them but id risk it anyway and yes i know the mobius continuum can get me in trouble but it can just as quickly get me out again okay said trask and i know i wont be able to stop you if it happens only try to understand liz is on my mind too shes on all of our minds but it wont help to keep brooding on it so whats next youre asking me said jake what are my ears deceiving me ben trask is asking me what next youre the necroscope trask answered i cant possibly do the things you do no one can so im delegating my responsibilities thats all fine said jake so lets think about it first i reckon we should listen to what premier turchin has to say if only as a means of last resort it has a lot going for it well thank goodness someone thinks so said turchin and he quickly reiterated his plan to destroy the perchorsk complex in a nuclear explosion including your enemies said trask sourly the whole worlds enemies said turchin no less so than your your vampires with which he backed off a pace averting his eyes from trasks millies and jakes jake nodded wryly understandingly and said dark glasses thats our first requirement i know a place in marseilles that sells them and designer labels at that at this time of night said garvey without thinking whats the time got to do with anything said jake as he took a pace forward and disappeared in a count of ten he was back dumping a tray of sunglasses onto the front seat of the minibus and be my guest he told trask and millie take your pick may as well look our best on what could be our last night as for myself since i appear to be just a little more luminous than you two i think ill have to go with these ray charles shades he chose a pair with side panels trask and millie quickly chose suitable glasses regardless of style and surprisingly so did turchin then when the rest of them looked at him wonderingly inquiringly he glanced from face to face and said eh what is it i mean dont you agree that im rather highprofile at which point the old lidesci who had been keeping watch said so are we and it looks like weve got company three uniformed policemen were heading across the car park toward them flashing their torches all of you jake snapped get round to the other side of the vehicle and quickly when they were there he gathered trask millie and turchin together and conjured a mobius door they clung to him until he dumped them in the corridor of ebranch hq then he returned for the others and repeated the procedure and back in bulgaria the three policemen looked at the minibus then at the open field of scrub behind it the slip road and beyond that the motorway and scratched their heads no one was there just the moon and the silvergleaming emptiness and a vehicle full of weapons and ammunition but at least the minibus was a regular vehicle not like that hearse theyd found on the other side of the airport with its engine ticking over and its doors wide open like an invitation from the grim reaper it seemed a certainty that both vehicles had been the property of whichever terrorist group had hijacked the vtol but as for the terrorists themselves within minutes of the teams return the hq was buzzing like a hornets nest trask told the duty officer to keep everyone the hell away from his group and took them to the ops room even here were not safe he told them when the door had closed behind them especially here these people have various talents it wont take them long to figure out whats wrong or what they consider to be wrong so we need to move fast weve lost most of our weapons said goodly and trask nodded use the intercom get on to john grieve tell him what we need but leave out the garlic bombs okay as for silver bullets well we cant do without them so well just have to risk burning our fingers then he looked again more closely at the precog garvey turchin and lardis and because of his dark glasses and the fact that garvey was sticking to branch protocols they didnt know what he was thinking and listen you four he said taking a deep breath i want you to understand you you arent necessary i mean youre excess to requirement this time when we move out im not asking for volunteers and lardis my old friend as for you its right out of the question youll stay here with lissa and all of the good people in ebranch will look after you and throwing up his hands he finished off by barking well thats it ive said what i wanted to say and paul garvey looking uncomfortable answered but you will let us think about it right trasks enigmatic dark glasses fixed themselves on the telepath and for a moment there was silence then he said ill tell you what to think about think about getting the perchorsk schematics up on that big screen i for one feel the need for a refresher and millie youve never been there youre letting me go then behind her glasses she raised her eyebrows do you want to try and stop me she said thats what i thought said trask and god knows we need you you need all of us said ian goodly he had done speaking to john grieve and the weapons were on their way and if i can get a word in edgewise here arent you forgetting something what this well all be in it together at the end shit said trask you cant argue with the future ben said the precog and again for long moments trask looked at his team especially at garvey until finally he said okay in the few hours we have left you can think about it but for gods sake for gods sake think straight theyre your lives people theyre your lives the perchorsk schematics were now up on the screen looking at them trask shook a fist well be coming for you soon now nephran malinari he growled youre not there just yet but when you do get there well be waiting millie said nothing but shielded herself and thought that old scar of yours ben still itching is it i understand and anyway i refuse to be jealous of a dead woman zek fdener was a wonderful person youre right to want revenge but trask hadnt stopped with malinari and continued and you vavara you hag i want you for lizs sake but especially you szwart if everything else fails me ive just got to have a crack at you then turning from the screen and apparently unconscious of what he was doing he glanced at millie hiding her embarrassment and a smile she would not otherwise have been able to conceal millies sunglasses saved her and if only for the moment everything was all right everything that mattered anyway coldweather gear trask snapped his fingers winter warfare kit and to goodly get on to the minister responsible well be needing three sets of white parkas and trousers our sizes that will be seven sets then said the precog and yes ben i really do have a great deal of faith in my talent while it can be miserly in its details rarely showing me everything still i can rely on what it does tell me have it your own way trask answered gruffly just make sure that stuffs delivered within the hour and then nodding to himself he muttered which leaves one other item i want to take with me he used the intercom to speak to john grieve john are we in contact with david chung yes came the answer i have his telephone number hes in glasgow scheduled to be airborne again about an hour and a half from now chung and his ecological chums they think they know where their quarry is and we know where ours is going trask answered try to get david on the blower for me will you patch him through to me in ops my pleasure said grieve and ben is there anything i can do for you i mean i really dont give a damn about the situation i dont think any of us do it looks like the world is going to hell anyway quite apart from any other er local complications for a moment trask was silent then said thanks john i want you i want ebranch to know that were on it everyone in here is on it we cant say what problems well experience further down the line but right now were all on track hell we know that said grieve his voice breaking up a little and then as an afterthought oh and there is one other thing tell turchin we had a message come through for him the things a bit esoteric and goes like this nest ransacked as expected egg in second nest hatched at pm moscow time and by pm the birds had flown and thats it thats it said grieve trask passed the message on to turchin and by the time he was finished grieve was patching david chung through trask took the call its a funny thing said chung but a little while ago i was checking out tonights flight looking at a map i had this feeling a kind of premonition and checked up on ebranch too i stuck my finger on the map london the city and like i said its a really funny thing or maybe not not said trask not from where im standing anyway so what did you locate david mindsmog he sensed chungs nod and the locator said i dont suppose its much good my asking if everythings okay down there i mean you know with jake and all everything is just fine trask answered knowing full well that his tone was speaking volumes for him telling a very different story with jake and with millie and with me too were all just fine for the time being anyway and after a long pause anything i can do said chung just do your job said trask and pretend its the most important thing you ever did even though it mightnt feel like it right now i mean when theres a storm blowing up even the little hatches are important perhaps even the most important everydamnthing gets battened down right and anyway we have all the help we can use at our end ill be thinking of you said chung huskily i know you will said trask but while i appreciate your concern its not why i contacted you and he told the locator what he wanted sure said the other its in my room right there in the hq youre welcome to it and theres really no need to explain why you want it good luck ben then trask called john grieve again and had a certain item taken from chungs room and delivered to ops while these things were in progress premier turchin spent time explaining something to jake i had fake documents leaked to all three of the militarist animals who would like to unseat me he said the letters hinted of a secret location a source of untold wealth in gold that general mikhail suvorov had discovered also that suvorov was there right now busily amassing incredible riches while these former close colleagues of his were barely surviving on cabbage soup and cheap vodka in moscow i knew of course that as soon as my defection or rather my disappearance from the earth year summit became public knowledge then my three enemies would begin hunting down this alleged eldorado and also that since this false information this red herring you might say had been leaked simultaneously to each of them theyd be obliged to join forces on this wildgoose chase not one of them would dare let the others out of his sight you see so theyd all have to be in it together hah the terms we use eh red herrings and wild geese still im sure you understand and where wild geese are concerned it appears these three birds are now in flight that message i received just now yes you are correct my apartments in moscow have been subjected to a very thorough search nothing was found because nothing was there i didnt want to make it too easy for them too obvious ah but a man of mine in zhukovka has been keeping an eye on my dacha there and earlier today about pm that too was searched this time they found what they were looking for your dacha at zhukovka jake frowned but didnt you say youd hidden the bomb there indeed turchin nodded and the bomb is still there for if they had found it my man would certainly have reported that too but thats not what they were looking for my leaked documents had mentioned all kinds of improbable things eldorado yes but also a modern scientific marvel a means of converting base metals into gold the philosophers stone hidden away in a secret laboratory somewhere in the urals the only thing that was missing was the location perchorsk said jake correct and in a wall safe hidden behind a picture in my dacha was a set of schematics very similar to the ones you see up there on that wall screen but why did i keep them secret in a safe in a dacha in zhukovka eh finally all the links in the chain that i had forged had come together and these enemies of mine had suddenly remembered suvorovs connection with the perchorsk complex the fact that hed been responsible or rather that he had assumed responsibility for the cleanup operation when that place was finally shut down and the birds have flown said jake at pm moscow time they left in an aircraft a military aircraft said turchin probably an air force jetcopter heading for perchorsk the necroscope finished itoff turchin nodded which means that by now they are there where theyll have come face to face with the hoodlums who run the place said jake they will have met them certainly turchin agreed they could hardly avoid it but a confrontation i think not for my enemies are clever schemers no less than general suvorov before them instead they will join forces with perchorsks convicts at least for the time being but while they are greedy dangerous men these hawkish militarists theyre by no means stupid when they see the gate they will doubtless recall that mikhail suvorov vanished a long time ago and still has not reappeared gone to the alleged eldorado well perhaps gone to his grave ah an equal possibility so then what to do you tell me said jake but isnt that obvious turchin replied they will send men who are stupid through that gate to discover what lies on the other side theyll send the convicts themselves said jake all of them very heavily armed exactly said turchin and nathan and his people in sunside will have another battle on their hands more szgany blood spilled but while the wamphyri were monsters as ive now seen for myself they were not armed to the teeth and they were not driven by the entirely human lust for gold so then surely you can see that my plan is the only way this way we can close the gate forever and at the same time rid the world of three ruthless militarists who especially in the current circumstances are an additional threat to peaceful coexistence and therefore to the entire planets security and said jake well also be blocking malinaris vavaras and szwarts bolthole that too turchin answered and perhaps well even trap them under a million tons of settling mountain but only if we get there in time but not too early said the necroscope surely it would serve our purpose far better to let your ruthless militarists and perchorsks excons join forces and have a go at the wamphyri together before we get there maybe we could arrive in the middle of the fighting stand off and watch the fireworks and step in at the last minute when theres less to be done excellent turchin clapped his hands but how very logical you have a sharp mind jake cutter i have a very clear mind for once said jake narrowing his eyes behind his sunglasses the cold devious and calculating mind of a vampire eh ah yes said turchin but far more quietly now and thats something i must watch very closely said the necroscope i cant afford to let the cold overcome whats left of the warmth in me so i suppose ill have decisions to make choices of which this is the first about lesser and greater evils he turned to ben trask who was studying the schematics and said i think youd better let me go and get premier turchins bomb if only to have it in reserve as a last resort trask looked at him ive come to the same conclusion he said but i was listening to your conversation and i can only hope its me thinking and speaking and i know what you mean said jake in moscow the night was chilly and overcast jake and turchin had emerged from the mobius continuum some hundred yards from the latters dacha on a wooded track it was the same place the selfsame coordinates that the original necroscope harry keogh had used all those many years ago when hed come here to visit the murdered gregor borowitz then head of the soviet unions ebranch and now jake remembered it well you are very cautious turchin whispered as he recognized the location from his own frequent visits so was harry keogh jake answered when he came here thats all very well said turchin but well risk being seen out walking in this wood in the dead of night you should have brought us a little closer than this no said jake shaking his head were close enough for now and then putting a finger to his lips keep very still and very quiet removing his dark glasses he lifted his head and sniffed at the air and his eyes were feral wolfish in the night then he looked all about at the leaden sky the silhouetted trees the gravel path winding away lapped at by the ground mist and finally as once again jake drew on the night air and held it in his nostrils so his head turned in the direction of turchins dacha well said the russian premier very quietly a cigarette jake whispered he rolls his own this one he uses inferior tobacco and he smokes them down to the tip he whoever he is on guard outside your dacha damn said turchin i hadnt anticipated this that the authorities would be on the lookout for you bab this has nothing to do with any authorities turchin replied something i perhaps didnt mention that i made provision for my cabinet to be informed that im not a defector but merely spending time in england where im avoiding the possible consequences of a death threat meanwhile special forces under my control are tracking down the wouldbe assassins here in russia therefore since this information was restricted to senior cabinet members whoever is waiting for me cannot possibly know it else he would not be waiting ergo he is not of the authorities but obviously an underling or hireling of the three this is something new said jake does trask know youre covering your backside like this playing both ends against the middle its possible i forgot to mention it turchin shrugged but trask is trask he would have known i wasnt telling all of the truth anyway what has any of that to do with what were doing here and of course the entire assassin story is so much bull yes yes its bull said turchin im not under threat except by these three who are on their way to perchorsk and we are wasting time jake nodded and said okay but you are the russian premier after all and this fellow at the dacha cant you talk him down he isnt here to be talked down turchin answered hes here to ensure that if i send someone to retrieve those schematics that if anyone goes near that dacha he wont survive to talk about it russian politics said jake yes no perhaps the other replied and sarcasm is the lowest form of wit and ben trask knows what hes talking about when he calls you a fox said the necroscope but youre right were wasting time so wait here and only come when i whistle leaving the path he moved silently into the shadows under the trees gradually disappearing into the darkness there and before turchin could even begin to work up an anxious sweat jakes whistle sounded the premier hurried along the familiar track slowing down a little when he saw saw the dacha looming in the trees there in the shadows under projecting eaves the necroscope was waiting for him and at jakes feet crumpled to the boards of the porch a figure in an overcoat lay partly obscured by swirling tendrils of mist his cigarette a mere stub was glowing fitfully where it had rolled away from him turchin looked at jake his gleaming eyes his thin lips smiling in a certain way and drew back a pace but jake only shook his head no he said no puncture gustav just a punch but i reckon hed passed out even before i hit him maybe half a second after i appeared out of nowhere right beside him now then wheres the bomb behind the dacha turchin answered in a ramshackle old woodshed built into the hillside a bolthole that borowitz had dug for himself a long time ago i discovered it in the winter a few years back after letting the pile of wood get very low i went to lift a log and it wouldnt come then when i tugged harder but youll see for yourself they went round the dacha to the back where jake saw that indeed the woodshed was a ramshackle affair there was no lock on the door and it creaked on rusted hinges when turchin dragged it open inside at the back an untidy pile of handysized logs was covered with moss and toadstools you left a nuclear device in here said jake and turchin nodded even if anyone knew i possessed such a thing this is the last place hed think to look he answered there is nothing here to attract the attention of thieves and even the lowliest tramp wouldnt sleep here so wheres the bomb said jake help me turchin answered and youll see oh and by the way there are two bodies back here bodies the chechens who helped me carry the thing said turchin unconcernedly in the end they er attempted to overpower me yes which left me no choice but to shoot them taking a deep breath the necroscope said now tell me is there anything else youve forgotten to mention no turchin shook his head i dont think so i covered them with lime and the last time i looked in here there wasnt much of a smell jake helped him shift the upper layers of logs to one side to about halfway down the stack the three bottom layers however were all bolted together and now pivot said turchin dragging the false woodpile away from the sloping earthen wall at the rear the entire facade pivoted on the left revealing roughly concreted steps that descended into the ground below the walls were of stone under a low ceiling propped up with timbers the floor was a crazypaved mixture of broken garden slabs and gravel central on a trolley stood the bomb a cylinder of shining metal some two and a half feet long by twelve inches in diameter connected to a timing device with windows showing hours minutes and seconds and in one corner of the dugout jake saw a whitelimed area of floor where two humped human figures lay still stiff and obviously very dead while turchin went to the bomb and wiped moisture from its casing with his handkerchief jake stepped into the corner and shifted lime about with the toe of his shoe for all his enhanced sense of smell the resultant odour wasnt too potent but it was of course the stench of death when youre quite finished over there said turchin all that remains for us to do is to wheel this thing into your mobius continuum and transport it back to ebranch hq and jake speaking almost to himself as if he hadnt heard what turchin had said muttered and heres a man who talks so eloquently of ruthless opponents eh what the necroscope looked at him his eyes burning i was just wondering how men who were attacking you got shot in the back he said does it matter turchin looked surprised i mean arent you forgetting something these men were from that same suicide squad whose leaders planned to reduce moscow to so much rubble if they had succeeded they would have died in the blast and if they had failed they would have been shot anyway so whats the difference when all of this is over said jake we can no longer be friends reallysaid turchin well the way i see it when and if ever this is all over well each and every one of us need all the friends we can get jake thought about that and said ill take the bomb while you go back out close the door and pile the logs you wouldnt want anyone else to come in here now would you turchin narrowed his eyes for several long moments remaining silent before answering very well but dont make me wait too long jake said no of course not but back at ebranch hq he took his time drinking a mug of hot black coffee leaving turchin on his own at the woodshed in zhukovka for a full twenty minutes before going back for him the winter warfare kit was delivered with black leggings to go under the white trousers this last had been trasks idea based on what the precog had told him that their last stand would be made in a dark place for trask knew that while outside the perchorsk complex in the deep urals ravine that housed it it would be white with snow from the sky or frozen spray from the dam inside was a place of shadows of gloom and frequently of stygian darkness white clothing would make good camouflage for the ravine but it wouldnt work inside the complex itself as the team examined and prepared their weapons dressed in their assault gear said various farewells over the telephones intercom and internet so the duty officer john grieve came to the ops room door and asked to speak to trask what is it john trask asked him at the door grieve barely glanced at trasks sunglasses before answering david chung was on the blower again he asked if we could fax him some recognition diagrams photographs schematics of a russian mikeclass sub he believes thats what theyre chasing and needs to take this stuff with him theyll be taking off in just over half an hours time i have a disc with the information he requires but ill have to use the big screen to be sure i get a printout of the right stuff or if youd prefer not to have me in there you can perhaps do it for me no i cant trask answered were pretty busy so youd better come in and do it yourself youre sure the others wont mind grieve was very diplomatic about it or perhaps he was simply being cautious were a bit of a mix in here john trask told him nothing seems to have changed not yet anyway no one will mind as long as you dont with which grieve entered and went to the big wallscreens console the screen was no longer in use the perchorsk schematics had been studied as best possible in the time allowed and in a few moments more the screen was displaying a concise history of latetwentiethcentury soviet submarine technology grieve began printing out the photographs and other details that chung needed and as the various frames were displayed so they attracted ian goodlys attention frowning and very obviously perplexed he moved closer stared hard at the screen for a long moment then staggered having seen what had happened trask went to goodly steadied him and asked what is it now ian what did you see this time the precog took a moment or so to compose himself and think about it before answering then he said cast your mind back a few weeks to a day or so before we went after vavara on krassos we were in your office you me and david chung the usual ritual you asked me if id foreseen anything refresh my memory said trask i had been having a string of glimpses flashes daydreams call them what you will said goodly at the time they were more or less meaningless they didnt relate to anything because they were scenes from the future trask answered yes now i remember you mentioned blackrobed figures drifting or floating vavaras nuns as it turned out their flowing gait and you spoke of a warren of burrows like giant wormholes in the earth all filled with loathsomeness like morbid mucus in a cosmic sinus i remember that well enough and i know now what it meant that place under palataki yes said the precog thats right but as i recall it i saw something else something that really didnt seem to relate to anything at all and just a moment ago looking at this wallscreen these schematics pictures diagrams of a russian submarine suddenly i saw it again and again trask remembered and was able to repeat goodlys precise words from that earlier time you saw something sinking deeper and deeper into groaning abysses of water jake had come to stand with them joining grieve trask and goodly where they stared up at the schematics and now he said you were seeing this boat that chung is looking for going down into the sea but youre a precog isnt it to be expected that youll envisage things like that in connection with what were doing but thats just it said goodly i mean this isnt what we are going to be doing none of us will be involved with it in any way its chungs thing not ours which makes it rather unusual my visions usually relate to me and the people immediately surrounding me its our future after all mine and whoever happens to be there to share it with me on this occasion however chung wont be there and we cant be at perchorsk and with him at the same time at which the necroscope remembered something went to where his discarded clothes were piled on a chair and took the fragment of hairbrush that chung had given him harry keoghs hairbrush from his inside jacket pocket the thing was quiescent now just a shard of broken wood and a few pig bristles but he would keep it with him anyway if only as a good luck piece and then he returned to the others where they were still looking at the big screen millie cleary had joined them and so had gustav turchin all long out of date the latter wasnt overly impressed with what was on the screen it is now millie told him but it was pretty new stuff some fifteen years ago this is a mikeclass vessel twin nuclear reactors using liquidlead coolant oh the premier looked at her curiously and said tell me my dear in addition to being a powerful telepath are you also an expert on submarines millie is expert in a good many subjects trask told him shes a walking currentaffairs manual and like she says all of this stuff was current affairs certainly to the british and us secret services some fifteen to twenty years ago now turchin was impressed a secondary talent no trask answered millie is a very quick study thats all and she has a head for details er such as now turchin spoke directly to millie it was like a challenge the liquidmetal coolant system was first used in the alfaclass attack subs she answered but it was very dangerous i mean without wanting to be impolite those nuclear submariners of yours paid for that coolant in a lack of lead shielding in fact most of those soviet subs were noisy dirty and lethal to the poor men who went to sea in them the first of the mikes is a case in point shes almost a mile deep southwest of bear island where shes lain for the last twentyodd years do you recall her name said turchin the komsomolets millie told him she went down due to a fire in her aft compartments the propulsion system and best not to try testing her gustav trask grinned at his astonished guest or just like that sub youll find yourself well out of your depth john grieve had got what he wanted and knowing it was very nearly time for the team to be leaving he shook hands all round and left minutes later looking at his watch turchin said by now my enemies are well established in perchorsk while yours or rather the worlds will soon be landing there isnt it time we were on our way trask agreed saying anyone who wants out nows the time to speak up but no one did and ian goodly said see what i mean and yes they all knew what he meant that the future would not be denied perchorsk in plan viewed or photographed from space which it had been often in a perilous earlier time the perchorsk ravine was a darkly enigmatic gash in the tortured landscape lying parallel with the mountains north to south in a huge fold in the northern urals the ravine was flanked by closepacked whitecapped peaks reminiscent of the shattered fossilized spinal plates of some primal stegosaurus the bottom of the ravine had been a watercourse subject to severe seasonal flooding but some thirty years ago it had been dammed to provide hydroelectric power for the disastrous perchorsk projekt upriver the manmade lake was full its surface leaden in starlight but the moon was up and climbing and soon the lake would gleam silver threequarters of the waters stood open to the night the rest lay hidden under a vast platform of reinforced concrete during the projekts early days this domed canopy had supported a roof of massive lead protection against radiation reflecting back from the sky but since the projekts failure and in the interests of the faltering russian economy the valuable lead had been stripped and transported away for use elsewhere while the lake appeared calm on its surface underneath it was a raging torrent channelled under the roof through sluicegates the water reappeared in four shining spouts that issued from conduits in the dam wall flung spume rising up from the deluge froze and fell or drifted back coating the ravines bed in feathery snow and decking its walls in curtains of glittering ice with the bulk of its contents restrained only a much reduced stream now followed the ancient course downriver on top of the dam wall four blockhouses stood guard each housing the controls of its respective turbine three of these squat sentinels stood silent and unmanned their turbines long since fallen into disrepair only the fourth the one closest to the complex was still working and then only very inefficiently feeding a sporadic stream of electrical power to the complex some sixty or seventy feet back from the dam wall a dully glinting army jetcopter stood waiting on the faded yellow x of a helipad landing zone its black grey and greenmottled camouflaged shape like that of some alien dragonfly perched on the concrete canopy the cold unblinking eyes of cabin windows stared out over the dam wall towards the yellow glow from huge steel doors in the wall of the ravine the entrance to the complex behind the planes black windows the pilot and copilot had their orders they had been sitting there for close on two hours now and would continue to do so for two more if necessary before issuing their first threats over the planes loud hailer the armourpiercing mm cannons in the jetcopters nose were also trained on perchorsks doors but independent of the airmobility of the chopper they could very quickly switch to the blockhouse at what amounted to pointblank range weapons like this could reduce the structure to so much smoking rubble in seconds in which event the energy that powered the complex would be gone along with the blockhouse armed nightpatrolmen keeping watch from a road dynamited out of the solid rock of the mountain the ramp that serviced the complex shivered uncomfortably in their parkas and kept moving making sure they werent in the line of fire and staying well back from the light that came flooding from the halfopen doors inside those doors in a cavernous service bay perchorsks bosses and their vip visitors from moscow sat around a blazing brazier locked in conversation or rather in negotiations the three vips though dissimilar in appearance were very much of a sort in their ambitions the only difference lay in how they would use their wealthbased power if or when such power became available communist hardliners in their time and still hard in their hearts they had seen their political ideologies and aspirations whittled away russias status as a world leader diminished and her armed might depleted to the point of decimation they wanted these things back and power returned to them and if that wasnt possible then the next best thing must suffice personal wealth beyond all dreams of avarice in which case let mother russia go to hell for they would be out of it the speaker for the three was exgeneral nikolai korolev a bigboned squareheaded bear of a man in polished boots a fur hat which he persisted in wearing embellished with four stars the insignia of his erstwhile rank and a furlined leather overcoat holding his hands out to the brazier and rubbing them briskly he said so then comrades galich borisov and kreisky good fellows all allow me to thank you on behalf of my colleagues for the grand tour you have afforded us whats more i commend your patience in waiting out these three long years in so desolate so isolated a place as perchorsk im sure that your er benefactor my old friend general suvorov will be most appreciative that is of course if ever he returns oh really a man called karl galich seated on the other side of the blaze replied in a voice like the purring of a big cat you doubt that hell return but why wouldnt he he made us several promises and kept at least one the most important of all to set us free else we wouldnt be here in perchorsk now so why should he renege on the others it seems to me that explanations are in order for instance why the delay why has it taken you so long to begin looking for him especially since the general was such a very good friend of yours galich was a tall slender handsome man very effeminate in his looks and sensuous movements but he was also a psychopath a serialkiller axeman who but for suvorovs intervention would still be serving out his triple life sentence in the ukhta penal colony patience karl patience korolev held up a hand unwise to go rushing at things and jumping to wrong conclusions yes mikhail is or perhaps was our mutual friend and he left a trail of clues for us to follow in the event of any unfortunate accident or even more unfortunate demise finally we have put it all together and tracked him down we now know where mikhail went if not why hes still there now you must allow us a moment or two to think things through for after all youve given the general three whole years as to why he hasnt yet returned and probably never will well reach a mutually satisfactory conclusion certainly in view of your loyalty your dedication to this dear old comrade you may not like that conclusion but well get there in the end nevertheless and then well come to a decision on what to do for the best only rest assured karl we shall honour the generals promises down to the last rouble or very last ounce of alien gold whichever but as he quit rubbing his hands sat back and appeared to engage in quiet contemplation in fact korolevs thoughts were elsewhere he was reflecting on everything that he and his colleagues had seen during the course of their guided tour of the perchorsk complex especially he considered the heavy rings of crudely hammered gold plainly visible gleaming on the fingers of this cutthroat trio galich borisov and kreisky selfappointed leaders of the exconvict factions now in control of the threedimensional labyrinth that was the perchorsk complex and complex was the right word for it indeed the only one korolevs coconspirators were igor gurevich a physicistcumsenior officer in the almost destitute russian air force a man who believed that the illfated perchorsk projekt should be resurrected as a shield against american air superiority and admiral maxim aliyev a sailor from the cold war school of soviet heroes who for his pains had been given responsibility for the safe decontamination and disposal of that eras oncemighty nuclear fleet but aliyevs mad answer to that specific problem was the reason why david chung was currently out over the north atlantic ocean his mind focused on probing for massive radiation leaks both of these menwho along with korolev made up premier gustav turchins trio of military opponents were in their early sixties gurevich was small sharpfeatured ratlike and swift in his movements aliyev was fat bowlegged bearded and slowmoving and when he walked he had a sailors swaying gait and right now both men in parallel with their burly often bullying industrialist colleague nikolai korolev were thinking back on what theyd seen here the complex roughly spherical like a giant bubble scooped out of the bedrock with its many levels zones and sectors areas both safe and unsafe some physically dangerous by reason of residual radioactivity others made fearful and mentally destabilizing by virtue of sights best left unseen korolev and his party had inspected onceimmaculate barrack rooms pigsties now for the convict scum who inhabited them they had visited a laboratory once equipped with the apparatus of modern science where nothing of value remained except some abandoned junk that perchorsks current crew had cobbled together into a still producing lethal potato vodka they had seen various demarcations signs and sigils like so much graffiti painted on the perimeter corridor walls and bulkhead hatches offering stark warnings of passage from one bosscontrolled zone to the next the inhabitants of perchorsk had separated themselves into factions not always as mutually cooperative as now and of course korolev and his colleagues had been shown the grotesque the nightmarish magmass levels and far more importantly the core the shining of the gate itself down there in the core where thirty years ago the worlds worst yet most secret accident had occurred when an atomic pile imploded ate itself and created the gate they had also seen the stinking remains of a burned and bulletridden creature not of this world its leatherandwood saddle reduced to little more than charcoal now had clearly defined this things function as a mount but for what strange species of rider for if he was half as fierce as his beast twice the size of a horse but unlike any horse or beast of burden ever seen before there was something about that cadaver where it lay on the steel fishscale disc surrounding the gate something other than its obviously alien origins that korolevs party found deeply disturbing for paradoxically despite its otherness there was that about the things limbs its eye sockets and entire skull that hinted of freakish mutations and even of some unthinkable human lineage which only served to make even more anomalous the creatures incredible jaws teeth and acromegalic paws equipped with claws like chisels and yet this thing from the gate a mere fighting brute a mindless warrior had worn a golden bit in its mouth a golden plate with a spike to protect its skull golden chains and attachments on its saddle and a ring of gold weighing half a kilo in its armoured nose sitting around the brazier it was the ratlike physicist igor gurevich who unable to suppress a shudder blinked first yuri borisov a squat bulldog of a man seated on aliyevs left noticing gurevichs discomfort pointed at him and said hah but you have been two shades lighter ever since you saw that thing eh comrade think nothing of it for youre not alone myself i no longer venture anywhere near the core for ive seen more than enough of that thing what it gave me nightmares it was threequarters dead when it burst through but the sight of it set men screaming like women before they managed to kill it i was one of them and im not afraid to admit it most of those holes in its mangy skull were put there by me what do you read minds gurevich grimaced no borisov grinned just expressions i could see that thing reflected in your eyes a creature like that it makes a nonsense of your physics your science eh and korolev said is that the reason why you havent gone through for fear of monsters like that waiting for you on the other side he spoke directly across the brazier to galich it could be one of the reasons galichs purr was more a growl now stung by what he considered an accusation of cowardice a slur he narrowed his eyes on the other hand we are loyal in our way to the general he told us to stay here and wait on his return myself borisov and kreisky weve since agreed to do just that and anyway why should we spoil a good thing we have a limitless supply of vouchers that we exchange for whatever we want at the penal garrison in beresov and compared to life in a gulag perchorsk is a holiday camp no offencenow aliyev spoke upbut its clear to me your waiting is in vain and loyalty be damned at this rate you could spend your whole lives here but that alien gold you wear can you imagine what you could do with a ton of it oh we have imagined sol kreisky a pockmarked bearded giant of man and a mass murderer of women answered and wevelong since decided on the split all that remains for us to do is figure out a way to bring it out ah said gurevich there is after all a problem then he nodded knowingly and went on i thought that might be the case this portal is in my line of work you see its properties are fascinating to a scientist such as myself when we were down there in the core i noticed how you men stayed well back from the gate and asked myself why im still waiting for an answer but i remember the perchorsk accident it was all hushhush and i could get no sensible answers to my questions then either there were various fantastic rumours however about a gate with properties like those of a black hole which once it has drawn you in permits of no return there you have it said galich yet another good reason why we havent followed mikhail suvorov through the gate but not good enough said korolev taking command of the conversation again and igor gurevich felt the industrialists elbow in his ribs warning him to shut up for the time being not good enoughsaid galich again you hint of cowardice perhaps you would undertake to lead us through this gate eh comrade and again you have misinterpreted my comments korolev tuttutted i make no accusation of cowardice indeed everything youve told us so far makes perfect sense but insomuch as you lack a scientists understanding of the problem your approach is wrong you see only the action and never the reaction or vice versa whichever he shrugged dismissively oh said galich and are you a scientist too both you and this this physicist here one glance at the gate and youve figured it all out is that it korolev sighed shook his head said no my knowledge of science isnt the equal of igor gurevichs but then again we dont share the same field of expertise you see where igors science is theoretical mine is practical i am an industrialist and as such far better at mechanics than physics mechanics its the science of the action of forces on bodies korolev explained kinetics statics and mechanical interactions er are you any the wiser please go on galich purred beginning to frown a little by all means enlighten me first tell me said korolev is it a fact that once you enter that sphere you have to go on galich nodded first the general and his expedition they experienced this problem they thought it might be a temporary effect and proceeded anyway but then they had no choice and eventually three of ours followed them well in fact we made them go through there is honour you see even among thieves and we had caught them stealing so they had a choice go and see what suvorov was doing see if they could help him in any way or refuse and die we were testing the generals theory that this was a temporary thing but it wasnt and now gurevich came in again with and yet that creature had no trouble at all when it came through from the other side i know said galich still frowning i have no explanation but i have said korolev the portal acts like a seesaw or better still a piston once up there is only one way to go and thats down again i still dont understand galich shook his head do you know how a slingshot works said korolev of course well this is the same thing just as you can fire a stone from botb sides of the catapult so you can use the gate its simply a matter of which way you stretch the elastic and like a piston you cant return until youve first gone all the way forward galich was on his feet now excited he was finally beginning to understand and simultaneously falling for nikolai korolevs clever explanation his lie in order to return he said first we must go right through to the other side is that what youre saying exactly said korolev and gurevich seeing the lie of the land said of course you are precisely right nikolai the gate is a twoway shunt but galich had sat down again and staring hard at the visitors through the braziers flames he said then tell me why hasnt suvorov returned and likewise the thieves we sent after him which brings us back to that unfortunate conclusion said korolev but one which we must surely draw listen and please try not to be offended i understand your loyalty to the man your loyalty to any man who would set you free but cant you see how he needed you he needed you yes to guard this place while he established his rights and amassed his fortune on the other side and as once again galich and also borisov and kreisky began to come to their feet now listen korolev quickly went on gold is gold yes but its only one kind of wealth i have known mikhail suvorov for a long long time and i know him well i cannot imagine he would stay long in an inhospitable world without meat and good strong booze and certainly not without lusty willing women is it any wonder that he and his party are still there not at all they are taking that place for all its worth and do you really think therell be room there for you but said galich his voice a growl now but isnt it perfectly obvious what happened when suvorov went throughsaid korolev also risen to his feet him and his men his soldiers his own heavily armed elite special forces they wiped out the local inhabitants on the other side that is what happened and as for that dead monster down there in the core fatally wounded in the fighting it escaped into the gate and found its way here and by now by now my good friend general mikhail suvorov rules in a rich beautiful parallel world that he will make his own before he returns to take this one if he can return galich snarled you see ive not yet accepted your theory youre pushing it too hard now tired of this circular argument korolev felt obliged to play his ace card then accept this he snapped theres something else you havent thought through another possible reason why its taking suvorov so long to come home oh this time when korolev jabbed gurevich the physicist knew just exactly what to say it had been on the tip of his tongue ever since theyd got here mikhail suvorovs expedition wasnt an entirely military operation you know he said he didnt only take soldiers with him but some very capable scientists too for all we know they could be working to create a gate of their own and if they do what price then for your loyalty and your allegiances eh galich sat down yet again but very heavily i dont want to believe it he said after a while and yet and yet you must korolev told him and you most surely will when you and your men under command of officers loyal to us go through and take it all back again only this time there shall be fair shares for all of gold yes and whatever else this alien world has to offer now what do you say about that i say galich snarled springing up and reaching inside his leather jacket and borisov and kreisky flanking him duplicating his actions i say ive had enough of military and exmilitary bastards trying to make fools and dupes of us and if this alien world is all you say it is then what do we need you for the three had guns in their hands and likewise their men who came surging forward out of the vast service bays shadowy areas but if they were armed so were their vip visitors and cold metal glinted in the red firelight at which point there came a disturbance shouting from outside the great doors transported by jake in two parties ben trask and the ebranch team had arrived just a minute or so earlier on a broad ledge under an overhang on the far side of the ravine they crouched behind drifted snow and observed the entrance to the complex now trask spoke quietly to jake how come youre familiar with this ledge i mean these coordinates i remember them jake answered matteroffactly harry keogh was here once in fact he was all over the place inside that complex its like a maze with many levels i know said trask me and goodly weve been in there too we probably wont remember it as well as you though turchin touched trasks parkaclad arm you see that jetcopter my enemies are here our timing couldnt be better you can say that again said trask because i think our enemies are here too or theyre about to be listen a moment later and they all heard it the faint throb of a small vtol aircrafts engines a throbbing at first but as it grew louder a sudden change an obviously irregular sound the sporadic sputtering and juddering of failing engines and look millie gasped craning her neck and staring at the wide strip of moonlit sky where a deltashaped silhouette was descending on spasmodic bursts of fire she isnt going to make it said trask that planes out of fuel malinari and his bloody friends have pushed it all the way pushed it to the limit and beyond and liz is on board jake breathed i can make a jump can you trask grabbed his arm can you look at the way shes falling steadying up then falling again theres no way you can judge it what if your coordinates are wrong you could end up underneath her frying in her jets frying or flying fuck it i have to try said jake conjuring a mobius door but at the last moment goodly stopped him its all right jake the precog said its all right well all be there at the end remember and that includes liz shes steadied up millie gasped her hand to her mouth look shes going to land close to the jetcopter the vtol scimitar was down to their level now maybe fifty feet above the gently domed reinforced concrete canopy behind the dam wall but her vertical thrusters were sputtering again and just when it seemed she was actually going to make it two of them cut out entirely the plane yawed wildly port wing and tail tilting striking the concrete canopy and tearing free if there had been any fuel left in the tanks that would have been the end of it but the fuel was gone used up and with its passenger cabin incredibly intact the scimitar crashed the last twelve or so feet to the deck as she hit torn metal screamed and bits of tailplane and crumpled wing went flying then she shivered and lay still the lights in her cabin went out and a mess of white foam came flooding from her ruptured belly a standard protection against fire on the other side of the ravine men in parkas were hauling on the service bays huge doors dragging them open while from the cavern itself shouted orders came echoing as running gesturing figures spilled out casting eerie shadows in the slowly widening arc of yellow light in a matter of seconds more than a dozen armed men were out onto the ramp while in the bay an engine coughed into life and a tracked snowplough came rumbling into view with binoculars to his eyes turchin said those three men standing together the ones who arent doing anything they are the ones i want dead if you think the earth is threatened now you cant imagine how much worse it will be if they should survive this trask said nothing but took the glasses from him and looked where he had indicated the three bosses had finished ordering their men into action now karl galich came running stuck a machine pistol in nikolai korolevs ribs and said is this your doing comrade a task force to backup your jetcopter those officers you mentioned wholl place us under their command no way you may have been a general in your time but im very glad i didnt serve under you as a tactician youre a total failure your men certainly wont fire on us while we are holding their leaders are you mad korolev rounded on him weve no idea what this is all about cant you see thats a private airplane it has nothing to do with us as for troops how many soldiers do you think you could cram into that thing in any case what on earth are you worrying about if the people in that plane survived the crash theyre almost sure to be severely injured but if theyre not yours what are they doing here said galich how should i know korolev put away his pistol threw up his hands and turned to his companions excuse me for enquiring he snarled but can one of you perhaps explain this is there something i dont know some precaution that someone may have taken without mentioning it to me gurevich and aliyev looked at each other disbelievingly then at korolev and aliyev said fuck you comrade you are the one with all the mouth so you explain it korolev puffed himself up and looked about to explode but before he could do or say anything else there came a burst of static from a side pocket in his overcoat and a tinny excited voice that said chopper one to general korolev whats going on what do you want us to do korolev looked at galich and said there does that sound like this is something we planned of course not let me speak to my pilot taking a miniature walkietalkie from his pocket he extended the aerial shoving harder with his weapon galich said be very careful what you say korolev grimaced paused a moment to nod his understanding then answered chopper one saying do nothing we have no idea whats happening how about you no the answer came back there was no call for help no radio communication that plane seemed to come out of nowhere and it almost landed on top of us it must be that they were in trouble and this was the only place they could land there have to be injuries do you want us to help but snatching the walkietalkie from korolevs hand galich answered that one himself no he growled do not interfere we have it in hand oh and incidentally we also have your vip bosses in hand so keep your fingers off those triggers meanwhile the snowplough with a driver and three armed men aboard had left the ramp rumbled up onto the canopy and come to a halt near the wrecked scimitar just a moment ago the four had climbed down from their vehicle and entered the plane via a sprung hatch now everyone on the ramp in front of perchorsks doors fell silent waiting to see what would happen trask and his team were waiting too and paul garvey said i cant see the wamphyri being much hurt by that crash the crew probably but not the wamphyri not a hope in hell said trask but what about lizjake muttered just try to stay calm trask advised him if your nerve endings feel as raw as mine which means theyre almost bleeding then i know exactly how you feel but dont try anything rash those four men who just entered that plane thats what i call rash look said goodly whats all this a survivor the four figures seeming inordinately bulky in their heavy parkas had reemerged from the sprung hatch the one in front the smallest of the four seemed to stagger he could have been shocked by what hed seen inside the wreck but the figure immediately behind him was holding him up apparently guiding him the last man the biggest of the four moved effortlessly even though he was carrying someone goodlys survivor liz jake had to hope so but while goodly was the precog he wasnt a telepath that was millies department and now she gasped thats them those four men they arent i mean only one of them is a man and the others are wamphyyyri said lardis lidesci is that liz that ones carryingjake shifted his weight from one foot to the other and back again a feral yellow glow escaping from behind his dark glasses suffused his upper cheekbones take it easy jake ian goodly warned him and like ben said dont do anything rash this isnt the time and it certainly isnt the place if it is liz said millie shes right out of it but i cant scan too close or theyll sense me the only reason they havent so far is because theyve got other things more important things on their minds but whos the one in front said trask a victim millie shuddered i cant feel any mind there at all only pain then the one behind him must be malinari the words came grinding out of trasks mouth nephran malinari stealing all he can straight out of that poor bastards head and the one with liz must be szwart the necroscope growled a rumble low in his throat i could be down there before they even knew it but again the precog said no and trask said for christs sake let it be jake everyone down there is armed you are what you are we know but a bullet in the brain would pay no mind to that it would stop you dead the true death and what chance for liz then the five figures had got aboard the snowplough with malinari at the controls it now headed for the defended blockhouse at first jerking stalling slewing this way and that finally the vehicle answered to his touch and ran true and since malinaris victim one of the exconvicts from the complex was of no further use he simply bundled him from the driving platform as he fell the braindrained mans flopping left arm got caught in a clanking track immediately dragged under he burst like a grape from the crushing weight and his shattered corpse was chewed by churning metal flayed and flattened as the vehicle surged on he left a hugely spreading stain on the concrete and a thin black trail that followed the plough to its target its target yes the blockhouse that controlled perchorsks power supply but aroused by the blood and the action hothead vavara had given the game away hurling aside her parka she stood erect in the cab of the plough aimed a machine pistol at the men on the ramp and let rip with a hail of lead her insane laughter could be heard even above the chatter of her weapon and the vehicles howling engine but unused to the weapons of earth her aim was off her bullets struck sparks from the face of the cliff above perchorsks huge doors and sent men diving for cover but other than that they did no harm still not knowing what was happening but knowing what they must do to stop it the men on the ramp answered fire with fire and they were more accurate metal on metal the automatic gunfire from perchorsks defenders left dents in the blade of the snowplough scarred its sides and had malinari and the others cowering from the buzz and spang of ricocheting bullets it lasted for a moment only before the snowplough crashed headlong into the blockhouse a wall crumbled and collapsed figures came scurrying from within some from the gaping hole in the wall others from the door they too were firing guns but unnerved by the suddenness of the attack and blinded by flying debris their efforts made no impression vavara on the other hand had the hang of it now she used her weapon like a scythe slicing among them cutting them down in another moment all three of the wamphyri had abandoned the snowplough and were inside the blockhouse and liz merrick went with them like a looselimbed doll flopping on szwarts shoulder from inside more gunshots as the lights in the blockhouse were extinguished then a row of spotlights in the walls of the ravine finally the lights in the service bay blinking out one by one as the last whining dynamo died then instantly the shadows of the ravine walls seemed to come alive crawling blackly over the concourse the shattered blockhouse the face of the dam and the entrance to perchorsk which left only the streaming moonlight to save the scene from total darkness opening skirmish the moon was up but still climbing as yet it silvered only one side of the gorge which left the complex side in multilayered shadows that changed from moment to moment shrinking or lengthening growing lighter or darker every time a wisp of drifting cloud cleared or veiled the lunar orb and in the streaming changing moonlight smoke was issuing from the wrecked blockhouse flowing over the dams superstructure and eddying towards the complex meanwhile a second snowplough had set out from the service bay loaded with heavily armed men who clung to every available space its headlights cut a swathe through the smoke as it churned for the crippled vtol once the vehicles crew had deployed there the men in the blockhouse would be caught in a crossfire from both the scimitar and the service bay but now the smoke from the blockhouse was spreading in that direction too toward the scimitar and the jetcopter its eddies uncoiling in an almost sentient manner like the arms of some immaterial octopus almost sentient on the ledge in the hollow cliff under the overhang lardis lidesci started and said eh whats this smoke without fire ah but ive seen just such smoke before and far too often the old mans adams apple bobbed convulsively but after swallowing to moisten his throat he went on ah no my bully boys and likely lass you cant fool me that isnt smoke not a bit of it its your mist your vampire mist and just look at it go aye and in a moment youll go too hidden in the heart of it the mist had reached the jetcopter it swirled thickened put out other tendrils that reached for the wrecked vtol and now said lardis now he was right barely visible shapes fleeting figures went loping through the mist making away from the blockhouse toward the jetcopter and again there came bright bursts of fire from the men now sheltering behind perchorsks halfopen doors they tried but it was like shooting at shadows and had just as much effect the second snowplough had reached the scimitar its passengers leaped free scattering some took up positions behind the fuselage while others went inside and in just a moment one of the latter used a walkietalkie to speak to galich three of our men are dead the other one is missing probably that mess on the canopy but god karl you should see the shit in here our boys and the flight crew theyve been cut to fucking pieces galich cursed and answered those bastards who wrecked the blockhouse they did this now theyre headed your way get out of that plane and take command of the men hold your fire until you see those mothers coming and then fire into that smoke or mist or whatever it is whoever they are i want these fuckers dead and korolev too was back on his walkietalkie talking to the crew of his jetcopter the stuff from the blockhouse is a smokescreen he was shouting its giving cover to a force of men who are heading your way they have to be special forces of some sort enemy forces so anything you see moving between you and that blockhouse take it out use those cannons and blow it straight to hell you should have them on your thermal imaging in which case you can open up on them right now in the red light from the blazing brazier karl galich spat his disgust onto the floor of the service bay stared his loathing right into korolevs face and said youd murder your own men just to uphold a lie and save your own miserable life well i reckon youre right and they are special forces theyre your special forces and you are a crazy fucking crablouse korolev told him then turned his back on him in order to follow the action as it developed beyond the doors it was the final insult and a fatal error for unlike mikhail suvorov korolev knew nothing of galichs past his record of blind rages and serial killings against men who had done no more than scorn or laugh at him and twice now korolev had cast doubts on galichs sanity effeminate and feline the exconvict might be but cats have claws and big cats have big claws and almost all cats are wont to strike without warning casually handing his machine pistol to one of his men galich unhooked a small steel hand axe from his belt weighed it in his hand and without further pause sank it to its haft through korolevs leather coat and deep into his back amazingly korolev didnt die immediately but simply stood there shuddering trying to reach behind himself with a spastic hand that couldnt quite grasp the axes handle finally falling to his knees in a flailing agonized pirouette he gazed up into galichs eyes and blinked twice his jaw hanging open and galich took back his machine pistol stuck its stubby barrel in korolevs yawning mouth and pulled the trigger blood and brains sprayed the door in the instant before korolev slammed into it and sat there his head falling forward with blood flowing over his shoulders turning his brown leather coat red only a few paces away igor gurevich and maxim aliyev dropped their side arms backed away and huddled together as galich and his men turned their attention on them i know nothing i mean absolutely nothing about any of this the rodentlike gurevicb squealed whatever is going on here i had nothing to do with it nor i maxim aliyev could scarcely croak his denial it must have been korolev we never could trust him we only ever wanted to do whatever was best for everyone concerned is that so galich came forward grabbed gurevich by the scruff of the neck and spun him toward the open doors and the pockmarked giant sol kreisky did the same to aliyev wait wait gurevich cried but heres your chance said galich a wonderful opportunity to prove your good intentions get out there and fight for us and he kicked gurevich out through the doors sol kreisky followed suit and with another kick sent the pairs side arms skittering out onto the ramp after them meanwhile the men at the wrecked scimitar hadnt been able to fire a shot the sinisterlooking jetcopter standing halfway between them and the blockhouse obstructed their vision no less than the tendrils of mist that seemed intent on blanketing and blinding them and as for the jetcopters crew in chopper one the pilot had penetrated the now dense mist with his thermal imaging but too late to do anything fleeting figures had vanished from the viewscreen before he could adjust the range and coordinate his fire whoever these special forces were they were already too close to the jetcopter to be visible on the planes scanning devices now receiving no answer from korolev to his frantic questions the pilot cursed and brought his engine into whining life prior to takeoff but again he was too late someone or some monstrous thing had clambered up onto the choppers nose in front of the black windows but behind the armaments and now that something was pressing its face or what passed for a face to the oneway window as it tried to look inside but jesus christ the pilot felt as though it was looking inside as if it could see him oh shit shit said the copilot having also seen that terrible face and once more shit oh shit as he saw the muzzle of a machine pistol turning toward the allegedly bulletproof windows at pointblank range the first burst of fire sounded like a dozen hammers striking so close together they were almost one the glass vibrated buckled and as if by magic a starbust of fine cracks like a pattern in thin ice struck by a stone appeared on the window then a brief pause before the second burst shattered the glass inwards in a spray of myriad tiny cubes in the silence that followed when the firing ceased and the choppers rotors whup whup whupped to a halt the pilot could barely believe he was still in one piece almost deafened by the sound of ricocheting bullets ricochets that had shut off the copilots gibbering and reduced the flight controls to so much smoking electrical ruin all he could hear was his own pounding heart but then when finally he summoned up the nerve to take his trembling hands from his face hands that were warm and sticky with his copilots blood the first thing he saw was szwarts hideous grin his entire face melting and reforming as the lord of darkness came flowing in through the shattered window to take him by the throat by then having left vavara outside where she continued to make mist and watch over the unconscious liz malinari was up into the nearclaustrophobic fuselage tearing the cockpit door from its hinges he came upon szwart about to bite the pilots neck no he said here take this one while his hearts still pumping but we need that one he grabbed the copilots loose body and dragged it through into the passenger area very reluctantly szwart released the pilot and flowed past malinari who in turn climbed into the cockpit the pilot was trembling like a jelly massaging his bruised throat trying hard to shrink down out of sight oh mother oh my god he managed to gasp who who are you i mean what the fuck are you im the man who will kill you malinari answered if you dont do exactly as i say you see that wrecked airplane yes yes i see it what of it turn your weapons on it said malinari do it now but there are men from the snowplough there i know there are men there you fool said malinari and i know they want to kill me but very well his patience used up he grabbed the pilots head between his sucking hands and as knowledge flowed from the pilot to the vampire malinari he absorbed what he needed and discarded the rest the targeting device was shot but the cannons remained in working order malinari used the manual controls to swivel the blastshielded muzzles toward the vtol notch by notch making rapid dullsounding adjustments kerchunk kerchunk kerchunk he lined the cannons up on their target something less than fifty feet away not quite pointblank but close enough then he called back into the cabin to his grotesque colleague lord szwart make finished in there when im done with the scimitar well make a run for that second snowplough its heavy blade will be our shield when we drive in through whats left of those great doors szwarts bloody snout rose up and he grunted those doors look solid enough to me but not for long said malinari this jetcopter points in the right direction and she has more than mere cannons and then he fired on the scimitar a private aircraft with no armour made even weaker by its fall the vtols shell offered no protection to the men taking cover behind it explosive cannon fire blew the wreckage apart punching holes through its fuselage as if it were papier mache and as the survivors ran so vavara was there to cut them down for she could see through her own mist as if it were broad daylight and with technical skills stolen from the pilot who now slumped drooling in his seat malinari armed and fired one of the choppers airtoair missiles in the service bay a squad of desperate men was trying to close the doors when the missile hit half of them were killed outright as one of the doors was blown off its rollers in three massive chunks and hurled back into the bay sprung bolts ricocheted like bullets and shards of sharp metal went buzzsawing in every direction it was more than enough for the remaining defenders coughing and choking in the smoke and cordite stench they retreated to the rear of the cavern where they took cover guarding perchorsks access routes on the opposite side of the ravine the necroscope was now more than ever concerned for lizs safety if i could only see her catch a glimpse of her through that bloody mist he said id go to her if she would only wake up and call me i know id be able to find her in a moment trask grabbed his arm jake i know this may sound stupid but right now shes safer with them she wont come to any harm from that rabble in perchorsk thats for sure they dont know what theyre up against but we do and its our one advantage so dont blow it now and anyway said turchin you have other things to do jake and trask looked at him and trask said the bomb indeed the bomb turchin nodded the way i see it just about every exconvict in the complex will be dropping whatever he was doing and hurrying to defend the place to defend himself so if you want to destroy the core the entire perchorsk complex now is the time to put the bomb down there we should at least plant the thing before the wamphyri get inside after that then it will be a matter of timing timing said jake of course said turchin you will want to allow yourself time to get liz out of there before the explosion and before malinari and the others reach the gate trask nodded but jake said youve got it backwards no ones going to even touch that timer until liz and my baby are out of it liz and your trasks jaw fell open dont ask me jake told him whatever you say trask answered anyway what you said about getting liz out of there first thats understood well okay the necroscope growled and then after pausing to calm himself i remember the layout in the core every coordinate the gate is surrounded by a saturnsring concourse of overlapping steel plates like fishscale armour but beneath the plates in the bowl of the core directly below the gate well i dont think therell be anyone down there it isnt the sort of place where anyone in his right mind would ever want to go unless theyve got around to filling in the magmass there are moulds down there twisted human figures in the magmass that dont bear looking at that would be the perfect location said turchin but i havent yet shown you how to set the timer i should come back with you to ebranch hq but jake shook his head no he said that wont be necessary you see gustav im not going to be setting the timer you are me turchin was taken completely by surprise why me because youre more interested in destroying your enemies than in closing the gate thats why and if its murder pure and simple that were talking about im not your hired assassin and after a moment is that really what you think of mesaid turchin do i come over as badly as all that what difference does it make said jake if were talking dirty work here youll be doing your own and if we arent youll be doing everyone a favour so what it boils down to is this are you a member of this team or arent you im here am i not turchin stood as tall as he could the necroscope nodded and youll be there in the complex in harms way with the rest of us so is it yes or no because if its no ill take you out of here right now back to moscow and from now on well know who were dealing with or not dealing with think it over gustav for its like you told me not so long ago if were lucky and there is a tomorrow were all going to need all the friends we can get but turchin didnt need to think it over if you position that bomb he said grimly then when the time comes i shall prime it as for my qualifications as a member of this team you havent seen what ive seen tapping a finger on the plastic casing of his nitelite binoculars he handed them to jake and continued those figures climbing the road up the side of the ravine unless i am very much mistaken they are igor gurevich and maxim aliyev in which case i must assume that nikolai korolev died in the blast when that door was destroyed and these two are running for their lives while they still can so tell me jake since i no longer have any enemies left in perchorsk how can i be planning to murder them there the necroscope nodded again smiled slowly and handed the nitelites back unused okay he said but dont go looking for an apology lets just say im very glad i was wrong about you on this one thats this one as for how you got this far well i cant say ive been much impressed by your methods its the difference between east and west turchin shrugged and grinned in that foxy way of his its politics my young friend but i think youll find the end will justify the means jake didnt answer but without more ado conjured a mobius door and disappeared into it a few loose flakes of snow where hed been standing were picked up and swirled in the vacuum of his departure and trask said gustav were hundreds of miles from anywhere and im already feeling the cold your old chums aliyev and gurevich cant possibly make it so it looks like its all worked out for you i know turchin answered grimly they are doomed to die anyway but not by my hand i laid them a trail to follow yes but they didnt have to take it i didnt bring those men here ben greed and their lust for power did that aye the old lidesci grunted and thats something that holds true for both worlds probably for all worlds for those are exactly the same things that brought the wamphyri here paul garvey nodded and said and now theyre desperate to get out of here no less than gurevich and aliyev desperation yes said the precog thats about all you can expect from them from now on theres only one way back to starside and they know it and its a defended route at that thats true said millie but look theyre going for it anyway and god help anyone who gets in their way from the back of the service bay fifteen guns were trained on the open space at the entrance where one door had been torn to bits and the other stood half open the blazing brazier amazingly untouched by all that had happened burned red as before its fiery heart a marker at the far end of a seeming tunnel of darkness there came the rumbling growl of a snowploughs engine at which six of the fifteen slipped away unnoticed deeper into the complex in search of places to hide or perhaps karl galich lone survivor of the three bosses dazed and bloodied from a gash in his forehead though he was was nevertheless aware of their cowardice for now he raised his voice in a harsh warning any man who runs without a fight answers to me but his answer wont matter because ill kill him anyway so stand and fight you worthless bastards and remember this these bloody special forces whoever they are and no matter how good they seem to be theyre only human theyre just men like you and me he had no way of knowing how very wrong he was the rumbling grew louder began echoing through the cavern and preceded by a twofoot deep rolling bank of mist the snowplough appeared as a silhouette against the silverygrey oblong of the entrance jolting and shuddering clattering where its caterpillar tracks lifted it up over various mounds of metallic debris and flattening several less solid obstructions including some that squirted it advanced through the mist and bore down on the brazier in a cloud of stinking blue exhaust smoke use the brazier to gauge the distance and get your range galichs voice was hoarse with rage now and perhaps with something of fear when those coals are spilled let that be your signal to open fire useless someone shouted back a waste of good lead the ploughs blade is up galich cursed and yelled back then use the stanchions and cavern walls if you have to and go for ricochets but whatever you do dont even think of surrendering weve seen what they can do these mothers they play really rough and they arent the kind who take prisoners the brazier toppled and was crumpled under scattering redhot coals like a flood of rubies across the caverns floor and perchorsks defenders opened fire a hail of bullets struck sparks off the snowploughs raised blade others whined viciously where they took chips out of the cavern walls or scarred the stanchions that supported the roof but the snowplough came clattering on neither slowing down nor deviating a single inch from its course its unstoppable collision course with flesh and blood and were out of here galich gasped when there was nothing left to say or do except retreat or die but only seven out of the nine made it into the complex while the other two left it just a little too late and went down screaming under the snowploughs bloodied tracks but the way had narrowed down and malinari was too slow in finding neutral and the brakes so that the plough slewed sideways when it hit a wall and jerked to a halt but no harm done for by then all that remained of the defenders was the sound of their running footsteps beating a hasty retreat through perchorsks many mazy corridors jake dragged the trolley with its lethal load out of the mobius continuum onto the glasssmooth rock at the bottom of the core the core was a perfect sphere eaten out of the bedrock when the perchorsk experiment had gone disastrously wrong and an atomic pile had devoured itself a bubble with a diameter of fortytwo or fortythree metres it had been all that remained of the pile of the equipment surrounding it and of the physicists who operated it the core and at its core the perchorsk gate a second far smaller sphere of blinding white light a gravitydefying singularity its outer surface an event horizon suspended in midair dead centre of the bubble and slicing into the cores curved smoothly polished floor and walls at every imaginable angle drilled through the solid bedrock in the instant of implosion scores of precisely circular shafts or energy channels like wormhole escape routes for the alien forces that had been trapped here now being at the bottom of the bubble in the bowl of the core the necroscope felt the blinding light almost like a physical weight on the back of his neck and looked up at its enigmatic source the lower hemisphere of the gate it glared like a cosmic light bulb like the sun itself but its light was without heat even wearing sunglasses still jake shuttered his eyes and looked away blinding yes but the gates dazzle was the least of his problems for with harry keoghs memories of this place jake also knew that if he tried to use the mobius continuum too close to the singularity it would create a completely ungovernable conflict of alien energies when harry had first come here he had done just that and the resultant backlash had hurled him immeasurable light years out into space then only the long dead august ferdinand mobius himself had been able to guide him home again jake wasnt about to duplicate harrys mistake but already he knew how close he had come for even in the act of conjuring his door prior to exiting the continuum he had sensed it fighting him seen its instability how it warped and fluctuated in the gates invisible force fields this close then and no closer and now another problem the trolley was heavy and the bomb it carried even more so and despite the necroscopes newfound expertise and harry keoghs memories still hed failed to arrive dead centre of the bowl and finding their level the trolleys wheels turned on the curved floor and one of them tilted into a wormhole at that the trolley jammed into immobility but its clatter had been heard up above in the ominous silence of the core the sound rang out with crystal clarity its metallic echoes bouncing from the wormholeriddled walls likewise the harsh voices that reached down to jake from above the fishscale plates what was that did you hear that the necroscope couldnt be sure what was said for it was in russian but he could certainly guess and he froze where he crouched beside the trolley at which there came another voice a deadspeak voice that startled him because now of all times the teeming dead werent much given to speaking to him necroscope is that you harry it seems like an age and i really thought that you must be dead too a girls voice and jake recognized it at once penny an innocent some poor kid whod got too close to the original necroscope at the wrong time and ended up down here jake remembered her and felt a lump in his throat but harrys emotions not his no he told her necroscope yes harry no harry was i dont know my mentor me im just jake jake cutter but at least you were right about one thing harrys been gone from us a long time most of him anyway and from up above where for a while thered been a breathless silence rats someone said it could only be rats the fucking place is crawling with them only this time recognizing jakes confusion penny heard the words through the necroscopes ears and translated them for him you know russian he said i have lots of friends here she answered its bow we pass the time ive learned lots of things harry er jake but russian physics too penny told him its really amazing bow death focuses your concentration ill take your word for that said jake and then unintenionally thoughtless you were pretty stuck on harry right oh yes she answered harry was taking me to a world wbere wed bave a great high house under a tumbling moon he would be the lord and id be his lady but i wasnt paying attention to the tbings be said this is where he lost me or i lost him but it wasnt harrys fault ive often wondered if be cried for me wondered if he was able to and knowing that penny would feel it in his deadspeak jake nodded and said he was able to for a little wbile anyway while overhead bloody big rats said the first voice dubiously to make a racket like that anyway what the hells going on we should have been relieved by now what happened to the power the fans have stopped and now the lights in the tunnel are out i dont like any of this like ive been trying to tell you said the second voice it has to be the rats maybe theyve chewed through a cable or something and that noise down there in the bowl rats could be said the other down in those wormholes there are cysts with meat in them still all turned to leather where theyre completely enclosed and every time a cyst cracks open or gets gnawed through its like hey you furry fourlegged comrades a free lunch then tired of the subject look if youre so fucking worried about it why dont you go down there and check it out for yourself what are you crazy the answer came back i dont even like being here never mind down there but perhaps id better go take a look through the hatch just a quick look jake unfroze prepared himself to drag the trolley free of the wormhole and through a mobius door but at the last minute there came the tinny bicyclebell ringing of an antique field telephone and now what said the one who had been going to come and have a look better answer it said the other maybe someones going to tell us whats happening up there jake heard footsteps on the perimeter walkway a low muttered conversation then a shout as the telephone was slammed down in its cradle hey were out of here it sounds like all hell has broken loose and every available man is defending the complex what defending perchorsk against what what am i fucking psychic move your arse comrade then the sound of booted feet hammering on the walkway their echoes fading into the distance penny said jake as he carefully disengaged from the trolley and saw that it was safe and wouldnt tilt any further im going now but before i do i just think id better tell you and your russian friends that if things work out therell be a bell of a big bang down here i mean we know what you mean she cut in its been in your mind all along as for these physicists theyre not at all unhappy it seems theyre finally going to find out what its like to be at the centre of a nuclear explosion and who can say if there are places beyond better places maybe this will help speed us on our way and maybe ill find harry there goodbye jake and good luck jake climbed rungs to a hatch got up onto the walkway and took a look at the core it was much as he recalled it except thered been three katushev cannons upon a time now there were only two and a strippeddown frame whose parts had been cannibalized to service the ones that were still working their squat ugly muzzles were pointing at the gate of course jake assumed that after that warriorcreature had come through from starside the guns had quickly been put back in working order and perchorsks exconvicts had kept them manned twentyfour hours a day from that time on but aware of the seconds and minutes ticking by the necroscope had no more time for any further observations trask and the others were waiting for him and liz was still in the clutches of the wamphyri back on the ledge under the overhang trask breathed a sigh of relief when jake stepped out of the mobius continuum and told him okay ive positioned the bomb whats next right trask answered the way i see it we have to lay our ambush down in the lower levels on the approach routes to the core gustav youll be located with the bomb youll have to be there anyway in order to prime the thing which youll do as soon as weve got liz out of the way in a hurry now he turned back to the necroscope when we last saw liz szwart had her so hes all yours it could even be that he has a little respect for you he knows what you can do and was there when you wrecked his garden but i need someone a volunteer to go along with you because i cant help feeling that szwart will be our most difficult target me said millie at once i volunteer szwart owes me since they were running out of time trask couldnt waste it arguing with millie but still his heart skipped a beat when he answered okay and in any case well be fairly close together down there all of us he turned to the precog but goodly beat him to it saying vavara is mine ben i nearly bought it in her labyrinth under palataki so now its my turn me and paul if hes willing we should make a pretty good team while i try to glean what shes going to do paul can perhaps get into her mind and corroborate what shes doing he looked at garvey who said sure why not what can i lose except my life finally trask turned to the old lidesci which leaves just you and me old friend you me and malinari lardis grunted for zekintha aye for all of us said trask everyone everywhere and he looked at jake thats it were ready two things before we go said the necroscope theres no power now in the complex no lights but we do have those three halogen lamps that we brought with us theyve got to go to the people who need them most millie for one if we get separated the brilliant light from one of those lamps might be sufficient to back szwart off he cant take strong light that leaves one lamp for paul and ian and one for lardis as for gustav hell have all the light he needs from the gate itself good said trask so whats the other thing not so good said jake right now in perchorsk malinari will be looking for someone who knows his way around the place which probably means just about any one of those excons hell drain his victim of his knowledge and after that hell know as much about the complex as as someone who has lived here for three years youre right of course said trask with malinari leading them those monsters wont be blundering around down there theyll know exactly where theyre going our only advantage that is if we have one lies in the fact that they dont know were here not yet anyway which leaves us with no room for error said the necroscope and no time to spare he turned to turchin you first comrade and turchin said what greater sacrifice eh the russian premier gives his all for his people his country his world right said jake moving close to him itll make great headlines in izvestia if we ever get out of this the final battle beyond the complexs cavernous service bay a tunnel lined with storage rooms led to a hatch that in turn opened on a junction of rockhewn corridors and from the junction onwards right left and straight on all routes except down were available as for the latter a boardedover shaft in the solid rock floor was all that remained of an earlier stairwell to the nether levels wrecked in the first terrifying moments of the perchorsk experiment when shockwave vibrations had caused bolts to shear and had reduced the relatively flimsy structure to a heap of concertinaed scrap one hundred and ten feet down the shaft it had never been rebuilt since there were several other routes to the core and since in the aftermath of the disaster perchorsk had been more or less written off its funding cut to the bone repairs hadnt been deemed a priority in the three horizontal corridors karl galich had deployed six men including himself their instructions were simple anything but anything that came through the hatch an oval door five feet high and set in a steel bulkhead was to be cut to ribbons with concentrated gunfire in galichs own words ive had more than enough of foreplay now we fuck and if these mothers so much as stick their noses in here ill have them in a crossfire i want their blood and guts all over the walls and floor in payment for what they spilled outside and now from twentyfive feet away with their electric torches and weapons lined up on the hatch the six waited in ambush never suspecting that just beyond the bulkhead malinari the mind was listening to their very thoughts the complex was silent now no humming from the motionless fans no booted feet tramping the endless corridors no voices echoing in the still heavy air but it was an ominous silence like the dead calm that warns of a coming storm the hatchs locking wheel squealed as it was given a tentative turn then the wheel spun and the hatch cracked open as it was hurled back on its hinges torch beams stabbed at the darkness and galichs men took up first pressure on their triggers but nothing was moving in the frame of the hatch then it was mist a corpsewhite living mist that came crawling over the lower lip of the hatch swirling into the complex a vampire mist coiling across the floor and thickening as it came until the hatch itself was obscured its outline fading swallowed up in the total opacity of the stuff it took only a matter of seconds for galich to realize what was happening here exactly the same thing that had happened outside and then he drew breath and yelled open fire into the mist fire right into this this whatever it is and his men needed no further urging sensing something of the alien otherness as their skin began crawling they were only too glad to oblige and the clamour was deafening as they blasted away at the place where they believed the hatch to be or rather they hosed fire on an area that vavaras beguiling talent had told them was the hatch but it wasnt and suddenly the four men in the corridors that angled to left and right of the hatch had adjusted their aim to target each other the firing commenced and as quickly ceased and in its wake there was only the hot stench of cordite and fresh blood slumping shadows and choked screams gurgling into silence but in the straighton corridor galich and his secondincommand were unhurt and what the fuck is going on galich whispered as he loaded a fresh magazine into his machine pistol his hands shaking so badly that he could scarcely draw back the cocking lever and his secondincommand said this mist is like its like living slime karl i can feel it crawling on me and in that same moment from directly above them lord szwart said ahhhh as he came seeping down from the ceiling semisolid one moment in the next szwart was muscle bone chitin claws and mantrap jaws and wrenching the russians weapons from their nerveless fingers he hurled them aside and slammed the pair up against opposite walls half stunned they would have fallen but vavara and lord nephran malinari were there flowing out of the vampire mist their eyes burning and their overly long arms reaching out with irresistible strength and this one said malinari sniffing at galich with a wrinkled snout his fingers writhing like snakes as they grasped the exconvicts head is mine one of their leaders he knows all the mazy ways of this place he has learned them by heart now in just a little while i shall learn them too then glancing at vavara and lord szwart in an unaccustomed fashion with his jaws gaping and his eyes madly ablaze he said allow me allow me a moment or two before i take what we need for i have worked my mind hard tonight and i begin to feel to feel the strain so many voices shrieking their fear my head aches with their thunder how much may a single mind contain with impunity i wonder as often before ive wondered how many thoughts how much knowledge what quantity of pain before the brain succumbs and clutching karl galichs head in one huge lilypad hand he used the other to mop his livid face and brow shaking his head as if to clear it of all the babble but then seeing the way his companions were looking at him sensing their curiosity at his apparent weakness malinari controlled himself and continued meanwhile before we go back for the girl the pair of you can do as you will with that one aye for the sooner be stops thinking the better a death warrant on galichs secondincommand which szwart and vavara wasted no time in serving the approach route to the core that was where trask had determined to ambush the wamphyri and that was where jake had taken the remaining members of the team after positioning gustav turchin in the bowl under the gate with his deadly nuclear device but while trask and the precog had been here before and jake too insofar as he remembered it the rest of the team were newcomers here and as such they hadnt known what to expect just as well for in the nightmare scenario of their coming battle the gates close environs made for a perfect setting perfectly nightmarish first to be deployed goodly and garvey found themselves on opposite sides of a wide heavily timbered badly scorched catwalk that descended through a region of sheer fantasy now they formed a part of that fantasy or more properly that horror for they looked up at the catwalk from a grotesquely humped bed of magmass that stretched away into the dim recesses of a weird chaos a great disorder an utterly alien landscape no light here but what little came filtering up from below from the gate itself for even when electricity had been freely available it had never been routed through here this had been the unanimous decision of various overseers over the years that this was a region best kept unlit which no sane eye would ever want to look at yet now the telepath and the precog were very nearly a part of it kept separate only by their clothes and the thickness of their skins and despite that goodly had been here once before still he wished his skin was thicker as for what the telepath paul garvey thought of this place in fact he tried not to sprawling in deep manshaped moulds or depressions in the magmass finding cover in these human templates these matrices of men who had been trapped in the backfire from the failed perchorsk experiment men who had died here goodly and garvey tried to avert their eyes from their surreal surroundings only to find it impossible for wherever they looked the magmass was there the precogs eyes were fixed on the catwalk following its descent through an awesome maze of fused stone crumpled metal and warped plastic extrusions where on all sides those smoothbored energychannels wound and twisted like wormholes in soft earth except these holes were cut through bedrock solidified lava and buckled steel girders the hideous magmass yes paul garvey was rather more successful in his mental avoidance of the magmass in the alien terrain on the other side of the catwalk the telepath was attempting to concentrate his attention in the other direction up the sloping vista where the wooden catwalk emerged from a shaft in a solid rock wall his powerful halogen lamp was located within easy reach in the burst bubble of a magmass cyst it was switched off for the time being but its beam had been tested and was focused on the nightdark shaft if or when anyone or anything appeared in that opening garveys brilliant beam would reach out to define startle and blind it or so he hoped so the pair were situated and so they waited the telepath probing for mindsmog however warily and the precog praying for a glimpse of the future and both of them fearing what they might discover they were armed of course with sidearms and grenades but neither esper felt in any way superior or even equal to what they must surely face here both of them were well aware of the tenacity the audacity of their enemy the best they could hope for was that pauls lamp their protective garlic sprays and their firepower would drive malinari and his monstrous companions straight along the catwalk to their next confrontation and on the way the men from ebranch would focus their fire on vavara trying to remove her from the final equation but why vavara why the female and presumably the weakest of this awesome species first for one because it was unlikely that she would be carrying liz and two because vavara could turn the minds of men trask and the others they had to be sure that if they fired at something it was what they actually saw and not what they were made to see these were reasons enough the witch must go first and there in the place of the magmass the precog looked to the future and saw nothing and the telepath searched for mindsmog and found it rushing headlong down through the tortured bowels of perchorsk toward the core and only himself goodly and their ebranch colleagues to halt its charge ben trask and the old lidesci were next in line a little less than one hundred feet deeper in the heart of the complex where the magmass was relatively free of those twisted and frequently inverted human templates those hideous reminders of the agonies once suffered here theyd taken up positions at the foot of a cliff of black fused rock close to the perfectly circular mouth of the downward slanting tunnel that led to the core but for all its lack of gargoyle figures and mutant moulds still the magmass here was magmass and unearthly so that once again the thought occurred to trask just as it had when first he saw this place that the perchorsk accident if accident it had been and not a form of higher retribution had resulted in the release of alien forces utterly outside mans knowledge forces that defied earthly science he lay on his front behind what looked like a frozen black wave in a potholed or whirlpooled lake of magmass and couldnt help wondering what it had looked like in flow at the moment of meltdown and how he would have felt to be trapped in it but since that simply didnt bear thinking about he quickly redirected his thoughts to the old lidesci and wondered what he was making of all this lardis had taken cover behind what had once been a stanchion that was now bent over in the form of a stylized magnet and he was so quiet that if trask had not seen him locate himself there he would have been certain that he was alone this was a szgany survival mechanism trask knew which sunsides tribes had evolved through immemorial centuries of wamphyri predation in the old days and some not so old when the vampires were wont to come raiding out of starside on their manta flyers the szgany had fled into hiding and willed themselves out of existence they hadnt moved they hadnt spoken they hadnt thought and they certainly hadnt used garlic to protect themselves that would have been a dead giveaway for only cut or crushed garlic had the strong scent and garlic couldnt crush itself lardis was employing the same mechanisms now he was here and he wasnt here when the wamphyri came down the stairs from the catwalk and followed the base of the cliffs to the illumination from the core they wouldnt or shouldnt detect him similarly trask was also protected his talent was by no means common and unlike telepathy and the skills of the locators it did not disturb the psychic aether or cause him to glow in the dark if he could manage to keep himself to himself shield himself as his espers would have it he might remain undetected in a clump of magmass stalagmites until the last possible moment and that would be the moment when he and lardis lidesci opened up on lord nephran malinari malinari the name burned in trasks mind like acid it was a pain on his nerve endings a torment in his heart zeks loss was something that wouldnt couldnt ever be eradicatedbut it could be avenged at least the pain could be salved the torment eased and the burning partquenched but not until malinari or trask himself one or the other was dead and only the true death would suffice that was why he was here and that was what he would do for if trask had considered himself tenacious and determined in the pursuit of this great vampire before there was now that in his blood in his no longer entirely human system that made him far more so and if he should be the one to die well so be it his future along with the worlds was in any case uncertain now and his only regret would be in losing millie too but then again perhaps she was already lost millie liz the necroscope and trask too all of them lost to what continued to consume them and consumed them ever faster even as they waited to confront it at its source the third and last party consisted of millie and jake there in the core jake helped his partner settle down into the bucket seat of a twinmounted katushev cannon for they had realized shortly after trask deployed them as soon as millie had seen the gate that ball of brilliant white light suspended in the centre of the core that she would scarcely be needing her halogen lamp even wearing her sunglasses she couldnt look at the singularity for more than a few seconds but that worked to everyones advantage the lamp could now go to trask or the precog who were more in need of it and in any case the katushev was a far more devastating weapon and its lethal effects more permanent the only problem now was that jake didnt know how to operate the thing but he believed he knew how to find out that would involve deadspeak but since his every unshielded thought was deadspeak it required no great effort on his part there has to be someone down here he said who understands the workings of these weapons you russians you soldiers who died bere doing your duty way back in perchorsks early days i could use a little help long seconds ticked by and no answer but then let me speak to them said penny you see necroscope even down here the great majority have had something of a voice and the comrades here were warned off long ago but if there really are other places beyond death and if that bomb of yours really is a different kind of gate eh a coarse cold voice cut her off that of an exrussian soldier which jake understood because it was deadspeak mental communication which like telepathy knew no language barrier do you think thats possible necroscope i dont know jake could only shrug if i said yes absolutely id be lying but then again i lived a full life without knowing there was this place neverguessing that the dead go on so what do i know the only thing i do know for sure the original necroscope died in the atomic blast of a weapon on the far side of the gate a weapon fired through the gate from this very spot and yes i can definitely guarantee that he went on for im the living proof and another voice said im gunner golovin or i was those katushev cannons were my babies i maintained them you want to know how to fire em im your man excellent said jake with feeling but its only right that i should warn you we could experience a little interference a little deadspeak static maybe from the great majority fuck em said the other way down here out of sight and almost out of our minds we take care of our own and what the hell the teeming dead never much bothered with us anyway they warned us off so what if theres a way out of this we should take it and if there isnt what have we got to lose and finally another voice but one that jake recognized at once it was zek foener who knew this place only too well and she said jake the great majority are aware of what youre trying to do the only thing you can do and this time you have their blessing but deadspeak often conveyed more than was actually said and jake was adept at reading between the lines there are vampires in the world he said and the teeming dead want them gone but they do mean all of them all of us right he sensed zeks nod and sadly its the way things have to be necroscope she said and then as she began to drift away theres just one thing just one more little thing that you can do for me jake if you will and id be obliged if youd do it before before anything else happens youve been my friend said jake so name it and she did and was gone and then jake and gunner golovin showed millie how to operate the katushev cannon but just as they were finishing ahhh said millie her eyes opening wide what is it said jake who believed he already knew she looked at him and her face was pale and drawn but pale from what she was or from what she knew he couldnt say until suddenly she projected a thought directly into his mind telepathy for the first time with a person other than liz millies vampireenhanced talent coming into play and malinari and the others she said theyre coming what do you seejake asked out loud is there any opposition have any of those excons survived human minds said millie minds free of mindsmog only two and strangely they know all about these katushevs synchronicity i suppose theyre creeping like a pair of terrified mice they know that somethings very wrong the silence the stagnating air the lights that dont work the fact that no one bothers to answer their calls so that now theyve stopped calling just the two of them jake theyre all thats left i know who they are said jake they were up here when i was installing turchins bomb when the place came under attack they got called away called to their deaths millie now whispered concentrating her talent on listening the mindsmog is closing in on them the wamphyri know theyre there they can smell them maybe youd better get out of there said the necroscope thoroughly alarmed now once those men are finished well be the only ones left our minds if malinari catches you probing like that hell know were here she looked at him and cocked her head on one side do you really think he doesnt already know i wish i could believe that jake but he has liz and he knows that sooner or later youll try to get her back before he could answer ahhhh millie said again and yet again ahhhh two minds snuffed out she breathed deeply and lay back in the katushevs seat those poor men they never knew what hit them but youre right and im out of there now how far away were they said jake close said millie and by now theyre closer still for theres no longer anything to delay them and theres one other thing you should know i think liz could be waking up just as i got out of there i sensed another mind it was very familiar female afraid and it was groping for consciousness liz unharmed he could scarcely believe it shes a survivor said millie the moment she wakes up the moment she calls for me i have to go to her said jake but only if youre sick of living said millie and only if you want liz to die too best to play it according to plan necroscope shes their lure for you and the moment they take you she dies or worse damn it all to hell said jake under his breath if only i didnt feel so bloody useless you want something to dosaid millie then why not take that lamp to the precog and paul garvey theyll need it a lot more than we do and if they dont already know about the wamphyri tell them say that theyre coming and fast and on your way back you can warn ben and lardis too jake had to admire her necroscope though he was she sometimes made him feel like a schoolboy millie cleary he said youre one cool lady but not yet a lady she answered with a wry smile and as long as im just cool and not cold well ill be all right taking up the lamp jake did as she had suggested but before leaving trask in the magmass wasteland he remembered a message hed promised to pass on and ben he said zek was here zek trask started a little then scowled and said what do you mean zek was but there he paused for it had dawned on him what the necroscope meant or at least he thought so and finally that was a very long time ago he said no i mean now a few seconds ago said jake she wanted you to know something she said if things work out dont waste any more of your life in remorse and she said what you had was great but its gone now the living are for the living and the dead are for the dead she has jazz now her first love shell go to him now in zakinthos where she was born and you have to go wherever your heart takes you trask nodded smiled a less than grim smile and said now she tells me at a time and in a place such as this but thats zek always the optimist and with another nod but gratefully now he said thanks necroscope with no time at all to spare even at this eleventh hour still jake decided to make a little time but that was make it not waste it for time stands still in the mobius continuum he had an itch that couldnt wait any longer it needed scatching and since his course was set absolutely what difference could it make now it was something that the others had deterred him from doing but none of that mattered too much any more not when his future as foretold by ian goodly was almost upon him and so on his way back to the core he took the time yet wasted none of it to do what had to be done then having done it he returned to millie and just one or two heartbeats after hed stepped from the mobius continuum then everything moved up a gear the future wouldnt be probed so goodly had stopped trying all he could do now was point his mm browning special at the hole in the sheer rock wall where the catwalk emerged from the darkness and began bridging the magmass and pray his bullets were silverplated and if he could land one of them in the right place in vavaras heart or in one of her eyes it should certainly stop her stop vavara if not the driving force within her for she had been wamphyri for unknown centuries and her leech and vampire flesh would be unwilling to give in so easily there would be a merry display before she succumbed but if he could bring her down pull the pin of a grenade and ram it in the great gape of her jaws that should do the trick for sure the precog had calculated that he might be able to get off just two or three shots switch on the lamp that the necroscope had given him use his garlic aerosol spray before the wamphyri got it together and reacted to his presence but by then theyd be in a crossfire for paul garvey would be shooting too hopefully with vavara down the other two would run for it along the catwalk and the precog and garvey would target their legs try to soften them up for trask and lardis waiting at the shaft to the core but if liz was still with them still their captive that would be all that the ebranch agents could do and even then theyd be risking hurting liz that had been the plan anyway but that wasnt the way it happened jesus the telepath suddenly hissed from forty feet away causing goodlys flesh to prickle and the short hairs to spring erect at the nape of his neck mindsmog theyre so close that they cant any longer shield it its here and so are they leprous white mist a vampire mist as dense as smoke from damp leaves in a garden fire in autumn uncoiled itself like a living thing from the shaft in the shinyblack rock face expanding and putting out sentientseeming tendrils it rolled along the catwalk lapped over the sides came groping among the magmass mouldings garveys halogen lamp blazed into life and as dense as the wall of mist was still that powerful beam cut through it seen in outline two male figures stood upright side by side in the narrow shaft and in the next moment moved stiffly forward but that was as much target as garvey and the precog needed and as close as they wanted to get their weapons came clamouring alive their gunfire and its echoes were sensesstunning in the confines of the magmass cavern and the two figures where they had barely emerged from the mouth of the shaft jerked and danced like puppets but oddly they didnt fall and stranger far their feet werent touching the walkways planking and now the precog thought my gad they are puppets he had used a full clip and so had garvey as they went to reload lords malinari and szwart emerged from the shaft following close behind the hag vavara came wafting with liz lying limp in her arms moving with eyeblurring speed the first two hoisted high their human shields the shattered corpses of the men who had manned the katushevs and threw them effortlessly out and down into the magmass their aim was excellent garveys lamp went clattering into the darkness and the precog saw a wet flailing faceless mass bounce once directly in front of him before it came slithering and flopping into his arms the dead man was heavy goodlys hands slipped in blood as he tried to throw him off he was aware of garveys shuddering gasping inarticulate mouthings from the other side of the catwalk where the telepath faced unthinkable problems of his own and finally as goodly managed to free himself from a tangle of loose flopping limbs malinari was there malinari no longer handsome or even remotely human rising from a magmass matrix immediately adjacent to goodlys own the precogs fingers were numb wet with a dead mans blood as they fumbled to fit a fresh clip into the grip of his gun and malinari crouched there watching with scarlet eyes perhaps amused at his antics but then when at last the full magazine slipped up into its housing ah no little seer said the great vampire taking goodlys weapon from him and throwing it away im afraid we cant allow that for look look here one of your bullets actually found its target coming right through my poor dead friend here to strike at me ah but it merely grazed me in passing i felt its sting its silver burn but nothing more and i shall heal while this faceless thing and you wont oh hahabaaaaa a hugelytaloned hand wiped at the lobe of his fleshy right ear and came away dripping blood my blood malinari nodded which is ohsoscarce so very precious what a terrible shame to waste it ehand squeezing goodlys cheeks until his mouth popped open malinari slopped blood into his forced gape gently closed it and wiped his hand clean on the precogs lips and the rims of his flaring nostrils then clamping goodlys mouth shut he forced him to breathe through his nose blood from the precogs upper lip was sucked in and goodly realized the worst of it that even if he lived he was dead or undead he tried to close his eyes to shut everything out but the monsters burning gaze held him mesmerized and malinaris jaws cracked open in a drooling lunatic grin as he said but there fairs fair little scryer and lord nephran malinari malinari the mind has been hospitable i have given of my wine of life and you have supped now i shall sup of yours but what a great pity and such bitter irony eh that for all your alleged talent you didnt see this coming his jaws opened wide wider and came down towards goodlys face but then thinking better of it holding back on his bite for a moment he clamped the precogs head in his icy hands and stared at him perhaps there was room in his mind yet and what a bonus that would be to be able to see into the future then as his index fingers writhed like worms lengthened and sought his victims ears vavara called from the walkway have done nephran and you too szwart come take this stupid girl off my hands and lets go while the goings good weve come a very long way but were not done yet those other ebranch people will have heard the shooting lets not give them time to work out whats happened to the first of their ambush parties and regroup im sure therell be hazards enough to negotiate malinari looked up flowed to his feet growled deep in his throat but he saw that vavara was right and meanwhile the precogs flopping hand had struck something hard and metallic the handle of the halogen lamp malinari bent to strike a murderous backhand blow but goodly struck first blinding white light painful light went streaming into the vampires eyes in a shaft that felt solid as a bar of iron malinaris blow found the side of goodlys head but instead of crushing his skull it glanced off enough to hurl him aside and render him unconscious but nothing worse and momentarily blinded staggering tripping and flailing his arms nephran malinari went mewling back across the magmass to the walkway meanwhile paul garveys problem was indeed unthinkable it was the unthinkable lord szwart szwart too heard vavara calling but he didnt answer instead through eyes that seemed to drip sulphur he stared in alien astonishment at the telepath it was garveys face that fascinated him that reconstructed face which looked normal enough when it was emotionless but that now was anything but emotionless even a smile looked bad on garvey a frown frightening and a scowl monstrous but when the telepath showed fear szwart had been about to kill him but now looking at him garveys hideously twisted features muscles pulling in all the wrong directions tendons jerking under unresponsive flesh szwart wasnt so sure that death was the worst possible punishment indeed it might even be preferable for it was almost as if garvey formed some kind of living link with the magmass szwart fashioned his vocal cords for speech and said myson my son and indeed you could be my son for this world has played you foul that you should look like this and ah i know your torment for i was ever ugly ugliness itself as you see however i have learned to live with it and so shall you but without my mist your beam would have revealed me and it hurts me that i am as i am you would have caused me pain pain in these nightseeing eyes of mine unused as they are to loathsome dazzle but much more pain in my mind which cringes from bright lights wherefore i shall cause you pain but not in your mind physical pain aye a little now and a lot more later when your own kind come to kill you now watch with his head held tight in the grip of a great pincerlike hand garvey could scarcely refuse and then szwart showed him his other hand a crab claw crusted with chitin that reshaped itself even as garvey watched the claws flattened fused and elongated they formed a pneumatic needle that slid to and fro in a bony sheath while a pearl of greyish moisture gleamed at its tip my essence said szwart not my blood but that which is in my blood when this takes hold youll know the real meaning of the word ugliness and when they come to kill you then too youll remember how you tried to kill me and he slid the needle into the pounding carotid artery on the right side of garveys neck injecting him there it wasnt the transfusion of a vampire egg which in its own right causes unbearable agonies but it was the next best or worst thing and the stuff ran through the telepaths blood like quicksilver like electricity down wires in his arteries as szwart released him garvey tried to scream but already he was jerking like a flatfish left stranded by the tide paralysed by pain and a moment later he was unconscious the first ambush teams gunfire its echoes bouncing from wall to wall floor to ceiling its sound changing with every deflection itself moulded by the magmass matrices had been almost as deafening in trasks and lardiss ears as it had in goodlys and garveys but when the shooting had stopped abruptly and after its echoes had subsided then the second team had also heard the precogs involuntary cry of horror as a faceless cadaver had come flopping from the magmass and something of the telepaths terrified gibbering when he had come face to face with lord szwart and now they heard only the silence trask was armed as well as grenades and a machine pistol that was loaded cocked and set on automatic fire he also had a third weapon in a sausage bag at his side as for the latter his hopes were fading as to its use but that was a personal thing and in any case he knew that even a vampires flesh must eventually give way to a fusillade of silver bullets oh really but with only one exception goodly and garvey had been similary armed so what the hell had happened to them and what was happening even now its called fear mr trask said malinari in trasks mind what youre experiencing is fear for youve now seen for yourself how we deal with opposition and as for your talents your ebranch skills surely youve realized by now that they are worthless against the wamphyri at the first icy word or thought almost before the message had time to sink in trask gave a massive start squirming as he jerked his head to look frantically in all directions it was as if malinari were actually there crouched over him talking to him in person and not just in his mind and despite that no one else was present no nightmare face staring back at him still trask knew that it was malinari for hed felt those same icy thoughts before but bow was his first involuntary thought or exclamation not a reply merely an astonished reaction how the others mental voice mocked him how but am i not nephran malinari malinari the mind weve met once before you and i out in australia a brief meeting its true but i have remembered your psychic signature which at this range is quite unmistakable thats how mr trask but theres also a why because youre in our way and we havent time to waste arguing with you or your weapons wherefore mind to mind as it were though your mind is scarcely a match for mine i give you one last opportunity to remove and save yourselves you and your ebranch people before we move against you or simply stay wbere you are guarding the final sbaft to the core and meet up with your fate right there the choice is yours unused to telepathy except with zek and millie and even then never having tried to converse in his own right trasks mind betrayed him when without thinking he thought cbrist this bastard knows it all and oh bhhahaaaa malinaris laughter slammed home but only for a moment and then so bows it going to be said the great vampire but there was something in that cold telepathic voice that he couldnt quite hide a sly eagerness and the fact that he already knew how it was going to be now trasks talent came into its own casting the vampires lie aside and revealing the truth this was no last opportunity just a delaying tactic trask shielded himself and was surprised that he knew how unless it was something that came naturally to all vampires hed left it too late of course for now he recognized another grim truth that just like the locator poor bernie fletcher in turkey he himself had betrayed his location it had been there in his mind in his own treacherous thoughts his hiding place in the magmass near the shaft to the core that was how malinari had found him and cold from head to toe cold as this unmarked grave in this foreign land that hed chosen for himself trask suddenly thought my god im a dead man and despite that his psychic shields were in place at this range this pointblank range he might as well have spoken the words out loud for he was merely an amateur while malinari was a master and indeed you are a dead man said that one but not just yet first youll be a hostage a blanket of mist was gathering over the magmass and beginning to flow towards him but trask guessed there was something closer than that pointblank indeed and sure enough he saw a lumpish blackcloaked figure like a grounded mansized bat making its weird flopping approach over the twisted terrain trask gulped the stagnant metallictasting air swallowed hard and tried to moisten his bone dry throat his palsied fingers groped for a fragmentation grenade and a deeper shadow fell on him in his magmass mould he gasped rolled over and looked up and had barely enough time to see something furry and freakish clinging to the uneven magmass ceiling directly overhead it took no more than a split second to realize what he was seeing but in that same fraction of time a tentacle of mutant vampire protoplasm as thick as his forearm and hard as a rubber cosh whipped down and almost broke his wrist the grenade was sent flying with its pin intact and trasks numbed right arm and hand wouldnt answer his commands as he went to reach for his machine pistol but in any case the effort was wasted for something black and viscous was descending snatching the gun away and as szwart quickly extended himself down from the ceiling touched bottom thickened and grew up from the floor like the stem of an instantaneous stalagmite so malinari straightened from his crouch threw back his cloak and reached for his greatest human enemy with a hand as broad as a plate catching trask by the back of the neck and drawing him to his feet he hissed as for the rest of my plan mr trask why with the girl and yourself as my hostages that should be the very simplest of things simplicity itself but szwart had noticed something and now in a voice that rattled and wheezed like a pair of ruptured bellows he enquired nephran do you see what i see then leaning closer to trask and staring at his face he formed a member that closely resembled a hand and drew trasks dark glasses from the breast pocket of his parka indeed i do malinari answered the feral yellow of his eyes yes and i suspect the same of the girl and what of the rest if their powers are enhanced it answers several puzzling questions such as how theyve followed us so closely seeming almost to anticipate our every move and why theyve proved so hard to detect and their shields so difficult to penetrate even for me its true i needed them to follow us but not so hot on our heels so then it appears your garden under london met with a measure of success after all lord szwart then all is not lost szwart wheezed if or when i have need to come back here i might find this world darker and far more to my liking he laughed a sound almost as awful as his looks and stood there shaking in all his nearformless horror then he pressed trasks sunglasses to his own lumpish face and even malinari grimaced at what next took place which would have been selfmutilation in any other the soft squelching sound and the slow drip of morbid fluids as szwart forced the sunglasses back until the sixinch shafts sank right into his black protoflesh behind the dark lenses the fire of his eyes was at once reduced to the glow of hot embers and szwart said well then what do you think more than merely cosmetic eh my friend said malinari indeed the other wheezed i suffered the gates brightness when first we came here but the pain should be less going back and he laughed again while malinaris only thought kept shielded of course was this dont laugh too loud misshapen fool for i sense the necroscope close by and talents such as his were threat enough without any help from you and your fungus garden or merely the first of many in perchorsks core the third team jake and millie had also heard goodlys and garveys gunfire that had been but a moment ago and as its echoes died away jake said its started this is the best possible place for you millie with your thumbs on the firing studs of this katushev the only thing is you cant use it until ive got liz back and so and so youll position yourself just inside the mouth of the shaft said millie reading it straight out of his mind correct jake answered the gates dazzle should give me a small advantage at least and with a bit of luck ill be able to snatch liz and get her out of here then you can use you can use the katushev seeing a certain look on her face he frowned stumbled to a halt and asked did i say something yes she answered you seem to be assuming theyre going to get this far thats all and it was true jake had been assuming exactly that which translated into an assumption that maybe ben trask and the rest of the team arent going to make it her eyes looked right through him im just trying to cover every angle jake tried to reassure her failed and went on right now though i think its a good idea you should get that armoured canopy up then if you do have to shoot and if anything shoots back youre covered he went to turn away and something squirmed in his pocket stabbing his thigh right through his trousers what thejake fumbled with his parka to thrust a hand deep in his pocket came out with the fragment of harry keoghs hairbrush that david chung had given him there was a little of his blood on the splintered end and the thing was vibrating in his hand chung said millie immediately a problemjake wondered out loud should i try to reach him said millie no need the necroscope answered her lifting his head as if he were listening to something ive got him this piece of old hairbrush is both compass and rangefinder i can go to him right now but hell he could have chosen a better time still you have to go said millie who knows it may be something thats important to us thats true said jake but i would go anyway because i know chung would help me if it was the other way round now get that canopy up and dont worry ill be back and a moment later he was gone guided by instinct and the wooden shard in his hand jake used the mobius continuum and went to david chungs coordinates but when he got there which took no time at all he found something new and very odd his mobius door formed readily enough but it wouldnt hold still this wasnt the warping effect hed experienced upon arriving in the core the door was firm enough and stable in itself but it moved up and down shifted from side to side constantly changed its mobius spacetime location and then the necroscope realized why it must be that the locators location was changing and jake was lockedon to chung it was chungs transport the helicopter that was moving but very erratically in a moment when the door held relatively still jake stepped out of the continuum into normal space and at once lurched as the floor shifted under his feet he staggered saw a safety strap swaying there grabbed at it and held on and in the next moment three or four voices began shouting a chorus of exclamations what the bell who christ whats going on here and then chungs voice saying its okay hes a hes a friend they were seated belted in in the helicopters passenger cabin three on one side and two on the other the seat next to chung was empty and as the aircraft lurched again jake let go of the strap and aimed himself in that direction chung grabbed at him helped to locate him as he toppled into the seat said jake weve got a problem you me trask and all the rest of us jake answered him breathlessly and we dont have a lot of time so whats up who is this person someone yelled above the shrilling of the choppers engine and a bansheee howling from outside and another insisted will someone please tell me what the hell is shut the fuck up chung shouted at them all of you you want to live this is the man wholl save you but if you dont want to live just keep mouthing off i and when their mouths snapped shut he turned again to jake we were okay until about half an hour ago then the storm came in the weather forecast said it was going to be unsettled but this is ridiculous the wind is from the east coming down from norway and its getting worse by the minute were heading for the outer hebrides but now anywhere will do northern ireland dry land anywhere but were burning fuel fighting the wind and the pilot says we may not make it jake got up grabbed a strap leaned to look out through a window the choppers searchlight scanned a heaving sea where massive waves smashed this way and that foaming white against the black of bottomless ocean moonlight struggled to find its way through clouds that roared across the sky and to the east there was nothing but inky blackness how long have you got said jake stumbling back into his seat maybe twenty twentyfive minutes chung told him jake nodded if it gets tight give me another call incidentally you did call me right i tried to locate you said chung you got harrys hairbrush said jake chung shrugged managed a smile and said same difference necroscope and one other thing said jake did you find that russki ship not yet chung answered but i know where she is as you know i have this thing for radioactive materials well all of our worst suspicions are proven i keep picking up this signal jake and its a bad one were moving toward it right now but a shipload hell its a whole sbitload and not a thing we can do about it not in this storm i have to go said jake conjuring a door so how are things your end chung asked anxiously as the necroscope lurched to his feet if you call me and i dont answer jake replied thatll tell you how things are at my end and as the chopper lurched again he was gone moving cautiously malinari led the way into the shafts unnatural dazzle the light from the gate along the glaring catwalk he went with vavara and szwart following on behind vavara was carrying a barely conscious liz while szwart propelled a helpless trask but malinari himself was for the moment unburdened which was how he preferred it back there in the magmass he could have sworn that someone else other than trask was hiding nearby his mentalist probes had discovered no one however not in the magmass but jake cutters presence elsewhere had been more than apparent then for a while the necroscope had disappeared from malinaris mental register but now he was back indeed his return just a few moments ago had felt like some kind of energy surge in the psychosphere and now despite that he had shielded himself his shields were so strong they betrayed him in their own right he was in the core guarding the gate itself while waiting to take back his woman and that was exactly where malinari wanted him vavara had demanded to know why she should be burdened with liz and malinaris excuse for letting her do the work was very simple and simply a lie he needed to have his hands free in order to handle the necroscope the real reason however while it certainly had to do with jake cutter was in fact very different lord malinari knew that whoever was in charge of liz was liable to deadly attack from the moment he or she stepped from the shaft into the core then indeed malinari would need a free hand for the girl meant nothing neither the girl nor trask but the necroscope was everything with powers such as his malinari knew he could take back starsidesunside even this parallel earth in its entirety eventually but when next he came hed be leading a vast vampire army of his own and no need then for this pair of grotesque mental midges who had been nothing but a hindrance no for between times he would have seen to them as for vavara wouldbe mother of a vampire horde he would see to her right now if an easy means were to present itself and so having first ensured that his colleagues followed close behind malinari stepped out onto the railed walkway that hugged the wall of the core around its perimeter but even wearing a pair of disposable cardboard sunshields that hed picked up from a container at the entrance to the shaft still he must put a hand up against the glare until his eyes had adjusted for there it was the portal itself shining no less dazzlingly than the natural gate on starside and once across its threshold malinari knew that he would soon be home in his vampire world ah but with what wild talents at his command that remained to be seen now he held back a little scanned left and right not only with eyes narrowed to slits but also with his mind and at once detected millie and the necroscope at this range their psychic signatures were unmistakable the latter was crouched in a sort of sentry box or observation post maybe ten paces to the right while to the left at three times that distance the female was hiding under the tinted glass turret of a heavyduty weapon or could it be that she was actually manning the thing whichever it was time that malinari took charge of liz vavara he said letting the witch come up alongside him and starting off across the fishscale steel plates towards the gate let me assist you with the girl i need no such assistance she grunted for i have seen through you oh lord of lies what did you think that you were the only one with powers i feel them here too and more especially him but then who could fail to detect him eh this is the third and last stage of their ambush and this girl will provide a shield against whatever force of weapons they intend to use against us so fuck you nephran malinari eh what szwart wheezed stumbling where he followed he now used one hand to hold trask and the other to protect his eyes from the glare for even with trasks sunglasses still he could feel the light on him revealing every hideous contour the bitch vavara would ruin our plans for her own safety cried malinari and that is something we cant allow turning on vavara he crouched down a little and rising up drove the heel of a hammer hand up under her chin every single ounce of malinaris prodigious vampire strength not to mention his pent hatred of the hag was behind that blow and as she cried out flailed her arms and toppled backwards malinari caught up liz vavara spat blood and shattered scythelike teeth where she sprawled and lord szwart stumbled this way and that wheezing eh what nephran what are you doing malinari made no answer but instead began to drag liz who was suddenly wide awake and struggling however weakly across the fishscale steel plates towards the gate if the necroscope was after all a great coward and failed to attempt a rescue at least malinari would not be leaving this world emptyhanded but meanwhile trask had recognized szwarts difficulty and risking his life which probably wasnt worth anything anyway he halfturned and reached up a hand to wrench the sunglasses from the monsters face twin jets of goo spurted from the holes in that nightmarish countenance and szwart let out a whistling cry like steam from a kettle he shrank down into himself and slapped both hands to his face covering his streaming eyes which left trask free to make a flying tackle on malinari and sliding on his belly over the plates he grabbed at that ones ankles hampered by lizs struggling and tripping where trask held him malinari cursed and managed a fumbling backheel kick his heel glanced off the side of trasks head sending him tumbling sideways which was fortunate for him for vavara was up on her feet again hissing like a snake where she advanced on malinari with spiderlike hands and fishhook fingers extended by now millie had seen her opportunity the katushevs batterydriven motor hummed into life its turret turning smoothly as she sought to target szwart where he stood isolated from the rest by some two or three paces and millie wasnt the only one in action the necroscope had commenced his run hurling himself diagonally across the steelplated disc toward the gate level with malinari and liz he went to intercept them at the gates event horizon but out of the corner of his eye malinari had seen him and deliberately slowed down for with the exception of the hag vavaras interference it was all working out almost exactly as planned three of ebranchs avengers millie trask and the necroscope were now involved in the action but there was still a fourth to come for malinaris telepathic probes had not been in error back there in the magmass cavern when momentarily they had seemed to detect a presence other than trasks they had in fact detected just such a presence only to be tricked deflected from their quarry by a traveller survival technique and of course lardis lidesci was one of the greatest survivors of all time out from the shaft he stepped with his razoredged machete in his clenched fist the strap of trasks sausage bag over his shoulder and disposable sunglasses protecting his eyes and no more than twenty feet ahead of him there stood szwart with his ropy hands held up in front of his grotesque face his gasping whistling voice cursing the light from the gate lardis didnt think twice and to hell with his rheumatic joints as he drew back his throwing arm and let fly with all the deadly accuracy of a szgany marksman coated with silver at its tip the machete made a whupwhupwhupping sound as it spun end over end once twice three times and slammed into szwarts back point first but already in the process of alien automatic metamorphosis szwarts being was something less than solid and the old lidescis weapon passed threequarters through him so that the first six inches stuck out in front szwart drew it out point first gazed at it through eyes in flood then turned and glared his astonishment then his fury at lardis and took one menacing step towards him which was when millie thumbed the katushevs firing studs the lord of darkness was swatted holed mangled like a rag doll snatched from his feet and thrown down with blobs of his blood and chunks of his protoflesh flying and under the katushevs canopy millie laughed and cried bouncing in her seat like a lunatic as she eased her thumbs off the studs and the obscene cacophony of cannonfire ceased and there on the steel plates beginning at the spot where szwart had been standing lay a trail like a scarlet skid mark leading to a steaming immobile mound of weird flesh twenty or more feet away and take me down under london would you you bastard thing millie cried vampirize me with your bloody spores would you youre done for szwart but youre not going to hell alone the katushevs motor hummed again but millie was too late the action had moved on and friends and enemies alike were now too close together malinari was almost at the gate its glaring white surface the event horizon seemed to beckon him but the hag vavara was hot on his heels her face a mask of loathing and her chomping bottom jaw dripping blood and not only vavara but jake cutter too the necroscope was coming fast he would arrive at the same time and he wore a harness slung loosely over his shoulders a bottle of incendiary chemicals on his back and such a scowl of determination on his face that malinari felt a sudden twinge of selfdoubt but it wasnt only jakes look that did it it was the squatbodied flamethrower in his whiteknuckled hands he had found the weapon hanging from its hook in the sentry box and it had seemed to make a lot more sense than a machine pistol for no matter how lethal the latter might be against an ordinary man it wasnt likely to unnerve nephran malinari not while he was holding liz but the sight the very notion of aflamethrower just might and in fact it had let her go malinari jake yelled im the one you want not the girl and pointing the flame throwerss nozzle he took up first pressure on the trigger and ignited the pilot light i havent harmed your lover malinari snarled not yet so dont worry about me worry about that one and he pointed at vavara for she had seen the danger too and came bearing down on jake with her long arms reaching and her face a mask of blood jake look out liz cried writhing in malinaris arms she neednt have worried the necroscope was already swinging the flamethrower in vavaras direction and now he squeezed the trigger all the way home a roaring whitehot jet of flame a demons tongue of fire licked out striking vavara full in the face and stopping her just as surely as if shed slammed headon into a brick wall vavara shrieked to match the hissing shriek of jakes lance danced a mad dance while he hosed her down finally slumped to the fishscale plates in a spreading pool of her own fluids her smoke steam and stench rose up but malinari had turned liz to face jake and held her like a shield between himself and jakes weapon and youre right he said its you i want and not the girl but listen do you see this face of mine do you see these jaws and teeth and he showed jake what he meant one bite and the girl is gone i can ruin her face suck out her tongue push my fingers in through her eyes to addle her brain or perhaps ill simply drive my hand right through her and crush her heart but on the other hand you want me said jake and the moment you do anything to liz youre a dead man you know it and i know it he moved a step closer and malinari backed off until he was only a few feet from the gates event horizon but i could do it and still leap into the gate the monster said and if you did id follow you said jake all the way to hell if i had to so tell me can you leap faster than my fire even if you got to starside i would find you there and believe me malinari no one moves faster than me one morning as you lay down to sleep id be there with fire in my hands oh i know i know malinari gurgled so quite obviously this has to end here a duel necroscope fair and above board your powers against mine now hear my proposal youll put down your weapon and kick it away beyond reach and ill release the girl into the hands of your good friend mr trask meanwhile lardis lidesci had come closer and now he said dont do it jake never make a deal with a vampire and certainly not a lord of the wamphyri it seemed the old gipsy king had forgotten perhaps conveniently that the necroscope had become a vampire in his own right jake had heard just such a warning before but this time he had no choice and anyway he actually wanted it for his vampire blood was up release the girl he growled drop the flamethrower said malinari and together slowly carefully each followed the others instructions jake shrugged out of his harness let the bottle fall clanging to the floor malinari held liz at arms length but kept hold of one wrist the necroscope stooped a little to let the flamethrower fall and went to kick it away and finally malinari let go of liz for she was no longer of any use to him and in that split second that single moment of time as jake sent the flamethrower and its tank skidding towards trask malinari moved he moved like quicksilver grabbing at jake before he could even think to avoid him and his hands clasped jakes head in their icy braindraining grip lardis had a gun but couldnt use it liz and trask were in the line of fire and the old lidesci was by no means expert in the weapons of earth and in the katushevs bucket seat millie was similarly hampered if she fired at malinari jake would go with him and where liz had been the monsters shield now jake took her place ahhh yesss malinari hissed as his sensesnumbing hands formed themselves into great webs and his fingers quivered and lengthened all of your secrets necroscope everything that you know the keys to all of your powers soon to be mine but what was that you said nothing moves faster than you perhaps nothing travels faster place to place but where the reflexes of muscles and mind are concerned i think you are mistaken jake slumped the chill of malinaris hands wasnt physical but mental the bitter cold of ignorance leeching on knowledge the negative pole of a powerful magnet applied to the positive pole of the necroscopes intelligence his psyche for malinari the mind was a creature apart who lived not alone on blood but on the memories and deepseated secrets of his victims leaving nothing behind and already his index fingers were vibrating as they probed jakes ears all here malinari gurgled its all right here but ah whats this i feel a secret place a special place perhaps a locked room here in the manse of your mind your treasure vault of powers eh necroscope but see the key is in the lock and now i turn it your secrets are mine his fingers sought knowledge and found something else they sought magic and found madness nothing nothing at all of intelligence transferred to malinari but something someone who he had long forgotten and thought never to know again and such was his eagerness that he got it all all of korathoncemindsthrall bereft in his loneliness sucked from jakes mind in an instant like a speck of blood through a mosquitos siphon but unlike jake malinari had no special room in which to contain him his rooms were full to brimming ahhhhargh he choked snatching back his hands from the necroscopes head releasing him as if he were ablaze to go staggering this way and that and his crimson eyes flying open and bugging and his great jaw dropping gaping as he slapped palsied hands to his head and again and yet again for inside his head in malinari the minds mind korath ran like the lunatic he was down every corridor crushing every sentient thing destroying all memories erasing all knowledge and leaving nothing but chaos in his wake he was an instantaneous disease an allconsuming virus and malinari the perfect host whose brain had been teetering on the rim of lunacy long before this fatal infection liz ran to jake where he had gone to his knees but already he was recovering shaking his head awakening as from a bad dream what did you do to him she asked then what happened to him i i dont know he answered hugging her close but i feel somehow i feel free its something we can consider later trask grated as he advanced on the drooling gibbering malinari where he sat slapping his head crosslegged on the fishscale floor but right now theres something i need to do something that ive wanted to do for a very long time before we go looking for the precog and paul garvey and get the hell out of here and handing trask his sausage bag lardis went with him a moment later trask thrust his hand into the idiot malinaris battle gauntlet and flexed it and as the cutting edges sprang erect he raised the gauntlet high and brought it slicing down on the mad things neck again and again trask struck home with all his strength until the exmonsters head leaped free and his body toppled then trask shook the gauntlet loose and let it fall and picking up the flamethrower liz said so you finally got your revenge ben and millie got hers but mine is still to come then as they backed off turning away from the one grisly scene millie shouted a warning as she clambered down from the katushev behind you look behind you and for all that they had been through still they were shocked anew at what was taking place where millie pointed first the steaming mass that had been vavara was no longer quiet indeed it was unquiet the slumped hags fireblackened mouth hung open and out onto the slimy floor poured the myriad eggs of a mother of vampires translucent pearly spheres like a small boys spilled marbles and propelled by flickering cilia they skittered and shimmered all across the steelplated floor seeking blindly for brand new hosts liz didnt think twice but torched them all then turned her fire on the steaming remains of vavara yet even now it wasnt finished what the hell said the old lidesci his mouth falling open as he watched something black lumpish and ragged dragging itself to the perimeter and into a wormhole that angled acutely into the wall its szwart said jake disbelievingly what does it take to kill these bloody things taking the flamethrower from liz who was done with it now he ran toward the wormhole that was a mistake for there in the darkness beyond a bend in the energy channel lord szwart had quickly refashioned himself and as jake approached the hole it might easily have been some giant octopus that sensed his presence and reached out with a nest of lashing tentacles jake squeezed the flamethrowers trigger and nothing happened the pilot light died with a noise like a damp squib and szwart dragged jake head first into the hole a moment later and the necroscope found himself inside lord szwart enveloped by him and szwart formed eyes several eyes on the inside to look at him darkness the vampire thing gasped and wheezed his vestigial lungs pulsating breathing their poison into jakes face the darkness was ever my friend it was my beginning and shall be my continuance where darkness lives there goes szwart and you ah i know you destroyer of my fortress under london you come and go at will but this time i go with you jesus jake gasped no said the other only szwart but be sure i have godlike power over you the power of life and death aye and now jake cutter the one malinari called necroscope youll take me out of here to a place of darkness in that same moment jake felt a stab through his trousers not anything of szwarts doing but a splinter of old hardwood in his pocket then shielding his mind to conceal an involuntary thrill of anticipation suddenly he knew how to kill this mutant thing i cant move he said not while you surround me then i shall extrude you said szwart but heed my warning necroscope dont take me where theres sunlight it would kill me certainly but you would die too and just as painfully with which he squirted a few drops of specially altered internal fluids onto jakes neck hissing where it ate into his flesh the stuff burned like hell causing him to gasp in pain and szwart said there if you fail me that shall be your lot to be sucked dry of all your juices shrivelled and burned to nothing do we have an understanding yes jake gasped yes we have an understanding szwart reshaped himself extruded jake inside the wormhole but continued to hold him in a nest of whipcord pseudopods and while jake gulped gratefully at reasonably clean air again the lord of darkness said so then where shall we go i know a place of ultimate darkness said jake beginning to breathe a little more easily as the agony of his seared neck gradually subsided where i may live for as long as you live the necroscope answered take me there now said szwart driving jake before him out of the wormhole onto the perimeter walkway and in through a mobius door the storm over the atlantic had blown itself out as rapidly as it had blown up but the helicopter was running on fumes david chung had found the rogue russian ship now his scientist colleagues were taking infrared snapshots of the vessel reporting its location by radio and likewise the fact that their instruments were recording lethal radiation it was all they could do in what little time remained to them down below stricken by the storm and hampered by its submarine burden the towship was wallowing in the heaving swell listing badly to starboard and in danger of capsizing but the locator was intent upon only one thing contact with the necroscope and jake came but not alone and not into the chopper on his way through the mobius continuum while szwart assumed a manshape but continued to hold him as tightly as ever the necroscope had chosen an indirect route moving first in one direction then another in order to think things through before arriving at his destination and hed kept his thoughts shielded in case szwart was less of a dullard than he seemed as for jakes plan it had been somewhat complicated he had understood from chungs contact the vibrations of the hairbrush shard that the locator was in trouble if not chung himself then certainly the helicopter in which he was a passenger if they were ditching then it was possible that in the confusion jake could free himself from szwart grab hold of chung and make an exit by now the locator and his colleagues would be wearing lifebelts at least and inflatables were standard on such aircraft maybe they were already down in the water while the helicopter filled up and started to sink in that case jake would immediately transfer szwart to the chopper and desert him there if he could get away from him then with the coordinates fresh in mind he would go back for chung and co and rescue them from the sea complicated yes the plan had a great many ifs buts and maybes but for the moment it was the best he could do and one thing for sure if it worked there would be no more trouble from szwart for theres no darker or deadlier place to be than under the crushing weight of a mile of water that had been the necroscopes plan but as he conjured his mobius door he saw that once again it was slipping and sliding bucking and heaving and slowly but surely descending and so guessed that the helicopter must be settling toward the sea he made a quick decision dissolved the door and moved away from it and at coordinates of his own conjured another except this time without pause he proceeded through it into the dark atlantic night and the blustery aftermath of the storm his calculations were a little off emerging in midair he tasted salt and felt the slap of spume from driven wave crests saw the helicopters rotors glinting overhead some little distance away and then fell jake and szwart plunging into a trough between waves sinking under the water and slowly surfacing then what eh szwart gasped and spluttered tightening his grip as their heads broke the surface are you mad necroscope do you want to die a mistake jake lied as choppy water slapped him in the face but i can get us out of this then do it now at once said szwart for that was your last mistake jake cutter i wont allow another at which moment jake spied the russian ship as the heaving ocean lifted them up necroscope and monster together jake saw the stricken vessel saw members of her crew in goggles and safety harnesses risking their lives where they hung from a framework of buckled steel booms at her stern they were working at frantic speed with acetylene torches trying to cut through the trailing towlines and behind the ship lolling in the swell with the tip of a rusty conning tower breaking the surface there was the doomed old sub herself where jake had hoped she would be then breaking in on his concentration szwart told him i cant swim nor can you not with me clinging to you so get me out of this now necroscope or we both go down together as you will said jake he judged the distance saw the last hawser sliced through and go splashing down into the sea attempted to recall everything that hed seen of chungs target on the big screen in ebranch hqs ops room that great nuclear submarine but more especially its reactor compartments those leadlined rooms that no sane engineer would ever enter except in the most desperate of circumstances and then as the conning tower slipped under for the last time and a wave lifted them high the necroscope conjured his door prayed that hed got it right and again entered the mobius continuum he neednt have worried chungs hardwood shard was vibrating itself into a hundred even smaller fragments in his pocket and as before it was his compass and his rangefinder eh said szwart what like a thunderous grunting in the continuums nothingness darkness jake answered as he fashioned his most dangerous door and guided szwart through it that is what you asked for isnt it and dark it was pitch dark oily metallic and burning with a heat that couldnt be felt by men except in the passing of time but szwart felt it and he couldnt understand it astonished he relaxed his grip and the necroscope at once leaned away from him and through a mobius door the one pseudopod that managed to come snaking after him was lopped off as he slammed the door behind him and jake was free in the mobius continuum while in the corporeal world below the waves there was heat in the reactor compartment the same energy that fuels the sun but without the suns light little wonder szwart couldnt understand it but he could feel it and as the groaning sub nosed ever deeper he felt it eating into him mercifully perhaps too mercifully he wouldnt feel it for long already his mutant flesh was sloughing from him steaming away into nothing while his bubbling screams went all unheard drowned in fathoms of ocean down in perchorsks core lardis had found another flamethrower and was busy filling the air with foulness removing every last trace of malinari and vavara trask had told him that this was futile as soon as the necroscope got back the entire perchorsk complex would be consumed utterly in an awesome nuclear explosion but that had made no great impact on lardis a job isnt done until its finished the old lidesci had answered and ive been finishing such as these bastards for a very long time it needs doing so leave me be and who could say he was wrong for even as lardis worked malinaris neck grew fat as a leech wriggled free of the stump and his body burst open in a nest of pulsing grey and purple pseudopods that lashed frenziedly at the air before they melted and likewise with the hag her crisped outer shell cracking open steam jetting from the rupture while her pale blue and yellow guts heaved and tossed full of a mindless life of their own but lardis had carried on and finally had his way meanwhile turchin had come up from the bowl under the gate and gone with trask millie and liz in search of garvey and the precog and they had carried them back to the core both of the men had been sleeping but a special kind of sleep and trask said to millie at least we didnt go through that no she answered but it all works out the same anyway i know he nodded grimly and sighed were all vampires now and out there in the world a lot more are being made and making others as we speak but that fight is still to come a good many fights she agreed us against the rest and im frightened how do you think it will go ben thats assuming we can get out of here the fighting or the rest of it the rest of it she answered quietly the blood harry abstained trask reminded her as did the dweller likewise turgo zolte until shaitan forced him it doesnt have to be human blood millie if we dont slip too far back toward the dark ages and if science doesnt take too much of a battering maybe well be able to synthesize something and if not well people have been meateaters ever since the good lord gave us incisors okay she said ill accept that but where do we start and what do we do the human race is facing extinction ben we start at ebranch he answered that is if our people will accept us thats our power base and while the world goes to hell well look for a solution well find a way to survive and keep our humanity as for the more distant future youd do better asking him he nodded toward the sleeping precog when he wakes up his powers should have been enhanced quite a bit talking about survival and the future said liz breaking in excitedly on their conversation hes okay jake i mean and hes on his way back here right now lizs powers too had been enhanced jake stepped out of the mobius continuum a different man to the one they had known his hollow handsome face was grey now and his hair where it swept back like wings from his temples was white it formed into a blackand whitebanded braid at the back and as for his eyes they were no longer feral but uniformly red red as blood i lost my dark glasses he said as liz went to him but i can replace them right now though i think its time we all got out of this hellish place everyone agreed and gustav turchin went back down through the trapdoor under the gate to set the timer on his device ten minutes would be enough in his absence trask took jake aside and said you know twice youve had my heart in my mouth are you insane or something first to take on malinaris challenge then to go chasing after szwart like that but jake only smiled and trask knew the truth of it you did it he said you checked out the future thats right said jake i didnt go far but far enough to see that my thread goes on way past tomorrow and a day its a red thread sure enough but it does go on and as it goes it gathers other threads to it doesnt make them you understand just gathers them up yours and ebranchs i suppose and they all go on together then turchin came scrambling back up through the trapdoor and in the next few seconds and three trips jake conveyed the entire party back to the surface up there the locator david chung was waiting chung and his scientist colleagues and a british searchandrescue helicopter sitting there on the dam wall inside the chopper the wideeyed pilot told jake ive got just enough fuel left to take off but ill really have to give her the gun with all these extra passengers aboard i mean im still not sure we can make it so what do you want me to do we have to be mobile the necroscope shrugged i suppose the easiest way would be to take off and then fly her out over the dam wall over the gorge you mean thats right jake nodded and you can do that er that whatever you did again the pilots face was chalk white he wasnt even sure where he was or if he was or what this bloodeyed creature was but trust me said jake and because hed already been privy to one miracle tonight the pilot did trust him and when the engine shut down over the gorge he simply closed his eyes and kept them closed even as the chopper yawed a little and fell all of six inches to the roof of ebranch hq and not quite by coincidence just a few minutes later and thousands of miles away in the urals the mountain over perchorsk gave a massive shudder and subsided by almost exactly the same amount by way of an epilogue not so very devious after all for a full seventytwo hours the precog ian goodly lay asleep and paul garvey woke up just an hour or so before him for both men it had been the sleep of change following a direct infusion of blood or essential essence from a great vampire a threeday fight between the men and their raging fevers which inevitably they must lose while yet surviving they wouldnt die not the true death but they would wake up undead paul garvey wasnt alone in his anguish a telepath as he tossed and turned and fought his fight other minds accompanied him liz millie and john grieve they stayed with him through his torment spelling each other willing him on and constantly reminding him of his humanity they didnt try to converse but simply topped up his troubled mind with positive and fortifying thoughts so that when he woke up he would remember what he was and not what the alien thing in his blood wanted him to be and when they werent succouring garvey the three were counselling each other as for the precog he was a different case entirely search as they might the greatest minds in ebranch couldnt find his mind it wasnt there but was traversing future times searching in its own right and in the last hour or so before he opened his eyes goodly dreamed the strangest of dreams this was how it went he was reading a newspaper report on the plague but not the asiatic plague in the mediterranean in the air on land and across the aegean the greeks and turks were at war each blaming the other for the vampires come among them in australia the authorities had blockaded the east coast from gladstone to coffs harbour and were shooting anyone or anything attempting to leave china had launched its first nuclear missiles against the new vampireinfested red russia and there was continuous nightfighting all along their borders the bulgarian authorities operated a dusktilldawn curfew and anyone caught walking the streets after dark was shot on sight and burned in the british isles with the exception of northern ireland where as yet the two main political parties had failed to agree any mutually satisfactory countermeasures the various governments had long since declared a state of emergency giving the police and military previously unthinkable draconian powers of arrest confinement and execution sales of home security systems were rising exponentially while those of sunglasses contact lenses and sunscreening creams had been banned ounce for ounce the price of silver was double that of gold garlic was selling on the black market for seven pounds the clove and for the first time in decades the churches were filled to overflowing while holy water was disappearing from their fonts in proportion to the increase in their congregations despite that he had rarely been allowed to see so much the precog looked at the date on the paper march just a little over two years ahead he was reading the newspaper while riding into the the city on an evening bus outside the streets were almost deserted a handful of people but a very small handful were hurrying to their homes or other destinations and no one looked at or spoke to anyone else there were posters pasted on the walls of every street corner except for their headers in bloodred sixinch letters goodly couldnt read what they said he didnt need to for the headers alone said it all public warning notice are you aware of the time better check your watch now then he felt a bump and gave a start the man seated beside him had fallen asleep his head striking goodlys shoulder and a nervous woman behind him tapped him on the other shoulder and said i think i think someone should tell the driver and for all that her voice was a mere whisper in his ear or perhaps because it was still it contained a whole world of fear goodly did as she suggested as he moved from his seat the sleeping man lolled sideways falling across both seats without waking up the driver took his bus off route to a gloomy building with brickedup windows and tall new chimneys that were pouring out smoke stopped and got out and in a while three men came and carried the sleeper off the bus there are so many of them the woman whispered again and goodly turned to look at her but seeing his face her eyes went wide then she stood up and stumbled into the aisle calling for the driver a dream or a vision whichever it was time to move on and goodly left his newspaper the woman and the bus behind him as his mind carried him further still into the future previously the precog had recognized some of the streets now too he recognized them yet at the same time he didnt or didnt want to not in their current disorder but disorder destruction was the better word for it it was still london a sign on a heap of rubble where a chimney of bricks stood central told him that much the junction of oxford and regent streets goodly was still in a vehicle but it wasnt by any stretch of the imagination a bus its windows were darktinted slits in the thick metal walls of an armoured personnel carrier a halftrack rumbling through the shattered remains of the citys once bustling streets he seemed to be the commander of the vehicle and there were half a dozen combatclad men with him excluding the driver outside it was dirty dingy daylight one of the men his secondincommand was david chung and his eyes were as brown as always the rest of the crew was made up fiftyfifty of vampires and human beings most of whom goodly recognized as ebranch agents of old which meant that they were quite capable of working together if only because theyd always worked together in a common cause looking at chung however he thought good for you david keep it as long as you can my friend you may grow older faster than i do but youll always be you and no one and nothing else making decisions for you witbout you realizing it then stop here said chung and the vehicle kicked up dust and debris as it slewed to a halt then a motor hummed and the roof slid open and four highpowered weapons elevated into position with their gunners crouched under smoked sunscreening plastic canopies scanning all the quadrants since the sun hadnt been visible for a sixmonth the canopies were a purely precautionary measure and overhead the leaden lowering clouds remained black and yellowstreaked with poisonous smoke over there said chung pointing his eyes narrowed brow wrinkled and radiationsensitive mind focused its there in that street dumped there by the last heavy rains its bad so you cant afford to hang about get those signs up quick as you can and then get out of there we cant have any of our patrols going down there two men in radiation suits left the vehicle carrying warning triangles and metal staves they worked quickly hammering the staves into the ground at the entrance to chungs street an avenue of piled rubble stretching away out of sight with two or three gutted buildings in various stages of collapse hung the signs on the staves and ran back to the halftrack decon as soon as we get back home the locator told them as they climbed aboard and when the vehicle rumbled into life again he turned to the precog maybe its my imagination but you seem awfully quiet whats up er daydreaming goodly heard himself saying i wasnt here for a minute or a couple of years chung nodded i know just a handful of years since those bastards brought this hell down on us a handful well six actually sometimes it seems like yesterday and other times its for ever like its always been this way then it was back to business again is there anywhere else you want to check before we go back under the dome goodly wanted to say the dome but figured hed find out soon enough and he did and then was glad hed kept silent for soon they were into a part of the city that he definitely recognized ahead of the vehicle suddenly the air was full of a shimmering distortion and the buildings beyond it while they were gradually falling into disrepair were still more or less intact as they drew to a halt before the shimmer chung spoke into a walkietalkie hello the barrier let us in there was no barrier as such that the precog could see but the uniformed man beyond the shimmer gave a nod spoke into his own walkietalkie and a moment later the distortion went away ah said goodly then beginning to understand and frowning chung turned to him and asked are you sure youre okay but the precog never got to answer not in his dream for his mind had moved on again he had moved it on this time goodly the current timetravelling goodly wasnt himself present at least not as a viable corporeal presence on the first occasion on the bus hed experienced a true vision for in that world as he had foreseen it he definitely wouldnt have been riding a bus not with red wamphyri eyes the next time in the halftrack that had been him hed actually played himself inhabited that future goodly and seen out through his own eyes this meant that he was learning his vampireenhanced talent was growing exploring its own potential now this third time out his talent reverted to its previous parameters so that he saw the future without the future seeing him also the time and location werent randomly thrust upon him but determined by the precog himself and knowing that he was doing it he went to ebranch hq into the ops room during an introductory briefing by trask ben trask on the podium leaning on the lectern exactly as the precog had seen him so often before now talking to a handful of new recruits david chung and paul garvey gustav turchin and the minister responsible jake liz and millie even goodly himself they were all there standing at the back watching the proceedings along with many other members of old ebranch and a few of them were still entirely human as for the six seated people four men and two women they were fatigued dirty and their eyes were feral they were vampires yes but only recently the reason youre here trask told them is because you managed to hold out because you lasted all this time out there on your own fighting back and refusing to give in despite that the country is overrun in short youve done what weve done or what we havent done you havent succumbed youve refused to kill other men in order to prolong your own existence that and only that is what sustained you youre vampires yes but youre human too and we need you because there are so few of us its your choice to stay and work with us or to go out in the streets where youll live till you die the true death for while you havent taken the blood of your fellow men and women there are millions in the world who have theyre killing themselves off and we cant stop it because once theyve tasted it well thats the end of it but in this place under this dome of energy that doesnt happen it isnt allowed to happen and if you ever forget that then we will kill you survival of the fittest yes and we are and we intend to remain the fittest we have food we have healthy animals a farm of sorts a noahs ark and were learning how to synthesize blood weve got scientists here geneticists and microbiologists and were getting better at what we do all the time theres got to be an answer a better way and because we know its there well find it thats a fact you can be a part of our future too and believe me we do have a future trask paused to glance at the other goodly standing at the back of his audience smiled knowingly and continued we know that quite definitely that there will be a future and meanwhile as for what weve got here this place is our protection a dome of energy half a mile wide that covers all of central london it was a foreign invention originally but it didnt work for them in fact it caused a disaster but with the help of a russian friend the man who brought us the specifications weve made it work for us now he glanced at gustav turchin an older much less robust turchin of course but still human for now as then the old fox was tenacious in his own right trask gave him a grateful nod and carried on the power source is a nuclear generator buried deep underground beneath what used to be our seat of government a secret national emergency measure from cold war times it remained inactive until well until the emergency lets face it there couldnt have been a greater emergency we learned of this power source from one of our oldest and most learned members now trask turned his gaze on the crimsoneyed minister responsible a man who is still with to this day as we hope youll be with us from now on and thats it for the time being thats all i have to say but as ive already said you have a choice stay here and work with us or return to the streets the terror the end of humanity except here humanity albeit a different humanity will go on that was enough for goodly having heard what he had wanted to hear so did the precog go on into the future but further much further than ever before this time the precogs mind found its own way for goodly could home in now on his target times and subjects as surely as david chung homed in on radiation or people of his acquaintance and when he knew hed reached a point of revelation there he paused once again he was the ghost not participating in the scene but simply viewing it it seemed to him that he was in a classroom or perhaps a church or a cross between the two but it was only dimly lit with tall windows set high in the walls so that the light came slanting in overhead crisscrossing without reaching down to the children and for the time being that worried him that the light wasnt reaching them the teacher or preacher was a woman she wore darktinted spectacles and held a piece of chalk in a whitedusted hand she was the only one who stood in a pool of reflected light that loaned her something more than a dusky outline and behind her on a blackboard there were names and words that goodly couldnt help but recognize perchorsk necroscope liz porton down trask new eden ebranch the minister responsible and last but not least goodly it was the end of the lesson and now the teacher was testing her charges she took up a rod pointed it at a word on the blackboard and said gordon clarke a small boy stood up like all the children he was a featureless blob in the gloom perchorsk he said in his little boys voice the bad blood came from perchorsk and those who brought it died there the true death aye as he sat down the pointer moved on and the teacher said jimmy chungskin another small figure stood up reciting the minister responsible he ministered the power and gave glory to the dome annie goldfarb said the teacher moving her pointer and a small girl answered liz she was wife to jake mother to harry jakeson he was a necroscope the fifth of his line the pointer moved on the teacher called a name and torton down a tall eager boy jumped up his voice like a chant jake the first brought wise men out of porton down they were the keepers of the blood and he brought others who understood the power of the sun to harness it and make the dome alice techschild said the teacher and ebranch came the answer ben trask was its father and ebranch mothered and fathered us all john garviskin said the teacher her pointer on the move across the blackboard er but without reading my thoughts if you dont mind eden a wellbuilt boy tried not to snigger they called the dome new eden which means innocence and a new beginning and when the dome failed they went out into the land and found the clean places and built again too smart by far john said the teacher after hed sat down dont think i didnt feel your probe cleverclogs then once again for the last time this session she moved her pointer and said jake jakeson goodly said that one in a strong sure voice he foresaw it all all of this and was able to guide them trask and the wise men and all and without his future we wouldnt have had one goodly and trask and the host of ebranch they could have had eternity but in choosing the blood that is true they relinquished their years to retain their humanity as we shall give of ours for our childrens sake and the teacher nodded and said so ends the lesson time to go home then it was a race for the door and goodly went with them out into into the sunlight out into the broad green fields under blue skies where for the first time he saw their eyes those different eyes of the children of ebranch that so perfectly reflected the nature of their genetically altered blood some of them were yelling jake this time well beat you home and jake jakeson the spitting image of another jake from another time except for those amazing eyes answered not a hope why im already there but the teacher grabbed his arm shook a finger and said jake jakeson the twelfth or is it the thirteenth why youre just like your father and his and his before him like all of them have been for two hundred and fifty years according to the books now listen to me by all means beat your friends home but do it on your own two feet and running beat them by running jake like all the rest of us and not by just by simply going there youre to stay fit and strong do you hear but youll only do that by using your godgiven muscles as well as your talents yes maam jake said looking up at her with his ohsoinnocent eyes those uniformly azure blue eyes she let go of his arm and turned toward the precog then gave a small start so that just for a moment he thought shed actually seen him there for like all of them the teacher was talented too but then frowning she blinked shook her head and turned to call one last time after jake two seconds too late for while the other children were streaming out over the fields toward their homes jake jakeson was no longer there and neither was the precog ian goodly for there was nothing left to see and only one place left to go ebranchs entire higher echelon its most senior members were standing at goodlys bedside his scarlet eyes moved from smiling face to face knowing they would find no one missing only to find someone missing and the first thing the precog said as he came fully awake was lardis for in those future times thered been no mention no hint of lardis lidesci ben trask laid a hand on the precogs arm and said dont concern yourself about lardis hes back in sunside lardis and lissa both taken there by nathan nathan recovered then said goodly struggling to sit up and as trask helped him but of course he must have for with the exception of the dweller he is the only one who ever moved between worlds without using one of the gates then he frowned and asked so what about it ben what about the gate gone said trask it all worked out fine and we did our job stopped those alien bastards at perchorsk and stopped them dead then the smile slipped from his face as for the world theres nothing good to report im afraid its going to hell and fast i know said goodly taking trasks hand and standing up and weve an awful lot to do the trouble is finding a place to start said jake cutter as he stepped forward hand in hand with liz but the precog only smiled albeit wryly and said no big deal jake but therell be work for you work for all of us and the sooner we get to it the better ian said trask anxiously whats going on are you sure youre im fine goodly cut him short and now if youre ready i want you to get the minister responsible in on this and call in every available agent and then and then yes said trask then ill tell you all just exactly how its going to be said the precog and thats just exactly how it was
