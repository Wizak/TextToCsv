james leech with a sneer pointing to a patch on the knee of herbert carters pants herberts face flushed he was not ashamed of the patch for he knew that his mothers poverty made it a necessity but he felt that it was mean and dishonorable in james leech whose father was one of the rich men of wrayburn to taunt him with what he could not help some boys might have slunk away abashed but herbert had pluck and stood his ground it is my style he answered firmly looking james boldly in the face i admire your taste then returned james with a smooth sneer then you had better imitate it retorted herbert thank you said james in the same insulting tone would you lend me your pants for a pattern excuse me though perhaps you have no other pair for shame james exclaimed one or two boys who had listened to the colloquy stirred to indignation by this heartless insult on the part of james leech to a boy who was deservedly a favorite with them all herberts fist involuntarily doubled and james though he did not know it ran a narrow chance of getting a good whipping but our young hero controlled himself not without some difficulty and said i have one other pair and these are at your service whenever you require them then turning to the other boys he said in a changed tone whos in for a game of ball i said one promptly and i said another herbert walked away accompanied by the other boys leaving james leech alone james looked after him with a scowl he was sharp enough to see that herbert in spite of his patched pants was a better scholar and a greater favorite than himself he had intended to humiliate him on the present occasion but he was forced to acknowledge that he had come off second best from the encounter he walked moodily away and took what comfort he could in the thought that he was far superior to a boy who owned but two pairs of pants and one of them patched he was foolish enough to feel that a boy or man derived importance from the extent of his wardrobe and exulted in the personal possession of eight pairs of pants this scene occurred at recess after school was over herbert walked home he was a little thoughtful there was no disgrace in a patch as he was sensible enough to be aware still he would have a little preferred not to wear one that was only natural in that point i suppose my readers will fully agree with him but he knew very well that his mother who had been left a widow had hard work enough to get along as it was and he had no idea of troubling her on the subject besides he had a better suit for sundays neat though plain and he felt that he ought not to be disturbed by james leechs insolence so thinking he neared the small house which he called home it was a small cottage with something less than an acre of land attached enough upon which to raise a few vegetables it belonged to his mother nominally but was mortgaged for half its value to squire leech the father of james the amount of the mortgage precisely was seven hundred and fifty dollars it had cost his father fifteen hundred when he built it obtaining half this sum on mortgage he hoped to pay it up by degrees but it turned out that from sickness and other causes this proved impossible when five months before he had died suddenly the house which was all he left was subject to this incumbrance upon this interest was payable semiannually at the rate of six per cent fortyfive dollars a year is not a large sum but it seemed very large to mrs carter when added to their necessary expenses for food clothing and fuel how it was to be paid she did not exactly see the same problem had perplexed herbert who like a good son as he was shared his mothers cares and tried to lighten them but in a small village like wrayburn there are not many ways of getting money at any rate for a boy there were no manufactories as in some large villages and money was a scarce commodity herbert had however one source of income half a dozen families living at some distance from the post office employed him to bring any letters or papers that might come for them and for this service he received a regular tariff of two cents for each letter and one cent for each paper he was not likely to grow rich on this income but he felt that though small it was welcome according to custom herbert called at the post office on his way home he found a letter for deacon crossleigh one for mr duncan two for dr waffit and papers for each of the two former ten cents he thought with satisfaction well that is better than nothing though it wont buy me a new pair of pants he was about to leave the office when the postmaster called after him wait a minute herbert i believe theres a letter for your mother herbert returned and received a letter bearing the following superscription mrs almira carter wrayburn new york i hope it isnt bad news said the postmaster i see its edged with black i cant make out where its from said herbert scanning the postmark critically nor i said the postmaster rubbing his glasses and taking another look the postmark is very indistinct theres an n and a p said herbert after a little examination i think it must be randolph randolph so it is i declare have you got any friends or relatives living there yes my mothers uncle herbert for whom i was named lives there then he must be dead what makes you think so the envelope is edged with black you had better carry it home before you go round with the others perhaps i had said herbert ill run so as not to keep the others waiting deacon crossleigh is always in a hurry for his paper yes the deacons always in a fidget to know whats going on particularly when congress is in session he takes a wonderful interest in politics herbert ran up the street with a quick step pausing a minute at his humble home you are out of breath herbert have you been running yes ive got a letter for you and i wanted to bring it before i went round with the rest a letter where from asked the widow with curiosity for she held very little intercourse with the world outside of wrayburn its postmarked randolph as well as i can make out while you are reading it ill run and leave my letters and be back to hear the news in a hurry to do all his errands and get back herbert ran all the way while his eyes were fixed on one of the envelopes he ran full against james leech who was walking up the street with a pompous air in the encounter jamess hat came off and he was nearly thrown down what made you run into me he demanded wrathfully excuse me james said herbert recovering himself you did it on purpose said his enemy glaring at him angrily that isnt very likely said herbert i got hit as hard as you did your hat didnt get knocked off pick it up said james imperiously pointing to it as it lay in the path i will because it is by my fault that it fell said herbert stooping over and picking it up you neednt have ordered me to do it the next time take care how you run against a gentleman said james arrogantly take care the next time to speak like a gentleman said herbert good night i must be off insolent beggar muttered james he dont know his place how dare he speak to me in that way chapter ii what the letter contained half an hour later herbert reentered the cottage breathless with running well mother what is it he asked uncle herbert is dead she answered when did he die yesterday morning they wrote at once the funeral is to take place tomorrow afternoon at three oclock uncle herbert was rich wasnt he mother yes he must have left nearly a hundred thousand dollars what a pile of money said herbert i wonder how a man feels when he is so rich he ought to be happy riches dont always bring happiness uncle herbert was disappointed in early life and that seemed to spoil his career he gave himself up to moneymaking and succeeded in it but he lived by himself and had few sources of happiness then he had no family no do you think he has left us anything mother asked herbert with something of hope in his tone i am afraid not if he had been disposed to do that he would have done something for us before he knew that we were poor and that a little assistance would have been very acceptable but he never offered it even when your father was sick for three months and i wrote to him for a small loan he refused saying that we ought to have laid up money to fall back upon at such a time i dont see how a man can be so unfeeling if he would only leave us a thousand dollars how much good it would do us we could pay up the mortgage on the house and have something left over it wouldnt have been much for him to do well we wont think too much about it said mrs carter it will be wisest as probably we should be only preparing ourselves for disappointment uncle had a right to do what he pleased with his own shall you go to the funeral mother i dont see how i can said mrs carter slowly it is twenty miles off and i am very busy just now still one of us ought to go if only to show respect to so near a relation people would talk if we didnt i think as you were named for your uncle herbert i will let you go if you think best mother i will walk and that will save expense it will be too much for you to take such a walk you had better ride no mother i am young and strong i can walk well enough but it must be twenty miles objected his mother the funeral doesnt take place till three oclock in the afternoon i will get up bright and early say at five oclock by nine i shall be halfway there i am afraid it will be too much for you herbert said mrs carter irresolutely you dont know how strong i am said herbert i shant get tired so easily as you think but twenty miles is a long distance i know that but i shall take it easy the stage fare is seventyfive cents and its a good way to save it i wish somebody would offer me seventyfive cents for every twenty miles i would walk id take it up as a profession i am afraid i could earn little that way i never was a good walker youre a woman said herbert patronizingly women are not expected to be good walkers some are i remember my aunt jane would take walks of five and six miles and think nothing of it i guess i could match her in walking said herbert confidently is she alive no she died three years since perhaps i take after her then you dont take after me i am sure of that i think herbert you had better take seventyfive cents with you so that if you get very tired with your walk over you can come back by stage all right mother ill take the money but i shall be sure not to need it it is best to be prepared for emergencies herbert if i am going tomorrow morning i must split up enough wood to last you while i am gone i am afraid you will tire yourself i think i can get along with what wood there is already split oh dont be afraid for me youll see ill come back as fresh as when i set out i expect to have a stunning appetite though ill try to cook up enough for you said his mother smiling herbert went out into the wood shed and went to work with great energy at the wood pile in the course of an hour he had sawed and split several large baskets full which he brought in and piled up behind the kitchen stove mrs carter could not be expected to feel very deep grief for the death of her uncle it was now more than six years since they had met he was a selfish man wholly wrapped up in the pursuit of wealth had he possessed benevolent instincts he would have offered to do something out of his abundance for his niece who he knew found it very hard to make both ends meet but he was a man who was very much averse to parting with his money while he lived he lived on a tenth of his income and saved up the rest though for what end he could not well have told since the death of mr carter whose funeral he had not taken the trouble to attend though invited he had not even written to his niece and she had abstained from making any advances lest it might be thought that she was seeking assistance under these circumstances she had little hope of a legacy though she could not help admitting the thought of how much a few hundred dollars would help her bridging over the time till herbert should be old enough to earn fair wages in some employment if he could study two or three years longer she would have been very glad for her son had already shown abilities of no common order but that was hardly to be thought of there mother i guess ive sawed wood enough to last you unless you are very extravagant said herbert reentering the kitchen and taking off his cap now is there anything else i can do you know i shall be gone two days or a day and a half at any rate i think of nothing herbert you had better go to bed early and get a good nights rest for you will have a hard day before you so i will but eight oclock will be soon enough just suppose we should get a legacy after all mother wouldnt it be jolly i wouldnt think too much of it herbert there isnt much chance of it besides it doesnt seem right to be speculating about our own personal advantage when uncle herbert lies dead in his house there was justice in this suggestion but herbert could hardly be expected to take a mournful view of the death of a relative whom he hardly remembered and who had appeared scarcely to be aware of his existence it was natural that the thought of his wealth should be uppermost in his young nephews mind the reader will hardly be surprised to hear that herbert knowing only too well the disadvantages of poverty should have speculated a little about his uncles property after he went to bed indeed it did not leave him even with his waking consciousness he dreamed that his uncle left him a big lump of gold so big and heavy that he could not lift it he was considering anxiously how in the world he was going to get it home when all at once he awoke and heard the church clock strike five time i was on my way he thought and jumping out of bed he dressed himself as quickly as possible and went downstairs but early as it was his mother was down before him there was a fire in the kitchen stove and the cloth was laid for breakfast what made you get up so early mother asked herbert i wouldnt have you go away without breakfast herbert especially for such a long walk i meant to take something from the closet that would have done well enough you will be all the better for a good warm cup of tea sit right down it is all ready early as it was the breakfast tasted good herbert ate hastily for he was anxious to be on his way knowing that he could not afford to buy lunch he put the remnants of the breakfast including some slices of bread and butter and meat into his satchel and started on his long walk chapter iii herbert meets a relative herbert had never been to randolph in fact he had never been so far away from wrayburn he was not afraid of losing his way however here and there along the road guideposts were conveniently placed and these removed any difficulty on that score when he had gone about six miles the coach rattled by it had started more than an hour later herbert turned out for the lumbering vehicle and waited for it to pass there was a boy on top but such was the cloud of dust that he could not at first recognize him it happened however that one of the traces broke so that the driver was compelled to make a stop just as he overtook our hero then he saw that the boy on top was james leech with james curiosity overcame his disinclination to speak to one so far beneath him where are you going carter he inquired to randolph was the answer going to walk all the way i expect to said herbert not relishing the crossexamination why dont you ride james did not ask for information he knew well enough already but as there are purseproud men so there are boys who are actuated by feelings equally unworthy and it delighted him to remind herbert of his poverty herbert divined this but he was proud in his way and answered because i choose well you must like the dust thats all said james complacently tapping his wellpolished boot with a light cane which he had bought where are you going asked herbert thinking it about time for him to commence questioning im going to randolph too answered james with unwonted affability im going to stop a few days with a friend of mine tom spencer his fathers a rich man got a nice place there didnt you ever hear of mr spencer the lawyer i dont think i have thats his father he makes a load of money by his law business i think i shall study law some time perhaps ill go into partnership with him what are you going to be i dont know yet said herbert i suppose youll be a mechanic of some kind a carpenter or mason or bricklayer perhaps so said herbert quietly what are you going to randolph for asked james with sudden curiosity to attend my uncles funeral whats your uncles name the same as mine i suppose he was poor no he was rich was he repeated james in some surprise what do you think he was worth about a hundred thousand dollars sho you dont say so perhaps continued james with newborn respect he has left you something in his will i dont think so why not he hasnt shown any interest in us for six years and i dont think hell remember us now james looked thoughtful he had never before heard of this relationship or he would have treated herbert differently the mere fact of having a wealthy relative elevated our hero considerably in his eyes then too there was a possibility that herbert would turn out a legatee when is your uncles funeral he inquired after a pause this afternoon you wont get there in time you had better get up and ride no i guess not well perhaps i shall meet you at randolph by this time the harness was repaired the driver resumed his seat and whipped up the horses to make up for lost time im glad i dont think as much of money as james leech thought herbert i suppose if my uncle would only leave us a good round sum he would forget that i once wore patched pants and accept me as his intimate friend this was exactly what james would have done and herbert showed that he was not wholly without knowledge of the world in forming the conjecture pausing occasionally to rest herbert at length accomplished his journey arriving at randolph a little after noon he stopped just outside the village and ate his frugal dinner which by this time he was prepared to relish he then took off his jacket and beat the dust out of it dusted his shoes and washed his face in a little brook by the roadside having thus effaced the marks of travel he entered the village and inquired the way to the residence of his late uncle he found out where it was but did not go there yet knowing that there would be preparations going on for the funeral neither did he go to the tavern for he knew that he would be expected to dine there and this was an expense which he did not feel able to incur he threw himself down in the shade of a tree and remained there until after he heard the church clock strike two he was still lying there when a young man smartly dressed sporting a showy watch chain and locket and an immense necktie came up the street and accosted him i say boy can you tell me where old man carters house is yes said herbert do you want to go there of course i do im one of the relatives ive come all the way from new york to attend the funeral im one of the relations too said herbert well go along together by jove thats strange how are you related to the old chap drawled the young man he was my mothers uncle was he well im a second or third cousin i dont know which never saw him to my knowledge in fact i wouldnt have come on to the funeral if i hadnt heard that he was rich expect to be remembered i dont think so he hasnt taken any notice of mother or myself for years indeed said the young man who was rather pleased to hear this intelligence are there many relations do you know i dont think there are thats good it makes our chance better you know i say whats your name herbert carter same as the old mans yes did he know you was named for him of course then he may leave you something for the name suggested the other not very well pleased i dont expect anything what is your name cornelius dixon im related to the old man on my mothers side are you in business in new york asked herbert who in spite of the queer manners of his new relative felt considerable respect for one who hailed from so important a city yes im a salesman in a new york store where do you live in wrayburn wheres that about twenty miles from here some onehorse country town i suppose are you in any business no said herbert but id like to be do you think you could get me a place in new york well said cornelius flattered by the belief in his influence which this inquiry implied perhaps i might you can give me your name and address so i can write to you if i hear of anything if the old man only leaves me a few thousand dollars ill go into business for myself and then id have an opening for you i hope he will then so do i that is where we both agree but perhaps it will be you that will get the cash i dont think so if you do put it into my hands and go into partnership with me ive got business experience you know while youre green countrified you know it would never do for you to start alone no i shouldnt think of it then its agreed is it said cornelius if i get a legacy ill take you into my store if you get it you will go into partnership with me im willing said herbert who really believed that his companion had as valuable business qualifications as he claimed how was he to know that the pretentious cornelius was only a salesman at twelve dollars a week in a drygoods store on eighth avenue by this time they had reached the rather dingylooking house of their deceased relative the front door was open they passed through the gate and entering took their places with the mourners chapter iv reading the will apparently the deceased had but few relatives but six persons were in a small room appropriated to the mourners when our hero and his new acquaintance entered one of these and far the most imposing in appearance was a stout lady who quite filled up the only armchair in the room in a plain chair close by was a meek little man three inches shorter and probably not more than half her weight a boy and girl the children of the illmatched pair the former resembling the father the latter the mother were ranged alongside permit me to introduce mr and mrs josiah pinkerton of castleton an adjoining town master albert and miss nancy pinkerton mrs pinkerton is a milliner and her husband is her clerk and errand boy she has considerable business capacity and makes enough to support the family comfortably besides adding something annually to the fund in the savings bank the relationship to the deceased is on the side of the husband who is a cousin this relationship has given rise to great expectations on the part of mrs pinkerton who fully expects to inherit half the estate of mr carter if we get it josiah she has promised magnificently ill buy you a new suit of clothes but maria expostulated the meek husband it will be left to me not to you why so demanded she frowning because he is my cousin not yours you indeed retorted the wife angrily and what do you know about the use of money who supports the family i should like to know i help answered josiah meekly and precious little you help returned his wife sarcastically so far as you are concerned we should all be in the poor house long before this no josiah the money must come into my hands ill give you a good allowance and hire an errand boy so that you neednt have to carry round bundles you ought to be contented with that as no legacy had yet been received mr pinkerton thought it best not to continue the discussion indeed he was rather afraid of his imperious wife who held the reins of authority and whom he did not dare to dispute the two other relations were first a brownfaced and brownhanded farmer alonzo granger and an old lady of seventy or thereabouts miss nancy carter a sister of the deceased for years she had lived on a small pension from her brother increased somewhat by knitting stockings for the neighbors she indeed was the only real mourner the rest were speculating about how far they were likely to be benefited by the death of the deceased of whom they had seen but little in life even herbert though impressed by the presence of death could hardly be expected to feel deep grief for a man who had neglected his mother in his life of the funeral rites it is unnecessary to speak we are interested in what came afterwards the relations were quietly notified to meet at five oclock in the office of mr spencer the lawyer to whom had been intrusted the will of the late mr carter those who have even a slight knowledge of human nature will not need to be told that the attendance of all was punctual there was an anxious expectant look on the faces of all not even excepting the old lady she knew that if her brother had made no provision for her she must go to the almshouse and against this her honest pride revolted she was willing to live on anything however little if she might live independently as she had hitherto done to feel herself dependent on public charity would indeed have been a hard trial for the poor old lady of all probably mrs pinkerton was the most confident she had come to feel that her family was entitled to a large share of the estate and she had gone so far as to decide just how she would invest it and what new arrangements she would make for she had no idea of consulting her husband on the subject the lawyer was a gentlemanlylooking man whose face inspired confidence in his integrity a remark which unhappily cannot be made of all in his profession he took his seat at a table and produced the will which he considerately commenced reading at once after the usual introduction the will proceeded thus to my sister nancy i give the use of my house rent free as long as she shall live i leave her also an income of two hundred dollars a year which as her wants are small will be sufficient to maintain her in comfort the old lady breathed a sigh of relief her fears were removed she could continue to live as she had been accustomed to do and need not be beholden to private or public charity mrs pinkerton was not so well pleased she felt almost as if she had been deprived of what belonged to her by right she frowned at miss nancy but the old lady was unconscious of the displeasure excited in the bosom of her imposinglooking relative the lawyer proceeded to my cousin alonzo granger i leave one hundred dollars not because he needs it for i understand that he is welltodo but as a mark of remembrance the farmer scowled slightly and opened and closed his brown hands in dissatisfaction he was welltodo but when was a man ever satisfied with that he had counted upon a few thousands with which he proposed to buy an adjoining farm mrs pinkerton however was pleased there was so much the more for her to cornelius dixon here herberts morning acquaintance began to feel excited i bequeath one hundred dollars to buy a lookingglass and a new suit of clothes the young mans face lengthened very perceptibly as he heard the small amount of his legacy and he glared savagely at mrs pinkerton who showed a mirthful face at his discomfiture her turn came next to josiah pinkerton his wife and children i leave one hundred dollars apiece also my best black pantaloons which he or his wife may appropriate as may be arranged between them all except the pinkertons laughed at this sly hit and even the lawyer smiled but the stout lady flushed with rage and disappointment and ejaculated abominable the eyes of all were now directed to herbert who was the only one remaining could it be possible that the balance of the property was left to him the fear of this made him the focus of unfriendly eyes and he became restive and anxious to my namesake herbert carter i leave a black trunk which i keep in my room with all that it contains to his mother i direct that the sum of one hundred dollars be paid this was not much but it was more than herbert had expected he knew how welcome even one hundred dollars would be to his mother and he looked satisfied the only one of the party except the old lady who showed any pleasure at the contents of the will the relatives looked bewildered all had been mentioned in turn and yet but a small part a very small part of the estate had been disposed of mrs pinkerton bluntly expressed the general curiosity whos to have the rest mr spencer she demanded im coming to that answered the lawyer quietly all the rest and residue of my property of whatever kind i leave to the town of randolph to establish a high school directing that not more than twenty thousand dollars be expended upon the building which shall be of brick i desire that the school shall be known as the carter school to the end that my name may be remembered in connection with what i hope will prove a public blessing that is all said the lawyer and he laid down the will upon the table chapter v what came afterward there was silence for a minute after the will was read mrs pinkerton fanned herself furiously and looked angry and excited at length she said i wish to say that that is a very unjust will mr spencer i am not responsible for it mrs pinkerton answered the lawyer quietly i dont know what the rest of you think said the angry lady with a general glance around the office but i think the will ought to be broken on what grounds asked mr spencer he had no right to put off his own flesh and blood with a beggarly pittance and leave all his money to the town pardon me whatever you may think of mr carters will there is no doubt that he had a perfect legal right to dispose of it as he did then the laws ought to be altered said mrs pinkerton angrily i dont believe he was sane when he made the will if you can prove that said the lawyer you can set aside the will but not otherwise my brother was in his right mind here interposed miss nancy he always meant to give the town money for a school no doubt you think he was sane sneered mrs pinkerton turning upon the old lady you have fared better than any of us miss nancy was most nearly related to the deceased said the lawyer and she needed help most its all very well to talk said the lady tossing her head but me and mine have been badly used i have hard work enough to support the family and little help i get from him she added pointing to her unhappy husband im workin all the time remonstrated josiah you are unkind maria i could hire a boy to do all your work for three dollars a week she retorted thats all you help me ive worried along for years expectin mr carter would do something handsome for us and now hes put us off with four hundred dollars i get only one hundred said the farmer and i too its a beastly shame remarked cornelius really said the lawyer it appears to me unseemly to speak so bitterly so soon after the funeral i dare say you like it well enough said mrs pinkerton sharply youve got all our money to build a schoolhouse it will not benefit me any more than the townspeople generally said the lawyer for my part i should have been glad if my late friend had left a larger sum to those connected with him by blood dont you think we could break the will asked mrs pinkerton persuasively couldnt you help us you can attempt it but i assure you in advance you havent the ghost of a chance you would only lose your money for the town would strenuously oppose you the stout ladys face fell she felt that the last hope was gone all i can say is that its a scandalous thing she concluded bitterly i should like to know whats in that trunk he left you said cornelius dixon turning to herbert maybe its money or bonds if it is dont forget our agreement this drew attention to herbert to be sure said mrs pinkerton whose curiosity was aroused mr dixon may be right suppose we all go over to the house and open it herbert looked irresolutely toward the lawyer there is no objection i suppose said mr spencer i know whats in the trunk said miss nancy straightway all eyes were turned upon her what is it its clothes my brother used to keep his clothes in that trunk cornelius dixon burst into a rude laugh i say herbert i congratulate you he said with a chuckle the old fellows left you his wardrobe youll look like a peacock when you put em on if you ever come to new york to see me leave em at home i wouldnt like to walk up broadway with such a gawk as youd look young man said miss nancy her voice tremulous it dont look well in you to ridicule my poor departed brother he didnt forget you he might as well muttered cornelius i hope you wont laugh at my brothers gift said the old lady turning to herbert no maam said herbert respectfully i am glad to get it i cant afford to buy new clothes often and they can be made over for me you wouldnt catch me wearing such oldfashioned duds said cornelius scornfully no one asked you to young man said the old lady disturbed at the manner in which her brother was spoken of the boys worth a dozen of you thank you said cornelius bowing with mock respect i should like to ask he continued turning to the lawyer when i can get my legacy it isnt much but i might as well take it as the amount is small i will send you a check next week said mr spencer if you will leave me your address and can i have my money too demanded mrs pinkerton its a miserable pittance but i owe it to my poor children to take it i will send your husband a check also next week madam you neednt send it to him you may send it to me said the lady part of it is mine expostulated the husband in meek deprecation i can give you your part said his wife mr spencer you may make the check payable to me but maria be silent josiah dont make a fool of yourself said his wife in an imperious tone the poor man was fain to be silent but the lawyer was indignant and said mr pinkerton i will certainly not pay your legacy nor your childrens to anyone but yourself i will send mrs pinkerton a check for her own share one hundred dollars since she desires it i insist upon your sending me the childrens money also said the lady angrily he aint fit to take charge of it you may insist as much as you like mrs pinkerton said the lawyer coolly but it will be useless as the head of the family i shall send the money designed for the children to your husband do you call him the head of the family demanded the angry maria i would have you to know sir that i am the head of the family the law does not recognize you as such as to the pantaloons which form a part of the legacy i will forward them to you if you wish do you mean to insult me sir gasped mrs pinkerton growing very red in the face not at all but they were left either to you or your husband as you might jointly agree the lady was about to decline accepting them at all but it occurred to her that they might be made over to suit her husband and so save the expense of a new pair and she directed that they should be sent to him then gathering her family about her she strode majestically from the office shaking off metaphorically the dust of her feet against it next mr granger after a few words with the lawyer departed mr cornelius dixon also announced that he must depart come and see me some time in the city he said to herbert and if you ever get a windfall just put it into my hands and ill go into business with you ill remember said herbert but im afraid itll be a good while before that i dont know about that you can open a secondhand clothing store the old mans left you a good stock in trade good joke isnt it goodby next miss nancy rose to go tell your mother to call and see me my boy she said kindly to herbert i wish my brotherd left her more for i know she needs it thank you miss nancy said herbert respectfully but we dont complain we are thankful for what we have received youre the best of em said the old lady earnestly youre a good boy and god will prosper you she went out and of the eight heirs herbert alone remained chapter vi the lawyers home the lawyer regarded herbert with a smile your uncles will doesnt seem to have given general satisfaction he said no responded herbert but for my part i have come out as well as i expected i suppose you know mr carter was rich so my mother told me how much do you think he was worth herbert was rather surprised at this question why should the lawyer ask it when of course he knew much more about the matter about a hundred thousand dollars i suppose he answered you are not far wrong now doesnt your share and your mothers seem very small compared with this large amount it is very small compared with that but we had no claim to anything the clothes and the money will be very useful to us you are a model heir said mr spencer smiling you alone do not find fault except of course miss nancy who has fared the best i would rather make a fortune for myself than inherit one from another said herbert sturdily i respect your independence my boy said the lawyer who felt favorably disposed toward our hero still a legacy isnt to be despised now tell me when you want to take your trunk i want to ask your advice about that said herbert i walked over from wrayburn how shall i carry the trunk back you will have to return by the stage tomorrow morning that is if you are ready to go back so soon do they charge much to stop overnight at the hotel asked herbert anxiously for he had but seventyfive cents with him it occurred to him how foolish he had been not to consider that it would be necessary for him to spend the night in randolph i dont know exactly how much i think they charge fifty cents for a bed and the same for each meal herberts face lengthened and he became alarmed how was he going to manage on his limited resources the lawyer penetrated his perplexity and being a kindhearted man quickly came to his relief i think you would find it lonely at the hotel my boy he said and i shall therefore invite you to pass the night at my house instead you are very kind sir said herbert gratefully finding his difficulty happily removed i accept your invitation with pleasure the boy has been well brought up if he is poor thought mr spencer well he said that is settled i think our supper must be ready so we will go over to the house at once by the way there is a boy from your town visiting my son you must know him is it james leech asked herbert remembering what james had told him yes do you know him we are schoolmates then it will be pleasant for you to meet herbert was not quite sure about this but forbore to say so he accompanied mr spencer to his house which was just across the street from the office and followed the lawyer into an apartment handsomely furnished james leech and tom spencer were sitting at a small table playing checkers hello carter exclaimed james in surprise how came you here mr spencer invited me said herbert not surprised at the mode of address did your uncle leave you anything asked james with interest yes how much he left my mother a hundred dollars that isnt much said james contemptuously was that all no he left me a trunk and what is in it what is in it clothes i believe a lot of old clothes commented james turning up his nose thats a fine legacy i must say i shall find them useful said herbert quietly oh no doubt you can roll up the pants and coatsleeves it will be fun to see you parading round in your uncles tailcoats i dont think youll have that pleasure said herbert flushing if i wear them i shall have them made over for me i congratulate you on your new and extensive wardrobe said james mockingly wont you cut a dash though on the streets of wrayburn herbert did not deign a reply to this rude speech tom spencer who was much more of a gentleman than james was disgusted with his impertinence he rose and took herbert by the hand you must let me introduce myself he said my name is thomas spencer and i am glad to see you here thank you said herbert his heart opening at the frank and cordial manner of the other my name is herbert carter and i am very glad to make your acquaintance are you going to finish this game tom drawled james not relishing the idea of herberts receiving any attention from his friend if you dont mind well have it another time said tom there goes the supper bell and i for one am hungry at the supper table james noticed to his secret disgust that herbert was treated with as much consideration as himself mr and mrs spencer appeared to consider them social equals which made james very uncomfortable you boys are about of an age i suppose said mr spencer i really dont know said james haughtily you attend the same school yes said james but i expect to go to some select academy very soon at a public school you have to associate with all classes you know mr spencer arched his brows and steadily regarded the young aristocrat i dont see any great distinction of classes in a country village said he dryly besides we are living in a republic you wouldnt like to associate on equal terms with a day laborer said james pertly i am a laborer myself said the lawyer smiling i wish i could say i were a day laborer exclusively but sometimes i have to work into the night you are a professional man and a gentleman said james you dont work with your hands i hope you boys will all grow up gentlemen said mr spencer i shall of course said james and you tom i hope so and you herbert i hope so too said herbert but if it is necessary to be rich to be a gentleman i am not sure about it what is your idea of a gentleman james asked the lawyer he must be of a good family and wear good clothes and live nicely is that all he ought to be well educated i see you name that last which i should name first so these constitute a gentleman in your opinion yes sir not always i have known men combining all the qualifications you have mentioned who were very far from being gentlemen in my opinion how is that sir asked james puzzled they were arrogant puffed up with an idea of their own importance deficient in politeness how well he has described james thought herbert but he was too much of a gentleman to say so james looked disconcerted and dropped the subject he thought the lawyer had some queer ideas why need a gentleman be polite to his inferiors he thought but he didnt say so after supper the boys went out behind the house and feasted on peaches which were just ripe herbert found tom very social but james took very little notice of him our hero did not make himself unhappy on this account in fact he was in unusual good spirits and enjoyed in anticipation the pleasure of going back to wrayburn with the welcome news of the two legacies about half past seven mr spencer came out into the orchard as the stage starts early in the morning herbert he said we had better go over and get the trunk ready so that you can take it home james leech hoped to receive an invitation to accompany the two but no invitation was given and he was forced to content himself with staying behind chapter vii a welcome discovery mr spencer entered the house so lately vacated by the old man who had occupied it for forty years the trunk is in your uncles room said the lawyer or ought to be i suppose it has not been moved the two entered the chamber it was a small poorly furnished apartment covered with a carpet which cheap in the first place was so worn with use that the bare floor showed in spots your uncle was not very luxurious in his taste said mr spencer there are plenty of day laborers in town who have as good rooms as this i suppose he liked laying up money better than spending it said herbert you are right there this must be the trunk it was a small black hair trunk studded with brass nails mr spencer took a bunch of keys from his pocket and unlocked it lifting the cover he exposed to view a collection of woolen clothescoats vests and pants this is your legacy herbert said the lawyer i am afraid you wont find it very valuable what is this he drew out and held up to view a blue cloak of ample proportions will you try it on he said smiling herbert threw it over his shoulders and looked at himself in a small sevenbynine lookingglass which was suspended over the washstand it came down nearly to his feet i should hardly dare to wear this without alteration he said but there is a good deal of good cloth in it mother can cut a coat and vest out of it for me here is a blue coat with brass buttons i remember your uncle used to wear it to church twenty years ago of late years he has not attended and has had no occasion to wear it here is a pair of pantaloons but they are pretty well worn so they went through the list finding little of value the last article was a vest it seems heavy said herbert the lawyer took it from him and examined it there seems to be an inside pocket he said there must be something in it the pocket was confined by a button mr spencer thrust his fingers inside and drew out something loosely enveloped in brown paper what have we here he said in a tone of curiosity the secret was speedily solved when the paper was opened it was found to contain five gold eagles and two dollars in silver coins herberts eyes glistened with delight as he viewed the treasure fiftytwo dollars he exclaimed and it is mine undoubtedly the will expressly says you are to have the trunk and all it contains i wonder whether uncle herbert remembered this money we cant tell as to that but it doesnt affect your title to the money i congratulate you herbert it will do us a great deal of good then there are the hundred dollars for mother why we shall be rich then you are content with your legacy asked mr spencer oh yes it was more than i expected or mother either yet it is but a mere drop of your uncles wealth said the lawyer thoughtfully that may be but he neednt have left us anything i see you look upon it in the best way you are quite a model heir very different from most of your relatives mrs pinkerton for instance i supposed she expected more than i did she appeared to expect the bulk of the property i am afraid her husband will have a hard time of it for a week to come said the lawyer laughing he will have to bear the brunt of her disappointment well there seems no more for us to do here we have found out the value of your legacy and may lock the trunk again if you will lend a hand we will take it across to my house so that there may be no delay when the stage calls in the morning all right sir james leech was looking out of the front window awaiting the return of mr spencer and herbert with not a little curiosity at length he spied them tom he exclaimed your father and that carter boy are coming back why do you call him that carter boy why dont you call him herbert i am not on intimate terms with him said james that is strange as you both live in the same village you must remember that there is some difference in our social positions said james haughtily that is something i never think of said tom candidly i am a genuine republican i am not said james i should like to live in england where they have noblemen not unless you could be a nobleman yourself i suppose no of course not by this time mr spencer and herbert were bringing the trunk into the front entry i shouldnt think a professional gentleman like your father would like to be seen carrying a trunk across the street said james oh he dont care for that nor should i said tom herbert entered the room well herbert what luck asked tom better than i expected said herbert gayly what do you say to that and he displayed the gold and silver how much is it asked james his vanity melting under the influence of curiosity fiftytwo dollars capital said tom it isnt much said james in a tone of depreciation ill bet herbert is richer than you james said tom in a lively manner can you show as much money as that i shall be a rich man some day said james with an air of importance your father may fail the moon may be made of green cheese retorted james loftily how about the clothes are you going to show them i think not said herbert a parcel of rags i suppose said james with a sneer not quite so bad as that responded herbert goodnaturedly still i think i shall hardly venture to wear any of them without alteration i wouldnt wear secondhand clothes remarked james leech in his usual amiable tone perhaps you would if you were poor said herbert quietly but i am not poor fortunately for you then you wont show the clothes i suppose they look as if they were made in the year one for our forefather adam suggested tom laughing i am inclined to think the old gentleman in question hadnt clothes enough to fill a trunk as large as that probably not said herbert he had no uncle you know to leave any to him what are you going to do with your money carter asked james whose curiosity got the better of his dignity occasionally i havent made up my mind yet i think i shall find plenty of uses for it what would you do with it if you had it james asked tom i can have more if i want to i have only to ask father then youre better off than i say father will you give me fiftytwo dollars when you are twentyone i may do it you see said tom but you havent answered my question what would you do with the money if you had it i think i would buy a new rowboat theres a pond near our house when you get it send for me and ill help you row very well said james but he did not answer very positively in fact he was by no means sure that his father would comply with his request for money although it suited him to make this representation to his companions herbert retired early it had been a fatiguing day for him and it would be necessary to rise in good season the next day as the coach left randolph for wrayburn at an early hour chapter viii herberts return mrs carter awaited herberts return with interest she felt lonely without him for he had never before been away from home to stay overnight but there was a feeling of anticipation besides her hopes of a legacy were not very strong but of course there was a possibility of her uncles having remembered them in his will even if it is only five dollars it will be welcome she thought where people are so poor as we are every little helps she sat at her sewing when the stage stopped before the door im glad he rode home thought the widow the walk both ways would have been too fatiguing but why does not herbert come in at once he had gone behind the coach and the driver was helping him take down a trunk where did he get it thought his mother in surprise i guess you can get it into the house yourself she heard the driver say yes ill manage it you neednt wait said herbert the driver cracked his whip and the lumbering old coach drove on oh there you are mother said herbert looking toward the house for the first time ill be with you in a minute and he began to draw the trunk in through the front gate where did you get that trunk herbert asked mrs carter oh its my legacy said herbert laughing here it is and he lifted it up and laid it down in the front entry what is inside asked his mother with natural curiosity it isnt full of gold and silver mother so dont raise your expectations too high it contains some clothes of uncle herbert out of which you can get some for me i am glad of that for you need some new clothes well we were not forgotten after all you dont seem disappointed mother i might have wished for a little money besides herbert but beggars cannot be choosers but sometimes they get what they wish for uncle herbert left you a legacy of a hundred dollars a hundred dollars said mrs carter brightly why that will be quite a help for us was it left to me yes to you it was kind in your uncle my legacy is more than yours herbert i dont know about that mother look here and herbert displayed his gold and silver here are fiftytwo dollars that i found in the pocket of a vest it belongs to me for the will says expressly that i am to have the trunk and all it contains i am really glad said his mother joyfully we are more fortunate than i expected sit down and tell me all about it who got the bulk of the property none of the relations it is bequeathed to the town of randolph to found a high school to be called the carter school well it will do good at any rate didnt the other relations receive legacies small ones but they didnt seem very well satisfied do you know mr and mrs josiah pinkerton slightly said mrs carter smiling were they there she was and he was in attendance upon her she didnt give him a chance to say much i have always heard she kept him in good subjection how did they fare they and their two children received a hundred dollars apiece she was mad and wanted to break the will then there was a mr granger a farmer who got the same and cornelius dixon also i hope aunt nancy fared better she is the best of them all she is allowed to occupy the house rent free and is to have an income of two hundred dollars a year as long as she lives i am really glad to hear it said mrs carter with emphasis she deserves all her good fortune one of the best things her brother did in life was to allow her such an income as to keep her independent of public charity i feared he would forget to provide for her she seems a good old lady she asked me to invite you to call and see her i should like to do so and if i ever have occasion to go to randolph i will certainly do so now mother said herbert when he had answered his mothers questions i want you to take this money and use it as you need but herbert it was left to you and if you use it i shall receive my share of it by the way your money will be sent you next week so mr spencer assured me who is mr spencer the lawyer who read the will he was very kind to me it was at his house i spent the night i got acquainted with his son tom a fine fellow i met also james leech whom i cannot compliment so highly he was visiting tom i never thought him an agreeable boy nor anyone else i expect he appears to think he can put on airs and expects everybody to bow down to him because his father is a rich man i hope you didnt quarrel with him said mrs carter apprehensively oh no he sneered at me as usual and drew a ridiculous picture of my appearance with my uncles clothes on do you mind what he says asked his mother anxiously a little said herbert but i can stand it if he doesnt go too far he has an unhappy nature i think his father must have been somewhat like him when he was young so do i he feels just as important as james i like to see him strut round as if he owned the whole village he does own more of it than anyone else among the rest he owns our house in part you mean he has a mortgage on it mother yes seven hundred and fifty dollars isnt it yes herbert how much do you consider the whole worth asked our hero thoughtfully it cost your father fifteen hundred dollars that is the land nearly an acre cost three hundred dollars and the house to build twelve hundred would it sell for that not if a sale were forced but if anybody wanted it fifteen hundred dollars would not be too much to pay i wish the mortgage were paid so do i my son but we are not very likely to be able to pay it how fine it would have been if uncle herbert had left us say eight hundred dollars so that we might have paid it up and still have had a little left for immediate use yes herbert it would have made us feel quite independent but it isnt best speculating on what might have been it is better to do the best we can with what we really have i suppose you are right mother but it is pleasant to dream of good fortune even if we know it is out of reach the trouble is our dreaming often interferes with our working it shant interfere with mine ive got something to work for do you refer to anything in particular herbert yes i want to pay off this mortgage answered herbert manfully some day when you are a man you may be able but the time is too far off to spend much time upon it at present herbert had moved to the window as the conversation went on suddenly he called to his mother look mother there is squire leech riding up he is pointing out our house to the man that is riding with him do you know who it is yes it is mr banks his new superintendent he has just come into the village i wonder why he pointed at our house probably he was telling him that he had a mortgage on it when does the interest come due on the mortgage next week i had only five dollars laid by to meet it but thanks to my legacy i shall have no trouble in the matter if you couldnt pay the interest could the squire foreclose yes thats the law i believe and he would take advantage of it but he never shall if i can prevent it chapter ix a business confidence squire leech lived in a large square white house situated on an eminence some way back from the street it had bay windows on either side of the front door a gravel walk bordered with flowers leading to the gate a small summerhouse on the lawn and altogether was much the handsomest residence in the village three years before the house or at all events the principal rooms had been newly furnished from the city no wonder the squire and all the family held up their heads and regarded themselves as belonging to the aristocracy in a back room used partly as a sitting room partly as an office the great man and his new superintendent amos banks were sitting the evening previous to herberts return home it may be asked why squire leech needed a superintendent to this i answer that his property beside the home farm included two outlying farms which he preferred to carry on himself rather than let to tenants besides he had stocks and bonds to which he himself attended but the farms required more attention than he individually was willing to bestow accordingly he employed a competent man who had the general supervision of them his former superintendent having emigrated to the west he had engaged mr banks who had been recommended to him for the charge banks came from a town thirty miles distant and had never lived in wrayburn before he had just entered upon his duties and was talking over business matters with the squire you will occupy the house on the ross farm said squire leech i think you will find it comfortable i have always reserved it for my superintendent there is a house on the other farm i suppose said banks yes but that is occupied by a family already i dont rent the farm that is except about half an acre of land for a kitchen garden that i have prepared to cultivate myself precisely said the superintendent i will tell you why i inquired you tell me there will be need of another permanent farm workman now i know an excellent man in fact he is a cousin of my own who would be glad to accept the place very well i have no objection to your engaging him since you vouch for him oh yes he is a faithful and industrious man and he will be willing to do work for moderate wages indeed he cares more for a permanent place than high pay where he is now he is liable to be idle for some months in the year is he a family man yes he has two young children of course he will move to wrayburn yes if he can get a suitable house in fact that was what i was coming at i thought of your other house but you say that is already occupied yes and the family has occupied it for several years i should not like to dislodge them do you know any other small house my cousin could rent squire leech reflected the fact is he said after a pause there has not been much building going on in wrayburn for several years and it is hard to find a vacant house i am sorry for that i am afraid it may interfere with browns coming there is one house i think that would just suit your cousin said squire leech slowly where is it it is now occupied by the widow carter and her son is she going to move she wouldnt like to then how will that help us who owns the house she does that is nominally i hold a mortgage on the place for seven hundred and fifty dollars which is more than half the market value then it may eventually fall into your hands very probably between ourselves i think it probable that she will fail to be ready with the semiannual interest which comes due next week she is quite poor has nothing but this property and has to sew for a living or braid straw neither of which pays well suppose she is not ready with the interest do you propose to foreclose i think i shall i will allow her three or four hundred dollars for her share of the property and that will be the best thing she can do in my opinion whether or not it would be the best thing for mrs carter it certainly wouldnt be a bad speculation for the squire since the place as already stated was worth fully fifteen hundred dollars how a rich man can deliberately plot to defraud a poor woman of a portion of her small property you and i my young reader may find it hard to understand unfortunately there are too many cases in real life where just such things happen so that there really seems to be a good deal of truth in the old adage that prosperity hardens the heart if mr banks had been a just or kindhearted man he would not have encouraged his employer in the plan he had just broached but he was selfish and thought he saw in it an easy solution of the difficulty which he had met with in securing a house for his cousin he did not know mrs carter and felt no particular interest in the question what was to become of her if she was ejected from her house no doubt she would find a home somewhere at any rate it was not his business it seems to me that will be an excellent plan he said with satisfaction how soon can we find out about it next week tuesday it is then that the interest comes due suppose she is ready to pay the interest what then then i will make her an offer for the place and represent to her that it will be the better plan for her to part with it and so escape the payment of interest she has to pay fortyfive dollars a year and that is a great drain upon one who earns no more than she does i think you said she had a son does he earn anything or perhaps he isnt old enough yes he is thirteen or fourteen still there isnt much in a small village like this for a boy to do he is attending school i believe then in one way or another you think there is a good chance of our obtaining the house said the superintendent with satisfaction yes i think so how would it do to go around and speak to the widow about it beforehand i could then write to brown as to that she may be very particular to retain the house and even if she is not provided with the money succeed in borrowing enough now my idea is to say nothing about it till tuesday she may depend upon my waiting a few days that i shall not do if the money is not forthcoming i will foreclose at once without giving her time to arrange for the money the superintendent nodded a very shrewd plan squire leech he said by the way where is the house situated only a furlong up the road it is on the opposite side of the way i think i remember it there is some land connected with it isnt there nearly an acre the house is small but neat in fact for a small place i consider it quite desirable tomorrow we will ride by it and you can take more particular notice they did ride by as we know and squire leech pointed it out to his superintendent herbert noticed this but he did not know that the two men had formed a scheme for turning his mother and himself out of their comfortable home and defrauding his mother of a considerable portion of the small property which his father had left had he known this it would have filled him with indignation and he would have felt that even property is no absolute safeguard against the selfish schemes of the mercenary and the rapacious chapter x squire leech is baffled tuesday arrived but as yet the check from mr spencer had not been received never mind mother said herbert you will get it before the end of the week but i shall need it to pay the interest to squire leech he will call for it today how much it is twentytwo dollars and a half you forget the gold i handed you last week i dont like to use it herbert i want you to use it for yourself i am as much interested in paying the interest as you mother dont i occupy the house seeing that herbert was in earnest mrs carter overcame her scruples and laid aside enough of the money to make up the amount required about five minutes of twelve squire leech was seen advancing to the front door with slow pompous steps there he comes mother said herbert ill open the door is your mother at home herbert asked the squire in a dignified tone yes sir wont you walk in ahem yes i think i will i have a little matter of business with her squire leech entered the small sitting room which seemed uncomfortably full when he was in it not on account of his size but because he seemed so swollen with a sense of his own importance as to convey the idea that he was cramped for space very much like an owl in the cage of a canary good morning squire leech said the widow good morning maam i apprehend you know my errand i suppose you come for the interest squire leech you are quite right of course you are prepared to pay it though the squire said of course he by no means expected that it would be ready nor for reasons which we know did he desire it he was rather discomfited therefore when mrs carter said did you bring a receipt with you squire a receipt in full queried the great man yes sir are you prepared to pay the whole today yes sir this ought to have been gratifying intelligence but it was not the squire looked quite crestfallen no i didnt bring a receipt he said slowly ill bring writing materials said herbert promptly he left the room but appeared almost instantly with pen ink and paper the squire sat down to the table with a disappointed air and slowly wrote the required document he seems sorry to receive the money thought herbert who was quick in reading the faces of others i wonder why and he gazed at the visitor in some perplexity the squire received the money and handed the widow the receipt still he did not seem inclined to go he was thinking how to broach the subject of selling the house mrs carter he began fortyfive dollars a year seems a good deal for you to pay yes it is considerable said the widow surprised could it be that he intended to reduce the interest that did not seem like him for one in your circumstances i mean of course youve got to earn your own living and your sons herbert does his share said the mother when he is older i shall feel quite easy but that time is a good way off ive been thinking of your case mrs carter and as a man of business i see my way clear to offer you a little advice i shall be thankful for any advice squire said the widow meekly of course your judgment in business matters is much better than mine herbert listened to this conversation with eager interest what could the squire mean to advise ive been thinking said the squire deliberately that it would be a good plan for you to sell this house to sell it repeated mrs carter in surprise but where could i live you might hire a couple of rooms for yourself and herbert i dont see how mother would gain anything interrupted herbert she would have to pay rent very true but she would get some money down for the house over and above the mortgage i dont know as anybody would want to buy it said mrs carter i would take it off your hands simply to oblige you said the squire with an air of extraordinary consideration i dont know that it would be of any particular use to me i might not get a tenant still i am better able to take the risk than you are to keep it how much would you be willing to pay for it asked herbert who somehow suspected that the squire was more selfish than benevolent in the plan he had broached why said squire leech assuming a meditative look over and above the mortgage i would be willing to pay three hundred dollars cash that would make the value of the place only ten hundred and fifty dollars said herbert well you dont consider it worth any more than that do you my husband considered it worth fifteen hundred dollars said the widow it cost him that the squire laughed heartily really my dear madam that is utterly preposterous fifteen hundred dollars why that is ridiculous it cost that said herbert sturdily i very much doubt it said the squire i dont believe it cost a cent over twelve hundred dollars i have my husbands papers to show that it cost fifteen hundred said the widow then all i have to say is he was outrageously cheated said the squire i believe i know as much about real estate as any man in town he proceeded pompously indeed i own more than any other man i assure you on my word i have offered you a very good price i would rather not sell said the widow gently but decidedly i will increase my offer to eleven hundred including the mortgage said the squire who saw the prize slipping through his fingers and felt it necessary to bid higher eleven hundred dollars thats three hundred and fifty dollars cash mother i am sure you wont think of selling for any such sum expostulated herbert no said his mother i dont want to sell you stand very much in your own light maam said the squire impatiently and you herbert are too young to offer any advice on such a subject i dont see why said herbert independently i ought to feel interested in such a matter you are a boy and have no judgment boys of your age should be seen and not heard said the squire sternly i can see what is best for my mothers interest said herbert i decline to discuss the matter with you i consider your interference impertinent said the squire becoming angry oh herbert said his mother who was a little in awe of the great man of the village be respectful to squire leech i mean to be said herbert but im sure hes wrong in thinking i have nothing to do with this matter reflect again mrs carter persisted the squire of the advantages of my proposal think how comfortable you would feel in knowing that you had three hundred and fifty dollars on interest in the savings bank i admit that i may not offer you quite as much as the place cost but houses never fetch their first cost ive made you a very fair offer maam very fair i wont say anything as to that squire leech but this house my poor husband built in this house i have passed many happy years and while we can keep it herbert and i we will there is no other place in town that would seem so much like home this is all very sentimental maam but permit me to say very ridiculous said the impatient squire rising to go ill give you time to think over what i have said and ill call again ill have that place yet he muttered to himself as he left the cottage i wont be balked by an obstinate woman and an impertinent boy chapter xi sickness squire leech was reluctant to give up his intended purchase he had an idea that herbert stood in the way and he contrived to call upon the widow in the course of the following week at a time when he knew our hero was away from home but he failed again im very sorry to go contrary to your advice squire leech said mrs carter deprecatingly but i cant give up my home herbert too would be very much disappointed i hope you will not allow yourself to be guided by the judgment of an inexperienced boy maam said the squire mortified i think i ought to consult my boys wishes said the widow he doesnt know what is best for him perhaps not but i feel with him at present im sorry to disappoint you squire leech as to that maam i have no interest in the matter i was only advising you for your good im sure im much obliged to you in fact as your means are limited i will stretch a point and offer you fifty dollars more i shouldnt be at all sure of getting my money back thank you but i think well keep the house for the present if i should find we couldnt afford it i will let you know i dont agree to keep to my offer after this week now or never is my motto i can draw the papers right out the widow shook her head and reiterated in gentle tones her refusal squire leech was provoked and did not hide his feeling as he only proposed to take the house to oblige her as he represented mrs carter was surprised at his display of feeling she was not a shrewd woman and it did not occur to her that he had any selfish object in view in his advice i didnt succeed mr banks said the squire to his superintendent that carter woman is dreadfully obstinate between ourselves i judge its her son that influences her i think i have seen him a boy of fourteen or fifteen yes hes a very selfwilled boy you said you thought you would be able to foreclose on account of their failing to pay the interest they paid it i was surprised at their promptness till i learned from my son that they had received a legacy of a hundred dollars or so from a relative that wont last always no the time will come when i can get the place on my own terms i am determined to have it then brown will have to find a different house yes i have heard of an old house that will do temporarily till i get the widow carters its a little out of the village and is in rather a dilapidated condition but it will do for a few months or a year and that will fetch round the carters the house referred to was secured and the superintendents cousin moved to wrayburn but neither the squire nor mr banks forgave herbert for his assumed instrumentality in thwarting their plans the next winter mrs carter was unfortunate enough to be laid up with severe sickness from december to march herbert devoted himself to her comfort and performed nearly all his mothers customary work washing and ironing however he was obliged to have done when the sickness commenced the hundred dollars left by his uncle was unbroken but for three months neither he nor of course his mother was able to earn anything of any amount while their expenses were necessarily increased at the opening of april herbert had the satisfaction of seeing his mother fully recovered assume her usual place in the little household this was pleasant but there was a drawback to his satisfaction the legacy had dwindled to twentyfive dollars he reported this to his mother how unlucky that i should have been sick so long said mrs carter sighing how lucky we had the legacy to fall back upon said herbert i dont know how we could have got along without that truly mother i must look about for work i ought to be earning four or five dollars a week at my age you are only fifteen but i am stout and strong of my age i shall soon be a man dont you see my mustache coming mother said herbert with a laugh not very distinctly but perhaps my eyesight is growing poor answered his mother smiling the trouble is said herbert thoughtfully there is very little chance of work in this town i wonder whether squire leech wouldnt hire you through the spring and summer on one of his farms i heard that he is going to hire a boy i am not sure whether he would be willing to hire me however much he wanted a boy why not he dont seem to like me nor does mr banks like me what can they have against you i thought everybody liked you thats because you are my mother but the squire doesnt feel maternal so far as i am concerned i didnt understand it at first but now i do what is it you remember the squire tried hard to get you to sell this place that was last year and you wouldnt sell that is why he is angry with both of us but i dont understand why he should be said the widow innocently he said he would take it only as a favor to me that was all gammon excuse the word which isnt very elegant i admit but its the right word for all that the squire wanted the place very much what could he do with it he couldnt live in it himself not much i can imagine the look of disgust jamess face would wear at the idea of such a thing he wanted it for nahum brown who lives in the old house up the road you know brown who is a cousin of mr banks the superintendent and he is very anxious to get hold of our house how did you learn all this herbert i never knew it before tom banks let it out one day i dont see how the squire can dislike us for wanting to stay in our old home there are a good many things you dont understand about selfish men mother that is why i am afraid it wont be much use to ask the squire for employment you may be mistaken about his feelings herbert at any rate ill go to him if i cant find employment anywhere else in the village i wish you would that is if you dont think farm work will be too hard for you ill risk that in pursuance of this promise herbert after ascertaining that there was no work to be had anywhere else in the village called one fine morning at the imposing residence of squire leech james was in the yard at work on a kite have you come to see me said james superciliously no i wanted to see your father what about herbert was about to answer on business but it occurred to him that it would be better policy to keep on friendly terms with james and he said i am looking for work and i thought he might have some for me perhaps so said james patronizingly of course one in your position must work for a living dont you expect to work asked herbert in some curiosity not with my hands of course said james i may study some genteel profession such as law i am too poor to be genteel said herbert amused of course you will probably be a day laborer i hope to rise to something better in time said herbert for the present i shall be glad to work by the day or the month if your father will engage me i think my father is at home you can ring and see said james who could be kind to one who was willing to acknowledge his inferiority herbert rang the bell and was ushered into the presence of squire leech who was examining some papers in the back parlor chapter xii poor and proud good morning squire leech said herbert politely good morning said the squire jumping to the conclusion that the carters had made up their minds to sell their place do you wish to see me yes sir i hope i dont interrupt you go on said the squire waving his hand i am busy to be sure but i can give you a few minutes he resolved to take advantage of mrs carters necessities and make a smaller offer for the place in this way he would make her suffer for her former obstinate refusal to entertain his proposition his face fell when herbert said i came to ask you if you could give me employment on one of your farms my mother has been sick and i feel that i ought to be doing something to earn money ahem said the squire i leave all such matters to mr banks was that all you wished to say to me i believe so said herbert will there be any use in applying to mr banks i dont know whether he has got help enough or not your mother has been sick hasnt she yes sir all winter i heard of it i suppose you found it expensive eh yes sir neither of us could earn anything you are in debt then no sir my uncle left us some money last year that kept us along its pretty much used up now i suppose not quite herbert was inclined to be surprised at the squires apparent interest in their affairs but the motive soon became apparent well you have made up your mind to sell the house now i suppose said the squire no we hadnt thought of it but youll have to not if i can get employment said herbert our expenses are very small and we can live on a little the great man frowned that is all nonsense he said impatiently it is quite impossible for you to hold on to the house i am willing to give you cash down three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage for it that isnt as much as you offered last year said herbert shrewdly i believe i did offer three hundred and fifty then your last offer was fifty dollars more than that it may be so but i told your mother that it wasnt a standing offer she must accept it then or not at all we dont ask you to purchase said herbert independently i had no idea of such a thing when i came here that makes no difference you will have to sell of course and i have made up my mind to offer you three hundred and fifty if you had taken me up at the time i would have given you fifty more you cant expect that now however we dont expect anything the house is not for sale then why are you taking up my valuable time demanded the squire frowning with displeasure i beg your pardon sir i only came in to ask for employment that i might have given you if you hadnt been so unreasonable i dont think we are unreasonable squire leech even if we were willing to sell we should ask at least fourteen hundred dollars for the place fourteen hundred are you crazy i never heard of such a thing the place land and all cost my father fifteen hundred i dont believe it weve got his papers to show that it is so it isnt worth near that now it is certainly worth more than eleven hundred which is all you offer look here carter said the squire i dont mind telling you that i want the place for one of my men brown that is my only object in making you an offer at all he is the cousin of mr banks my superintendent and i rather think banks will find you something to do if you will induce your mother to sell the place i cant do that said herbert slowly i cant consent to my mother making such a sacrifice she might as well give you three or four hundred dollars as sell the place so much under price you are a boy and know nothing about business you think property must necessarily bring its first cost though mind you i dont admit that yours cost anything like fifteen hundred dollars i am inexperienced herbert admitted but i am sure it would be foolish to sell for eleven hundred dollars you may have to sell for less how is that if you are not prepared with the interest when the time comes i shall foreclose you wouldnt be so hard on us as that squire leech said herbert anxiously i dont call it hard it is only just and legal when that time comes i dont promise to pay as much as i offer today herbert looked serious he saw that the squire meant just what he said that in fact he was lying in wait their need should put them in his power well said the squire triumphantly you see how the matter stands now i do said herbert then you will cease your foolish opposition to what is best for you i will speak to my mother about it said herbert rising the place is hers not mine and she must decide without your offering any foolish advice i hope i cant say as to that squire leech i will bid you good morning good morning if you change your mind call again and we will see about the employment well said james as herbert came out did you get work not yet your father is not sure whether he will find any for me when i am a man said james pompously i do say i may be able to throw something in your way thank you said herbert tempted to smile in spite of his serious thoughts i shall be richer than my father added james his property is increasing every year you have an excellent prospect before you said herbert half enviously thats so wouldnt you like to change places with me i am not sure about that you are not sure about that repeated james incredulously no why i am a rich mans son i know that but i have an excellent mother she has got no money i should not value her more if she were worth a million said herbert warmly of course said james but that wont save you from being a day laborer it is my great ambition just at present to become a day laborer said herbert smiling of course theres a great difference between us but i say carter can you help me with this kite theres something wrong about it it wont fly herbert looked at it critically the trouble is with the frame he said its too heavy i wish youd help me about it very goodnaturedly our hero set to work and in the course of twenty minutes or so the difficulty was obviated the kite would fly you may stay and help me fly it said james condescendingly thank you i shall be needed at home oh i forgot your time is valuable here take this james with extraordinary liberality held out five cents to herbert what is that for asked herbert puzzled and not offering to take the money for your help about the kite oh i wouldnt think of charging anything for that said herbert amused why not you are poor and i am rich i know it but i dont want money for a trifle like that just as you say said james returning the money to his pocket a little relieved if the truth must be told that the coin was not accepted for he was naturally fond of money good morning said herbert turning to go if the kite gets out of order you can call upon me any time i wonder why he didnt take the money thought james he may be poor and proud ive heard of such cases but of course it would be absurd for a boy in his position to be proud herbert kept on his way with a very serious face it seemed as if they must lose their home after all chapter xiii mr banks the superintendent after his interview with squire leech herbert walked home slowly and thoughtfully he comprehended now all the danger of the situation the squire wanted their house and was mean enough to desire to get it at less than its value though two or three hundred dollars would have been of little account to him while to the poor widow whom he wished to defraud it was a great sum how can a rich man be so mean exclaimed herbert indignantly that question has puzzled more than our hero is there something in riches that dwarfs the man and makes him mean and ignoble in too many instances such appears to be the effect well mother said herbert when he returned to the cottage ive been to see squire leech what success did you meet with asked his mother anxiously he will probably give me employment you see herbert you misjudged him after all said the widow her face brightening wait and see if i did there is a condition attached what is that that you will sell him the cottage did he mention that yes he offered three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage why he offered more than that last year i reminded him of that what did he say he said he would have given three hundred and fifty if we hadnt been so unreasonable as to refuse then now as you have been sick he expects he can get the place on his own terms i didnt think squire leech would be so ungenerous he hinted besides that when the next interest is due he would foreclose if the money were not ready it wont be ready i am afraid herbert said his mother depressed what shall we do i am afraid we shall be forced to sell the place though it would be hard to leave it theres a month before the interest comes due mother said herbert with energy something may turn up but his mother was not so hopeful as he what can turn up she said i may get employment even if you do a boy can earn little in the country that is true mother but somehow i feel hopeful that is because you are young herbert it is natural for youth to be hopeful well mother isnt it better to be hopeful than despondent but it wont alter wants suppose the worst to happen suppose we do leave the house we shall have three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollars in cash to keep us from starving and when that is gone before that is gone i shall be earning good wages somewhere you see mother matters are not as bad as they might be after all in spite of her doubts mrs carter was cheered by her sons hopeful tone perhaps you are right she said since god orders all things we ought not to be discouraged now you are sensible mother how much money have you got left twentyfive dollars why thats enough to pay the interest and a little over but how are we to live for the next month i ought to earn money enough for that if there were any chance of finding work well i will go out again tomorrow herbert spoke with a confidence which he did not feel wrayburn was not a large village and in general boys were to be found in families where a boys work was required in fact the only one who seemed likely to have work for a boy was mr banks the squires farm superintendent his son tom might indeed have worked had he been inclined but he was naturally indolent and his father was too indulgent to compel him to work he was an only child and bade fair to be spoiled though only fifteen he had already learned to smoke and drink and the only limit to either was his scanty pocket money as herbert was walking up the street in perplexity he fell in with tom who was smoking a cheap cigar with the air of an old smoker where are you bound herbert he asked nowhere in particular i wish i knew where to go come fishing with me i havent time you said you were not going anywhere in particular because i dont know where to go then why not go with me i want to find work somewhere tom shrugged his shoulders thats just what i am not anxious to find he said my father keeps thinking every day that i ought to be at work but i dont see it tom winked here and looked or thought he looked uncommonly sly then your father has work for a boy to do said herbert getting interested oh yes it is spring now and the busy season is beginning but that sort of work dont suit me i will never be a farmer when i get a little older i should like to go to the city and enter a store that would be jolly you might get tired of it no i wouldnt im sick of this stupid old town though theres nothing going on i say tom as you dont want to work do you think your father would give me a chance i dont know said tom ill speak to him if you want me to i wish you would therell be one advantage about it if he hires you he wont be at me to work all the time ill do it come along and ill speak to him now thank you tom oh you neednt thank me its for my own sake im doing it as much as yours said tom who was at least frank in his selfishness they went to the small house occupied much against his will by amos banks he was in the field with one of his men when tom and herbert came up and jumping over the stone wall approached him well tom said his father you have come just in time i want you to ride the horse to plow i cant father i dont feel well today whats the matter oh ive got a headache riding will do you good no it wont said tom confidently but if you want a boy to help you here he is mr banks turned to herbert you are herbert carter he said yes sir i would like very much to get a chance to work youre the widow carters son yes sir has your mother decided to sell her cottage i dont think she has mr banks of course you know that squire leech wants to buy it yes sir he told me that he wanted to purchase it for your use just so said the superintendent stopping work ive taken a fancy to that house and so has mrs banks you had better accept the squires offer that would be too much of a sacrifice mr banks the squire wants to get the place considerably below its value very likely you overvalue it mother is attached to it she would rather have it than a nicer house father built it and it was here they lived for nearly fifteen years no doubt no doubt said banks impatiently but poor folks cant afford to be sentimental if its for your mothers interest to sell then shed ought to sell thats my opinion we may have to sell some time but as long as we can hold on to the place we mean to i may as well say said the superintendent that the squire has authorized me to hire you to work in case your mother consents to sell is that the condition yes then said herbert turning away i am afraid i must give up the chance thats an obstinate boy said banks looking after him but hell come around after a while the squire says hell have to or be turned out for not paying the interest chapter xiv herberts new undertaking to be willing to work and yet to be unable to find an opportunity was certainly a hardship herbert was a boy of active temperament and even had he not needed the wages of labor he would still have felt it necessary to his happiness to do something in the course of his walks about the village he stopped at the house of a carpenter who bore the rather peculiar name of jeremiah crane mr crane owned about an acre and a half of land which might have been cultivated but at the time herbert called early in april there were no indications of this intention the carpenter was at work in a small shop just beyond the house and there herbert found him well herbert said mr crane in a friendly manner what are you up to nowadays nothing profitable mr crane i am wandering about in search of work cant you find any not yet have you been to squire leech yes i should think he might find something for you to do there is a little difficulty in the way what is that then herbert told mr crane about the squires wish to purchase their cottage and his vexation because they were not willing to sell seems to me thats unreasonable in the squire he acts as if it was your duty to oblige him i dont know but we shall have to come to his terms said herbert rather dejectedly we certainly shall if i dont find anything to do i wish i could help you but if you were to learn my trade you wouldnt be worth any wages for nigh a year and you couldnt afford to work so long without pay no i couldnt besides in a village like this there isnt more than enough work for one man why there isnt more than one new house built a year if the squire wants to provide mr banks with a house why doesnt he build him one he might just as well as not it would cost him more than to buy our place at the price he offers so it would your place must have cost fifteen hundred dollars land and all so i did but the squire laughed at the idea all he offers is eleven hundred dont you sell at that price it would be too much of a sacrifice we wont unless we are obliged to i hope you wont be obliged to a man as rich as squire leech ought not to try to get it under price i suppose he wants to make a good bargain no matter if it is at our expense i wish you had a farm mr crane so you could give me work on it ive got more farm now than i can take care of dont you have a garden ive got the land but no time to work on it my wife often wishes we had our own vegetables instead of having to buy but you see after working in the shop or outside all day im too tired to work on land how much land have you about an acre that i could cultivate i suppose engage me to take care of it ill do all the work and your wife can have her own vegetables really i never thought of that said the carpenter i dont know but it might be a good idea how much pay would you want ill tell you said herbert who had a business turn and who had already matured the plan in his own mind if you will pay for plowing and provide seed i will do the planting and gather it when harvest time comes for onethird of the crop you mean you will take your pay in vegetables yes said herbert promptly if there is more than you need i can sell the surplus what do you say it strikes me as a fair offer herbert just wait a minute and ill go and ask my wife what she thinks of it mr crane went into the house leaving herbert in the shop he reappeared in five minutes herbert to whom the plan seemed every minute more desirable awaited his report eagerly my wife is all for your plan he said she says it is the only way she knows of likely to give her the fresh vegetables she wants besides she thinks well of you so its a settled thing if you say so i do say so herbert replied promptly now when will you have it plowed i shall leave all that to you i havent time to make arrangements you can engage anybody you like to do the plowing and i will pay the bill then as to the seed there again i trust all to you you can buy what you find to be necessary and the bill may be sent to me you may ask mrs crane what vegetables she wants all right said herbert please understand said the carpenter that i will do what i have said but i dont want to be worried about the details you are a boy but i shall trust to your judgment as you are interested in the result thank you said herbert rather proud of the confidence reposed in him i will do what i can to justify your confidence ill go right off and see about the plowing very well whatever herbert did was done promptly he knew of a man named kimball a farmer on a small scale who was accustomed to do work for neighbors not having enough work of his own to occupy his whole time he went to see him at once mr kimball he said i want to know if i can engage you to do some plowing for me for you repeated the farmer opening his eyes why you havent taken a farm have you not yet said herbert smiling but ive agreed to cultivate a little land on shares sho you dont say so what land is it its the field behind mr cranes house so hes engaged you has he well ive often wondered why he didnt cultivate it might as well as not its my idea i proposed it to him now when can you come wait a minute said the farmer cautiously whos agoing to pay me mr crane he told me to engage somebody and he would pay the bill thats all right then said the farmer in a tone of satisfaction cranes a man that always pays his bills i hope i shall have the same reputation said herbert i hope you will but youre only a boy you know and i couldnt collect of a minor thats the law i shouldnt think anybodyd be dishonest enough to bring that as an excuse plenty would do it so i have to be careful what time do you want me to do the work for you as soon as you can let me see i guess i can come tomorrow there aint anything very pressing for me to do then thats good said herbert with satisfaction youll find me there and i can ride the horse to plow if you want me to i should like to have you well thought herbert as he started for home to tell his mother what he had done ive made a beginning i suppose you havent found any work yet herbert said his mother in a tone of resignation as he entered the little cottage yes i have though i shall have to wait some time for the pay what is it herbert im going to cultivate a garden on shares mother so next fall and winter you can have all the vegetables you want how is that herbert tell me all about it when herbert had detailed the contract he had entered into he was glad to find that his mother approved of it she declared that it would be very satisfactory to her to have an abundant stock of vegetables but she said doubtfully do you think you know enough of farming to attend to all the work if i dont i can easily ask some farmer said herbert confidently i am not in the least afraid to undertake the job he went to bed that night feeling that at last he had obtained something to do the reader will perhaps recall the statement in our first chapter that there was a little land connected with the cottage which was used for the growth of vegetables this in fact supplied nearly all that was required by the widow and her son and the probability was that herbert would be able to send to market nearly all his share of vegetables obtained under his new contract and thus obtain payment in money of which they were so much in need chapter xv the crisis approaches herbert went to work in earnest it took only part of one day to plow the field which he was to cultivate he decided after consultation with mrs crane to appropriate twothirds of the land to potatoes and the remainder to different kinds of vegetables he was guided partly by the consideration of which would be most marketable on the third day while at work he heard his name called it must be explained that mr cranes house and land were on the corner of two streets so that he was in full sight while in the field from the side street looking up he recognized james leech who was surveying him with evident curiosity good morning james said herbert going on with his work i see youve got a job said james yes has mr crane hired you not exactly then why are you at work in his field because ive agreed to work it on shares how is that i am to have a third of the crops to pay me for my services what can you do with it part of the vegetables we can use at home and the balance i shall sell i shouldnt think youd like that arrangement why not because you have so long to wait for your pay that is true but its better than not working at all and ive tried all over the village in vain to get employment do you think youll make much out of it i dont think i shall make my fortune but i shall make something dont it tire you to work asked james with some curiosity of course if i work all day but i dont mind that i should you are not used to work i should say not returned james with pride i never worked in my life it was a strange thing to be proud of but there are some who have nothing better to be proud of i like to work said herbert you do yes only i like to get something for my labor you expect to work some time dont you not with my hands said james i shall never be reduced to that do you think it so very bad to work with your hands isnt it respectable oh i suppose its respectable said james but only the lower classes do it am i one of the lower classes asked herbert amused of course you are but suppose i should get rich some day said herbert that isnt very likely you cant get rich raising vegetables no i dont expect to still i may in some other way didnt you ever know any poor boys that got rich i suppose there have been some admitted james havent you ever heard of vanderbilt of course i have father says hes worth forty millions dont you consider him a gentleman of course i do well he was a poor boy once and used to ferry passengers across from staten island to new york did he i didnt know that suppose my uncle had left me all his fortune a hundred thousand dollars would i have been a gentleman then yes but it isnt the same as if you had always been rich i dont agree with your ideas james it seems to me something besides money is needed to make a gentleman still i hope to get on in the world and i shouldnt object to being rich though i dont see any prospect of it just at present no said james you will probably always be poor thats very encouraging said herbert laughing how about yourself oh i shall be a rich man like father thats very encouraging for you i hope when you are a man youll give me work if i need it i will bear it in mind said james with an important air now i must be going that day at dinner james said to his father that carter boy has got a job has he asked the squire not very well pleased yes hes working at mr cranes what is he doing working in the garden what wages does crane pay him none at all he says he has agreed to work for the third of the crops did he say that asked the squire with satisfaction yes he told me so this morning you are sure he gets no money yes he is paid wholly in vegetables he said he couldnt find employment anywhere else in the village so he had to work that way that boy stands very much in his own light said the squire how is that father i told him mr banks would give him work if he would agree to sell me his cottage he doesnt own it does he his mother of course i mean its the boy that keeps her from selling it why does he do that oh theyve got a silly notion that no other place would seem like home to them and besides they think i dont offer them enough how much do you offer them eleven hundred dollars that is i have a mortgage on the place for seven hundred and fifty i offer them three hundred and fifty dollars besides is that all the money they are worth yes they are very foolish to refuse for theyll have to come to it some time in about a week the interest comes due and im very sure they wont be able to meet it suppose they dont then said the squire with a satisfied smile i shall take possession and theyll have to sell herbert says he hopes to be rich some time i dare say said the squire laughing heartily everybody does so far as i know do you think there is any chance of it about one in a thousand i shouldnt want the lower classes to get rich said james thoughtfully theyd think they were our equals yes no doubt james was not aware that his grandfather had once been a poor mechanic or rather he ignored it he chose to consider that he had sprung from a long line of wealthy ancestors his father heard with pleasure that herbert was not likely to realize any money at present for his services already he felt that the little cottage was as good as his it was only a week now to the time of paying interest and he was very sure that mrs carter would be unprepared to meet it in that case he decided i will certainly foreclose there will be no sense in granting them any further indulgence it will be for their interest to sell the cottage and get rid of the burden which the interest imposes really they ought to consider it a favor that i am willing to take it off their hands we are very apt to think it is for the interest of others to do what we greatly desire and i dont suppose the squire was singular in this i think however that there are many who are less selfish and more considerate of others herbert too was thinking and thinking seriously of the interest that was so soon coming due in spite of his own and his mothers economy when the preceding day arrived all they could raise toward the payment was thirteen dollars and the sum required was twentytwo dollars and a half mother said herbert at dinner the day before i see only one chance for us and that is to borrow the money if anyone would lend us ten dollars we could pay the interest and then we should be free from anxiety for six months i am afraid you will find that difficult said his mother the squire is the only rich man in the village and of course we cant apply to him at any rate i can but try instead of going to work this afternoon i shall go about and try to borrow the money if i cant then i suppose we must give up the house certainly the prospect seemed far from cheerful chapter xvi an unexpected offer it was with very little confidence in his ultimate success that herbert set out on his borrowing expedition the number of those who could be called capitalists in a small village like wrayburn was very small and it happened very remarkably that all of them were short of funds one man had just bought a yoke of oxen and so spent all his available cash another had been shingling his barn and still another confessed to having money but it was in the savings bank and he didnt like to disturb it so at supper time herbert came in depressed and dispirited well mother its no use he said as her anxious look met his i didnt much think you could borrow the money she answered trying to look cheerful theres only one thing remains to be done said herbert what is that to try to induce the squire to give us more time i dont think he will do that nor i in that case we must come to his terms but its a pity to sacrifice the property mother yes herbert i shall be sorry to leave the old place she sighed you were born here and your father was always very much attached to it but poor folks cant have everything they wish and it might be worse yes it might be worse and if the squire was not so bent in getting the place into his hands it might be better i suppose we ought not to blame him for looking out for his own interest yes we ought when it seems that he is ready to injure his poorer neighbors mrs carter did not reply she did not wish further to incense her son against the squire yet in her heart she could not help agreeing with him the next day herbert did not go to work as usual he did not feel like it while matters were in such uncertainty he knew the squire would be at the cottage a little before twelve oclock and he wanted to be with his mother at that time for he felt that if the place must be sold he would be more likely to get good terms for it than his mother who was of an easy and yielding disposition he took a little walk in the course of the forenoon not with any particular object in view but in order to pass the time as he was passing the hotel for there was a small hotel in the village he heard his name called turning round he found that it was the landlord who had called him come here a minute herbert he said herbert obeyed the summons what are you doing nowadays he asked i have turned farmer said our hero whom are you working for for myself how is that i dont understand i am cultivating mr cranes land on shares does it take up all jour time no i would only work part of the day if i had anything else to do ill tell you what i have been thinking of theres a young man boarding with me from the city a mr cameron he was a college student but his eyes gave out and the doctor sent him out of the city to get well he wants some one to read to him part of the time and go about with him for company he is from a rich family the son of a wealthy manufacturer and he will be willing to pay a fair price do you think i would suit him asked herbert eagerly yes i think you would you are a good scholar and when i mentioned you to him he said he would like to see you he said he would prefer a boy as he would be more ready to adapt himself to his wishes when can i see mr cameron asked our hero come in now you will find him in his room here john show herbert up to number six herbert was ushered into one of the best rooms the hotel afforded a young man of pleasant appearance was sitting at the window with a green shade over his eyes he pushed up this that he might see herbert this is herbert carter mr cameron said john unceremoniously i am glad to see you herbert said the young man smiling as he extended his hand he was secretly pleased with herberts open and manly face did the landlord say why i might need your assistance he said your eyes were affected yes they broke down a month since i am a student of yale college in the junior class i suppose i tasked my eyes too severely at any rate they gave out and i am forbidden to use them at all that must be a great loss to you said herbert with sympathy it is i am very fond of reading and study and the time passes very heavily in the absence of my usual employment i dont know what i should do if i could not use my eyes you would find it a great hardship now i must tell you why i came here the doctor told me i should be better off in the country than in the city he said that the sight of the green grass would be good for me and the fresh air in improving my general health would help my eyes also i hadnt much choice as to a place but some one mentioned wrayburn and so i came here but i soon found that unless i got some pleasant company and some one who could read to me i should die of weariness that brings me to my object in asking you to call upon me how is your time occupied i have taken an acre of land to cultivate on shares answered herbert it was because i could find nothing else to do and must do something does that keep you pretty busy it is planting time now but i could get along with working there half a day and could you place yourself at my disposal the other half i should be glad to do it answered herbert suppose then that you work in the field in the forenoon and give me every afternoon all right said herbert promptly now comes another question what pay would you expect for giving me so much of your time i shouldnt know what to charge mr cameron i leave that matter entirely with you would you be satisfied with five dollars a week five dollars a week herbert could hardly believe his ears why he would have been well paid if this had been given him for the whole of his time but for half it seemed munificent i am afraid i cant earn that much he answered i would be willing to take less you dont know how hard i shall make you work said the young man smiling i insist upon paying you five dollars a week i dont seriously object said herbert smiling but if you think after the first week that it is too much you can pay me less i see that we are not likely to quarrel on the subject of salary then when can you begin this afternoon if you wish i do wish it otherwise the afternoon would pass very slowly to me then i will be here at one oclock half past one will do i will be on hand till then i will bid you good morning as i shall be wanted at home very well herbert herbert left the room and hurried home for it was nearly twelve on the way he stopped at the post office and found a letter addressed to his mother he did not recognize the handwriting nor such was his hurry did he notice where it was postmarked he had no watch but thought it must be close upon twelve oclock so he thrust the letter into his pocket and continued his way homeward on a half run he was in time for just as he reached the front gate from one direction the squire reached it from the other good morning said the squire a little stiffly is your mother at home i presume she is wont you come in i wonder if theyve got the money ready thought the squire as he followed herbert into the modest sitting room chapter xvii what the letter contained leaving the squire in the sitting room herbert went in quest of his mother squire leech is here he said what shall we say to him asked his mother soberly wait a minute and i will tell you said herbert his face brightening ive had a stroke of luck mother ive been engaged to work afternoons at five dollars a week who has engaged to pay you such high wages asked mrs carter astonished a young man staying at the hotel whose eyes are weak i am to read to him and do whatever else he requires i got the chance through the landlord you are certainly fortunate said his mother gratified now what i am going to propose to the squire is to wait two or three weeks for the balance of the interest till i can make it up out of my wages if he werent so anxious to get possession of the place he would but i am afraid on that account he will refuse but we ought to go in mrs carter removed the apron which she had worn about her work and entered the sitting room followed by herbert i hope you will excuse my keeping you waiting squire leech she said certainly maam though i am rather in a hurry i suppose you have come about the interest it is due today as of course you know yes i suppose you have it ready said the squire eyeing her shrewdly i can pay you fifteen dollars of it said the widow nervously squire leech felt exultant but he only frowned it amounts to twentytwo dollars and a half he said sharply i know that and i shall be able to pay the remainder if you will be kind enough to wait two or three weeks not knowing anything of herberts good fortune squire leech utterly disbelieved this he knew no source from which the widow could get the money it is easy enough to make promises he said with a sneer but that doesnt satisfy me i want my money now herbert felt it time for him to take part in the conversation my mother can keep her promise he said can she perhaps you will explain where you expect to get the money from my wages answered herbert proudly i wasnt aware that you received any sneered the squire i have just made an engagement to work for five dollars a week said our hero enjoying the squires look of surprise indeed who pays you that a gentleman boarding at the hotel has engaged me to read to him as his eyes are weak a fool and his money are soon parted said squire leech you may retain the position a week i hope to keep it i feel sure that i shall i dont said the squire emphatically then are you willing to wait say two weeks for the rest of the interest no i am not and you ought to have known i shouldnt be there is a way of arranging the whole matter by selling the place you mean yes i mean just that it is folly for you to think of keeping the property with such a heavy mortgage upon it on which you are unable to pay the interest i have offered you a fair price for it you offered four hundred dollars less than it cost that is nonsense it never cost fifteen hundred dollars i have my husbands word for it said the widow then he made some mistake you may be sure i am sure father was right said herbert besides we have his bills to prove it thats neither here nor there said squire leech impatiently even if it cost ten thousand dollars its only worth eleven hundred now that is to say three hundred and fifty dollars over and above the mortgage you are hard upon me squire leech said mrs carter despondently you are a woman maam and women never understand business i make allowance for you but your son ought to know better than to encourage you i want my mother to be treated fairly and justly do you mean to imply that i would treat her otherwise young man demanded the squire angrily i advise you not to make an enemy of me herbert looked sober the squire might not be right but certainly he had the power to carry his point and that power he was certain to exercise will you give my mother and myself a little time to consult what is to be done he asked yes said the squire feeling that he had carried his point i might refuse of course but i wish to be easy with you and therefore i will give you till half past twelve i will be back at that time he took his cane and left the house his reference to the post office reminded herbert of the letter he had in his pocket for his mother heres a letter for you mother he said a letter who can it be from its postmarked at randolph said herbert perhaps its from aunt nancy suggested the widow i dont know anyone else in randolph that would be likely to write to me she opened the envelope and uttered a cry of surprise as two bills dropped out and fluttered to the floor herbert picked them up eagerly and cried why mother they are tendollar bills twenty dollars in all twenty dollars repeated mrs carter in amazement hurrah now we can pay the interest exclaimed herbert wont the squire be mad and he laughed joyously read the letter aloud mother mrs carter read as follows my dear niece i have thought of you often and wish we were not so far distant from each other i should enjoy seeing you and that good son of yours often i am afraid you have had a hard time getting along my wants are few and i have more than enough to supply them i inclose twenty dollars in this letter i shall not need them for an old woman like me can live on very little i wish you would write to me sometimes or ask herbert to i feel lonely and it would be a great favor to me if it were not so far i would ask you and herbert to come over and spend a day or two with me perhaps you can manage to do it some time only dont delay too long for i am getting old and cant expect to live much longer your affectionate aunt nancy carter how good of aunt nancy if her brother had possessed her kind heart we should be better off today it came just in the nick of time mother how lucky say rather how providential my son we owe to the kindness of god he will not see us want of course you are right mother but the squire wont regard it in the same light he will be terribly disappointed for he thinks he has got us in his power i am thankful that this is to be our home for six months more longer than that mother i am earning something now and i will save up money to pay our next interest squire leech is coming back said mrs carter see how briskly he walks said herbert i dont think hell be so cheerful when he leaves the house i dont think we ought to exult herbert i cant help it mother and im not ashamed of it either you are carrying benevolence too far here the squires knock was heard and herbert went to admit him chapter xviii how the squire was circumvented the squire was in very good spirits all the way back from the post office he had been congratulating himself on the elegant bargain he was about to make the widow and her son had been obliged to yield squire leech thought more of herbert than of his mother for he was convinced that but for him he could have talked over mrs carter six months before serves the boy right he said to himself it was preposterous in him to oppose my wishes he might have known i would advise what was best the squire meant what was best for him he had not given much thought what would be best for mrs carter some men would take advantage of their situation and reduce their offer thought the squire virtuously but i wont be hard on them they shall have the three hundred and fifty dollars well said he cheerfully as herbert opened the door i believe i have given you the time i agreed upon yes sir said herbert please walk in the squire expected to find him sober and depressed but in spite of himself herbert could not help looking in good spirits this puzzled the squire a little but he said to himself probably they have decided that my offer wasnt so bad a one after all well said the village magnate well mrs carter now that you have had time to think over my proposal you have probably seen its advantages i should not be willing to give up the house sir my husband built it and the squires brow darkened what a perverse obstinate woman she was that aint the question he exclaimed pounding his cane on the floor there are many things we dont want to do that weve got to do you stand in your own light maam i have my rights we dont deny that sir said herbert who enjoyed the squires excitement knowing how it must end i am glad to hear it said the squire but it appears to me you think you and your mother are the only persons to be considered in this matter i think my mother is entitled to some consideration havent i considered her havent i offered her a most liberal price for the place we dont call it liberal then you are unreasonable many men in my position would offer less indeed i dont think i ought to offer more than three hundred dollars we would thank you squire leech if we could see any favor in offering three or four hundred dollars less than the house is worth we have had enough of this nonsense said the squire angrily it is not too late to withdraw my offer you had better withdraw it said herbert composedly for mother and i have decided to refuse it refuse it gasped the squire what do you mean by such outrageous impudence i dont see how it can be considered impudence we are not obliged to accept every offer made us you are obliged to accept this cried squire leech stamping his cane upon the floor again you know there is no help for it how do you make that out sir inquired our hero you cant pay the interest i beg your pardon sir we are ready to pay i mean the whole of the interest so do i it must be paid at once it shall be paid at once squire leech please make out a receipt squire leech was never more astonished in his life he was not convinced till herbert produced what he could distinguish as two tendollar bills and one five there will be two dollars and a half change said herbert in a businesslike manner what did you mean by telling me you could not pay the interest when i was here at twelve oclock we could not then or thought we could not then how can you pay me now we received some money in a letter this morning the letter had not been opened when you were here so we didnt know we could meet your claims squire leech was very angry he felt that he had been defeated and that triumph had slipped over to the other side but he resolved to make one more attempt i have the right to refuse this money he said it comes too late it should have been paid at twelve i beg your pardon squire leech you yourself gave us time to consult what to do because said the squire unguardedly i thought you could not pay the interest herbert could not help smiling we have nothing to do with what you thought the squire frowned and bit his lips with vexation he tried to think of some way of getting over the difficulty but none presented itself as he dashed off the signature and took the money he said angrily the time will come when i will have this place your convenient letters wont always come just in the nick of time i hope to be prepared for you next time without having to depend on that still the squire lingered the fact was that though very angry he was anxious to know from whom mrs carter had received this opportune help who sent you this letter he asked i dont think we need to tell you that said herbert i have no objection to tell said mrs carter it was my aunt nancy carter of randolph who so kindly remembered us i wish shed kept back her letter a day or two thought the squire is she rich he asked abruptly no she has a very modest income left by her brother but her wants are few and she thought we might need help she has a good heart well maam as my business is over i will leave you said the squire sulkily as for that boy of yours pointing his finger at herbert i advise you to teach him better manners he wont gain anything by his impertinence if he had acted differently i would have given him employment or got my superintendent to do so i should have been unable to accept it squire leech said herbert i have made an engagement already the squire had forgotten this and it was mortifying to expect that his patronage was of no importance to the boy whom he detested good morning he said abruptly and left the room i am afraid herbert you treated the squire disrespectfully said mrs carter i dont think so mother unless to oppose his wishes is to be disrespectful he spoke as if he thought you did i know that but he wouldnt if he hadnt been unreasonable but ive got to go to the hotel in fifteen minutes just give me a bite for im awful hungry so the day which herbert had so much dreaded in advance was marked by two pieces of good luck chapter xix herbert becomes a professor when herbert reached the hotel he went up at once to mr camerons room i believe i am a little late he said apologetically but i was detained at home by a matter of business you are young to have your time occupied by matters of business said the young man smiling yes if my father were alive it would not devolve upon me but my mother generally consults with me i hope your business was arranged satisfactorily yes but it came near turning out otherwise i would like to tell you about it do so said mr cameron kindly i shall be interested in whatever affects you herbert gave an account of squire leechs attempts to get possession of their cottage but for that letter of aunt nancys he concluded we should have been obliged to part with our house for the paltry sum of twentytwo dollars and a half it wasnt paltry to us no to be sure why didnt you tell me this morning i would have lent you the money you would exclaimed herbert with pleasure thank you mr cameron said our hero but i shouldnt have dared to ask such a favor of a stranger i must tell you that this squire leech has probably taken advantage of your ignorance of business i dont know exactly how the law is in this state but i presume that so far from the squire being authorized to take immediate possession of your place he would be obliged to give legal notice of sale on foreclosure of mortgage by advertisement in some weekly paper this would allow of sale at auction to the highest bidder i didnt know that i supposed the squire could order us out immediately and take possession squire leech certainly knew better than that but he evidently wanted to frighten your mother into selling to him at a sacrifice that was mean said herbert indignantly and he a rich man too i quite agree with you said mr cameron if you have any further difficulty with this grasping capitalist come to me and i will give you the best advice i can i will mr cameron and thank you for your advice you have relieved my mind i will tell mother what you say what would you like to have me read first we will put off the reading for a short time i want to ask you a few more questions about yourself not out of curiosity but because i may if i understand your circumstances some time have it in my power to serve you thank you sir i shall be very glad to tell you anything i was afraid you would not feel interested you are my private secretary now and that insures my interest how long since did your father die a little over a year what was his business when he was a young man he was employed in a manufactory near providence but the confinement injured his health and he learned the carpenters trade i shouldnt think there would be much for a carpenter to do in a small village like this my father managed to make a comfortable living but that was all at the time he died he considered that our house was mortgaged for only half its value but squire leech thinks otherwise squire leech wants to get possession of your place so that was all your father was able to leave you no not quite all there was something else which father seemed to think was worth something but i am afraid it will never do us any good what is that asked mr cameron he was at work in his leisure for the last two years of his life on an invention an invention of what nature you know i told you he was employed in a cotton manufactory when a young man this made him familiar with spinning and weaving he thought he could make an improvement in some of the machinery used and he worked out his idea in a wooden model have you the model asked cameron with interest yes sir and also a written paper describing the invention a few days before he died father called me to his bedside and told me that he wanted me some day to show his invention to a manufacturer and get his opinion of it he said that he hoped some time it would be a source of profit to mother and myself have you ever done as he advised asked cameron i have never had opportunity there is no manufacturing town near here and i cannot afford to travel i am myself the son of a cotton manufacturer said cameron and though i have never been employed in the business i have from my boyhood been accustomed to visit my fathers factory my opinion may be worth something therefore if you are willing to show me your fathers model i shall be very much obliged to you if you will look at it said herbert i have been afraid that father exaggerated its value and that it might have defects which would prevent its being adopted anywhere i will give you my opinion when i have seen it and now suppose we set to work here is a treatise on logic you may begin and read it very slowly pausing at the end of every paragraph till i tell you to go on herbert began to read as he had been requested for the first two or three times he took very little interest in his subject and thought it very dry in fact it was not all he began to reread the earlier portions that he could comprehend much of it now said cameron after he had read half an hour i have something else for you to do you are not only my reader but i must make you my teacher too herbert laughed saying i think youll have to get somebody that knows more than i then i wouldnt venture to teach a college student i mean that you shall hear my lessons i want you to imagine yourself a college professor and ask me questions on what you have just read do you think i can you may bungle a little at first but youll improve if you do well when i get through with you i will try to get you a professors chair at some college i should like that if professors get well paid they generally get more than five dollars a week but that is all that i can afford to pay at present im only an apprentice said herbert smiling and am quite satisfied herbert began to question cameron on what he had been reading he did not find it altogether easy partly from want of practice partly because the subject was one he knew nothing about but whenever blunders were made cameron laughed goodnaturedly and the young professor joined in the merriment well take political economy next said the student you wont find that so dry as logic though political economy is generally studied in the junior or senior year at college its principles if familiarly illustrated are not beyond the comprehension of a boy of fifteen he found himself reading with interest and when he came to act the role of professor he acquitted himself more creditably than with logic i think said cameron i shall recommend you for the chair of political economy i like it much better said herbert so do i still logic is important in its way tomorrow i must try you on latin i am afraid it wont be much use said our hero i have studied it a little two winters when we had a college student keeping our winter school if you know as much as that you will answer my purpose better than i anticipated now well take a walk you shall show me the houses of wrayburn the houses of wrayburn are four in number said herbert the two churches the town hall and squire leechs house theres another walk which i prefer i mean to prospect pond suppose we walk over to it i shall be glad to said herbert you are a very accommodating professor you let me off from study when i feel lazy chapter xx prospect pond it was a beautiful afternoon and herbert was satisfied to lay books aside and walk over to prospect pond this pond was about a mile from the village and probably about a mile and a half in circuit at the farther end was a small hill crowned with forest trees that would be a fine situation for a house yes said herbert but it would be hard to get at oh of course a road would have to be built connecting with the highway perhaps you will build a house there when you are a rich man then i shall have to wait a few years said herbert you wouldnt be the first poor boy that has grown rich my own father is rich now but when he was of your age he was only a poor bobbin boy working at scanty pay in the factory of which he is now owner i should like to be rich for my mothers sake said herbert with money one can do a great deal of good though not all rich men choose to apply their riches worthily how smooth the water is today isnt there a boat somewhere that we can use theres one a few rods from here but it belongs to james leech would it do to take it do you think it might do for you but not for me why not for you james and i are not very good friends why not he looks down upon me because i am poor so he is inclined to put on airs on account of his fathers money i should say he is let us go and see the boat at any rate herbert led the way through a meadow to a clump of trees where a small rowboat floated upon the water does leech often go out in it two or three times a week it is just about large enough for two though it would easily accommodate one more yes if i thought your friend would not be round i should be tempted to try it for half an hour i think you might venture jump in then and well push out herbert shook his head if the boat belonged to anyone but james leech i would go but i dont like him well enough to take any liberty with anything of his perhaps you are right would you mind sitting down and waiting for me twenty minutes or half an hour oh no it will be pleasant then here goes cameron jumped into the boat pushed off and began to row in a style that showed he was accustomed to the exercise the pond was so small that it was not easy for him to get out of sight herbert sat down not without a secret longing to be in the boat also but he did not care to place himself under any obligations to james suddenly he heard a hasty step behind him looking up he saw the owner of the boat close at hand james leech looked for his boat and saw that it was gone then his gaze fell upon our hero what have you done with my boat carter he demanded peremptorily what makes you ask such a question leech answered herbert why do you call me leech said james angrily for the same reason you call me carter i suppose theres a great difference between us said james thats true assented herbert and you ought to treat me with proper respect i treat you with all the respect you deserve you havent answered my question said james what question where is my boat out on the pond look and you will see it james looked where herbert pointed who is that in that boat he demanded angrily mr cameron whos he a boarder at the hotel is it the young man from yale college my father was speaking of him this morning said james moderating his tone very considerably yes then i dont mind my father says he is very rich i suppose i shall be introduced to him soon said james complacently if you will wait a few minutes till he comes ashore i will introduce you said herbert you what do you know of him sneered james i passed the afternoon with him said herbert he must be hard up for company said james look here james leech said herbert his eyes flashing ive had enough of that kind of talk i dont intend to submit to your impudence when you speak to me keep a civil tongue in your head i never heard such impudence what do you mean by addressing me in that style what do i mean i mean to warn you to be civil look here carter ill tell my father and hell turn you out of house and home exclaimed james furiously he hasnt the power fortunately hasnt he got a mortgage on your place yes but the interest was paid today and no more will be due for six months where did you get the money to pay the interest that is no business of yours it is enough for you to know that it is paid and that your father has no more control over us than we have over him james was disappointed he had expected that the interest would not be paid and that mrs carter and herbert would be at his fathers mercy it was certainly surprising that they had raised the money are you waiting here for mr cameron asked james yes i dont think you need to as you dont even know him i dont think your opinions as to his wishes of much importance i wouldnt thrust myself on him if i were you thank you i dont intend to i suppose you fell in with him by accident he probably dont know who you are oh yes he does he knows all about me i am going to spend tomorrow afternoon with him also said herbert delighting to mystify his companion he wont care to have you call much longer my aunt has written to my father about him and he will invite mr cameron to call i have no objection but i dont think it will make any difference as i am mr camerons private secretary private secretary what do you do i read to him as his eyes are poor and i suppose i shall write for him when he needs it what does he pay you i dont know as that concerns you particularly still i dont mind telling you he pays me five dollars a week thats a good deal more than youre worth i think so myself especially as i only spend the afternoon with him james was quite annoyed to find that the boy he disliked was prospering so well he was about to make another unpleasant remark when herbert suddenly exclaimed hes turned the boat doesnt he row beautifully the same thought sprang up in the minds of both boys i wish i could row like that chapter xxi rowing the little boat touched its moorings mr cameron said herbert allow me to introduce to you the owner of the boat mr james leech mr leech said cameron i have to apologize for taking your boat without leave i hope i havent kept you waiting for it if the young collegian had not been the son of a wealthy man whose social position was higher than his own james would not so readily have accepted the apology as it was he said graciously oh its no matter im glad you took the boat how beautifully you row thank you for the compliment last year i belonged to the sophomore crew at yale i wish i could row as well as you it is a matter of practice if i can give you any hints i shall be glad to do so thank you said james eagerly would you have time this afternoon yes i have an hour to spare if you and my friend herbert will get into the boat and row out a little way i shall get an idea of your style of rowing i would rather row out alone said james haughtily with a disparaging look at herbert unfortunately that wont do as well you must learn to row with one oar first then suppose you get into the boat with me that wont do as well i am much heavier than you now you and herbert are about the same weight very well then said james and turning to herbert he said ungraciously will you row with me if you desire it said herbert get in then when they returned cameron made some criticisms upon their rowing they started out again but herbert profited better by the instructions he had received and the young collegian said so when they returned james was far from liking this and when cameron asked him if he would try another row he answered no i am tired of it if you get tired so soon i am afraid you will have to strengthen your arms by gymnastic exercises oh i am not tired i dont feel like rowing then suppose we walk back to the village does your way lie with ours nearly all the way said james he enjoyed the idea of walking with the collegian but it was rather a drawback that herbert was to share that pleasure with him still he could not very well suggest that herbert should leave them have you seen my fathers house asked james perhaps without knowing whose it was you couldnt help knowing it it is the best in the village said james pompously cameron looked at him curiously if he comes to yale he thought and puts on these airs hell be taken down without ceremony oh indeed he said aloud dryly are you going to stay here long asked james i cant say how long i am here for my health you must come and see us my father will be very glad to see you my aunt has written us about you indeed may i ask your aunts name her name is davenport mrs john davenport she lives in new haven oh yes i have met her cameron smiled to himself the lady referred to was not unlike her brother and nephew being pompous and presuming one indeed whom he secretly disliked she wants me to prepare for yale said james of course we yale men are biased but we think no student can do better than to come to yale my father wants me to be a professional man a lawyer a good profession do you think you should like it yes said james complacently its a very genteel profession besides most of our public men are lawyers i might stand a chance to get into public life should you like it yes i should like to be a member of congress my father has a good deal of influence and i am his only son so i should have a very good chance dont you think so it would seem so said cameron with a quiet smile i think you had better come to yale you would be improved in many ways he referred to the possibility of james having some of the selfconceit taken out of him but then the squires son interpreted the remark as a compliment have you ever thought of going to college herbert asked cameron turning to our hero i always thought i should like to go answered herbert but i never thought there was any chance of it james laughed scornfully no i should think not he said why asked cameron meaning to draw him out hes too poor said james you i suppose have no trouble in that way my father is the richest man in wrayburn that is lucky for you said the collegian i shouldnt like to be as poor as carter it isnt pleasant or convenient to be poor said herbert quietly i dont mean always to be poor you probably will be said james poor boys dont always stay poor there isnt much chance for you to rise i dont know why said herbert then it seems herbert said cameron smiling there is not much chance of my welcoming you at yale i wish there was so you will have to be content with serving as my professor here james did not understand this allusion but privately wondered how cameron could talk so intimately with a boy in herberts low social position i turn off here he said that is our house is it said cameron indifferently your friend seems to have a very vain idea of his high position said cameron when james was out of hearing and a very low idea of mine added herbert does that disturb you a little he carries it so far as to be annoying circumstances may change with you both i hope they may with me said herbert i dont want james to come down in the world but i hope to rise the next day cameron was honored by a special call from squire leech who left an invitation for the young collegian to take tea with him the following afternoon this invitation cameron accepted chapter xxii andrew temple about halfpast four oclock one afternoon a tall darkcomplexioned man wearing a white hat inscribed his name in the register of the wrayburn hotel can you tell here mr leech lives he inquired of the landlord he lives about a quarter of a mile from here i can send some one with you to show you the house just then herbert came downstairs from mr cameron herbert said the landlord here is a gentleman wants to go to squire leechs would you mind showing him the way i will do so with pleasure said our hero politely are you ready to go now sir yes said the stranger landlord please assign me a room and have my bag carried up all right sir now my lad i am ready it isnt far is it about five minutes walk that is all sir i never was in wrayburn much going on here not much sir it is a quiet town mr leech squire leech i think you call him was an old schoolmate of mine we went to the brandon academy together i suppose he is rich eh he is the richest man in wrayburn i am glad to hear it said the other in a tone of satisfaction what do you think he is worth some say a hundred thousand dollars very good commented andrew temple for this was his name in the hotel register for the country i mean in the city that wouldnt make a rich man wouldnt it asked herbert who had supposed a man worth a hundred thousand dollars rich anywhere no to be sure not it costs a great deal more to live why i myself am worth something like that but in new york nobody regards me as rich i should feel rich with ten thousand said herbert that would about pay my expenses for a year squire leech doesnt spend anywhere near that i dont believe it costs him two thousand dollars a year very likely theres a great deal of difference between the country and the city is it easy to make money in the city asked herbert yes if a man is sharp and has some money to start with do you think of going there i am afraid it would be of no use i have no money to start with and i am afraid i am not smart wait and i may give you a lift heres my card thank you sir said herbert as he read andrew temple no nassau street room thats my office i speculate in stocks is that a good business capital if you know the ropes if you ever come to the city call at my office thank you sir here is squire leechs house i am much obliged to you allow me to compensate you for your trouble and mr temple thrust his thumb and forefinger into his vest pocket oh no sir i dont want pay said herbert hurriedly mr temple had made the offer as a matter of form and was relieved to find it declined he said goodnight graciously and advanced to the front door is squire leech at home he inquired of the servant yes sir i believe so wont you walk in thank you please hand your master that card squire leech did not recall mr temples name and greeted him distantly not so mr temple he rose and shook the squires passive hand energetically why leech it seems like old times seeing you again you have the advantage of me said the squire you dont mean to say youve forgotten temple andrew temple why we were at the brandon academy together i suppose i ought to remember you to be sure you ought we were very good friends in the old days one reason of the squires distant manner was that mr temple though a rich man according to his own account had a somewhat seedy look the squire was afraid he intended to ask for help on the score of old friendship it was with a hesitating voice therefore that he asked how has the world treated you i am not rich to be sure probably i am not worth more than a hundred thousand dollars at the outside but before five years roll over my head i see my way clear to half a million squire leechs manner changed instantaneously i am glad to see you he said cordially how long have you been in town only just arrived i inquired my way here as soon as i heard that you were living here are you at the hotel yes i left my luggage there you must come and stop with me we will talk over old times thank you it would be much pleasanter for me of course in fact i came to wrayburn on account of your being here i happened to be in the neighborhood and i said i must see leech at any rate so here i am fortune has smiled on you i hope yes said the squire i am comfortable the boy that guided me here said that you were the richest man in wrayburn i believe i am said the squire complacently i am worth somewhere about the same as you thats fair it is more for you than for me it costs me ten thousand dollars a year to live in the city does it inquired leech ive sometimes thought of going to the country where my expenses would be much less but after all you can make much more money in the city you think there are opportunities of making money rapidly there asked his companion no doubt of it i should like to talk with you on that subject after supper now i will go and tell mrs leech you are here we will send for your carpetbag after supper squire leech was a covetous man he had a passion for moneymaking and he had availed himself of all the opportunities which the country afforded he had about as much property as his friend he began to think he had been plodding along in a very slow unsatisfactory manner he would make careful inquiries and perhaps temple would put him in the way of doubling his money upon the whole therefore he was very glad to see mr temple and introduced him to his wife and son as an old schoolmate with whom he had once been very intimate chapter xxiii temple the tempter this is my son james mr temple said the squire as the young gentleman came in to supper a little late indeed how old are you james james took in at a glance the visitors appearance which did not give the impression of prosperity and answered with haughty condescension i am almost sixteen i congratulate you mr leech said temple i am not blessed with a son i would gladly give twenty thousand dollars could i have a son of your boys age james pricked up his ears temple spoke as if he had the twenty thousand dollars to give he must be a man of property and so entitled to respect what are you going to do with your boy i have not decided perhaps he may go to college i think i shall be a lawyer said james a good profession some of our new york lawyers make great incomes do you live in new york asked james yes that is my residence you must establish yourself in the city when you are ready to practice that is just what i want to do i dont want to bury myself in a onehorse country town like this and be a onehorse lawyer suggested temple laughing quite right my young friend in the city alone you will find a broad field of action thats just the way i think said james i neednt say i would do all in my power to push you and i flatter myself i have some influence you are very kind mr temple said mrs leech but i hoped that james could still continue to live with us you cant expect me to live at home all my life said james impatiently perhaps your husband may be persuaded himself to remove to the city said temple i really think he stands in his own light in staying in a small place like this just so said james who would have liked nothing better than to live in new york there is no society here i have no boys to associate with in my own position why wont you move to new york father that requires consideration said squire leech i should like to talk with you on that subject after supper said temple mrs leech may i ask for another cup of tea when supper was over squire leech led the way into the sitting room and his guest followed the vista of future wealth which his visitor had opened to him had not been without its effect and he began to make inquiries i suppose he said there are ways of investing money to good advantage in new york most certainly many ways real estate that may do but it is too slow for me i owned a house uptown i sold for thirty thousand dollars in six weeks i made twenty thousand more out of it is it possible ejaculated the squire twenty thousand did you say to be sure of course that was extra good luck you cant expect to do as well often but there are always ways of turning over capital may i ask in what way you made this large sum to be sure i speculated in erie it is all the time fluctuating i became convinced that it was on the rise i went in and the event justified my action temple spoke quietly as if it were no great matter after all his host was very much impressed and felt like a man who has discovered a gold mine he had succeeded in saving up about two thousand dollars a year for some years but what was that to twenty thousand dollars made in six weeks still prudence led him to suggest but isnt there danger of losing heavily not if you are acquainted with the stock market it is the ignoramuses that get bit i know very little of the stock market myself confessed squire leech i own some bank stocks no money to be made in bank stocks they pay good dividends no doubt but there is little or no variation in value its fluctuation that gives a man a chance i should be as likely to lose as gain knowing as little as i do of the market true but i should be happy to place my knowledge at your disposal as an old friend and schoolmate i naturally feel interested in your prosperity you are very kind said the squire but wouldnt it be too much trouble not at all in fact its my business and wouldnt inconvenience me in the least by the way how is your property invested asked temple carelessly mostly in real estate it must pay you very little that is true after deducting taxes and repairs there is very little left so i supposed it would pay you to mortgage your property or sell it and use the money in wall street i have about twenty thousand dollars in bank stock that could readily be sold what investments would you suggest i couldnt tell you on the moment but i think favorably of a mining stock lately put on the market i have private advices that it is likely to develop extraordinary richness and the stock may even treble in three months where is the mine asked the squire eagerly out in nevada a friend of mine has just returned from there and he has given me strictly confidential information in regard to it he has so much faith in it that he has bought fifteen thousand dollars worth of shares could i get any asked squire leech i think you could if you go to work quietly if you went into the market openly they would suspect something and raise the price on you yes i see do you think that is better than erie at present nothing is to be made in erie it is likely to go down before it goes up the time may come when you can buy to advantage but not now i have a great mind to go up to the city with you and investigate the matter said the squire do so by all means i shall be delighted and will cheerfully render you all the assistance in my power but my friend let me give you one piece of advice what is that say as little as possible to your wife on the subject women dont understand business they are frightened at risks and dont understand speculation i think you are correct said his host men must judge for themselves it is a weak man who would be guided by his wife so i say why my wife happened to learn that i had gone into erie on the occasion i mentioned she remonstrated in great alarm but when i announced that i had cleared twenty thousand dollars she had no more to say the next day they went to new york together and within a week the squire had bought largely in the nevada mine he subscribed to a financial paper and was fully embarked on the dangerous sea of speculation chapter xxiv james is snubbed in accordance with the invitation cameron walked to supper with squire leech his social position as the son of a rich manufacturer insured him a cordial welcome and great attention from the whole family you must find our village very dull mr cameron said his host oh no sir i think i shall enjoy it very well we have very little good society i am sorry to say thats so father broke in james i wish you would move to the city that may come some day said his father thinking of mr temple and his operations how do you occupy your time mr cameron asked mrs leech i walk about in the forenoon in the afternoon i am occupied with my professor answered the young man your professor repeated the lady in surprise is one of your college professors staying here no they are too busy to leave new haven i refer to my young reader herbert carter herbert carter repeated james scornfully yes said cameron ignoring the scorn he reads my lessons to me and then questions me upon them that is why i call him my professor i should hardly think you would find him competent said the squire he dont know much said james contemptuously on the contrary i find him very intelligent he reads clearly and distinctly and i congratulate myself on obtaining so satisfactory an assistant squire leech shrugged his shoulders and had too much wisdom to continue detracting from herberts merits seeing that his guest seemed determined to think well of him not so james he is from a low family he said spitefully low interrogated cameron significantly his mother is very poor thats a very different thing observed cameron mrs carter is a very respectable person said the squire condescendingly indeed i have offered to relieve her by taking her house at a high valuation but under a mistaken idea of her own interest she refuses to sell but youll get it finally father asked james i shall probably have to take it in the end as i have a mortgage on it for nearly its value cameron looked down upon his plate and said nothing my son will be happy to accompany you about the neighborhood mr cameron said squire leech i can go round with you most any time said james thank you both you are very kind said cameron politely but without expressing any pleasure i think i may send james to yale observed his host i have a high idea of your college mr cameron thank you i think your son could hardly fail of deriving benefit from a residence at yale james is my only child and i intend him to enjoy the greatest educational advantages i should like to have him become a professional man i should like to be a lawyer thats a very gentlemanly profession said james you might rise to be a judge said cameron with a smile very likely said james in a matterofcourse way that amused the young man exceedingly what an odious young cub he said to himself as he wended his way back to the hotel at ten oclock i never met such a combination of pride and selfconceit james thought cameron had taken a fancy to him he must get awfully tired of that lowbred herbert carter he said to himself i guess ill go round tomorrow morning and take a walk with him he met cameron on the steps of the hotel i thought id come and walk with you he said very well said cameron do you know the way to mr cranes the carpenters yes theres nothing to see there said james i beg your pardon i want to see herbert at his work oh well ill show you the way said james herbert was hard at work when the two came up how are you professor asked cameron very well mr cameron how are you james im well enough answered james who always found it hard to be decently civil to our hero dont you get tired working i havent worked long enough this morning for that i dare say i shall be tired before noon then your other work will begin said cameron that kind of work will be a rest to me its so different if you had an extra hoe i would help you a little it would be as good as exercise in the gymnasium perhaps i could borrow two and so employ both of you remarked herbert with a glance at james who was sprucely dressed and wore a flower in his buttonhole none for me thank you said james with a look of disgust i dont intend to become a laborer youll have to labor if you study law said cameron thats genteel besides i dont call it labor shall we go on mr cameron not just yet i want to watch herbert a little longer so he lingered much to the dissatisfaction of james wont you go out rowing he asked when they were walking away i have no objection said cameron and they spent an hour on the pond do you think i can get into the crew if i go to yale asked james complacently i should say not unless you improve in rowing dont i row well there is considerable room for improvement however you have time enough for that they were cruising near the shore when a boy of ten came down to the bank and called out to them james he said will you let me go across in the boat with you why should i demanded james not very amicably for the boy belonged to what he termed the lower classes do let me urged the boy i left mother very sick and went for the doctor she was all alone and i want to get back as soon as i can by the road the boy would have to walk about a mile and a quarter while he could be rowed across the pond in six or seven minutes i cant take anybody and everybody in my boat said james disagreeably go ahead and walk how can you refuse the boy when he wants to get home to his sick mother said cameron indignantly jump in my boy and well take you over i dont know about that said james sullenly look here said cameron shortly refuse this boy and i shall get out of the boat immediately and refuse hereafter to be seen in your company james was disagreeably surprised jump in my boy said cameron kindly thank you sir said the boy gratefully james was not a little mortified at the snubbing he had received but he did not venture to expostulate cameron was fond of boating but did not care to be indebted to james for the loan of his boat ill have a boat sent on to me he secretly determined and when i leave wrayburn ill give it to herbert chapter xxv the new boat herbert worked steadily every forenoon on his farm cameron then proposed that they should take the forenoon for their studies and walk out or exercise in some other way in the afternoon one afternoon cameron said let us take a walk to prospect pond i think i should enjoy a little rowing i will accompany you with pleasure mr cameron said herbert but dont ask me to go out in the boat with you why not are you afraid i will upset you no answered herbert i have confidence in your skill besides i can swim what is your objection then if the boat belonged to anyone but james leech i would not mind why should you mind that i met him last evening and he told me not to get into his boat again he said he was perfectly willing you should use it but he didnt choose to have me it appears that i am a greater favorite with james leech than you are said cameron smiling he looks down upon me as a poor boy well i suppose james is entitled to his prejudice but if you cant use the boat i wont dont let that interfere with your pleasure mr cameron said herbert eagerly i dont trouble myself in the least about the way james treats me let us go down to the pond at any rate we can sit down on the bank if nothing better all right an easy walk brought them to the edge of the pond herbert naturally looked for james leechs boat he thought something was the matter with his eyes for where there should be but one boat there were now two why theres another boat he exclaimed is there asked cameron indifferently yes dont you see it well it does look like a boat i admit i should say it was nicer than the other i should say it was isnt she a regular beauty exclaimed herbert enthusiastically i wonder whose it is james wouldnt want two there was a smile on camerons face that attracted herberts attention is it yours he asked no i know who owns it though it isnt the landlord is it no then i cant imagine whose it is said herbert cant you no said herbert will you tell me it is yours mine exclaimed our hero in the utmost surprise yes i intended at first not to give it to you till i went away but i may as well give it now on one condition that you let me use it whenever i please how kind you are said herbert gratefully i never received such a splendid present in my life i have done nothing to deserve it let me be the judge of that now with your consent we will try her with the utmost alacrity herbert followed cameron aboard the new craft and took the oars smoothly and easily the boat glided off on the surface of the pond i like it much better than james said herbert its a better model his is rather clumsy besides this is new and he must have had his for some time he has had it three years it needs painting even if it were painted it wouldnt come up to this i agree with you said cameron i am afraid james will be stirred with envy when he sees your boat i am afraid so too he wont believe it is mine it may be your duty out of a delicate regard to his feelings to give it up or exchange suggested cameron thats a little further than i carry my delicate regard to his feelings responded herbert after half an hours rowing cameron said suddenly i must go back to the hotel i came near forgetting an important letter which must be sent off by this afternoons mail herbert was a little disappointed still he said cheerfully all right mr cameron dont you cease your rowing said the collegian i thought you might not like to walk back alone i dont mind that i shall hurry back and should be poor company we will meet tomorrow morning cameron set out on his return home he had gone less than quarter of a mile when he met james leech good afternoon mr cameron said james who was always polite to the rich manufacturers son good afternoon james wont you go out in my boat mr cameron thank you i have just returned from the pond i am obliged to go back to the hotel to write a letter i should have been glad of your company you wont be alone said cameron mischievously i left herbert carter at the pond was he out in the boat asked james hastily yes without a word james walked abruptly away he was very angry with herbert who he naturally concluded was out in his boat hes the most impudent and cheeky boy i ever met he said to himself last evening i positively forbade his getting into my boat and he dont take the slightest notice of it he neednt think he can take such liberties cameron smiled as he read james feelings in his face just before reaching the pond there was rising ground from which james could take a general survey of the lake herbert was cruising about and had not yet seen james he dont think im so near thought james he thinks i wont know anything about his impudence ill soon make him draw in his horns in his excitement james did not notice the boat particularly if he had he would have seen that it was not his boat but so far as he knew there was no other boat on the pond indeed there was no boy whose father could afford to buy him one and james had come to think himself sole proprietor of the pond as well as of the only craft that plied on its surface i wonder he thought whether i couldnt have herbert fined for taking my property without leave especially after i have expressly forbidden him to do it i must ask my father this evening it would bring down his pride a little to be taken before a justice herbert had got tired of cruising and made a vigorous stroke as if to cross the pond james put up his hand to his mouth and shouted at the top of his voice come right back herbert carter chapter xxvi the rival boatmen herbert bending over his oars heard the peremptory order of james to come back and smiled to himself as he instantly comprehended the mistake which the latter had made from james standpoint his own boat was not visible and it was not surprising that he should suspect our hero of having appropriated his boat i wont undeceive him he thought what do you want he asked resting on his oars and looking back at james you know what i want said james provoked how should i know i want you to come right back at once whats happened what am i wanted for youll be wanted by the constable i dont understand you said herbert shrugging his shoulders you appear to be mad about something so i am and i have a right to be well im sure i have no objection if you like it james was pale with rage bring that boat right back here he said if youll give me a good reason perhaps i will but i dont think it necessary to obey you without you are a thief say that again said herbert sternly and i will come ashore and give you a whipping you cant do it i can try dont you know i can have you arrested for stealing my boat you loafer whos been stealing your boat you loafer you have are you sure of it why you are in my boat this very minute i think you are mistaken said herbert quietly dont you call that a boat you are in yes i do but theres more than one boat in the world and this isnt your boat he rowed near the shore as he spoke and james his attention drawn to the boat saw that it wasnt his at the same time walking nearer the edge of the pond he caught sight of his own boat moored at its usual place i guess i made a mistake said james i think you have returned herbert quietly where did that boat come from demanded james i dont know you dont then youve taken it without leave oh the owner wont object to my using it said herbert with a queer smile how do you know hes an intimate friend of mine the owner yes i suppose it belongs to mr cameron then he bought it do you call him your intimate friend hed be proud if he heard it said james with a sneer would he said herbert i should think he would considering your high position in society i think hes a pretty good friend of mine but i have never called him an intimate friend yes you have you said the owner of that boat was an intimate friend of yours so he is im with him all the time then why do you deny that you called mr cameron your intimate friend because mr cameron doesnt own the boat just now you said he bought it so he did but he doesnt own it then who does i do was the unexpected reply you own that boat ejaculated james yes did mr cameron give it to you yes i dont believe it that boat must have cost sixty or seventy dollars i dont believe he would give you such a present as that i dont know as it makes much difference when did he give it to you this afternoon ill row in perhaps you would like to examine it james surveyed with envious eyes the neat graceful boat for he saw at a glance that his own boat even when new was by no means its equal isnt it a beauty asked herbert not without pride very fair answered james condescendingly did you ask mr cameron to give it to you i never ask for gifts said herbert with emphasis what makes you ask such a question as that i thought it queer that he should have given you such a handsome present it was certainly very generous in him said herbert i shouldnt think youd want to accept it though why not because you are a poor boy and it dont correspond with your position perhaps not but that dont trouble me a less expensive boat would have been more appropriate perhaps it would but you wouldnt have me refuse it on that account james did not answer and herbert asked are you going out in your boat this afternoon i should like to try yours said james i shall be glad to have you said herbert politely and you may take mine said james with unwonted politeness all right the two boys got into the boats and pulled out james was charmed with the new boat in every way it was superior to his own boat apart from its being newer it was certainly very provoking to think that a boy like herbert carter poor almost to beggary should own such a beautiful little boat while he a rich mans son had to put up with an inferior one i say herbert he began when they returned dont you want to exchange your boat for mine not much i should be a fool to do that i dont mean even for i know your boat is better ill give you five dollars to boot no thank you theres a good deal more than five dollars difference between your boat and mine five dollars would come handy to a poor boy like you said james in his usual tone of insolent condescension i dont want it enough to exchange boats well ill give you ten dollars said james thats an offer worth thinking about i shant need to think about it i say no youve got an extravagant idea of your boat mine is nearly as good but ive taken a fancy to yours how will you trade anyway i dont feel at liberty to trade at all mr cameron gave me the boat but he is to have the use of it while he is here he wouldnt be willing to have me exchange he can have the use of it all the same if it is mine it wont do james said herbert shaking his head you are very foolish then said james disappointed i may be but that is my answer james walked away he made up his mind since he could not have herberts boat to tease his father to buy him a new one as to rowing in an inferior one his pride would not permit it chapter xxvii the race james broached the subject which was uppermost in his mind as soon as he got home i wish youd buy me a new boat father he said whats the matter with the boat you have now i dont want to be outdone by herbert carter i dont see how that can be hes got a beautiful new boat twice as handsome as mine ever was he has exclaimed the squire in amazement how can he have without any money mr cameron gave it to him i dont believe it probably the boat belongs to mr cameron and he has only let herbert use it no mr cameron gave it to him herbert told me perhaps he has not told the truth he wouldnt tell a lie that is about that said james modifying his first assertion lest it might be a compliment in reality he had implicit confidence in herberts word you wouldnt want me to be rowing around in a poor boat while that beggar has a new one said james artfully appealing to his fathers pride well the fact is my son said the squire rather embarrassed it would not be convenient for me to buy you a new boat just now why not father i thought you had plenty of money so i have but i have made some investments under the advice of mr temple if you can arrange to exchange boats by paying a little to boot you may do so i have proposed it but herbert is very stiff about it humph said the squire clearing his throat i think you will have to wait a while how long asked james dissatisfied ill tell you what ill do said his father if things go well i expect to make a good deal of money within twelve months instead of a rowboat ill buy you a beautiful little sailboat next season will you exclaimed james delighted yes wont that be much better you are right father certainly a sailboat would be far better and there was very little chance of herberts having one given him so james went cut rowing contentedly the next afternoon although herbert was out also in the new boat your boat is better than mine said james however i am to have an elegant yacht next year are you said herbert interested father has promised to get me one he would get me one this season but it would be some time before it could be got ready and i can have it the first thing next spring i congratulate you said herbert i should like a sailboat myself i dare say you would said james pompously but of course you cannot expect to have one i dont think there is much chance myself unless somebody leaves me a fortune said herbert goodnaturedly i am satisfied with this boat of course it is more than a boy in your circumstances could expect herbert smiled he was used to references to his circumstances james never allowed him to forget that he was a poor boy he thought it hardly worth noticing shall we have a race he asked just as you say said james james thought himself the better rower or he would not have consented to row across the pond are you ready asked herbert yes give way then both bent to their oars and rowed their best but it was not long before herbert began to draw away from his antagonist he had not had as much practice as james but he was stronger in the arms and had paid more attention to camerons instructions he came in more than a dozen lengths ahead of his competitor ive won the race james he said with a smile you ought to said james in a surly tone i havent had as much practice as you what if you havent youve got a new boat while mine is old and clumsy if you think that makes any difference ill row back with you changing boats agreed said james but james brought up the rear at about the same distance beaten again said herbert pleased with his success theres nothing to crow about said james crossly your boat is a good one but im not used to it i am not much used to it myself i only rowed in it yesterday for the first time thats long enough to get the hang of it there isnt much fun in rowing id a good deal rather sail i like both theres more exercise in rowing dont you get exercise enough in hoeing potatoes asked james with a sneer i shouldnt think laborers would need any extra exercise theres some advantage in varying your exercise there isnt much fun in hoeing no i should think not are you going in asked herbert noticing that james was proceeding to fasten his boat yes ive got tired of the water herbert was not to be alone however for just then mr cameron appeared on the bank i think ill go out with you he said all right said herbert with alacrity as he rowed the boat to shore mr cameron said our hero mother has asked me to invite you to take tea with us this evening i shall be very glad to come said cameron we live in humble style you know said herbert but i told mother you wouldnt mind that thank you for saying so i shall be very glad to meet your mother and expect to enjoy myself better than at squire leechs table it isnt the style but the company why is james going away so soon i have beaten him in two races said herbert i am not surprised to hear of your success you are really gaining very fast i am glad of it i want to be a good rower it is a good thing to do well anything you undertake whether it be rowing or anything else james thinks i dont need to row for exercise why not he thinks i shall get enough exercise in hoeing potatoes answered herbert with a smile it wouldnt do him any harm to get exercise in the same way the very idea would shock him chapter xxviii mrs carters guest at five oclock mr cameron knocked at the door of mrs carters cottage it was opened by herbert himself walk in mr cameron he said cordially my mother is in the next room mrs carter was prepossessed in favor of cameron in worldly advantages he was her superior yet with the instinct of a gentleman he seemed unconscious of any such difference and did not exhibit the least trace of condescension as many illbred persons might have i have wanted to see you mrs carter he said as the mother of my professor the desire was only natural herbert tells me he has learned a good deal since he has been reading to you he has often spoken of his good fortune in meeting you i feel equally fortunate in meeting him not every boy of his age would adapt himself as readily and intelligently as he has i am very glad if you find herbert of service to you said mrs carter in all ways the engagement has been of advantage to him squire leech was kind enough to offer me the services of his son james said cameron smiling james would hardly have been willing to sacrifice so much of his time said herbert though he might be willing to try it for a day or two to supersede me i think i shall have to worry along with my present professor said cameron and allow james to devote his superior talents to some other business the table was already spread in honor of the guest and both herbert and mrs carter were gratified to find that the young collegian did ample justice to the meal i feel almost ashamed of my appetite said cameron but the change from the stereotyped bill of fare at the hotel is pleasant and gives the food an increased relish i am glad to hear you say so mr cameron i could hardly expect to compete with the hotel in point of variety let me give you another cup of tea thank you i dont often venture on a third cup but i think i will make an exception tonight dr johnson sometimes got up to a dozen i believe said herbert he exceeded that number at times but we must remember that the cups in his day barely contained a third as much as ours so he was not so immoderate after all his excesses in eating were less pardonable was he a very large eater asked the widow he actually gorged himself if we are to believe the accounts that have come down to us said cameron i am afraid mrs carter you would have found him a very unprofitable boarder but said herbert there is one of dr johnsons labors i shall not seek to imitate i shall never attempt to write a dictionary it must be a monotonous and wearisome labor besides i dont think we could either of us improve upon webster or worcester they arose and mrs carter who could not afford to keep a servant herself cleared away the tea table herbert said the young collegian you mentioned one day that your father was an inventor he made one invention but whether it will amount to anything i dont know he had high hopes of it but died before he had any opportunity of testing its value will you show it to me with pleasure herbert led cameron upstairs into his own chamber where since his fathers death the work which had cost his father so many toilsome hours had been kept cameron examined it carefully herbert waited anxiously for his verdict at length he spoke as far as i am qualified to judge he said your fathers invention seems to embody an improvement but you must not rely too much upon my opinion my knowledge of the details of manufacturing is superficial i should like to show it to my father there is nothing that i would like better said herbert if you think he would be willing to examine it he would be glad to do so it is for his interest to examine anything which will facilitate the details of his business i am intending to go home next friday afternoon and with your permission will carry this with me i shall feel very much obliged to you if you will said herbert it may be worth nothing i know it would have been my fathers wish to have it examined by one who is qualified to judge it is a pity your father could not have lived to enjoy the benefit of his invention if it succeeds he was a great loss to us said herbert there were but three of us and he was at an age when we might hope to have him with us for a good many years yet if i had been a few years older i should have been better able to make up his loss to my mother she is fortunate in having a son who is so willing to do his best for her said cameron kindly we dont know what the future may have in store for us herbert but you may rely upon my continued friendship herbert pressed the hand of the young collegian warmly for he knew that the offer of service was no empty compliment but made in earnest sincerity the evening passed pleasantly and at nine oclock cameron took his leave herbert accompanied him as far as the hotel he was walking leisurely back when he heard his name called and turning saw that it was james leech who had accosted him where have you been carter inquired james been to see mr cameron i suppose doesnt he get enough of your company in the daytime you must ask him that he has been taking tea at our house and i accompanied him home he took supper at your house yes he seems very fond of keeping low company what do you mean demanded herbert his eyes flashing with indignation at this insolence i mean what i say answered james doggedly then i advise you hereafter to keep your impudence to yourself retorted herbert and for fear you may forget it i give you this as a reminder an instant later james leech found himself lying on his back on the sidewalk with herbert bending over him he kept upon his feet pale with rage and mortification ill be revenged upon you yet you brute he shrieked in his rage leaving our hero victor of the field i wouldnt have touched him if he hadnt spoken against my mother said herbert chapter xxix a bitter pill james leech was furious at the humiliation what he a gentlemans son to be knocked down and triumphed over by a boy who was compelled to work why it was almost a sacrilege and no punishment could be too severe for such flagrant outrage how should he be revenged first of all he would get herbert discharged from his present employment surely mr cameron would not continue to avail himself of the services of a common bully to attain this he decided to reveal the matter to his father that boy actually knocked you down exclaimed the squire but why did you permit him he took me by surprise said james and what did you do did you knock him over i would said james but i didnt care to pursue him i thought i would wait and tell you and what do you want me to do to get mr cameron to turn him off i want him to starve said james bitterly you express yourself too strongly james but under the circumstances i cant blame you much the boy is evidently a ruffian yes he is a ruffian and a brute and i dont see what mr cameron sees about him to like i am sure probably the boy makes him think he is a model of excellence such boys are apt to be deceitful hes deceitful enough youd think butter wouldnt melt in his mouth i shall make such representations to mr cameron as i flatter myself will dispose of the case of this young rascal and make him repent his brutal and unprovoked assault ill go over tomorrow forenoon to the hotel and speak to him on the subject said the squire pompously thank you father put it as strong as you can i will you may be assured of that if i can only get him turned off i wont mind his hitting me thought james i hope to see him in the penitentiary some day it would do him good it so happened that cameron had met herbert in a walk he took before breakfast and had been informed of the occurrence of the evening previous i dont know whether i ought to have struck james said herbert in conclusion but when he called my mother and myself low i couldnt help it i am glad you did it said the young collegian the boy is a disagreeable cub and deserves more than one lesson of that sort didnt he offer to hit you back no so i supposed i dont approve of fighting but if he had shown a little courage to back his insolence i should have despised him less what will he do he will injure me if he can said herbert we will see what comes of it meanwhile in this matter you may count upon my support herbert thanked his friend not realizing how likely cameron was to be called upon to redeem his promise shortly after breakfast cameron was told that squire leech wished to see him goodmorning mr cameron said the squire this is an early call not too early sir said the young collegian the fact is i have called on unpleasant business really sir i am sorry to hear it it is about the carter boy who is in your employ by the carter boy you mean my young friend herbert carter i suppose said cameron significantly of course if you choose to regard him as a friend i certainly do i dont think you will look upon him in that light when you hear that last evening he brutally assaulted my son james without provocation in the village street taking him by surprise and knocking him over cameron did not seem as much shocked as the squire anticipated he took the revelation very coolly you say he did this without provocation yes mr cameron did james tell you this he did and he is a boy of truth but perhaps he did not look upon it as a provocation when he called herbert and his mother low he didnt say anything about that i dare say not and even if he did use the word it would not justify carter in brutally assaulting him i confess i dont agree with you there squire leech i hate brutality as much as anyone and an unprovoked assault i certainly look upon as brutal but for a boy to resent an insult directed against his mother is quite a different matter and if herbert had not acted as he did i should have been ashamed of him squire leech flushed all over his face this certainly was plain speaking you have probably been misled by carters statement i dont believe my boy did anything or said anything that carter had a right to complain of from what i have observed of your son i regret to differ with you you are prejudiced against james i was not to begin with but what i have seen of him certainly has not prepossessed me in his favor he seems disposed to be insolent to those whom he fancies beneath him in social position if you refer to the carter boy said the squire pompously i should say that james is right in regarding him as a social inferior i wont argue that point or consider how far the possession of money which is certainly the only point in which herbert is inferior justifies your son in looking down upon him i will only say that he has no right to insult his social inferiors the discussion had assumed such a different character from what the squire anticipated that he found it difficult to come to the request he had in view but he did it i am certainly astonished mr cameron to find you so prejudiced against my son if you should find you had done him an injustice and that the carter boy was really the aggressor last evening will you be willing to discharge him from your employment if i find herbert justifies your denunciations and his assault was unprovoked i will discharge him then you can do it at once you have my sons word for it and i have herberts word for the contrary between the two i believe james does james deny that he called herbert and his mother low i have not asked him if you will do so and bring me his assurance that he said nothing of the kind i will examine herbert again and try to get at the truth very well i will put the question to him squire leech did so on his return home i dont know but i called him something of the kind james admitted but its true isnt it as to that the boy certainly acted in a very low manner but you shouldnt have called him so i couldnt help it when i heard him boasting of mr camerons having taken supper at his house wont cameron discharge him no said the squire shortly he is infatuated about that boy suppose we cut both of them it wont do james mr camerons father is a wealthy manufacturer much richer than i am we must keep on good terms with him but we neednt notice the carter boy some day he and his mother will be in my power i hope so father i want to bring him to his knees the proud beggar it was a bitter pill for james to swallow seeing his rival high in the favor of the young collegian chapter xxx out of work again mr cameron went home on friday afternoon i shall be back monday night he said to herbert but monday night did not bring him herbert didnt think much of it however as it was easy to imagine that some engagement had delayed the young collegian tuesday morning however he received a letter from cameron which contained unexpected and unwelcome intelligence it ran thus my dear herbert when i left you i fully expected to return on monday but an unexpected proposal has been made to me which i think it expedient to accept the physician whom i consulted about my eyes recommends a sea voyage as likely to benefit me and advises me to start at once a fellow student is intending to sail on saturday next for rio janeiro and i have decided to go with him while i hope to reap advantage from the voyage i regret that our pleasant intimacy should terminate so suddenly i ought not to use the word terminate however as i fully intend to keep track of you if i can in your future plans i may be gone some months perhaps a year but when i return i shall manage to meet you i have submitted your fathers invention to my father who will examine it when he has leisure and communicate with you there may be some delay as he is obliged to go to europe for three months on business i am owing you five dollars but inclose fifteen which i beg you to accept with my thanks for your services and my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity this was the letter which herbert read with feelings of regret almost bordering upon dismay he missed the daily companionship of cameron for whom he had formed an attachment almost brotherly and besides he was forced to regard the departure of his friend in its bearing upon his material interests the income upon which he chiefly depended was suddenly withdrawn and look where he might he could not see where he was to supply the deficiency the fifteen dollars which cameron had so considerately sent him would indeed last some time but when that was spent what was he to do this was a question which cost him anxious thought it was not till the day afterward that james leech heard of camerons departure it is needless to say that he took a malicious satisfaction in the thought that his enemy would now be deprived of his main income he hastened to inform his father what cameron gone away that is unexpected said the squire yes it is sudden where is he gone they told me at the hotel that he was going to sail to south america his eyes are weak you know and the doctor thinks the voyage will do him good i wonder he didnt take the carter boy with him he seemed infatuated with him he dont care anything about carter at any rate he will forget all about him now he is away the beggarly upstart will have to draw in his horns now he wont put on so many airs im thinking how much did cameron pay him for reading to him five dollars a week a perfectly preposterous price so i think but he wont get it now theyll find it hard to get along of course they will they cant pay you interest on the mortgage now i dont see how they can and you can take possession of the house cant you i certainly shall if the interest isnt paid promptly perhaps carter would sell his boat now he was pretty stiff about it before i wouldnt make him an offer why not if he succeeded in selling the boat he might be able to pay the interest and delay my getting possession of the property that is true said james i didnt think of that besides you have promised me a sailboat next spring if business is good as i hope it may be you shall have one at present i am rather short of money i thought you always had plenty of money father said james in surprise i have been buying stocks in the city james and that has tied up my money however i shall probably make a very handsome profit when i sell out my friend assures me that i stand a chance of making twenty thousand dollars concluded the squire complacently thats a big pile of money said james are you pretty sure of making it the chances are greatly in my favor of course it depends on the turn of the market if you succeed will you move to new york father very probably i hope you will this village is awfully slow new york is the place to see life there are some kinds of life it is not profitable to see said the squire shrewdly i dont want to be cooped up in a little country village all my life grumbled james you wont be dont trouble yourself on that score it will do well enough for carter he isnt fit for anything but a country bumpkin but it dont suit me well james you must be patient and things may turn out as you desire at the same time herbert was holding a consultation with his mother my prospects are not very bright here mother he said rather despondently i am ready enough to work but there is no work to be had so far as i can see you forget your garden herbert yes that will help us a little but i cant expect to clear more than twenty dollars out of it and twenty dollars wont go a great way it is something herbert it isnt enough to pay our next interest bill mrs carter looked troubled if i could sell the property for what it cost your father i should be tempted to do it you mean for fifteen hundred dollars yes that would give us seven hundred and fifty dollars over the mortgage i should be in favor of selling too in that case but squire leech only offers eleven hundred at the outside he ought to be more considerate he wants to make a bargain at your expense mother that isnt all he is provoked to think you havent accepted his offer before and of course that wont incline him to be any more liberal i am afraid we shall have to part with our home said the widow with a sigh there is one hope mother i dont like to think of it too much for fear it wont amount to anything but fathers invention may prove valuable you know mr camerons father has agreed to examine it if we could only get two or three hundred dollars for it it would be a great help if we get anything at all we shall get more i am afraid we shall have to wait though for mr cameron writes me his father is going to europe for a few months everything seems against us herbert said his mother in a despondent tone but herbert was more hopeful if we can only manage to keep along and pay the next interest i think well be all right mother he said i mean to try anyway if theres any work to be had anywhere within five miles ill try to obtain it how much money have you got left mother ten dollars and a half and here are fifteen that mr cameron sent me no chance of the poorhouse for a month mother before that has gone by something may turn up chapter xxxi a new start harvest came and for the time herbert was busy he could not afford to hire assistance and was obliged to do all the work himself when all was finished and his share of the vegetables sold he sat down to count up his profits well mother he asked how much money do you think i have made by farming you expected to make twenty dollars i have cleared twentyone dollars and a half besides the vegetables i have brought home and stored in the cellar that is doing very well said mrs carter i have had to work very hard for it said herbert thoughtfully and for a good many days after all it isnt quite enough to pay our interest the interest doesnt come due for six weeks yet that is true mother but six weeks hence we shall be poorer than we are now we shall have to use some of this money for current expenses and i know of no way to replace it you may earn some more i dont see any chance that is here there is nothing doing in wrayburn if there were any factories or workshops i might stand a chance of getting something to do mrs carter did not reply she knew that herbert was right and she had nothing to suggest i have thought of something said herbert but you may not like it at first what is it asked his mother with interest would you have any objection to my going to new york and trying my fortune there mrs carter uttered a little cry of dismay you go to new york a boy of your age she exclaimed i am old enough to take care of myself said herbert sturdily a great city is a dangerous place it wont be dangerous for me i shall be too busy that is if i get work to fall into temptation if that is what you mean i should miss you so much herbert even if i knew you were doing well said his mother pathetically i know you would mother and i should miss you too but i cant live here always if i do well in the city you can come and join me there this was the first time herbert broached the subject of going to new york he resumed the attack the next day and the next and finally won his mothers consent to go for a week and see whether he could find anything to do his mothers consent obtained herbert took but a day to make his preparations the next day after an early breakfast he started for the great city excited with the idea of going but hardly able to repress the tears as he saw the lonely look upon his mothers face he was her only son and she was a widow i must send her good news as soon as possible he thought that will cheer her up about noon herbert reached the city he had formed no particular plan except to find cornelius dixon who would doubtless be able to advise him about getting a place perhaps would have influence enough to procure him one he did not know where to look for cornelius but concluded that his name would be in the city directory he entered a small liquor store which he happened to pass and walked up to the counter goodmorning said he politely addressing a young man behind the bar this young man had coarse red hair and a mottled complexion and looked as if he patronized freely the liquors he sold he turned his glance upon herbert who stood before him with his fresh inquiring face holding under his arm a small bundle of clothing tied up in a paper hello yourself he answered want some bitters thank you said herbert innocently i dont require any medicine medicine repeated the other with a frown do you mean to compare my drinks to medicine you said bitters returned herbert youre from the country aint you asked the bartender yes sir so i thought you havent cut your eyeteeth yet when a gentleman takes a drink he takes his bitters now whatll you have nothing thank you oh you neednt thank me i didnt offer to give you a drink what do you want anyhow have you got a directory no we dont keep one we dont care where our customers live all we want is their money herbert did not fancy the bartenders tone or manner but felt that it would be foolish to get angry so he explained i have a cousin living in the city i thought i could find out where he lived in the directory whats your cousins name cornelius dixon never heard of him he dont buy his bitters at this shop it was clear that no satisfaction was to be found here and herbert looked further finally at a druggists he found a directory and hopefully looked for the name but another disappointment awaited him there were several dixons but cornelius was not among them i must give him up and see what i can do by myself thought herbert i wish i could come across him it seemed strange to him that one who was so prominent as cornelius claimed to be and who had been living for years in the city should have been overlooked by the compilers of the directory he was not discouraged however he expected to encounter difficulties and this was the first one he kept on his way attracting some attention as he walked the city arab knows a stranger by instinct carry your bundle mister asked a ragged urchin no thank you i can carry it myself i wont charge you much take you to any hotel in the city i dont think i shall go to any hotel i cant afford it can you show me a cheap boarding house yes said the boy whatll you give ten cents that aint enough it wouldnt keep me in cigars an hour do you smoke asked herbert surprised in course i do ive smoked for four or five years how old are you the old woman says im ten she ought to know it isnt good for boys to smoke said herbert gravely oh bosh dry up all us boys smoke herbert felt that his advice was not called for and he came to business ill give you fifteen cents he said if youll show me a good cheap boarding house well said the arab business is poor and ill do it for once come along herbert concluded from the boys appearance that he would be more likely to know of cheap than of fashionable boarding houses but it did not occur to him that there was such a thing as being too cheap he realized it when the boy brought him to the door of a squalid dwelling in a filthy street and pointing to it complacently remarked thats the place you want thats raffertys herbert stared at it in dismay accustomed to the utmost neatness he was appalled at the idea of lodging in such a place gimme them fifteen cents mister said the boy impatiently but i dont like the place i wouldnt stay here its cheap said the young arab raffertyll give you a lodging for ten cents meals fifteen you cant complain of that now i dont complain of the price its dirty i wouldnt stay in such a dirty place oh youre a fine gentleman you are said the boy sarcastically youd better go to the fifth avenoo hotel you had i wont stop here i want some decent place meanwhile mrs rafferty herself had come to the door and caught the meaning of the conference she took instant umbrage at herberts last words dacent do ye say she repeated with flaming eyes and arms akimbo who dares to say that bridget rafferty doesnt keep a dacent house he does said the arab indicating herbert with a grin and who are you id like to know demanded mrs rafferty turning upon herbert angrily who are you that talks agin a poor widder thats tryin to earn an honest living i beg your pardon madam said herbert anxious to get out of the scrape i meant no offense lucky for you thin said mrs rafferty in a belligerent tone be off wid you both thin or ill call a cop herbert turned to go nothing loath but his guide followed him gimme them fifteen cents he demanded you havent shown me a good boarding place yes i did you dont seem to know what i want ill give you five cents and look out for myself the young arab tried for ten but herbert was firm he felt that he had no money to waste and that he had selected a poor guide it was wiser to rely upon himself chapter xxxii opening the campaign not knowing his way but wandering wherever the fancy seized him herbert finally came to washington square and took a seat on one of the benches provided for the public he looked around him with interest surveying the groups that passed him though without the expectation of recognizing anyone but as good fortune would have it the very person he most desired to see strolled by mr cornelius dixon looked like a cheap swell in his dress he caricatured the fashion and exhibited a sort of pretentious gentility which betrayed his innate vulgarity he stared in wonder when a boy with a bundle under his arm started from his seat and hurried toward him with the greeting how do you do mr dixon really drawled cornelius you have the advantage of me dont you remember me i am your cousin herbert carter what the boy the old fellow left his old clothes to asked cornelius the same one answered herbert smiling you havent got any of em on have you asked mr dixon surveying him with curiosity yes this coat was made from my uncles cloak shouldnt have thought it it looks quite respectable pon my honor when did you come to the city only this morning on a visit no i want to find a place humph muttered cornelius thoughtfully places dont grow on every bush where are you hanging out i havent found a place yet i want to find a cheap boarding house you might come to mine perhaps you pay more than i could afford suggested herbert who was not aware that cornelius had a very limited income and occupied a room on the fourth floor of a bleecker street boarding house at the weekly expense of five dollars you can come into my room for a day or two and then well see what arrangement we can make im going there now will you come along herbert gladly accepted the invitation he was tired of wandering about the great city not knowing where to lay his head accordingly he joined his genteel cousin and they walked toward bleecker street have you got any money queried cornelius cautiously not much if i dont find something to do in a week i must go back to the country a weeks a short time to find a place but hold on we want a boy in our store i guess i could get you in what wages would i get two dollars a week to begin with i couldnt live on that could i i guess not four dollars a week would be the least you could get boarded for then it will be better for me to go home than to stay here and get into debt perhaps it would said cornelius who was afraid herbert might want to borrow of him cant i get something better how much do you get ahem only twenty dollars a week answered mr dixon who really got about half that why thats splendid said herbert so it would be if i only got it thought cornelius i cant save anything he answered i have to dress in the fashion you know on account of my position in society herbert privately thought from an inspection of his cousins wardrobe that the fashion was a queer one but he did not say so its a shame the old man didnt leave us more said mr dixon in an aggrieved tone it would have been convenient herbert admitted he ought to have left us ten thousand dollars apiece what would you have done with so much money gone into business on my own account if i had a store of my own i might have offered you a place but suppose i had ten thousand dollars too then i would have taken you into partnership it would be a grand thing for you to be junior partner in a new york firm herbert thought so too though it is doubtful whether a firm of which mr dixon was the head would have occupied so proud a position as some others i suppose you have spent all your legacy said herbert i should say so whats a hundred dollars i bought a new suit of clothes a dozen pair of kids and a box of cigars and that took up about all of it you dont smoke do you oh no answered herbert surprised at the question better not its expensive wait a minute i want to buy a cigar mr dixon dove into a cigar store and emerged with one in his mouth soon they reached the boarding house it was a fivestory brick building rather shabby outwardly cornelius opened the door with a night key and bade herbert follow so he did up to the fifth floor where his guide opened a door and admitted him into a room about ten feet square in a bad state of disorder in the corner was a bed not very inviting in appearance it looked very different from the neat little bed which herbert slept in at home the furniture was of hair and had evidently seen better days there were two chairs both of them covered with portions of mr dixons wardrobe cornelius cleared off one and invited herbert to be seated this is my den he said den seemed to be the right word though herbert did not say so he wondered why a man with so large an income did not live better you can brush your hair if you want to said cornelius the supper bell will ring right off ill take you down with me will there be room asked herbert oh yes ill arrange about that if you like you can room with me and i guess i can fix it so you neednt pay more than four dollars a week getting your lunch outside i wish you would said herbert who felt that dirty as the room was it would be more like home to him than where he was wholly unacquainted at the table below herbert found a seat next to cornelius there were other clerks at the table whom mr dixon knew also two or three married couples and two extra ladies that lady is an actress whispered cornelius pointing to a rather faded woman of about thirty on the opposite side of the table is she returned herbert examining her with considerable curiosity where does she play at the olympic said mr dixon she is rosalie vernon thats a pretty name its only her stage name her real name is brown did you ever see her play often shes good she looks very quiet she dont say much here but on the stage she has enough to say for herself do you see that man with gray hair and spectacles yes hes an italian count he lost his property somehow and is obliged to give lessons in french and italian quite a comedown isnt it in the evening he discussed his plans with cornelius cant i get more than two dollars a week in a store he asked i am afraid not though you might stumble on a place where they would give three even that would not be enough to live upon i must make that at any rate and i hoped to be able to save something there are some newsboys who make a dollar a day suggested cornelius a dollar a day thats six dollars a week exactly do you think i could go into that of course you can if youve got money enough to buy a stock of papers to start with youll be your own boss then theres bootblacking but that aint genteel i should prefer selling papers then youd better try it ive spoken to the landlady and shell take you for four dollars a week herbert closed the day in good spirits he thought he saw his way clear to supporting himself in the city before he went to bed he wrote a cheerful letter to his mother and deposited it in a post office box at the corner chapter xxxiii herbert as a newsboy the next morning by advice of his roommate herbert got up early and made his way downtown and obtained a supply of morning papers the first day was not a success chiefly on account of his inexperience he was stuck on nearly half his papers and the profits were less than nothing but herbert was quick to learn the second day though he still had some papers left he cleared twentyfive cents the third day he netted seventyfive he felt now that he had passed the period of experiment and that he would at any rate be able to pay his board of course he hoped for something better and indeed felt confident of it three weeks later about eleven oclock in the forenoon as he stood in front of the astor house with his last paper in his hand he heard his name called hello carter are you here he did not need to turn around to recognize james leech goodmorning james he said politely so youre a newsboy said james yes any way to make a living do you make much inquired his old foe curiously i havent made enough to retire upon yet but i can manage to pay my board how much do you pay for your board herbert hesitated about gratifying his curiosity but finally did so four dollars repeated james scornfully it cant be much of a boarding house an italian count boards there said herbert knowing james respect for rank you dont say so returned james rather impressed did he ever speak to you he spoke to me this morning what did he say will you pass ze butter do you save up any money inquired james herbert penetrated his motive in asking the question and did not mean to give too definite information but james was bent on learning all he could how much do you make a day he asked sometimes more sometimes less just as it happens i cant tell anything from that why do you want to know asked herbert pointedly curiosity i suppose so i thought if it was from interest in me i would tell you but i dont care to gratify your curiosity you dont expect me to feel any interest in a common newsboy do you no i dont i know you too well for that i dont see what object you have in refusing to answer my questions if you are thinking of going into the business yourself ill tell you i a newsboy i sell papers in the street you must be crazy returned james haughtily i suppose you feel above it said herbert smiling to be sure i do havent i a right to oh you must settle that question for yourself papers sir the gentleman addressed purchased the last remaining paper and herbert was free till afternoon how do you like the city asked james very much i should like to have my mother here then i would be contented we may come to live here said james of course we shall live in a brownstone front uptown i live in a brick house said herbert smiling fashionable people live in brownstone fronts i may be rich some time then youll have to go into some other business but there isnt much hope for you youll be a poor man you seem very confident of it youve got no chance you know but i must be going who do you think i met this morning father asked james later in the day i dont know the carter boy where did you meet him he was selling papers in front of the astor house he wont get rich very fast in that business what did he have to say for himself he wouldnt tell me how much money he was making he pays four dollars a week for board he probably finds it hard to pay that it isnt likely he lays up anything he would do better to stay in wrayburn then you think he cant send any money to his mother no he will find it hard to pay his own expenses then she wont be able to pay the interest on the mortgage i dont see how she can and you will seize the house i fully intend to do so good thatll bring down carters pride hes as cheeky as ever he hasnt much to be proud of that dont seem to make any difference with him he talks as if he were my equal that dont make him so when are you going to move to the city father i dont know said the squire shortly ive got tired of wrayburn youll have to stay there till my business will allow me to move the fact was squire leech had just had an unsatisfactory interview with mr andrew temple under the advice of that gentleman he had invested a very considerable sum of money in some mining shares in the assurance that he would be able in a very short time to sell at a large profit but from the time he bought they began to drop he asked an explanation of mr temple my dear sir said the financier theres no being sure of the market so many trivial circumstances affect it that the wisest of us cannot absolutely predict anything we can only calculate probabilities you told me there was no doubt about the stock rising grumbled the squire nor is there any if you only have patience to wait rome was not built in a day you know it seems to me there is a good deal of uncertainty and risk in these stock operations objected the squire very sensibly not under discreet guidance if you only have pluck and patience you are morally sure of a fortune in the end fortunes are made every day why theres old jenkins a grocer on sixth avenue youve heard of his luck havent you no made fifty thousand dollars in six months from an original investment of ten thousand at first things went against him but he was bound to see the thing through and he did and hes forty thousand better off for it what did he invest in asked the squire eagerly mr temple told him but i regret to say that the whole thing was a fiction intended to encourage his dupe he succeeded in influencing the squire to put another large sum into his hands and sent him away hopeful to raise this sum squire leech was obliged to sell or mortgage most of his real estate to parties whom mr temple found for him the prices realized were less than his valuation of the property but temple told him this was not so important as he was sure to double his money in twelve months by investments in wall street so squire leech gave himself up to dreams of sudden wealth he subscribed for two financial papers and spent many hours in studying their columns he was soon able to talk glibly of stocks and bonds and the wrayburn people thought he was on the high road to becoming a millionaire depend upon it the squires a longheaded man said old tom cooper in the village tavern it wouldnt surprise me a mite if he died worth a million chapter xxxiv herberts legacy the weeks slipped rapidly away herbert succeeded in maintaining himself at his new business and never failed to have ready the four dollars which he had agreed to pay for board it was lucky he did for he soon found that there would be no chance of borrowing from his roommate cornelius was always hard up as he only paid a dollar more board than herbert the latter wondered what he did with his twenty dollars a week but the fact was mr dixon at present received but half that sum though pride induced him to represent otherwise and what i ask are ten dollars a week to a young man of fashionable tastes no wonder he was always short of funds how could it be otherwise of course it was satisfactory to herbert to feel that he was paying his way but still he had a source of anxiety he felt that he ought indeed it was absolutely necessary to contribute to his mothers support moreover the dreaded day on which the semiannual interest came due was now close at hand so far as he could judge his mother would have nothing to meet it it seemed inevitable that she should submit to the squires demand and sacrifice the house it was a sad thing to think of yet there was this consolation the three or four hundred dollars cash which the squire would pay would tide over the next year or two until herbert was older and could earn more but after all was it certain that he would earn more could he sell more papers two years hence than now that was hardly likely if he wanted to advance his income it must be in some other business yet to a boy situated as he was there was little chance of getting any employment that would make as good immediate returns as selling papers so thinking over these things our hero was much perplexed and could see no way out of the difficulty he had never read david copperfield and had not accustomed himself to expecting something to turn up he was sensible enough indeed to know that it is idle to wait for such chances yet when one does his duty faithfully things will occasionally turn up and this was precisely what happened to herbert he was standing at his accustomed post one day when a pleasantlooking gentleman of fifty or perhaps a little more accosted him inquiring for a particular morning paper i havent got it sir but i will get you one said herbert will you be long no sir i know where i can get one at once very well then i will wait here till you return herbert was as good as his word as the gentleman paid him he asked pleasantly how is business my young friend pretty good sir can you make money enough to support yourself yes sir then i suppose you are contented i should be sir if i had only myself to look after you havent a wife and family i presume said the gentleman smiling herbert laughed i hope not yet sir he answered but i have a mother whom i ought to assist and you cannot i have not been able to yet it takes all i can earn to pay my own expenses does your mother live in the city no sir in the town of wrayburn fifty or sixty miles from here wrayburn repeated the gentleman in surprise yes sir it is a small village i dare say you never heard of it but i have heard of it my son passed a few weeks there during the last summer it was herberts turn to be surprised he examined the gentlemans face attentively and it dawned upon him who he was are you mr cameron he asked how is it that you know me inquired the other my name is herbert carter i was employed to read to your son have you heard from him we are expecting a letter daily but the distance is considerable and we may have to wait for some time yet so you are herbert carter yes sir my son was very much interested in you he has spoken often of you he was very kind to me your father was an inventor that was not his business but he devoted his leisure to invention my son placed in my hands for examination a model of his just before he went away have you examined it what do you think of it sir asked herbert eagerly i only recently returned from europe and have not thoroughly examined it so far as i have done so i am inclined to think favorably of it herberts heart bounded with hope do you think we can get anything for it he asked i think you can indeed if further examination bears out my first favorable impressions i will myself make you an offer for it i should be so glad for mothers sake exclaimed herbert my young friend said mr cameron i like your feeling toward your mother i sincerely hope i may be able to make you a satisfactory offer by the way how are you situated can you leave the city this afternoon yes sir then come home with me you shall be my guest for a week during that time we will examine and decide about the model thank you sir you are very kind said herbert hesitating what makes you hesitate i am afraid i dont look fit to visit a gentlemans family oh never mind that said mr cameron heartily we are plain people and dont value fine dress will there be time for me to go home first yes you can meet me two hours hence at the st nicholas hotel i occupy room on second thoughts you may as well wait for me in the reading room all right sir herbert hurried home arrayed himself in clean clothes put up a small bundle of necessary articles and in an hour and a half was at the hotel awaiting mr cameron he left a note for cornelius dixon explaining that he was called out of the city for a few days but would write soon he did not enter into details for he was not at all certain that things would turn out as he hoped mr cameron lived in a substantial country house with a fine garden attached nothing was wanting of comfort in his hospitable home but he avoided show and ostentation to herbert was assigned a large wellfurnished chamber the best he had ever occupied and he was made to feel at home the next day he accompanied mr cameron to the manufactory which he found to be a scene of busy industry employing three hundred hands i shall be busy today but tonight i will look at your fathers model said the manufacturer probably it will be three or four days before i can come to any decision herbert passed his time pleasantly for the next three or four days yet he could not avoid feeling anxious interest day was close at hand and his hopes might end in failure on the fourth day mr cameron said to him well herbert i have made up my mind about your fathers invention herberts suspense was great his heart almost stopped beating the manufacturer went on i consider it practicable and am disposed to make you an offer for it are you authorized to conclude terms my mother will agree to anything i propose sir then this is my offer the model must be patented at once i will see to that then make over to me half the invention and i will agree to pay you and your mother one thousand dollars a year for the next ten years are you in earnest gasped herbert entirely so said mr cameron will that satisfy you i would have accepted a quarter of the sum you offer sir better not tell me that said mr cameron smiling i might take advantage of it will you consider it a bargain then oh how happy my mother will be said herbert dont you want to go home and carry the news i should like to very much then his countenance changed two days hence as he reflected the interest would be payable must they lose the house after all if only he had a small part of the money it would make matters all right does anything trouble you asked the manufacturer noticing the sudden change in his countenance upon this herbert told him exactly how they were situated in regard to the house and in what danger they were of losing it if its nothing worse that that said mr cameron i cheerfully you neednt feel anxious i will advance you a hundred dollars on account of the contract and you shall give me a receipt for it herberts face cleared instantly and he was warm in his gratitude the next morning he started for home after all the little model which his father left behind had proved to be his most valuable legacy chapter xxxv herberts return mrs carter was setting the table for her solitary supper she had been very lonely since herbert went away the days seemed doubly long most of all she missed him at mealtime he kept her informed of all that was going on in the village and when there was no news to tell he talked over their plans for the future life seemed very dull and monotonous without him yet the poor mother always wrote cheerfully for she did not want to damp his courage or interfere with the plan of life he had formed she felt that there was nothing for him to do in wrayburn and since she could not go to him they must be content to live apart for the present i wish i could see my boy she sighed as she poured out her solitary cup of tea and tried to force down a few mouthfuls of toast shall we ever be able to live together again there was a noise at the outer door a quick step was heard and herbert rushed in nearly upsetting the table in his impetuosity as he embraced his mother are you glad to see me mother he asked you dont know how i have longed to see you was the heartfelt reply she did not ask what brought him home nor care to ask just yet she was too happy in having him back you dont ask for my news mother said herbert after a pause is it good news she asked wistfully suppose i should tell you that mr camerons father has agreed to pay two hundred dollars for fathers model has he really asked mrs carter her face lighting up he has bought it that is half of it but he is to pay more than that more than two hundred dollars herbert more than three hundred what do you think of that are you in earnest herbert quite in earnest mother only it is better than a dream you mustnt be too much excited mother when you hear the whole i will only say that we shant have to pinch any more or lie awake thinking how to ward off starvation and can we be together again herbert you dont know how lonely it is without you poor mother how lonesome it must have been yes we can be together again if you think a thousand dollars a year will pay our expenses a thousand dollars a year exclaimed mrs carter thinking that herbert was bereft of his senses it cant be that your fathers invention is worth as much as that mr cameron has offered that for half the invention and i have agreed to sell to him i supposed you would not object object i did not dream of getting onetenth as much it seems to me like a dream it is a happy dream mother and a true one father little thought what a handsome legacy he was leaving us when he left us that model how happy it would have made him had he known it before he died tell me how it all happened so herbert had to tell his mother about his fortunate meeting with mr cameron and what resulted from it mr cameron is a very honorable man he concluded for he might easily have offered onequarter as much and i should have agreed to it now mother let me tell you my plans for the future in the first place are you willing to leave wrayburn i am willing to live anywhere if we are together mr cameron proposed to me to accept a clerkship in his office but for the present i told him i wished to make up the deficiencies in my education in the town where he lives there is a flourishing academy i propose that we move there and i spend the next two years in study we shall have a competent income more than enough to support us and so i can afford the time i fully approve of your proposal herbert we may sometime lose our money but a good education never i was sure you would agree with me shall we have any difficulty in finding a house of suitable size i inquired about that there is a very pretty cottage just vacated not far from the academy i find we can have it at a moderate rent i have already got the refusal of it and will write at once that we will hire it and what shall we do with this house we wont sell it to squire leech at a sacrifice that is one thing certain by the way day after tomorrow is the day for paying the interest yes i have been troubling myself about it there is no occasion i have a hundred dollars in my pocket given me on account by mr cameron so the squire is checkmated but mother i have a favor to ask of you what is that for two days keep secret our good fortune why herbert i want the squire to be deceived to think the place is in his grasp and realize that there is many a slip between the cup and the lip what shall i say to the neighbors if they ask why you have got home say that i am not going back to new york that i couldnt earn enough there to save anything i will do as you think best herbert but i am afraid that my joy at the good news you have brought will betray me it will be attributed to your joy in having me back well keep things secret for a day or two thats all after supper herbert walked out he was popular in the village and received many cordial greetings to the inevitable inquiries he replied as he had suggested to his mother presently he met james leech he smiled to himself as he saw james advancing to meet him but assumed a sober downcast look hello carter have you got back said james yes got tired of new york i should like new york well enough if i could make enough money there then youre not going back asked james in a tone of satisfaction not at present i thought youd be coming back said james in a tone of triumph what made you think so i knew you couldnt get along there i supported myself while i was there but you didnt make anything over no then you might as well be back i dont know i am not sure of doing that in wrayburn i dont think i shall stay in wrayburn long father talks of moving to new york said james in a burst of confidence what do you expect to do here do you think your father would give me work asked herbert demurely i dont know he might if you agreed to sell the house we may if we can get enough for it youll have to anyway you must be very poor weve got a little money well ill mention your case to father im sorry for you but i knew beforehand you wouldnt succeed in new york herbert smiled quietly as james walked away hell be astonished when he hears the truth thought he chapter xxxvi conclusion james repeated to his father what herbert had told him and the squire jumped to the conclusion that herbert and his mother were in his power and must accede to his demand he decided to take advantage of their necessities and allow only three hundred dollars for the house he entered the little house with the air of a proprietor i suppose you know my errand mrs carter he said pompously i believe this is interest day returned the widow yes i presume you have by this time seen the folly of holding on to the place you cant afford it and it is best to accept my offer my mother and i have thought it over and decided to sell said herbert i am glad you are so sensible observed squire leech in a tone of satisfaction i will give you three hundred dollars over and above the mortgage you offered us fifty dollars more before then is not now you should have accepted my offer when i made it we have no idea of selling at that price said herbert our lowest price is six hundred and fifty dollars over and above the mortgage are you crazy ejaculated the squire angrily no we have fixed upon that as a fair price said herbert coolly you know you cant get it then we wont sell young man i apprehend you do not understand how the matter stands you will have to sell why must we you cant live on nothing of course not you have made a failure in new york i made my expenses while i was there then why didnt you stay i wanted to do something for mothers support you have altogether too high an idea of your own abilities i hope not sir you influence your mother to her harm i dont think so squire leech but in this case you must yield you cant expect me to wait for my money do you mean the interest of course i do we shall not ask you to wait i am ready to pay it the squire stared in discomfiture while herbert drew out the precise sum needed to pay the interest where did you get that money he inquired chopfallen honestly squire leech will you give me a receipt the squire did so mechanically i will give you the three hundred and fifty dollars he said but you must accept it today or it is withdrawn neither today nor any other day will it be accepted squire leech said herbert firmly if you choose to pay six hundred and fifty we will sell you must think i am crazy no sir it is a fair offer if you dont want to buy we will make another offer we will rent the house for ninety dollars a year that is the interest on fifteen hundred dollars at six per cent i believe a man in your employ wishes to live here where do you propose to live asked squire leech in surprise we are going to leave town have you got a chance to work outside yes but i have declined to i am going to school for two years to an academy but how are you going to live all this time inquired the squire in amazement i shall live on my income answered herbert smiling income have you had a legacy yes from whom i thought you only got a trunk of old clothes from your uncle my legacy comes from my father but he died poor he left behind him an invention half of which we have sold for an income of a thousand dollars a year a thousand a year ejaculated the squire yes i have sold it to the father of mr cameron who employed me last summer you see there is no occasion for our selling the house you have been very fortunate said squire leech soberly i congratulate you both thank you said herbert who privately thought their visitor looked excessively annoyed at their good fortune i will see you about the house he said as he rose to go well the squire congratulated us said herbert after he went away but he didnt look happy when he did so i shouldnt wonder if he accepted our terms now that he knows we neednt sell herbert proved to be right two days later the squire offered six hundred dollars over the mortgage for the place and it was accepted the place is worth more mother he said but it will relieve us from care to sell it james was even more annoyed than his father when he heard of herberts good fortune but after his first annoyance he showed a disposition to be friendly it is the way of the world nothing makes us sought after like a little good fortune james felt that now herbert was in a position to live without work he was a gentleman and to be treated accordingly herbert received his overtures politely but rated them at their real value two years slipped away herbert has finished his course at the academy and is about to enter the manufactory as an office clerk mr cameron means to promote him as he merits and i should not be at all surprised if our young friend eventually became junior partner he and his mother have bought the house into which they moved and have done not a little to convert it into a tasteful home the invention has proved all that mr cameron hoped for it it has been widely introduced and herbert realizes as much from his own half as mr cameron agreed to pay for that which he purchased so his fathers invention has proved to be herbert carters most valuable legacy squire leech has been unfortunate too late he found that andrew temple had deceived and defrauded him all his large property except a few thousand dollars has been swept away and james disappointed in his lofty hopes last week applied to herbert to use his influence to obtain him a situation in mr camerons establishment there was no vacancy there but our hero has found him a place in a drygoods store in the same town whether he will keep it remains to be seen times have changed since james looked upon herbert as far beneath him now he is glad to be acknowledged as his companion if james profits by his altered circumstances the loss of his fathers property may not prove so much of a misfortune after all for wealth is far from being the greatest earthly good for our young friend herbert we may confidently indulge in cheerful anticipations he has undergone the discipline of poverty and privation and prosperity is not likely to spoil him he has done his duty under difficult circumstances and now he reaps the reward the end
