was after nine oclock now and all the shops were open there were lots of people and cars and he had to drive slowly he took the road to the north and was through the town in half an hour not bad he thought ill get to birmingham by lunchtime as peter looked out ahead he saw a boy standing by the side of the road it was difficult to see in the rain but the boy looked about sixteen he was wearing a red jersey and jeans he was hitchhiking and was holding out his hand to ask for a lift peter slowed down and stopped the boy ran up and opened the door where are you going the boy asked manchester

peter in a kind voice well you see john began my parents are dead and i live with my uncle peter interrupted the boy in bristol yes thats right said john my uncle has always been kind to me but he never lets me do anything what do you mean asked peter the boy pushed back his chair well he never lets me go out in the evenings peter nodded why not oh the boy said he says that i must stay in and study instead he makes me stay in and study every night while my friends are out enjoying themselves i see said peter as he drank his tea thats why you ran away is it john shook his head not really it was because of what happened last night what did happen asked peter watching the boys face closely i told my uncle that i wanted to go to the cinema with some of my friends john explained but my uncle wouldnt let me go and told me to study instead yes said peter encouraging the boy to continue his story when he wasnt looking i ran out and went to the cinema with my friends when i came back my uncle was waiting for me he was very very angry and asked me where i had been i told him id been to the cinema when i told him that id been to the cinema my uncle hit me in the face john paused to drink his tea does he often hit you asked peter when he gets angry last night he hit me very hard and i got angry and hit him back replied john peters face was serious what did your uncle do then he asked nothing you see i must have hit him very hard because he fell on the floor and didnt move john stopped speaking and looked at the table what did you do then asked peter quietly i was john hesitated i was afraid and so i ran out where did you go inquired peter i cant remember when i came back an hour later there were several police cars outside the house all the lights in the house were switched on then a policeman came out of the house and saw me there he is he shouted and ran after me i ran away and the policeman didnt catch me i slept in the bus station and started hitchhiking early this morning well said peter you certainly had a busy night why did you run away from the police because they wanted to catch me and put me in prison answered john but why do you think they wanted to put

heres ninety pence said peter handing john the money can you go and get two more teas john went to get the tea there were a lot of people in the cafe and he had to wait peter picked up a newspaper which someone had left on the table peter looked at the front page man found dead the body of mr robert stevens was found in his home at devonshire road bristol last night there must have been a fight because a lot of furniture was broken nothing has been stolen police are looking for mr stevens nephew john stevens aged who lived with him when peter had read this he quickly put the newspaper in his pocket a minute later john returned with the tea was there anything interesting in the paper john asked no said peter drink up your tea because we must leave as soon as possible they finished their tea quickly and walked out to the lorry peter started the engine and drove off it had stopped raining and the sun was shining it was now warm inside the lorry and john began to feel sleepy if you want to sleep peter said you can get into the back the lorrys not quite full and theres an old coat of mine there you can lie on thanks said john that would be good peter stopped the lorry and john got into the back they drove off again peter drove as fast as he could in order to make up for lost time there were only a few cars and soon the lorry was near tewkesbury suddenly peter saw a police car stopped on the road ahead as he drove closer a policeman walked out in front of the lorry and held his hand up chapter three the lorry is stopped the policeman held his hand up peter slowed the lorry down and stopped the policeman walked up to the side window what is it asked peter whats the matter were looking for a boy who we think may have killed his uncle replied the policeman oh yes said peter i heard the news about it on the radio this morning well continued the policeman we think the boy has left bristol and he may be hitchhiking north is he dangerous asked peter very dangerous he killed his uncle with a chair leg the policeman added what does he look like asked peter the policeman took out his notebook and read john stevens aged brown hair brown eyes average height last seen wearing a red jersey and blue jeans the policeman looked up from his book have you seen him he asked peter yes said peter ive seen hundreds of young men dressed like that this morning it could have been any of them ok said the policeman thanks for your help if you do see him let us know wont you of course replied peter and started the engine cheerio shouted the policeman just a minute said another voice the policeman turned around another policeman was getting out of the police car he was big and redfaced and had a nasty voice what is it now asked peter ive got to be in manchester before five oclock all right this wont take long said the second policeman were going to search your lorry why asked peter angrily the boy may be hiding there both policemen walked around to the back of the lorry what shall i do now thought peter i could drive off before they look in the back but if i do drive away theyll drive after me and their car is much faster than my lorry what shall i do sit here and wait if they find john i can say that i didnt know he was in my lorry hey you shouted one of the policemen theyve found him thought peter hey you come and help us open the back of your lorry right shouted peter and got out if im there when they find john he thought perhaps i can give him a chance to escape by getting in the policemens way peter walked around to the back of the lorry and opened it for the policemen they looked in all they could see was a lot of boxes and in one corner some old coats on the floor right said the second policeman im sorry to have made you wait so long you can go now peter thanked him got into the lorry and drove off he drove for ten minutes until he was sure that the police car was not following him then he stopped jumped out and ran around to the back of the lorry he opened it and looked in he couldnt see john anywhere peter climbed into the back he couldnt understand where john was the old coat was there but john wasnt lying on it then peter saw something that the police hadnt noticed he could see part of a shoe sticking out from under the coat peter smiled when he thought how stupid the police were not to have looked under the coat he went up to the coat and said loudly this is the police come out at once we know you are under the coat all right said a voice from under the coat and john slowly got up oh its you said john i thought you were the police no replied peter i was just playing a joke on you you did frighten me said john i had a strange dream when i was asleep what exclaimed peter have you been asleep all the time yes i dreamt the police were searching the lorry that wasnt a dream replied peter it was real you mean that the police stopped the lorry when i was asleep asked john peter nodded his head yes he said and you didnt tell them where i was asked john no said peter but why did you help me asked john you could have got into trouble yourself because i dont think you did what the police said answered peter what has my uncle told them asked john your uncle hasnt told them anything well in that case said john because hes dead said peter quietly oh no cried john i didnt hit him very hard if you hit someone with a chair leg continued peter you dont have to hit them very hard to kill them a chair leg replied john in surprise i didnt hit him with a chair leg i hit him with my hands peter took the newspaper out of his pocket and showed john the article about the murder are you sure asked peter yes said john firmly then i was right not to tell the police about you said peter wed better start

before asked peter no i havent said john well this is what well do ive got to take my load of biscuits to this address he gave john a piece of paper itll take me an hour or two to unload everything and then im going to go and see some friends why are you going to go and see some friends asked john i thought you were going to help me find out who killed my uncle i am going to replied peter when i was younger i had a lot of friends in bristol we used to meet a lot and sometimes we did stupid things what do you mean stupid things john didnt understand oh fighting breaking windows borrowing cars explained peter john interrupted borrowing cars peter smiled well taking them for an evening driving around and then leaving them did you do that asked john looking surprised we had nothing else to do peter continued it was fun for a time not for the people whose cars you took john added thats true peter agreed anyway after a while i stopped seeing those friends why asked john because they started stealing cars and selling them explained peter john nodded his head i understand peter went on soon after that they were caught by the police what did the police do asked john they sent my friends to prison said peter john looked at peter im sure that stopped them stealing not really said peter shaking his head because in prison they met older men who taught them a lot about stealing what happened when they left prison inquired john they came to live in manchester answered peter and im afraid that theyve continued to steal things but how does this help me asked john when ive finished unloading the lorry im going to try to find some of these old friends said peter as theyve been in prison they know lots of criminals lots of people who make a living by stealing criminals always talk to each other about things like your uncles murder my friends may have heard something about it something which the police may not know john smiled i understand now he said they may be able to tell us something useful something to help us find out who killed my uncle peter stopped the lorry outside the shop where he was going to unload the biscuits right said peter look were here now why dont you go to a cafe or the cinema the police wont be looking for you in manchester ill meet you here outside the shop at ten oclock cant i come with you asked john no peter replied my friends might not want to talk in front of you because they dont know you ok said john see you at ten oclock thanks so much for all your help you can thank me after weve found the murderer said peter peter and john jumped out of the lorry john walked off down the street and peter went into the shop where he had to unload the biscuits he helped the men from the shop to carry the biscuits into the back of the shop and counted all the boxes then he got the manager to sign the papers to show that the shop had received all the boxes by this time it was half past six peter knew he had to hurry if he was going to help john he parked the lorry on a piece of open ground and started walking he walked quickly with his hands in his pockets and had soon left the shopping streets behind him it was already getting dark and the street lights were on peter crossed a busy main road and continued walking as fast as he could the houses here were smaller and older the roads were narrower and children were playing under the street lights here and there peter could see small areas of open ground covered with broken bottles old cars and empty tins peter hurried on and soon came to a cafe on the corner of one of the streets the sign outside said cosy cafe peter looked in the window and then went in he asked for a cup of tea and sat down the cafe was almost empty an old man sat in one corner reading a newspaper at the next table to peter sat a man of about twentyfive smoking a cigarette peter drank some tea and then went over to talk to the owner of the cafe who was washing up dirty cups and saucers good evening said peter yes the cafe owner replied what can i do for you im looking for an old friend said peter he used to live near here oh yes i might know him said the cafe owner without looking up from his washing up whats his name jeff jeff beck said peter quietly the cafe owner dropped the cup he was holding it broke on the floor no mister said the cafe owner i dont know anyone of that name you must have made a mistake are you sure asked peter going up close to the cafe owner i think you do know him look i said i didnt i dont like people asking questions why dont you go and ask someone else the cafe owner shouted go on get out ok said peter thank you for your help peter left the cafe and started to walk along the street excuse me can you tell me the time said a voice from behind peter turned round it was the man who had been sitting next to him in the cafe of course said peter and looked at his watch as he did so the man caught hold of peters hair and twisted his head back peter felt the cold steel of a knife against his throat now were going to see whether you really do know jeff or whether youre from the police the man said chapter five a visit to the cinema when john got out of the lorry he watched peter go into the shop then john started to walk slowly along the pavement he had never been to manchester before and he didnt know where to go or what to do people pushed past him as they hurried home from work everyone had somewhere to go or something to do except him he started looking in the shop windows so that people wouldnt see that he was lonely after a while he came to a cinema john went up to the cinema and looked at the photographs outside there was a cowboy film showing john noticed that there were other people standing looking at the photographs if i stand here he thought no one will notice me theyll think im waiting to go to the cinema or to meet someone soon he had looked at all the photographs several times so he stood watching the people go past there were several other people standing outside the cinema as well a man wearing a suit who kept on looking at his watch a small group of girls who were laughing together a girl of about sixteen who seemed worried about something a mother with two small children and lots of parcels two boys of about johns age smoking cigarettes and trying to look very grownup and an old man with a long coat more people came and waited for a while and then went into the cinema a small fat man came hurrying up to the woman with the children kissed her and picked up one of the children the woman picked up the other child and with parcels and children in their arms they rushed off together the group of girls finally decided to go into the cinema a taxi stopped and a pretty girl came running up to the man in the suit who had been looking at his watch she said she was sorry she was late and they went off happily together in the taxi the two boys put out their cigarettes and went into the cinema the old man walked off down the street slowly looking in all the shop windows the only people left waiting outside the cinema were john and the girl who was looking worried john looked at the clock outside the cinema entrance it was seventhirty the film had started at sevenfifteen john looked at the girl she was thin quite tall and had short brown hair she looked about the same age as john she was walking up and down with an angry look on her face she looks quite nice thought john i wonder what she would do if i asked her to go to the cinema with me i expect shes waiting for someone but shes been waiting for a long time now perhaps the person shes waiting for isnt going to come shall i go and ask her to go into the cinema with me what if she laughs at me what if she calls a policeman as he was thinking this john looked up to his surprise he saw that the girl was not the only other person there there was a man standing outside the cinema as well a policeman john stood quite still he wasnt sure what to do if he walked away perhaps the policeman would stop him and ask him questions if he stood there perhaps the policeman would ask him why he was waiting the policeman looked at john john looked away and pretended to look at the photographs after a minute john looked back at the policeman he was still staring at him then the policeman started to walk towards him well john thought theres only one thing to do now i must talk to the girl so that the policeman will think i live here john walked up to the girl and said hello hello the girl said in reply there was a silence do you want to go in and see the film with me john asked suddenly i dont know the girl replied looking surprised im waiting for my boyfriend but ive been waiting for half an hour and he hasnt come yet perhaps he wont come said john quickly perhaps he has taken another girl to the cinema instead the girl smiled well if hes done that she said ill come in with you but he may just be late and hell be angry if he gets here and doesnt find me the policeman came closer john took hold of the girls hand come on he said to her the films already started all right then the girl replied but i hope steve doesnt get angry whos steve asked john my boyfriend she replied as they went up to buy tickets oh dont worry about him said john feeling very happy because he had escaped from the policeman your boyfriend will never know you went into the cinema with me will he john turned to the ticket office and asked for two seats at the back thats six pounds sixty please said the woman selling the tickets john gave her the money whats your name he asked turning to the girl susan she replied whats your name john he said with a smile he took her hand and they went into the cinema together the film had already started and it was dark inside they found two seats at the back and sat down susan squeezed johns hand i like you she said to him youre nice chapter six the cabaret club the man holding the knife pushed peter and said come on all right said peter ill go with you jeffs a friend of mine and hell be angry with you if you hurt me come on then repeated the man lets go they walked along the dark street the man with the knife walked just behind peter at the corner a big car was parked stop here the man said and opened the door of the car get in dont try to escape or do anything stupid the man started the engine and drove very fast through the narrow dark streets after only five minutes the car stopped outside a big house there was a sign outside the house which said cabaret club there were lots of cars parked in front of the house get out the man said peter got out of the car and stood on the pavement this way said the man pushing peter towards the front door peter could hear music coming from the house the man rang the bell and a little window in the door opened a mans face appeared in the window what do you want asked the face its me said the man from the cafe ive brought someone who says that hes a friend of jeff jeffs in the back room the man at the door replied and opened the door to let them in the man from the cafe took peter through the hall and stopped outside a door at the end of the corridor peter looked around the rooms on each side of the hall were full of people drinking talking and playing cards the man with peter knocked at the door and pushed peter into the room it was a small room full of smoke three men were sitting around a table playing cards one of the men turned around and looked at peter it was jeff well look who has come to visit us jeff said in a surprised voice then jeff turned to the man who had brought peter from the cafe and asked why did you bring peter here well boss the man replied he said he was a friend of yours but i thought he was from the police well youre wrong said jeff peter is a friend of mine and i hope you didnt hurt him peter smiled because he was pleased that jeff remembered him ok said jeff all of you get out i want to talk to my old friend peter the others left the room and peter and jeff were alone well jeff said peter sitting down you havent changed much perhaps not replied jeff but im much richer now i own this club peter grinned so youve stopped stealing and started working honestly jeff laughed well not exactly you could say that i control the people who do the stealing i sell the things which they steal the club makes it very easy for me to do this because lots of people come here every day anyway peter said i didnt come here for lessons about being a successful criminal i need your help why asked jeff peter told jeff the whole story that peter had given john a lift that the police thought that john had killed his uncle but that john said that he hadnt killed him i dont think john did kill his uncle peter continued but how can we prove it there is only one way replied jeff youll have to find the murderer but i dont know how to start have you heard anyone talking about the murder peter asked no answered jeff but if you can wait for a few minutes ill go and ask some of my friends if they know anything about it make yourself at home while you are waiting after jeff had left peter got up and went out into the hall he looked into the big room where the music was coming from a man was singing some girls were dancing and people were talking and laughing it was quite dark and very hot peter felt thirsty he asked for a drink and a waiter brought it peter tried to pay for the drink but the waiter refused to take the money youre a friend of jeffs the waiter said so you dont have to pay ten minutes later jeff came back well he said as he sat down i think i have some useful information peter nodded what is it he asked do you know who the murderer is jeff laughed of course not he said but i can give you the name of someone in bristol who may be able to help you whats his name peter asked bob steel hes a friend of mine bob lives by the river he knows more about what happens in bristol than the police do thank you very much said peter jeff gave peter a piece of paper heres bobs address he said and a note to say that youre a friend of mine bob will help you find the murderer peter stood up thank you again but i must go now he said to jeff i must get back to bristol as soon as possible right replied jeff it was nice to see you again and if you ever want another job come and see me no thank you said peter with a laugh i dont think id be a very good thief jeff walked out to the door with peter and told the man at the door to drive peter back to his lorry in the big car peter got into the car and the car drove off fast down the street chapter seven john learns a lesson meanwhile john and susan were sitting in the cinema they were sitting close together and john had his arm around susan the film wasnt very good but they were both enjoying it then the film stopped and the lights came on it was the interval john turned to susan and said im very thirsty would you like a cola yes please she replied john stood up stay here he said and ill go and get you one john walked to the end of the row of seats where they were sitting and up to the girl who was selling drinks and icecreams yes what do you want asked the girl with a smile two colas please replied john there you are thats one pound twenty please the girl said john gave the money to the girl and started to walk back to susan then he stopped he could see that susan was talking to another boy she was arguing with him the boy seemed very angry john heard susan say to the boy its your own fault you were late now go away and leave me alone the boy didnt reply he turned around and walked towards john the boy bumped into john knocking one of the bottles of cola on the ground hey what do you think youre doing said john angrily you had better leave my girl alone answered the boy or ill do more than just push you john picked up the bottle from the floor and went back to susan who was that john asked susan it was my boyfriend steve susan replied hes angry with me because i didnt wait for him outside the cinema what did your boyfriend say john asked as he passed susan one of the bottles susan had a drink steve told me to come and sit with him she said john nodded and what did you say he asked i told steve to go away and leave us alone i told steve that i was a free person and didnt belong to him i said that he didnt own me and that i can do what i like and anyway she added i like you much more than him john smiled i certainly like you much more than i like steve he said just then the lights went out and the film started again john put his arm around susan give me a kiss he whispered to her she did please be careful she whispered suddenly if steve sees us hell be very angry john looked around just in time to see steve walking out of the door at the back of the cinema its all right said john steve has just left time passed very quickly for john and susan and soon the film finished and the lights came on look john said as they waited to leave the cinema i cant explain now but ive got to go back to bristol if you give me your address ill write to you when they got outside susan opened her bag wrote down her address and gave it to john while she was writing john looked at his watch it was quarter past ten but he had promised to meet peter at ten oclock i must go now susan john said ill write to you goodbye susan said and take care of yourself john gave her a quick kiss and started to walk back to the shop where he had said he would meet peter he walked quickly thinking of susan and the cinema suddenly a voice shouted hey you john stopped and turned around it was susans boyfriend steve where do you think youre going steve said loudly its nothing to do with you replied john and carried on walking oh yes it is shouted steve john could hear feet running up behind him he didnt turn around suddenly john felt a kick on the back of the leg he tried to run but fell over instead he lay on the ground and as he looked up he saw that steve was standing over him now well have a little talk said steve no we wont said john jumping up and pushing steve away then john looked around steve wasnt alone he had three friends with him steve came up to john and pushed him against the wall so he said you want to fight do you as he said each word he pushed john hard against the wall with his hand john felt lost what could he do there were four people against him and he was in a strange town were going to teach you a lesson said steve with a nasty laugh were going to teach you not to try to steal my girlfriend john began to feel afraid he knew that he must do something quickly suddenly he hit steve in the stomach and tried to run away but the other three boys caught him so youre frightened are you asked one of the boys you cant get away now said another were going to teach you a lesson said the third then one of the boys hit john hard in the face and another boy hit him in the stomach john fell on the ground he felt sick then steve came up and started to kick him john was going to scream when he suddenly heard a voice which he recognised leave him alone said the voice it was peter chapter eight river street leave him alone peter shouted steve stopped kicking john and turned around who are you steve asked and what do you want go away and mind your own business no i wont mind my own business said peter and hit steve hard knocking him back against the wall john seeing that the others were watching steve and peter fight jumped up and started to run this way shouted peter get into the car john ran over to the big black car which was standing by the pavement as john got in he looked back to see that peter had beaten steve steve and his friends were running away how did you know i was here john asked peter when he got into the car well talk about it later said peter john and peter sat in silence until the car stopped beside peters lorry peter thanked the driver and both peter and john got into the lorry peter started the engine and they drove back to bristol now said peter as they were leaving manchester tell me how you got into the fight john explained to peter about the cinema susan and steve i hope that fight taught you a lesson said peter dont yes i know replied john with a laugh dont steal other

drive back until tomorrow so i neednt go to work tomorrow well have all day tomorrow to find the murderer it was warm in the lorry john was tired after his days excitement so he soon went to sleep peter drove on and on through the night halfway to bristol they stopped at a cafe and had coffee and some sandwiches then they drove on again the big lorry was empty and so went faster than usual there were no cars and only a few lorries on the road they drove faster than peter had expected and it was still dark when they arrived in bristol wake up shouted peter were in bristol now john looked out of the window sleepily peter stopped the lorry you had better come to bridgwater with me he said it may not be safe for you to stay in bristol no dont be stupid replied john i can look after myself all right said peter with a smile do you want to get out here see you at lunchtime said john as he got out of the lorry but before peter had time to reply john jumped back into the lorry perhaps youre right john said ill come to bridgwater with you why did you change your mind so suddenly asked peter because i saw two policemen walking up as i was getting out of the lorry answered john john stayed with peter in bridgwater after their tiring night they both slept well peters mother was surprised to see john but peter explained that he was a friend in trouble he did not explain what the trouble was soon after twelve oclock the next day they drove back into bristol peter stopped the lorry outside a house close to the river i think this is it he said he took out the piece of paper which jeff had given him and looked at the address bob steel river street yes thats right number twelve river street was a small low house which hadnt been painted for a long time the windows

middle of the day the curtains were drawn in this room too the only light came from a small lamp on the table by the bed the bed was untidy and the sheets were very dirty the floor of the room was covered in old newspapers sit down said bob steel peter and john sat down and were able to look at bob steel in the light for the first time he was middleaged and quite short his hair was red and he

money and get out he said i tell you what ill do said peter quietly ill give you twenty pounds now and ill give you the rest when you tell me the name of the murderer bob steel was quiet for a minute he looked at john and thought for a moment he took the money then he smiled ok said bob steel lets arrange a place to meet how about under the clock at the railway station at half past three ill be able to tell you the name then well see you then said peter peter and john went out together when they were in the street peter turned angrily to john why dont you keep quiet peter said turning to john bob steel is our only chance you shouldnt shout at him or call him a liar i dont like him replied john and anyway he was trying to make you think that i am the murderer well find out who is the murderer at half past three said peter and they walked off down the street bob steel watched john and peter from his window he waited until they had gone then he went downstairs and over to the public telephone box across the street he dialled a number hello he said is that the police chapter ten john is arrested i must go to the post office said peter as he and john walked away from bob steels house why asked john i must get the eighty pounds to pay bob steel replied peter i see said john but do you think bob steel will meet us at the station at half past three i expect he will said peter unless you made him too angry do you want to come to the post office with me no thanks answered john i can look after myself ill go straight to the railway station and meet you there all right said peter do as you like see you at the station at half past three see you then said john then john walked off down the road towards the river he watched the ships unloading for a while then he walked back up the hill towards the station he went into the station and sat on a seat there were lots of people in the station and no one noticed him he watched the trains come and go the time passed quickly and looking at the station clock john saw to his surprise that it was already half past three he couldnt see either peter or bob steel john got up and walked over to the clock five minutes passed he began to wonder what had happened suddenly two men walked up to him i wonder what they want thought john perhaps they want to ask the way john stevens the first man said i am detective inspector shaw you are under arrest for the murder of your uncle they were policemen john looked around to see if he could escape but the second policeman put his hand on johns shoulder dont try to run away said the policeman youd better come with us the policemen took john outside the railway station where there was a police car waiting they put john into the back seat and detective inspector shaw got in beside him the other policeman got into the driving seat and started the car as they were driving off john looked back at the station and saw peter looking at the car why did you do it asked detective inspector shaw do what replied john kill your uncle said inspector shaw i didnt kill my uncle said john angrily oh yes you did said inspector shaw looking closely at john we know you did john did not reply when the police car arrived at the police station the policemen took john inside they put him in a small room with no window and told him to wait there there was no chair and john was soon tired of standing so he sat down on the floor a few minutes later inspector shaw came in he saw john sitting on the floor and told him to stand up john stood up are you going to tell us all about the murder now asked inspector shaw roughly john didnt reply he looked at the floor look at me boy shouted the policeman john looked up now tell me the truth said inspector shaw tell me why you killed your uncle i didnt started john i see interrupted inspector shaw so you want to be difficult do you inspector shaw went out of the room and banged the door john sat down again but as soon as he did so the door opened and he was told to stand up after about an hour another policeman came in smiled and said hello to john im sergeant black he said are you john yes john replied sergeant black brought two chairs and he and john sat down i expect youre thirsty said sergeant black would you like a cup of tea yes please said john with a smile he liked this policeman much more than inspector shaw sergeant black brought in two cups of tea and a plate of cakes now then said sergeant black kindly whats all this about john didnt reply you can trust me said sergeant black ill understand john liked sergeant black and he liked the tea so he started to answer the sergeants questions did you like your uncle asked the sergeant no said john slowly not very much where have you been for the last two days asked sergeant black ive been to john stopped just then there was a knock at the door sergeant black got up and went out john sat and thought for a minute i must be more careful he thought i nearly said that i had been to manchester that would get peter into trouble for helping me sergeant black still hadnt come back but john could hear his voice he went up to the door and listened sergeant black was talking to inspector shaw hes starting to talk now said sergeant black good replied inspector shaw hell tell you everything now john went back to his chair and sat down that was lucky he thought it had all been a trick to make him talk sergeant black and inspector shaw were working together sergeant black came back into the room now he said with a smile where were we oh yes you were just telling me that you had been to i dont remember now where was it you said you had been i havent been anywhere said john and im not telling you anything now dont be stupid said sergeant black if you didnt kill your uncle you havent got anything to be afraid of have you tell me all about it and ill see if i can help you john said nothing sergeant black tried asking more questions but john didnt reply after a while the sergeant put john in another room with a bed and locked the door can i have some food please john asked yes the policeman replied you can have some food when youve told us the truth chapter eleven peter finds bob steel peter looked at the police car as it drove away from the railway station he thought that he could see john inside the car peter looked again yes it was john the police had caught john at the railway station peter ran into the station and looked under the clock but there was no one there but where was bob steel perhaps bob steel had already left or perhaps he had seen the police and run away or perhaps bob steel had told the police that john would be waiting at the station at half past three peter turned around angrily and left the station peter went back to river street to collect his lorry he also wanted to talk to bob steel again he wanted to find out if bob steel had told the police about john and if he knew anything more about the murder when peter arrived at river street he was still feeling very angry peter banged on the front door of bobs home but there was no answer he waited for a moment and then banged again there was still no answer peter tried to look in the front windows but he couldnt see anything because the curtains were all closed he went around to the back of the house and banged on the back door there was no answer right thought peter if bob steel is at home hell have to go out at some time if hes out hell return home in the end so ill wait for him peter walked back to the front of the house and drove his lorry around the corner out of sight then peter went into the cafe on the corner where he and john had waited at lunchtime he sat at a table at the window from which he could watch bob steels front door it was just after four oclock peter drank a cup of tea and waited by five oclock bob steel still had not appeared peter drank another cup of tea and ate some biscuits at six oclock he went out bought a newspaper and returned to the cafe he looked at the front page of the newspaper youth arrested for murder police are still trying to find the murderer of fortyfour year old schoolmaster robert stevens this afternoon the police said that mr stevens nephew jonh was helping them with their enquiries peter pushed the newspaper away angrily so it was true john was under arrest peter asked for another cup of tea at half past six he decided not to wait for bob steel any longer he was just leaving the cafe when he suddenly stopped he could see bob steel walking quickly along the street away from number twelve peter decided to follow him bob steel went towards the centre of the town and peter followed him when bob steel stopped to cross the road peter hid in a doorway when bob steel looked around peter hid behind his newspaper after a few minutes bob steel stopped at a bus stop peter waited in a shop doorway pretending to read his newspaper the bus came and bob steel got on peter followed and sat close to the door of the bus so that he could watch bob steel without being seen peter wasnt sure what ticket he should buy so he asked to go to the centre of town and hoped that bob steel would get off there peter was right bob steel got off at the bus station in the centre of the town here it was easier for peter to follow because there were more people soon bob steel turned into a narrow side street peter followed him but when peter turned the corner he was surprised to see that the side street was empty peter walked along the side street slowly and carefully stopping every few metres to listen halfway down the street he could hear voices coming from a dark shop doorway he went close to the doorway and listened peter could hear bob steels voice but couldnt hear all the words peter could only hear some of the words bob steel was saying told you trust me the police arrest railway station peter moved closer to try to hear what bob steel was saying suddenly peter bumped into a tin which was lying on the ground the tin made a loud noise bob steel and the person he was with stopped talking peter jumped back and tried to hide but it was too late theres someone there shouted bob steel and he and the person he was talking to ran off down the street peter ran after them he could see both of them clearly as they ran ahead of him the person bob steel had been talking to looked quite young about fifteen or sixteen years old at the end of the street bob steel turned to the right and the boy he had been talking to turned to the left what shall i do thought peter which one should i follow he decided to run after bob steel he ran as fast as he could and slowly got closer and closer to bob steel bob steel looked over his shoulder at peter and tried to run faster but peter caught up with him and took hold of his coat bob steel tried to get free but he couldnt escape peter caught hold of bob steels arm and twisted it behind his back now said peter youre going to tell me the truth chapter twelve more information come on said peter tell me the truth but bob steel didnt say anything so peter twisted his arm a bit more oh cried bob steel stop it ill stop it when you start talking replied peter all right said bob steel but i cant talk here lets go back to my house and ill tell you there ive got a better idea said peter well walk back to your house and you can tell me what you know as we walk ok said bob steel but please leave go of my arm peter laughed no he said i dont want you to run away again then they started walking back to river street now said peter did you send the police to the railway station bob steel shook his head no he said i didnt do it peter twisted bob steels arm i dont believe you he said why did you send the police to the station was it for money no said bob steel they didnt give me very much then he was silent very much what asked peter quickly they didnt give you very much money so you did tell the police that john was at the station but they didnt pay you very well bob steel didnt reply they both walked in silence for a moment who were you talking to asked peter when said bob steel when i caught you replied peter i was talking to myself said bob steel no you werent peter said firmly i saw you talking to a boy who was he bob steel didnt answer they walked on in silence again and were soon back outside number twelve river street again open the door peter told bob steel we havent finished our conversation yet when they were sitting in the upstairs room again peter leant forward and started to speak seriously to bob steel now lets be honest with each other you make your living by selling information you sold information about my friend john to the police bob steel opened his mouth to speak but peter ignored him and continued you sold john to the police said peter but the police didnt pay you very much so someone else must have paid you as well someone else must have given you money to tell the police where john was am i right bob steel looked at the floor and didnt reply peter went on i think that the person who paid you to tell the police where john was must have had a reason i think he must have had a good reason to want to see john arrested by the police do you know what reason bob steel shook his head no i dont well i do said peter i think the person who paid you money to get john arrested was the murderer now tell me the name of the person who paid you tell me his name bob steel looked up you dont understand mister he said i dont tell people things i sell information if you want to know anything more youll have to pay me peter raised his hand angrily to hit bob steel dont hit me bob steel shouted if you hit me i wont tell you anything peter lowered his hand and smiled you would sell your own mother if you could he said all right ill pay you how much do you want you promised me eighty pounds said bob steel quickly thats right answered peter and he took out the money he held the money out to bob steel here you are peter continued tell me the name of the person who paid you to get john arrested bob steel took the money and counted it then he put it in a pocket of his old coat well he said im afraid i cant tell you the name what shouted peter angrily wait a moment let me explain said bob steel i cant tell you the name because i dont know it but i can tell you two things what are they asked peter firstly said bob steel slowly that everything i told you this afternoon was true tell me what you said this afternoon again said peter very well said bob steel i told you that mr stevens wasnt killed for money he was killed by someone who knew him he was killed by someone young whats the second thing you have to tell me peter asked just this replied bob steel if you go to manor park secondary school you will find the answers to all your questions how will i find the murderer at manor park secondary school asked peter in surprise mr stevens was a teacher there answered bob steel peter stood up quickly im going to go there now he said but i may have some more questions to ask you especially if i find that you havent been telling me the truth i think ill tie you up to make sure that you dont go out while im away peter picked up a piece of rope which was lying on the floor he tied bob steel to the chair in which he was sitting then peter ran down the stairs and out of the house leaving the front door partly open manor park secondary school was on the other side of bristol it was lucky that the lorry was around the corner peter got into the lorry and drove off to the school very fast chapter thirteen in the cafe peter stopped the lorry outside manor park secondary school then he looked at his watch it was already eight oclock the school looked dark and closed peter got out of the lorry and then he noticed that there was a light on in one of the rooms peter went over to the window and looked in there was a man of about sixty cleaning the floor of the classroom peter knocked at the window and the man looked up the man saw peter and opened the window what do you want the man asked id like to have a talk with you peter replied im very busy at the moment the man said its about mr stevens peter said oh replied the man youd better come in then and we can have a talk the man was the school caretaker he cleaned the rooms and took care of the building the caretaker let peter in and they sat down in the caretakers room together what do you want to know about mr stevens asked the caretaker carefully are you from the newspapers peter shook his head no he said and im not from the police either im a friend of mr stevens nephew john ah yes said the caretaker john has been arrested by the police peter nodded thats right he said but i think the police are wrong i dont think john killed his uncle did you know mr stevens well yes replied the caretaker as he lit a cigarette ive been working here for nearly twenty years and mr stevens had been here for ten years what was mr stevens like asked peter the caretaker thought for a moment before saying anything he was always very pleasant to me the caretaker continued but his pupils did not like him why not asked peter mr stevens lost his temper very quickly said the caretaker he got angry very easily he had fixed ideas about his pupils once he got the idea that a particular pupil was bad he would never change his opinion did mr stevens ever hit his pupils asked peter i think so replied the caretaker but it would be better for you to ask some of the boys themselves where can i find some of them now asked peter a lot of the boys go to a cafe about a kilometre from here close to the scala cinema the caretaker replied if you go there youll find some of mr stevens pupils peter thanked the caretaker he left the school and drove down to the cafe which the caretaker had told him about the cafe was dark inside and the radio was playing very loudly see the girl with the diamond ring she knows how to shake that thing oh yes all right tell me what i say a crowd of boys and girls aged fifteen or sixteen were standing by the door peter went up to them said hello and then asked them if they knew mr stevens stevens said one of the boys im glad hes dead he was terrible why was he terrible asked peter mr stevens used to make us look stupid he used to make jokes about our clothes and say how stupid we were all the time the boy explained my fathers in prison said another boy and mr stevens used to make jokes about it in every lesson he used to ask me if i was going to be a thief like my father stevens used to hit us too said another boy why peter asked he used to hit us all the time the boy replied he hit us if we were late or if we didnt answer his questions correctly what was mr stevens like in school on the day he was killed peter asked the group of boys its funny you should ask that said one of the boys because he had a big argument in our class that day what was the argument about inquired peter i dont remember now said the boy i think it was because mr stevens said that a boy had been rude to him the boy said he hadnt but mr stevens shouted at him and gave him a lot of extra homework to do what was the name of this boy asked peter i think it was tommy logan said another boy peter thanked the boys for their help and asked them where he could find tommy logan tommy could be anywhere one of them said hes got a motorbike but he usually comes here to the cafe at about nine oclock so if you wait youll probably see him peter went into the cafe got a cup of coffee and sat down he had been waiting for nearly half an hour when he heard a motorbike arrive outside a darkhaired boy wearing a leather jacket pushed through the crowd at the door the boy came up to peter i hear that youre asking questions about me he said staring at peter what do you want peter looked at the boy in the leather jacket peter couldnt remember where he had seen him before then peter remembered this was the boy he had seen talking to bob steel chapter fourteen the chase peter looked carefully at the boy in the leather jacket sit down peter said are you tommy logan thats right replied the boy he was about sixteen with dark hair and a thin face he seemed nervous and his eyes were moving all the time i want to ask you some questions about mr stevens peter told the boy calmly are you from the police asked tommy logan peter shook his head no im not he said in that case replied the boy i dont have to talk to you goodbye the boy stood up and turned to go peter caught hold of the sleeve of the boys leather jacket dont go yet peter said quietly lets talk about your friend bob steel a look of fear came into tommy logans eyes he pulled his jacket out of peters hand and pushed his way to the door peter got up and ran after the boy when peter got to the door he was just in time to see tommy logan jump on his motorbike peter ran out on to the pavement but it was too late tommy logan started the engine and drove off i know where hes going peter said to himself he ran back to his lorry and jumped in he started the engine quickly and drove after the motorbike but the motorbike was faster than the lorry and soon disappeared never mind said peter to himself i know where hes going peter drove back to river street as fast as he could as he turned the corner into river street he switched off the lorrys lights peter drove slowly and quietly along the street and stopped close to number twelve outside bob steels house peter could see a motorbike it was tommy logans motorbike peter had been right in thinking that the boy would come here peter climbed over the wall into the garden and went up to the front door it was wide open inside peter could hear voices he started to climb the stairs just then the door of bob steels room opened and someone switched on the light there he is on the stairs shouted tommy logan pointing at peter before peter could hide bob steel and tommy logan came running out of the room peter got ready to stop them as they came down the stairs suddenly peter saw that bob steel was carrying a chair it was the chair peter had tied bob steel up in tommy logan must have untied him with a laugh bob steel threw the chair at peter from the top of the stairs the chair was heavy it hit peter on the shoulder and knocked him down the stairs then tommy logan and bob steel ran down the stairs jumped over peters body and ran out into the street peter lay at the bottom of the stairs his head and right shoulder hurt badly then he heard the motorbike starting with difficulty peter got up and went to the door bob steel and tommy logan were both on the motorbike and they were driving away fast down the street im not going to lose them again said peter aloud he forgot about the pain in his shoulder and ran as fast as he could to his lorry in a moment he was chasing after the motorbike in his lorry the motorbike turned right at the end of the street and went down the hill towards the river peter switched on the lorrys headlights fully and with the tyres screaming he followed the motorbike around the corner going down the hill peter was able to go faster than the motorbike and was soon only fifty metres behind then at the bottom of the hill the motorbike suddenly turned right into a narrow street peter followed the motorbike into the narrow street as the lorrys lights lit up the wall at the end of the street peter shouted happily now ive got you he shouted theres no way out the street had no exit the only way out of the street was back to the road the motorbike went to the end of the street and discovering that there was no way out turned around then the motorbike drove back towards peter peter could see tommy logans face as he drove the motorbike straight at the lorry peter quickly turned the lorry across the street so that the motorbike could not pass and then he waited for the crash with a roar the motorbike came right up to the lorry then tommy logan saw a narrow gap between the lorry and the wall the gap was less than a metre wide but big enough to let the motorbike escape the motorbike roared through the gap between the lorry and the wall peter was furious angrily he turned the lorry around and began to chase the motorbike when he turned into the road by the river peter could just see the back light of the motorbike disappearing in the distance he drove faster he turned a corner and then to his surprise peter saw that tommy logan and bob steel had been delayed they had stopped in a queue of cars at the traffic lights the lights were red and so the cars had to wait tommy logan looked over his shoulder and saw that peters lorry was approaching fast peter was now very close tommy logan decided that he would not wait at the red lights suddenly he drove the motorbike out into the middle of the road and passed all the cars waiting at the traffic lights then without stopping the motorbike went straight across the crossroads against the red lights and nearly crashed into a car coming the other way peter immediately followed the motorbike and passed the line of cars which was waiting he didnt wait for the traffic lights to turn green he drove faster and chased tommy logan and bob steel across the crossroads and down the street they were getting nearer the centre of town now and the roads were busier as peter passed car after car in his chase after the two men he looked in the lorrys minor in the minor peter could see a police car with its lights flashing chasing both the lorry and the motorbike well thought peter im not going to stop now ill catch that motorbike if its the last thing i do with the tyres screaming and smoking as they went around the corners peter drove his lorry as fast as he could after the motorbike and behind both the lorry and the motorbike came the police car with its flashing lights chapter fifteen the police station at a hundred kilometres an hour the motorbike carrying tommy logan and bob steel roared through the centre of bristol peters big lorry raced after them behind peter came a police car with its blue light flashing tommy logan looked quickly over his shoulder to see if peter was any closer peter was much closer tommy looked ahead again and saw a sign low bridge ahead with a smile tommy drove the motorbike under the bridge peter saw the bridge coming but the lorry was going too fast to stop the lorry was quite high and peter thought it would hit the top of the bridge and crash with a loud roar the lorry went under the bridge and missed the top by a few centimetres peter wiped the sweat from his forehead that was close peter said to himself peter looked in the mirror again there were now two police cars behind he could see their blue lights flashing but he decided he wouldnt stop he had to drive on slowly but surely peter got closer and closer to the motorbike soon he was next to it the motorbike and the lorry screamed down the street side by side a car coming in the opposite direction saw the lorry and motorbike and drove up onto the pavement to avoid a crash finally peter got a little in front of the motorbike and slowed down to make it stop tommy logan also slowed down then he suddenly drove the motorbike up onto the pavement and passed peter again the people on the pavement jumped for their lives when they saw the motorbike coming towards them bob steels face was white with fear as he held onto tommy logans back tommy drove the bike onto the road again he was now fifty metres ahead of peter the road was straight now for nearly a kilometre the two police cars behind the lorry were now much closer peter could see the flashing lights of another police car in front of them tommy logan saw the police car coming too and started to slow down a moment later tommy turned the motorbike around and came roaring back towards peter peter stopped the lorry in the middle of the road the two police cars behind the lorry screamed to a stop one on each side of the lorry now there was no space for the motorbike to pass peter jumped out of his lorry and started running towards the motorbike tommy logan drove the motorbike straight at peter but at the last moment peter jumped aside the motorbike crashed into the lorry peter stood still in the middle of the road for a second he watched the motorbike hit the back wheel of his lorry behind him he could hear the policemen getting out of their cars and running towards him and the motorbike in front of him another policeman pointed at him and shouted stop tommy logan was not hurt he jumped up immediately and started to run away peter chased after him as he ran peter quickly looked behind him bob steel was lying on the ground by the motorbike with a policeman standing over him two other policemen were chasing peter peter could run faster than tommy logan he got closer and closer and finally jumped and caught tommy by the shoulders they both fell to the ground with peter holding on to tommys coat then peter felt two strong hands pulling him away he looked up and saw two policemen all right you two stop fighting youre both under arrest said one of the policemen peter and tommy both stood up and looked at each other now come with us said the policeman who was now firmly holding tommys arm and the four of them walked back to the police cars another policeman was waiting for them with bob steel bob steel had some blood on his face but he looked more frightened than hurt the motorbike was put in the back of peters lorry and a policeman drove it back to the police station peter tommy logan and bob steel followed in the police cars when they arrived at the police station they were taken to see the sergeant the sergeant took their names and addresses now then he said whats all this about bob steel and tommy logan said nothing peter thought for a minute and then he spoke its about the murder the murder of mr stevens really said the sergeant you were driving through bristol at a hundred kilometres an hour because mr stevens was murdered were you peter tried to explain the situation but the sergeant didnt want to listen if its about the murder the sergeant said you can talk to the inspector hes out now but hell be back in half an hour i hope youre telling the truth because the inspector is a very busy man hell be very angry if he thinks youre wasting his time hes mad shouted bob steel pointing at peter all right be quiet all of you said the sergeant you can all talk to the inspector when he comes the sergeant took bob steel and tommy logan and put them in one room then he opened another door and pushed peter into a different room peter shouted a voice peter looked up it was john peter how good to see you is everything all right now asked john are they going to let me go no said peter sadly then what are you doing here asked john im under arrest too said peter what for john asked in surprise dangerous driving replied peter he told john the whole story and john listened without saying anything then john told peter that the police had asked him lots of questions but that he hadnt told them anything i think its about time you did tell us everything said a voice from behind them it was inspector shaw now said inspector shaw youre both in bad trouble i want the truth chapter sixteen the truth is told inspector shaw sat down he looked at peter and john i want the truth the inspector said again peter looked serious he was going to tell the inspector the whole story he hoped inspector shaw would believe him if the inspector didnt believe his story peter knew that he would be sent to prison for helping john and for driving dangerously inspector shaw listened without saying anything while peter told him the whole story from the moment he had given john a lift to the chase through bristol the inspector wrote some notes in a little book while peter was talking do you expect me to believe this story asked inspector shaw when peter had finished yes said peter its the truth john added well see replied the inspector as he left the room inspector shaw returned a minute later with sergeant black bob steel and tommy logan sergeant black brought in some chairs and they all sat down inspector shaw turned to bob steel who looked very frightened youve been in trouble before said the inspector and this time youll go to prison unless you tell us all that you know prison said bob steel i havent done anything i havent killed anyone i was just walking past mr stevens house the night before last when i saw be quiet you old fool shouted tommy logan as he jumped to his feet sergeant black pushed tommy back into his chair what did you see inspector shaw asked bob steel bob steel continued i saw a young man running out of the house he left the front door open i was surprised so i went in to have a look mr stevens was lying on the floor who was the boy you saw running out of the house asked the inspector bob steel pointed at john it was him he said i didnt started john be quiet said sergeant black what happened next the inspector asked bob steel well bob steel continued mr stevens was lying on the floor i could see that he wasnt dead because he was breathing just then i heard footsteps coming so i ran out of the back door and hid in the garden i could hear a loud argument and then a fight i went around to the front of the house and looked in the window but i couldnt see anything i waited and after a few minutes i saw a young man leaving the house was it the same boy as before inspector shaw asked bob steel looked at tommy logan no he said it was tommy logan youre a liar shouted tommy logan thats not true what did you do then asked the inspector i went into the house again replied bob steel but when i saw that mr stevens was dead i left i telephoned the police

me at mr stevens house so you were at mr stevens house the inspector said quickly yes thats right replied tommy logan he looked angry and at the same time he looked as if he was going to cry bob steel kept on asking for more money said tommy logan i gave him some more but it was no use youve caught me anyway tommy logan stopped talking and started to cry stop crying said inspector shaw to tommy
