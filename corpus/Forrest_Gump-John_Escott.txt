chapter one school and football i was born an idiot but im cleverer than people think i can think things ok but when i have to say them or write them down sometimes they come out all wrong when i was born my mom named me forrest my daddy died just after i was born he worked on the ships one day a big box of bananas fell down on my daddy and killed him i dont like bananas much only banana cake i like that all right at first when i was growing up i played with everybody but then some boys hit me and my mom didnt want me to play with them again i tried to play with girls but they all ran away from me i went to an ordinary school for a year then the children started laughing and running away from me but one girl jenny curran didnt run away and sometimes she walked home with me she was nice then they put me into another kind of school and there were some strange boys there some couldnt eat or go to the toilet without help i stayed in that school for five or six years but when i was thirteen i grew six inches in six months and by the time i was sixteen i was bigger and heavier than all the other boys in the school one day i was walking home and a car stopped next to me the driver asked me my name and i told him what school do you go to he asked i told him about the idiot school do you ever play football he asked no i told him i see other people playing but i dont play and they never ask me to play with them ok the man said three days later the man in the car came and got me out of school mom was there and they got all the things out of my desk and put them in a brown paper bag then they told me to say goodbye to the teacher the man in the car took me and mom to the new high school there an old man with grey hair asked me lots of questions but i knew that they really wanted me to play football the man in the car was a football coach called fellers coach fellers asked me to put on a football suit then asked me to undress and dress again twenty times until i could do it easily i began to play football with the high school team and coach fellers helped me and i went to lessons in the school one teacher miss henderson was really nice she taught me to read and who do you think i saw in the school cafe jenny curran she was all grownup now with pretty black hair long legs and a beautiful face i went and sat with her and she remembered me but there was a boy in the cafe who started calling me names and saying things like hows stupid then he threw some milk at me and i jumped out of my chair and ran away a day or two later after school in the afternoon he and his friends came up to me and started pushing and hitting me then they ran after me across the football field i ran away fast i saw that coach fellers was watching me he had a strange look on his face and he came and told me to put on my football suit that afternoon he gave me the ball to run with the others started running after me and i ran as fast as i could when they caught me it needed eight of them to pull me down coach fellers was really happy he started jumping up and down and laughing and after that everybody liked me we had our first game and i was frightened but they gave me the ball and i ran over the goal line two or three times people were really kind to me after that then something happened which was not so good i want to take jenny curran to the cinema i told mom one day so she phoned jennys mom and explained next evening jenny arrived at our house wearing a white dress and with a pink flower in her hair she was the prettiest thing that i ever saw the cinema was not far from our house jenny got the tickets and we went inside the film was about a man and a woman bonnie and clyde and there was a lot of shooting and killing well i laughed a lot but when i did this people looked at me and jenny got down lower and lower in her place once i thought she was on the floor and i put my hand on her shoulder to pull her up but i pulled her dress and it came open and she screamed i tried to put my hands in front of her because there were people looking at us then two men came and took me to an office a few minutes later four policemen arrived and took me to the police station mom came to the police station she was crying and i knew that i was in trouble again and i was in trouble but i was lucky next day a letter arrived from a university it was good news if i played in their football team there was a place for me in school there and the police said thats ok with us just get out of town so the next morning mom put some things into a suitcase for me and put me on a bus she was crying again but they started the bus and away i went chapter two life at university when we got to the university coach bryant came to talk to us last man to get to the practice field will get a ride there on my shoe he shouted at us and he meant it when he said that kind of thing we soon learned that the building that i went to live in was nice on the outside but not on the inside most of the doors and windows were broken and the floor was dirty i lived in a room with a man called curtis he crashed into the room with a wild look in his eyes he wasnt very tall but he was very strong where are you from he asked mobile i told him thats a stupid town he said and that was all of our conversation for several days on the practice field things didnt start very well i got the ball but i ran the wrong way with it and everybody got angry and started shouting at me but coach bryant called me across just get in the line and start catching the ball he told me and then i told him something that he didnt want to hear they never taught me to catch a ball at high school i said it was difficult enough for me just to remember where our goal line was i dont think he was very pleased but he started to teach me to catch i wanted my mom and i wanted to go home i didnt like that place and curtis was always angry and i couldnt understand him he had a car and sometimes he gave me a ride to the practice field but one day when he had to change a wheel on the car i helped him if youre an idiot he said angrily how do you know how to do that maybe i am an idiot i said but im not stupid then curtis ran after me and called me all kinds of terrible names after that i moved my bed to another room the first football game was on saturday i ran well and we won to everybody was pleased with me i phoned mom to tell her i heard the game on the radio she said i was so happy i wanted to cry that night everybody went to parties but nobody asked me to go i went back to my room but i heard music from somewhere upstairs i found a young man who was sitting in his room playing the harmonica his name was bubba he broke his foot in football practice and couldnt play in the game i sat and listened to him we didnt talk but after about an hour i asked can i try it and he said ok and gave me the harmonica i began to play after several minutes bubba was getting really excited and saying good good good then he asked where did you learn to play like that i didnt learn anywhere i said when it got late he told me to take the harmonica with me and i played it for a long time in my room next day i took it back to bubba keep it he said ive got another one i was really happy and i went and sat under a tree and played all day it was late afternoon when i began to walk back to my room suddenly i heard a voice shout forrest i turned round and saw jenny she had a big smile on her face and she held my hand i saw you play football yesterday she said you were wonderful she wasnt angry about the cinema and she asked me to have a drink with her im taking lessons in music and i want to be a singer she told me i play in a little group were playing at the students centre tomorrow night why dont you come and listen ok i said chapter three the big game on friday night i went to the students centre there were a lot of people there and jenny was wearing a long dress and singing three or four other people were in the group with her and they made a good sound jenny saw me and smiled and i sat on the floor and listened it was wonderful they played for about an hour and i was lying back with my eyes closed listening happily how did it happen im not sure but suddenly i found that i was playing my harmonica with them jenny stopped singing for a second or two and the others in the group stopped playing then jenny laughed and began to sing with my harmonica and then everybody was saying wonderful to me jenny came to see me forrest where did you learn to play that thing i didnt learn anywhere i told her well after that jenny asked me to play with their group every friday and paid me every time the only other important thing that happened to me at the university was the big game at the orange bowl in miami that year it was an important game which coach bryant wanted us to win the game started and the ball came to me i took it and ran straight into a group of big men on the other team crash it was like that all afternoon when they were winning to coach bryant called me across forrest he said all year we have secretly taught you to catch the ball and run with it now youre going to run like a wild animal ok ok coach i said and i did everybody was surprised to see that i could catch the ball suddenly it was to and after i caught it four or five more times it was to then the other team got two men to run after me but that meant gwinn was free to catch the ball and he put us on the yard line then weasel the kicker got a field goal and it was to but then things began to go wrong again weasel made a bad mistake and then the game finished and we were the losers coach bryant wasnt very happy well boys he said theres always next year but not for me i soon learned that i couldnt stay at the university i wasnt clever enough at the lessons and there was nothing that anybody could do about it coach bryant was very sad i knew this would happen forrest he said but i said to them just give me that boy in my team for a year and they did and we had a good year the best year forrest good luck boy bubba helped me to put my things in my suitcase then he walked to the bus with me to say goodbye we went past the students centre but it wasnt friday night and jennys band wasnt playing i didnt know where she was it was late when the bus got to mobile mom knew that i was coming but she was crying when i got home whats wrong i asked a letter came she cried youve got to go in the army chapter four vietnam after i left the idiot school people were always shouting at me coach fellers coach bryant and then the people in the army but i have to say this the people in the army shouted louder and longer than anybody fort benning was in georgia after about a hundred hours on a bus me and a lot of other new young soldiers arrived there the place where i had to live was just a bit better than the rooms at the university but the food was not it was terrible then and in the months to come i just had to do the things that i was told to do they taught me how to shoot guns throw hand grenades and move along the ground on my stomach one day the cook was ill and somebody said gump youre going to be the cook today what am i going to cook i said how do i cook its easy said one of the men just put everything that you see in the food cupboard into a big pot and cook it maybe it wont taste very good i said nothing does in this place he said he was right well i got tins of tomatoes some rice apples potatoes and everything that i could find what am i going to cook it in i asked one of the men there are some pots in the cupboard he said but the pots were only small youve got to find something one of the other men said what about this i asked there was a big metal thing about six feet tall and five feet round sitting in the corner thats the boiler you cant cook anything in that why not i asked its hot its got water in it but the men had other things to do do what you like they said so i used the boiler i put everything in it and after about an hour you could smell the cooking it smelled ok then the men came back and everybody was waiting for their dinner hurry up with that food gump were hungry they shouted suddenly the boiler began to shake and make noises and then it blew up it blew the food all over us me and all the men who were sitting at the tables gump they screamed youre an idiot but i already knew that after a year we went to vietnam to fight in the war one evening we went to have a shower the showers were just a long hole in the ground for us to stand in while somebody threw water over us we were standing in it when suddenly there was a strange noise then the ground began to blow up all round us we threw ourselves on to the floor of the shower hole and somebody started screaming it was some of our men on the far side of the hole and there was blood all over them then everything went quiet again and after a minute or two the rest of us climbed up out of the hole the enemy soldiers tried to blow us up for the next five nights then it stopped but it was time for us to move up north to help some of our other men in the jungle we went in helicopters and there was smoke coming up out of the jungle when we got there the enemy started shooting at us before we got on the ground and they blew up one of our helicopters it was terrible people on fire and nothing that we could do it was almost night before we found our other soldiers in the jungle and who do you think one of them was it was bubba well in between the shooting bubba told me about himself his foot got too bad to play football and he had to leave the university but his foot wasnt too bad for the army to get him and here he was what happened to jenny curran i asked she left school and went off with a group of people who were against the war he said chapter five danger in the jungle there was a little valley between two hills we were on one hill and the enemy was on the other then we got orders to move the machine gun about fifty metres to the left of the big tree that was in the middle of the valley and to find a safe place to put it before the enemy blew us all up we found a place to put the gun and stayed there all night we could hear shooting all round us but they didnt hit us when it was day again our planes came and they blew up the enemy soldiers then we watched while our men moved off the hill and came down into the valley suddenly somebody started shooting at them we couldnt see the enemy soldiers because the jungle was too thick but somebody was shooting at our men the shooting was in front of us which meant that the enemy soldiers were in between us and our men and this meant that the enemy was able to come back and find us so we had to get out fast we began to move back to the hill but doyle suddenly saw more enemy soldiers who were going towards our men we waited until they got to the top then bones began shooting with the machine gun he probably killed ten or fifteen enemy soldiers doyle and i and the other two men threw grenades but then an enemy soldier shot bones in the head i pulled the machine gun from his hands and shouted to doyle there was no answer two of them were dead and doyle was only just alive i picked up doyle and put him across my shoulders then i ran towards the hill there were bullets flying all round me from behind and then i saw more enemy soldiers in the low grass in front of me they were shooting at our men on the hill i ran fast shouting and screaming as loudly as i could and suddenly i was in the middle of our soldiers and everybody was pleased and hitting me on the back my shouting and screaming frightened the enemy soldiers away they just ran the weeks went past slowly i got a letter from my mom and i wrote back to her that everything was ok i also wrote a letter to jenny curran and asked mom to ask her parents to send it on to her but i didnt get a reply bubba and i decided that we would get a shrimp boat when we got home again and catch shrimps and make a lot of money bubba planned it all it started to rain one day and it didnt stop for two months but we still had to look for enemy soldiers and one day we found them we were crossing a rice field when suddenly they started shooting at us somebody shouted back i picked up my machine gun and ran towards some trees i looked round for bubba but he wasnt there then i heard that he was out in the rice field and he was hurt so i left my gun by the trees and ran back into the field gump you cant go out there somebody shouted but i just ran halfway out i saw another man who was hurt he was holding a hand up to me so i picked him up and ran back to the trees with him then i ran out again and found bubba there was blood all over him and he had two bullets in his stomach he looked up at me and said forrest why did this happen what could i say then he said play me a song on the harmonica will you there was still a lot of shooting going on but i played a song then all the colour went out of bubbas face and he said something very softly home and then he died and thats all ive got to say about that the rest of the night was terrible the worst night that ive ever known nobody could get any help to us and the enemy soldiers were so near that we could hear them talking then when it got light an american plane came and used firethrowers on the enemy and almost on us suddenly the trees were on fire and men were running out of the jungle with burned skin and clothes during all of this somebody shot me in the back of the leg but i cant remember when it happened it didnt matter nothing mattered bubba was dead the shrimp business idea was dead with him i just wanted to die too then our helicopters came and the enemy soldiers who were left ran away an hour later i was out of there and on my way to the hospital in danang chapter six the white house i was at the hospital for two months after the first few weeks my leg was getting better and one day i went down into the little town to the fish market i bought some shrimps and one of the cooks at the hospital cooked them for me two days later i went back to the fish market and talked to a man who was selling shrimps where do you get them i asked him he immediately started talking fast in a language that i couldnt understand but he took me somewhere past all the boats and the beach there he took a net and put it in the water when he took it out again it was full of shrimps every day for the next few weeks i went with mr chi that was his name and watched him while he worked he showed me how to catch shrimps with the net and it was so easy that an idiot was able to do it which i did then one day i got back to the hospital and a colonel gooch said gump were going back to america together youre going to see the president of the united states and hes going to give you a medal because you were very brave there were about two thousand people waiting for us at san francisco airport when we got off the plane what a surprise a lot of them had beards and long hair i thought perhaps they were there to welcome us but i was wrong they were shouting unpleasant things and then somebody threw a tomato at colonel gooch and it hit him in the face he tried to clean it off and not look angry but i didnt want to wait for them to start throwing things at me no sir i started running the people ran after me all two thousand of them but they couldnt catch me i ran all round the airport and then i ran into a toilet and locked the door i waited in there for almost an hour before i came out again i went to look for colonel gooch and i found him in the middle of a group of policemen he was looking very worried until he saw me come on gump he said the plane for washington is waiting for us the army sent a car to meet us at washington airport and we drove to a really nice hotel after we put our suitcases in our rooms the colonel asked me to go out to a bar with him for a drink people are different here he told me they arent like the people in california he was wrong when we got there he bought me a beer and he was telling me about the president and my medal when something happened a pretty girl came up to our table and the colonel thought she was a waitress get us two more drinks please he said she looked at him and said i wont get you anything not as much as a glass of warm riverwater you pig then she looked at me and said and how many babies have you killed today you big ape well after that we went back to the hotel next morning we got up early and went to the white house where the president lives its a really pretty house with a big garden a lot of army people were there and they immediately started shaking my hand and telling me that i was a brave man and that they were pleased to meet me the president was a great big old man who talked like somebody from texas and there were a lot of people standing round him in the flower garden then an army man started to read something and everybody listened everybody but me because i was hungry and wanted some breakfast at last the army man finished reading and then the president came up and gave me the medal after that he began to shake my hand i was just thinking of getting out of there and having some breakfast when the president said boy is that your stomach making that noise so i said yes and the president said well come on boy lets go and get something to eat and i followed him into the house and a waiter got us some breakfast the president asked me a lot of questions about vietnam and the army but i just said yes its ok or shook my head to say no and after several minutes of this we were both silent do you want to watch tv the president asked suddenly so me and the president of america watched tv while i ate my breakfast later when we were back in the garden the president said you were hurt werent you boy well look at this and he pulled up his shirt and showed me the place on his stomach where he was hurt once where were you hurt he asked me so i pulled down my trousers turned round and showed him well lots of newspaper men started taking photographs before colonel gooch could run across and pull me away that afternoon back at the hotel he came to my room shouting and throwing newspapers on to the bed and there i was on the front page with my trousers down gump you idiot shouted colonel gooch yes sir i said thats what i am but i just try to do the right thing chapter seven meeting jenny again soon after that i heard that i was leaving the army early and they gave me some money for a train ticket to go home but all this time i was thinking about jenny curran just before i left the hospital in danang i had a letter from her she was now playing in a group called the broken eggs and they played two nights each week at a place called the hodaddy club near harvard university now that i was free from the army i just wanted to go and see her so i got a ticket for boston instead of mobile i tried to walk to the hodaddy club from the train station but i lost my way so i took a taxi it was in the afternoon and the man behind the bar said jennyll be here about nine oclock can i wait i asked ok he said so i sat down and waited for five or six hours students began to come in most of them wearing dirty jeans the men had beards and the women had long untidy hair later the group the broken eggs arrived but i didnt see jenny then they began to play and they were loud the music sounded like a plane that was taking off but the students loved it and then jenny came on she was different her hair was all the way down her back and she was wearing sunglasses at night she was wearing blue jeans and a shirt with lots of colours on it the group started playing again and jenny began to sing later i went outside and walked round for about half an hour then went back there were a lot of people waiting to go in so i went round to the back of the place and sat on the ground i had my harmonica in my pocket so i took it out and started to play i could hear the music that was playing inside and after a minute or two i began playing with it suddenly a door behind me opened and there was jenny who is that playing the harmonica she said and then she saw me forrest gump and she ran out of the door and threw her arms round me we talked together until it was time for her to sing again i didnt leave school said jenny they threw me out after they found a boy in my room one night i went to california and stayed there for some time she laughed i wore flowers in my hair and talked about love but the people that i was with were strange then i met a man and we came to boston but he was dangerous he was against the war like me but he blew up buildings and things i couldnt stay with him next i met a teacher from harvard university but he was married then i began to sing with the broken eggs where do you live i asked with my boyfriend she said hes a student you can come back and stay with us tonight the boyfriends name was rudolph he was a little man and he was sitting on the floor with his eyes shut when we got to jennys flat rudolph this is forrest jenny said hes a friend of mine from home and hes going to stay with us for a few days rudolph didnt speak or open his eyes but he put up his hand and smiled next morning when i got up rudolph was still sitting on the floor with his eyes shut that afternoon jenny took me to meet the other people in the group and that night i began playing my harmonica with them at the hodaddy club it went well and i played with them every night after that then one day i came back to the flat and jenny was sitting on the floor wheres rudolph i asked gone she said walked out like all the others and then she started to cry dont cry jenny i said and i put my arm round her well it started like that but the next minute we were kissing and making love and when we finished jenny said forrest where have you been all this time chapter eight into space spring and summer went by and i continued to play my harmonica with the group it was my happiest time of all but youve guessed it something went wrong how did it happen i dont know but one night i was sitting outside the hodaddy club smoking a cigarette when a girl smiled and came up to me she sat down across my legs and put her arms round me she was laughing and kissing me and i didnt know what to do suddenly the door opened behind me and there was jenny forrest its time to she stopped when she saw me with the girl then she said oh no not you too i jumped up and pushed the girl away jenny i said stay away from me forrest she said you men are all the same just stay away from me she didnt speak to me again that night and the next morning she told me to find another place to live i went to live with moses one of the other men in the group and soon after that jenny went to washington to talk and work against the war moses wrote down the address for me so i went back to washington too there was a lot of trouble there police were everywhere and people were shouting and throwing things and the police were taking some of them away i went to find jennys address but there was nobody at home i waited outside for most of the day then at about nine oclock a car stopped near the house and some people got out and there she was i started to walk towards her but she turned and walked away the other people two men and a girl didnt know what to say whats wrong with her i asked one of the two men she just got out of prison he said she was there all night before we could get her out jenny was in the back of the car now so i went over and talked to her through the window i told her how i felt i was sorry about the girl and i didnt want to play in the group without her she listened quietly then opened the car door for me to get in and we sat and talked the others were talking about something that would happen the next day some american soldiers planned to take off their vietnam medals and throw them away in front of the crowds of people suddenly jenny said did you know that forrest won a medal the others went quiet and looked at me then looked at jenny next morning jenny came into the livingroom i was sleeping on the floor of their house she woke me up forrest she said i want you to do something for me what i said i want you to come with us today and i want you to wear your army clothes why i asked because youre going to do something to stop all the killing in vietnam you can guess what i had to do cant you i had to throw away my medal with the other american soldiers but because my medal was a more famous medal than theirs it was more important to jenny and her friends but it got me into more trouble oh i threw my medal away ok but it hit somebody really important one of the presidents men so they threw me into prison why do things like that always happen to me as it happened i didnt stay in prison long because they soon realized that i was an idiot and they put me in a special hospital for idiots it was the doctors at the hospital who decided to send me to nasa thats the space centre at houston in texas youre just the kind of person that theyre looking for the doctors told me i soon understood why nasa sent me on a journey into space with a woman and an ape me a spaceman it was very strange all kinds of things went wrong because of that ape instead of coming down in the sea when we returned the space ship came down in the jungle somewhere and it was four years before the nasa people found us but the ape and i were soon good friends his name was sue yes i know its a girls name but they sent a male ape up by mistake and nasa didnt like to tell the newspapers that and it was in the jungle that i met big sam a man who taught me to play chess and that was important as you will see later chapter nine a real idiot of course the first thing that i wanted to do when i got back to america was find jenny so i phoned moses in boston the broken eggs group has broken up he told me i dont know what happened to jenny i heard that she went to chicago but that was five years ago do you have a telephone number or anything i asked its an old number he said but perhaps shes still there i phoned the number and she wasnt jenny curran a mans voice said she went to indianapolis got a job at the temperer factory so i went to indianapolis on the bus the temperer factory was outside the town i asked about jenny at the office and the woman said yes she works in here why dont you wait at the side of the factory its almost lunchtime and shell probably come out so i did a lot of people came out at lunchtime then jenny came out she went and sat under a tree on the grass and began eating an apple i went up behind her and said that looks like a nice apple she didnt look up she just said forrest it has to be you a minute later i had my arms round her and we were both crying people were watching us with strange looks on their faces but it didnt matter jenny and me were together again i finish work in three hours forrest jenny said why dont you wait for me in that bar across the street then ill take you to my place so i waited in the bar and i got into the wrestling business how ill tell you it started when i armwrestled a man in the bar and won some money on a bet that gave me an idea but at first i didnt say anything to jenny she came across to the bar after work and we had a drink and talked i saw you on tv when you went up into space forrest she said and i told her all about that and about sue the ape what happened to him she asked i dont know i said but he was a good friend later we went back to jennys flat and she said you can stay here next day when jenny went to work i went back to the bar several people wanted to try armwrestling with me again and i said ok none of them won because i was too strong but plenty of people wanted to try their luck after about a month i was winning nearly two hundred dollars a week armwrestling then one day a man called mike came into the bar you can make a lot more money he told me how i asked wrestling real wrestling he said i can teach you to make a long story short he did jenny wasnt happy about the wrestling but i won a lot of money sometimes by winning fights sometimes by losing them because mike told me to lose them yes that happens too but then i did something stupid again i bet on myself winning a fight after mike told me to lose it jenny got really angry it isnt honest she said i didnt listen i bet all my money on myself to win and then i lost the fight but there was worse to come when i got back to the flat jenny was gone and there was a letter waiting for me it said dear forrest youre doing something bad tonight it isnt honest and i cannot go on with you like this i think about having a house and a family and things like that now i watched you grow up big and strong and good and then in boston i realized that i loved you and i was the happiest girl in the world but then there was that girl outside the hodaddy club then you went up into space and i lost you for four years and i think you changed and i think perhaps i changed too i just want to live in an ordinary way now so i must go and find it i am crying while i write this but please dont try to find me goodbye my dear love jenny and for the first time ever i knew that i was a real idiot chapter ten money for playing games i decided to go home to mobile but the bus stopped at nashville on the way and i went into town for a drink and something to eat i was going past a hotel when i looked in the window and saw some people who were playing chess like i said before big sam taught me how to play chess when i was in the jungle well i went into the hotel to watch them but it was a special chess tournament and it cost five dollars to watch so i didnt go into the chess room i was just walking out again when i saw a little old man who was playing chess with himself at a table near the door i had another hour before i had to catch the bus again so i went across and watched him then i said if you make that move youll lose your queen he didnt look up but after a minute he said perhaps youre right it was time for me to get back to the bus station but when i started to leave the old man said why dont you sit down and finish this game with me i cant i said i have to catch a bus so he waved at me with his hand and i went back to the bus station but i missed the bus that evening and there wasnt another one until the next day so i walked back to the hotel and there was the little old man still playing against himself he looked up and saw me and told me to sit down it took me an hour to win that chess game just who are you he said after the game forrest gump i said where did you learn to play chess he asked in the jungle i told him he looked surprised arent you in the tournament he asked no i told him im going home and im going to start a shrimp business you can make a lot of money from chess he said youre very good am i i said the old mans name was mr tribble two days later we were on our way to los angeles to a big chess tournament we were a day or two early for the tournament and mr tribble took me to see some people who were making a film they make a lot of films in los angeles we were watching a man who was crashing through a window in a film fight when a man walked over to us are you an actor he asked me who me i said were here for the chess tournament said mr tribble but the other man was looking at me you are a big strong man arent you he said youre just what i need for a film that im making my name is felder he has to play chess in a tournament tomorrow said mr tribble he hasnt got time to be an actor it wont take long said mr felder so we went with mr felder and i found myself acting in a film about the jungle with raquel welch the famous film star is that really raquel welch i asked mr felder but things did not go well somehow when i was helping miss welch to escape from the jungle her dress came off and i had to run into the trees to hide her but who do you think we met there sue the ape he was in another film the three of us ran out of there fast and miss welch shouted and screamed no things didnt go very well i wasnt an actor for very long i think mr tribble was secretly pleased i was pleased because i was back with sue again back at our hotel the three of us sat in our room and tried to decide what to do its going to be difficult travelling with an ape said mr tribble he wont be any trouble mr tribble i said but mr tribble seemed worried next day was the big chess tournament at the beverly hills hotel mr tribble and i got there early and i had to play chess all day it took me about seven minutes to win the first game and half an hour to win the next i played all that day and the next and suddenly i was in the final playing with a russian honest ivan the best player in the world he was a big man with long black hair and he didnt want to lose it was a long game honest ivan was good very good but just when honest ivan seemed to be winning sue ran across the room and jumped onto the chess table honest ivan fell off his chair and everybody started screaming and running everywhere lets get out of here forrest shouted mr tribble we got back to the hotel and hurried up to our room forrest said mr tribble youre a wonderful chess player but i never know whats going to happen next heres half of the money that youve won its almost five thousand dollars take sue back to alabama with you and start your shrimp business he shook my hand and gave me his address write to me sometimes forrest good luck chapter eleven the shrimp business well i finally went home to mobile again the train got into mobile station about three oclock in the morning and sue and i got off we walked into the town and finally found a place to sleep in an empty building the next morning i bought some breakfast and got sue some bananas to eat then we went to see mom she was pleased to see me oh forrest she said youre home at last yes mom i said but i didnt stay long two days later sue and i got the bus to bayou la batre where bubbas parents lived and i explained to bubbas daddy about the shrimp business that bubba and i planned to start after we came out of the army he listened and he was very interested and the next day he took sue and me out in his little boat to look for a good place to start the shrimp business it took almost a month to start things up to get nets and a boat and everything finally the day came when sue and i were ready to go shrimping and by that night we had hundreds and hundreds of shrimps in our nets it was the beginning of my shrimp business we worked hard all that summer and that autumn and winter and the next spring and after a year mom was working for me and mr tribble and curtis my old football friend and bubbas daddy at the end of that year we had thirty thousand dollars everybody was very happy but me i was chinking of jenny of course i wanted to find her again and one day i dressed in my best clothes and got the bus to mobile and i went to jennys moms house forrest gump she said when she saw me come on in well we talked about mom and the shrimp business and everything then i asked about jenny i dont hear from her very often she said i think they live somewhere in north carolina now they i said didnt you know she said jenny married two years ago why wasnt i ready for that news i dont know but i wasnt and part of me seemed to die when i heard it but jenny only did what she had to do because im an idiot a lot of people say that they married an idiot but they dont know what its like to marry a real one i cried that night but it didnt help im just going to work hard i told myself its all i can do and i did and at the end of that year we had seventyfive thousand dollars time went on i looked in the mirror and saw lines on my face and grey in my hair the business was doing well but i asked myself what are you doing all this for and i knew that i had to get away mr tribble understood why dont you tell everybody that youre taking a long holiday forrest he said the business will be here when you want it again so i did sue came with me and we went to the bus station where do you want to go the woman in the ticket office asked i dont know i said why dont you go to savannah she said its a nice town ok i said chapter twelve little forrest sue and i got off the bus at savannah then i went and got a cup of coffee and sat outside the bus station what could i do next i didnt know so after i finished my cup of coffee i took out my harmonica and began to play i played two songs and a man walked past and threw some money into my empty coffee cup i played two more songs and soon the cup was half full of money by the end of the next week we were getting ten dollars a day then one afternoon when i was playing to some people in the park i noticed that a little boy was watching me carefully then i looked up and saw a woman who was standing near him it was jenny curran her hair was different and she looked a bit older and a bit tired but it was her all right and when i finished playing she held the little boys hand and came across she was smiling oh forrest i knew it was you when i heard that harmonica nobody plays the harmonica like you do what are you doing here i asked her we live here now she said donald works in a business here in savannah we came here about three years ago when i stopped playing the rest of the people walked away jenny sat next to me while the little boy started playing with sue why are you playing your harmonica in the park asked jenny mom wrote and told me about your shrimp business and how rich you were its a long story i said is that your little boy yes she said what do you call him his name is forrest she said quietly then she went on hes half yours hes your son forrest i looked at the boy who was still playing with sue my son i knew that a baby was on the way when i left indianapolis said jenny but i didnt want to say anything i dont know why i was worried that perhaps perhaps he would be an idiot i finished for her yes but forrest hes not an idiot hes really clever are you sure that hes mine i asked im sure said jenny he wants to be a football player i looked at the boy can i see him for a minute or two of course said jenny and she called to him forrest i want you to meet another forrest hes an old friend of mine the boy came and sat down what a funny animal youve got he said hes an ape i said his name is sue why is it called sue if its a he i knew then that i didnt have an idiot for a son your mom tells me that you want to be a football player yes he said do you know anything about football a bit i said but ask your daddy hell know more than me he put his arms round me for a second then went off to play with sue again jenny looked at me how long have we been friends forrest thirty years sometimes it doesnt seem true she moved nearer and gave me a kiss idiots said jenny who isnt an idiot then she got up and held little forrests hand and they walked away well after that i did a few things first i phoned mr tribble and told him to give some of my money from the shrimp business to my mom and some to bubbas daddy then send the rest to jenny and little forrest i said that night i sat up thinking perhaps i can put things right with jenny i thought now that ive found her again but the more i thought about it the more i finally understood that it was better for the boy to be with jenny and her husband and not to have an idiot for a father an idiot yes im an idiot but most of the time i just try to do the right thing
