paul prescotts charge preface paul prescotts charge is presented to the public as the second volume of the campaign series though wholly unlike the first volume it is written in furtherance of the same main idea that every boys life is a campaign more or less difficult in which success depends upon integrity and a steadfast adherence to duty how paul prescott gained strength by battling with adverse circumstances and under all discouragements kept steadily before him the charge which he received from his dying father is fully told and the author will be glad if the record shall prove an incentive and an encouragement to those boys who may have a similar campaign before them paul prescotts charge i squire newcome hannah the speaker was a tall pompouslooking man whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty he was sitting bolt upright in a highbacked chair and looked as if it would be quite impossible to deviate from his position of unbending rigidity squire benjamin newcome as he was called in the right of his position as justice of the peace chairman of the selectmen and wealthiest resident of wrenville was a man of rule and measure he was measured in his walk measured in his utterance and measured in all his transactions he might be called a dignified machine he had a very exalted conception of his own position and the respect which he felt to be his due not only from his own household but from all who approached him if the president of the united states had called upon him squire newcome would very probably have felt that he himself was the party who conferred distinction and not received it squire newcome was a widower his wife who was as different from himself as could well be conceived did not live long after marriage she was chilled to death as it was thought by the dignified iceberg of whose establishment she had become a part she had left however a child who had now grown to be a boy of twelve this boy was a thorn in the side of his father who had endeavored in vain to mould him according to his idea of propriety but ben was gifted with a spirit of fun sometimes running into mischief which was constantly bursting out in new directions in spite of his fathers numerous and rather prosy lectures hannah again called squire newcome separating the two syllables by a pause of deliberation and strongly accenting the last syllable a habit of his with all proper names hannah was the irish servant of all work who was just then engaged in mixing up bread in the room adjoining which was the kitchen feeling a natural reluctance to appear before her employer with her hands covered with dough she hastily washed them all this however took time and before she responded to the first summons the second hannah delivered with a little sharp emphasis had been uttered at length she appeared at the door of the sittingroom hannah said squire newcome fixing his cold gray eye upon her when you hear my voice a calling you it is your duty to answer the summons immejiately i have endeavored to represent the squires pronunciation of the last word so i would have come immejously said hannah displaying a most reprehensible ignorance but me hands were all covered with flour that makes no difference interrupted the squire flour is an accidental circumstance whats that thought hannah opening her eyes in amazement and should not be allowed to interpose an obstacle to an immejiate answer to my summons sir said hannah who guessed at the meaning though she did not understand the words you wouldnt have me dirty the doorhandle with me doughy hands that could easily be remedied by ablution there aint any ablution in the house said the mystified hannah i mean squire newcome condescended to explain the application of water in short washing shure said hannah as light broke in upon her mind i never knew that was what they called it before is benjamin at home yes sir he was out playin in the yard a minute ago i guess you can see him from the winder so saying she stepped forward and looking out all at once gave a shrill scream and rushed from the room leaving her employer in his boltupright attitude gazing after her with as much astonishment as he was capable of the cause of her sudden exit was revealed on looking out of the window master benjamin or ben as he was called everywhere except in his own family had got possession of the black kitten and appeared to be submerging her in the hogshead of rainwater o you wicked cruel boy to drown poor kitty exclaimed the indignant hannah rushing into the yard and endeavoring to snatch her feline favorite an attempt which ben stoutly resisted doubtless the poor kitten would have fared badly between the two had not the window opened and the deliberate voice of his father called out in tones which ben saw fit to heed what come into my presence immejiately and learn to answer me with more respect ben came in looking half defiant his father whose perpendicularity made him look like a sitting grenadier commenced the examination thus i wish you to inform me what you was a doing of when i spoke to you it will be observed that the squires dignified utterances were sometimes a little at variance with the rule of the best modern grammarians i was trying to prevent hannah from taking the kitten said ben what was you a doing of before hannah went out playing with kitty why were you standing near the hogshead benjamin why said ben ingenuously the hogshead happened to be near me that was all were you not trying to drown the kitten o i wouldnt drown her for anything said ben with an injured expression mentally adding short of a threecent piece then to repeat my interrogatory what was you a doing of with the kitten in the hogshead i was teaching her to swim said ben looking out of the corner of his eye at his father to see what impression this explanation made upon him and what advantageous result do you think would be brought about by teaching of the kitten to swim benjamin persisted his father advantageous result repeated ben demurely pretending not to understand certingly what does that mean do you not study your dictionary at school benjamin yes but i dont like it much you are very much in error you will never learn to employ your tongue with elegance and precision unless you engage in this beneficial study i can use my tongue well enough without studying grammar said ben he proceeded to illustrate the truth of this assertion by twisting his tongue about in a comical manner tongue exclaimed his father is but another name for language i mean your native language oh ben was about to leave the room to avoid further questions of an embarrassing nature when his father interrupted his exit by saying stay benjamin do not withdraw till i have made all the inquiries which i intend the boy unwillingly returned you have not answered my question ive forgotten what it was what good would it do asked the squire simplifying his speech to reach bens comprehension what good would it do to teach the kitten to swim o i thought said ben hesitating that some time or other she might happen to fall into the water and might not be able to get out unless she knew how i think said his father with an unusual display of sagacity that she will be in much greater hazard of drowning while learning to swim under your direction than by any other chance likely to befall her shouldnt wonder was bens mental comment pretty cute for you dad fortunately ben did not express his thoughts aloud they would have implied such an utter lack of respect that the squire would have been quite overwhelmed by the reflection that his impressive manners had produced no greater effect on one who had so excellent a chance of being impressed by them benjamin concluded his father i have an errand for you to execute you may go to mr prescotts and see if he is yet living i hear that he is a lying on the brink of the grave an expression of sadness stole over the usually merry face of ben as he started on his errand poor paul he thought what will he do when his father dies hes such a capital fellow too i just wish i had a wagon load of money i do and id give him half thats so ii paul prescotts home we will precede ben on his visit to the house of mr prescott it was an old weatherbeaten house of one story about half a mile distant from squire newcomes residence the prescott family had lived here for five years or ever since they had removed to wrenville until within a year they had lived comfortably when two blows came in quick succession the first was the death of mrs prescott an excellent woman whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son soon afterwards mr prescott a carpenter by trade while at work upon the roof of a high building fell off and not only broke his leg badly but suffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature he had not been able to do a stroke of work since after some months it became evident that he would never recover a year had now passed during this time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had succeeded in laying up previous to his sickness it was clear that at his death there would be nothing left at thirteen years of age paul would have to begin the world without a penny mr prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen paul a thoughtfullooking boy sat beside it ready to answer his call there had been silence for some time when mr prescott called feebly paul i am here father said paul i am almost gone paul i dont think i shall last through the day o father said paul sorrowfully dont leave me that is the only grief i have in dying i must leave you to struggle for yourself paul i shall be able to leave you absolutely nothing dont think of that father i am young and strong i can earn my living in some way i hoped to live long enough to give you an education i wanted you to have a fairer start in the world than i had never mind father said paul soothingly dont be uneasy about me god will provide for me again there was a silence broken only by the difficult breathing of the sick man he spoke again there is one thing paul that i want to tell you before i die paul drew closer to the bedside it is something which has troubled me as i lay here i shall feel easier for speaking of it you remember that we lived at cedarville before we came here yes father about two years before we left there a promising speculation was brought to my notice an agent of a lake superior mine visited our village and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of my neighbors bought shares fully expecting to double their money in a year among the rest i was attacked with the fever of speculation i had always been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation and had not been able to do much more than support my family this it seemed to me afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something which might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of sickness i had but about two hundred dollars however and from so scanty an investment i could not of course expect a large return accordingly i went to squire conant you remember him paul yes father i went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars after some hesitation he agreed to lend it to me he was fond of his money and not much given to lending but it so happened that he had invested in the same speculation and had a high opinion of it so he felt pretty safe in advancing me the money well this loan gave me seven hundred dollars with which i purchased seven shares in the lake superior grand combination mining company for some months afterwards i felt like a rich man i carefully put away my certificate of stock looking upon it as the beginning of a competence but at the end of six months the bubble burst the stock proved to be utterly worthless squire conant lost five thousand dollars i lost seven hundred five hundred being borrowed money the squires loss was much larger but mine was the more serious since i lost everything and was plunged into debt while he had at least forty thousand dollars left two days after the explosion squire conant came into my shop and asked abruptly when i could pay him the amount i had borrowed i told him that i could not fix a time i said that i had been overwhelmed by a result so contrary to my anticipations but i told him i would not rest till i had done something to satisfy his claim he was always an unreasonable man and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless speculation as if i could foresee how it would end any better than he have you ever been able to pay back any part of the five hundred dollars father i have paid the interest regularly and a year ago just before i met with my accident i had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which i had intended to pay the squire but when my sickness came i felt obliged to retain it to defray our expenses being cut off from earning anything then i suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last year no have you heard from the squire lately yes i had a letter only last week you remember bringing me one postmarked cedarville yes i wondered at the time who it could be from you will find it on the mantelpiece i should like to have you get it and read it paul readily found the letter it was enclosed in a brown envelope directed in a bold hand to mr john prescott wrenville the letter was as follows cedarville april mr john prescott sir i have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five hundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me on account of a loan which i was fool enough to make you seven years since i thought you an honest man but i have found to my cost that i was mistaken for the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated between us your intention is evident i quite understand that you have made up your mind to defraud me of what is rightfully mine i dont know how you may regard this but i consider it as bad as highway robbery i do not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the penitentiary let me advise you if you wish to avoid further trouble to make no delay in paying a portion of this debt yours etc ezekiel conant pauls face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel letter does squire conant know that you are sick father he inquired yes i wrote him about my accident telling him at the same time that i regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must occasion in my payments and knowing this he wrote such a letter as that said paul indignantly what a hard unfeeling wretch he must be i suppose it is vexatious to him to be kept out of his money but he has plenty more he would never miss it if he had given it to you outright that is not the way to look at it paul the money is justly his and it is a great sorrow to me that i must die without paying it father said paul after a pause will it be any relief to you if i promise to pay it that is if i am ever able mr prescotts face brightened that was what i wanted to ask you paul it will be a comfort to me to feel that there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day then dont let it trouble you any longer father the debt shall be mine and i will pay it again a shadow passed over the sick mans face poor boy he said why should i burden your young life with such a load you will have to struggle hard enough as it is no paul recall your promise i dont want to purchase comfort at such a price no father said paul sturdily it is too late now i have made the promise and i mean to stick to it besides it will give me something to live for i am young i may have a great many years before me for thirteen years you have supported me it is only right that i should make what return i can ill keep my promise father may god help and prosper you my boy said mr prescott solemnly youve been a good son i pray that you may grow up to be a good man but my dear i feel tired i think i will try to go to sleep paul smoothed the comforter adjusting it carefully about his fathers neck and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place upon the fire their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted and paul was obliged to go into the woods near by to obtain such loose fagots as he might find upon the ground he was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a whistle looking up he discovered ben newcome approaching him how are you paul pretty well ben how precious lonesome you must be mewed up in the house all the time yes it is lonesome but i wouldnt mind that if i thought father would ever get any better how is he this morning pretty low i expect he is asleep he said he was tired just before i went out i brought over something for you said ben tugging away at his pocket opening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown i found em in the closet he said wont hannah make a precious row when she finds em gone then i dont know as i ought to take them said paul though to tell the truth they looked tempting to him o nonsense said ben they dont belong to hannah she only likes to scold a little it does her good the two boys sat on the doorstep and talked while paul ate the turnovers ben watched the process with much satisfaction aint they prime he said first rate said paul wont you have one no said ben you see i thought while i was about it i might as well take four so i ate two coming along in about fifteen minutes paul went into the house to look at his father he was lying very quietly upon the bed paul drew near and looked at him more closely there was something in the expression of his fathers face which terrified him ben heard his sudden cry of dismay and hurriedly entered paul pointed to the bed and said briefly fathers dead ben who in spite of his mischievous propensities was gifted with a warm heart sat down beside paul and passing his arm round his neck gave him that silent sympathy which is always so grateful to the griefstricken heart iii pauls brilliant prospects two days later the funeral of mr prescott took place poor paul it seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow his father and mother both gone he felt that he was indeed left alone in the world no thought of the future had yet entered his mind he was wholly occupied with his present sorrow desolate at heart he slipped away from the graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over and took his way back again to the lonely dwelling which he had called home as he was sitting in the corner plunged in sorrowful thought there was a scraping heard at the door and a loud hem looking up paul saw entering the cottage the stiff form of squire benjamin newcome who as has already been stated was the owner paul said the squire with measured deliberation do you mean me sir asked paul vaguely conscious that his name had been called did i not address you by your baptismal appellation demanded the squire who thought the boys question superfluous paul pursued squire newcome have you thought of your future destination no sir said paul i suppose i shall live here that arrangement would not be consistent with propriety i suppose you are aware that your deceased parent left little or no worldly goods i know he was poor therefore it has been thought best that you should be placed in charge of a worthy man who i see is now approaching the house you will therefore accompany him without resistance if you obey him and read the bible regularly you will ahem you will some time or other see the advantage of it with this consolatory remark squire newcome wheeled about and strode out of the house immediately afterwards there entered a roughlooking man arrayed in a farmers blue frock youre to come with me youngster said mr nicholas mudge for that was his name with you said paul recoiling instinctively in fact there was nothing attractive in the appearance or manners of mr mudge he had a coarse hard face while his head was surmounted by a shock of red hair which to all appearance had suffered little interference from the comb for a time which the observer would scarcely venture to compute there was such an utter absence of refinement about the man that paul who had been accustomed to the gentle manners of his father was repelled by the contrast which this man exhibited to be sure youre to go with me said mr mudge you did not calclate you was a goin to stay here by yourself did you weve got a better place for you than that but the wagons waitin outside so just be lively and bundle in and ill carry you to where youre a goin to live wheres that wal some folks call it the poor house but it aint any the worse for that i expect anyhow them as has no money may feel themselves lucky to get so good a home so jest be a movin for i cant be a waitin here all day paul quietly submitted himself to the guidance of mr mudge he was so occupied with the thought of his sad loss that he did not realize the change that was about to take place in his circumstances about half a mile from the village in the bleakest and most desolate part of the town stood the poor house it was a crazy old building of extreme antiquity which being no longer considered fit for an ordinary dwellinghouse had been selected as a suitable residence for the towns poor it was bleak and comfortless to be sure but on that very account had been purchased at a trifling expense and that was of course a primary consideration connected with the house were some dozen acres of roughlooking land plentifully overspread with stones which might have filled with despair the most enterprising agriculturist however it had this recommendation at least that it was quite in character with the buildings upon it which in addition to the house already described consisted of a barn of equal antiquity and a pig pen this magnificent domain was under the superintendence of mr nicholas mudge who in consideration of taking charge of the town paupers had the use of the farm and buildings rent free together with a stipulated weekly sum for each of the inmates well paul said mr mudge as they approached the house in a tone which was meant to be encouraging this is goin to be your home how do you like it thus addressed paul ventured a glance around him i dont know said he doubtfully it dont look very pleasant dont look very pleasant repeated mr mudge in a tone of mingled amazement and indignation well theres gratitude for you after the town has been at the expense of providin a nice comfortable home for you because you havent got any of your own you must turn up your nose at it i didnt mean to complain said paul feeling very little interest in the matter perhaps you expected to live in a marble palace pursued mr mudge in an injured tone we dont have any marble palaces in this neighborhood we dont paul disclaimed any such anticipation mr mudge deigned to accept pauls apology and as they had now reached the door unceremoniously threw it open and led the way into a room with floor unpainted which to judge from its appearance was used as a kitchen iv life in a new phase everything was at sixes and sevens as the saying is in the room mr mudge and paul had just entered in the midst of the scene was a large stout woman in a faded calico dress and sleeves rolled up working as if her life or the worlds destiny depended upon it it was evident from the first words of mr mudge that this lady was his helpmeet well wife he said ive brought you another boarder you must try to make him as happy and contented as the rest of em are from the tone of the speaker the last words might be understood to be jocular mrs mudge whose style of beauty was not improved by a decided squint fixed a scrutinizing gaze upon paul and he quite naturally returned it havent you ever seen anybody before boy i guess youll know me next time shouldnt wonder if he did chuckled mr mudge i dont know where on earth we shall put him remarked the lady were full now oh put him anywhere i suppose you wont be very particular about your accommodations said mr mudge turning to paul paul very innocently answered in the negative thereby affording mr mudge not a little amusement well thats lucky he said because our best front chambers occupied just now wed have got it ready for you if youd only wrote a week ago to tell us you were coming you can just stay round here he said in a different tone as he was about leaving the room mrs mudge will maybe want you to do something for her you can sit down till she calls on you it was washing day with mrs mudge and of course she was extremely busy the water was to be brought from a well in the yard and to this office paul was at once delegated it was no easy task the full pails tugging most unmercifully at his arms however this was soon over and mrs mudge graciously gave him permission to go into the adjoining room and make acquaintance with his fellowboarders there were nine of them in all paul the newcomer making the tenth they were all advanced in years except one young woman who was prevented by mental aberration from supporting herself outside the walls of the institution of all present pauls attention was most strongly attracted towards one who appeared more neatly and scrupulously attired than any of the rest aunt lucy lee or plain aunt lucy for in her present abode she had small use for her last name was a benevolentlooking old lady who both in dress and manners was distinguished from her companions she rose from her knitting and kindly took paul by the hand children are instinctive readers of character and paul after one glance at her benevolent face seated himself contentedly beside her i suppose said the old lady socially youve come to live with us we must do all we can to make you comfortable your name is paul prescott i think mrs mudge said yes maam answered paul watching the rapid movement of the old ladys fingers mine is aunt lucy she continued that is what everybody calls me so now we know each other and shall soon be good friends i hope i suppose you have hardly been here long enough to tell how you shall like it paul confessed that thus far he did not find it very pleasant no i dare say not said aunt lucy i cant say i think it looks very attractive myself however it isnt wholly the fault of mr and mrs mudge they cant afford to do much better for the town allows them very little aunt lucys remarks were here interrupted by the apparition of the worthy landlady at the door dinners ready folks said that lady with little ceremony and you must come out quick if you want any for im drove with work and cant be hindered long the summons was obeyed with alacrity and the company made all haste to the diningroom or rather the kitchen for it was here that the meals were eaten in the center of the room was set a table without a cloth a tablecloth being considered a luxury quite superfluous upon this were placed several bowls of thin watery liquid intended for soup but which like city milk was diluted so as hardly to be distinguishable beside each bowl was a slice of bread such was the bill of fare now folks the sooner you fall to the better exclaimed the energetic mrs mudge who was one of those driving characters who consider any time spent at the table beyond ten minutes as so much time wasted the present company appeared to need no second invitation their scanty diet had the positive advantage of giving them a good appetite otherwise the quality of their food might have daunted them paul took his place beside aunt lucy mechanically he did as the rest carrying to his mouth a spoonful of the liquid but his appetite was not sufficiently accustomed to poor house regime to enable him to relish its standing dish and he laid down his spoon with a disappointed look he next attacked the crust of bread but found it too dry to be palatable please maam said he to mrs mudge i should like some butter pauls companions dropped their spoons in astonishment at his daring and mrs mudge let fall a kettle she was removing from the fire in sheer amazement what did you ask for she inquired as if to make sure that her ears did not deceive her a little butter repeated paul unconscious of the great presumption of which he had been guilty you want butter do you repeated mr mudge perhaps youd like a slice of beefsteak and a piece of plumpudding too wouldnt you i should very much said paul resolved to tell the truth although he now began to perceive the sarcasm in his landladys tone there isnt anything more you would like is there inquired the lady with mock politeness no maam returned paul after a pause i believe not today very moderate upon my word exclaimed mrs mudge giving vent at length to her pentup indignation youll be contented with butter and roast beef and plumpudding a mighty fine gentleman to be sure but you wont get them here ill be bound so will i thought aunt lucy if you aint satisfied with what i give you pursued mrs mudge youd better go somewhere else you can put up at some of the great hotels butter forsooth having thus given expression to her feelings she left the room and paul was left to finish his dinner with the best appetite he could command he was conscious that he had offended mrs mudge but the thoughts of his recent great sorrow swallowed up all minor annoyances so that the words of his estimable landlady were forgotten almost as soon as they were uttered he felt that he must henceforth look for far different treatment from that to which he had been accustomed during his fathers lifetime his thoughts were interrupted in a manner somewhat ludicrous by the crazy girl who sat next to him coolly appropriating to herself his bowl of soup having already disposed of her own look said aunt lucy quickly calling pauls attention you are losing your dinner never mind said paul amused in spite of his sadness she is quite welcome to it if she likes it i cant eat it so the dinner began and ended it was very brief and simple occupying less than ten minutes and comprising only one course unless the soup was considered the first course and the bread the second paul left the table as hungry as he came to it aunt lucys appetite had become accustomed to the mudge diet and she wisely ate what was set before her knowing that there was no hope of anything better about an hour after dinner ben newcome came to the door of the poor house and inquired for paul mrs mudge was in one of her crusty moods you cant see him said she and why not said ben resolutely because hes busy youd better let me see him said ben sturdily i should like to know whats going to happen if i dont said mrs mudge with wrathful eyes and arms akimbo i shall go home and report to my father said ben coolly who is your father asked mrs mudge for she did not recognize her visitor my fathers name is newcome squire newcome some call him now it so happened that squire newcome was chairman of the overseers of the poor and in that capacity might remove mr mudge from office if he pleased accordingly mrs mudge softened down at once on learning that ben was his son oh said she i didnt know who it was i thought it might be some idle boy from the village who would only take paul from his work but if you have a message from your father this she said to ascertain whether he really had any message or not but ben who had in fact come without his fathers knowledge only bowed and said in a patronizing manner i accept your apology mrs mudge will you have the goodness to send paul out wont you step in asked mrs mudge with unusual politeness no i believe not paul was accordingly sent out he was very glad to meet his schoolmate and playfellow ben who by his gayety spiced though it was with roguery had made himself a general favorite in school i say paul said ben im sorry to find you in such a place it isnt very pleasant said paul rather soberly and that woman mrs mudge she looks as if she might be a regular spitfire isnt she rather so i only wish the old gentleman meaning of course the squire would take you to live with me i want a fellow to play with but i say paul go and get your hat and well go out for a walk i dont know what mrs mudge will say said paul who had just come from turning the handle of a churn just call mrs mudge and ill manage it mrs mudge being summoned made her appearance at the door i presume maam said ben confidently you will have no objection to pauls taking a walk with me while i deliver the message i am entrusted with certainly said mrs mudge rather unwillingly but not venturing to refuse it takes me to come it over the old lady said ben when they were out of hearing now well go a fishing v a crisis before sunrise the next morning paul was awakened by a rude shake from mr mudge with an intimation that he had better get up as there was plenty of work before him by the light of the lantern for as yet it was too dark to dispense with it paul dressed himself awakened from a sound sleep he hardly had time to collect his thoughts and it was with a look of bewilderment that he surveyed the scene about him as mrs mudge had said they were pretty full already and accordingly a rude pallet had been spread for him in the attic of which with the exception of nocturnal marauders he was the only occupant paul had not to be sure been used to very superior accommodations and if the bed had not been quite so hard he would have got along very well as it was he was separated from slats only by a thin straw bed which did not improve matters much it was therefore with a sense of weariness which slumber had not dissipated that paul arose at the summons of mr mudge when he reached the kitchen he found that gentleman waiting for him do you know how to milk was his first salutation i never learned said paul then youll have to in doublequick time was the reply for i dont relish getting up so early and you can take it off my hands the two proceeded to the barn where paul received his first lesson in this important branch of education mr mudge kept five cows one might have thought he could have afforded a moderate supply of milk to his boarders but all with the exception of a single quart was sold to the milkman who passed the door every morning after breakfast which was on the same economical plan with the dinner of the day previous paul was set to work planting potatoes at which he was kept steadily employed till the dinnerhour poor paul his back ached dreadfully for he had never before done any harder work than trifling services for his father but the inexorable mr mudge was in sight and however much he wished he did not dare to lay aside his hoe even for a moment twelve oclock found him standing beside the dinnertable he ate more heartily than before for his forenoons labor made even poorhouse fare palatable mrs mudge observed the change and remarked in a satisfied tone well my fine gentleman i see you are coming to your appetite i thought you wouldnt hold out long paul who had worn off something of his diffidence could not help feeling indignant at this speech unaccustomed to be addressed in this way the taunt jarred upon his feelings but he only bit his lip and preserved silence aunt lucy too who had come to feel a strong interest in paul despite her natural mildness could not resist the temptation of saying with some warmth whats the use of persecuting the child he has sorrows enough of his own without your adding to them mrs mudge was not a little incensed at this remonstrance i should like to know maam who requested you to put in your oar she said with arms akimbo anybody wouldnt think from your lofty airs that you lived in the poorhouse ill thank you to mind your own business in the future and not meddle with what dont concern you aunt lucy was wise enough to abstain from provoking further the wrath of her amiable landlady and continued to eat her soup in silence but mrs mudge neer forgot this interference nor the cause of it and henceforth with the malignity of a narrowminded and spiteful woman did what she could to make paul uncomfortable her fertile ingenuity always found some new taunt or some new reproach to assail him with but paul though at first he felt indignant learned at last to treat them as they deserved with silent disdain assured of the sympathy of those around him he did not allow his appetite to be spoiled by any remark which mrs mudge might offer this of course only provoked her the more and she strove to have his daily tasks increased in the amiable hope that his proud spirit might be tamed thereby mr mudge who was somewhat under petticoat government readily acceded to his wifes wishes and henceforth pauls strength was taxed to its utmost limit he was required to be up with the first gray tint of dawn and attend to the cattle from this time until night except the brief time devoted to his meals he was incessantly occupied aunt lucys society his chief comfort was thus taken from him since in order to rise early he was obliged to go to bed as soon as possible after days work was finished the effects of such incessant labor without a sufficient supply of nourishing food may easily be imagined the dry bread and meagre soup which constituted the chief articles of diet in mrs mudges economical household had but one recommendation they were effectual preventives of gluttony it was reported that on one occasion a beggar apparently famishing with hunger not knowing the character of the house made application at the door for food in an unusual fit of generosity mrs mudge furnished him with a slice of bread and a bowl of soup which however proved so far from tempting that the beggar hungry as he was left them almost untouched one day as paul was working in the field at a little distance from mr mudge he became conscious of a peculiar feeling of giddiness which compelled him to cling to the hoe for support otherwise he must have fallen no laziness there exclaimed mr mudge observing pauls cessation from labor we cant support you in idleness but the boy paid no regard to this admonition and mr mudge somewhat surprised advanced toward him to enforce the command even he was startled at the unusual paleness of pauls face and inquired in a less peremptory tone whats the matter i feel sick gasped paul without another word mr mudge took paul up in his arms and carried him into the house whats the matter now asked his wife meeting him at the door the boy feels a little sick but i guess hell get over it byand by havent you got a little soup that you can give him i reckon hes faint and thatll brighten him up paul evidently did not think so for he motioned away a bowl of the delightful mixture though it was proffered him by the fair hands of mrs mudge the lady was somewhat surprised and said roughly i shouldnt wonder if he was only trying to shirk this was too much even for mr mudge the boys sick said he thats plain enough if he dont get better soon i must send for the doctor for work drives and i cant spare him theres no more danger of his being sick than mine said mrs mudge emphatically however if youre fool enough to go for a doctor thats none of my business ive heard of feigning sickness before now to get rid of work as to his being pale ive been as pale as that myself sometimes without your troubling yourself very much about me twont be any expense to us alleged mr mudge in a tone of justification for he felt in some awe of his wifes temper which was none of the mildest when a little roused twont be any expense to us the town has got to pay for it and as long as it will get him ready for work sooner we might as well take advantage of it this consideration somewhat reconciled mrs mudge to the step proposed and as paul instead of getting better grew rapidly worse mr mudge thought it expedient to go immediately for the village physician luckily dr townsend was at home and an hour afterwards found him standing beside the sick boy i dont know but youll think it rather foolish our sending for you doctor said mrs mudge but mudge would have it that the boy was sick and so he went for you and he did quite right said dr townsend noticing the ghastly pallor of pauls face he is a very sick boy and if i had not been called i would not have answered for the consequences how do you feel my boy he inquired of paul i feel very weak and my head swims was the reply how and when did this attack come on asked the doctor turning to mr mudge he was taken while hoeing in the field was the reply have you kept him at work much there lately well yes ive been drove by work and he has worked there all day latterly at what time has he gone to work in the morning he has got up to milk the cows about five oclock i used to do it but since he has learned i have indulged myself a little it would have been well for him if he had enjoyed the same privilege it is my duty to speak plainly the sickness of this boy lies at your door he has never been accustomed to hard labor and yet you have obliged him to rise earlier and work later than most men no wonder he feels weak has he a good appetite well rather middlin said mrs mudge but its mainly because hes too dainty to eat whats set before him why only the first day he was here he turned up his nose at the bread and soup we had for dinner is this a specimen of the soup asked dr townsend taking from the table the bowl which had been proffered to paul and declined by him without ceremony he raised to his lips a spoonful of the soup and tasted it with a wry face do you often have this soup on the table he asked abruptly we always have it once a day and sometimes twice returned mrs mudge and you call the boy dainty because he dont relish such stuff as this said the doctor with an indignation he did not attempt to conceal why i wouldnt be hired to take the contents of that bowl it is as bad as any of my own medicines and thats saying a good deal how much nourishment do you suppose such a mixture would afford and yet with little else to sustain him you have worked this boy like a beast of burden worse even for they at least have abundance of good food mr and mrs mudge both winced under this plain speaking but they did not dare to give expression to their anger for they knew well that dr townsend was an influential man in town and by representing the affair in the proper quarter might render their hold upon their present post a very precarious one mr mudge therefore contented himself with muttering that he guessed he worked as hard as anybody and he didnt complain of his fare may i ask you mr mudge said the doctor fixing his penetrating eye full upon him whether you confine yourself to the food upon which you have kept this boy well said mr mudge in some confusion moving uneasily in his seat i cant say but now and then i eat something a little different do you eat at the same table with the inmates of your house well no said the embarrassed mr mudge tell me plainly how often do you partake of this soup i aint your patient said the man sullenly why should you want to know what i eat i have an object in view are you afraid to answer i dont know as theres anything to be afraid of the fact is i aint partial to soup it dont agree with me and so i dont take it did you ever consider that this might be the case with others as well as yourself inquired the doctor with a glance expressive of his contempt for mr mudges selfishness without waiting for a reply dr townsend ordered paul to be put to bed immediately after which he would leave some medicine for him to take here was another embarrassment for the worthy couple they hardly knew where to put our hero it would not do for them to carry him to his pallet in the attic for they felt sure that this would lead to some more plain speaking on the part of dr townsend he was accordingly though with some reluctance placed in a small bedroom upstairs which being more comfortable than those appropriated to the paupers had been reserved for a son at work in a neighboring town on his occasional visits home is there no one in the house who can sit in the chamber and attend to his occasional wants asked dr townsend he will need to take his medicine at stated periods and some one will be required to administer it theres aunt lucy lee said mrs mudge shes taken a fancy to the boy and i reckon shell do as well as anybody no one better returned the doctor who well knew aunt lucys kindness of disposition and was satisfied that she would take all possible care of his patient so it was arranged that aunt lucy should take her place at pauls bedside as his nurse paul was sick for many days not dangerously so but hard work and scanty fare had weakened him to such a degree that exhausted nature required time to recruit its wasted forces but he was not unhappy or restless hour after hour he would lie patiently and listen to the clicking of her knitting needles though not provided with luxurious food dr townsend had spoken with so much plainness that mrs mudge felt compelled to modify her treatment lest through his influence she with her husband might lose their situation this forced forbearance however was far from warming her heart towards its object mrs mudge was a hard practical woman and her heart was so encrusted with worldliness and selfinterest that she might as well have been without one one day as paul lay quietly gazing at aunt lucys benevolent face and mentally contrasting it with that of mrs mudge whose shrill voice could be heard form below he was seized with a sudden desire to learn something of her past history how long have you been here aunt lucy he inquired she looked up from her knitting and sighed as she answered a long and weary time to look back upon paul i have been here ten years ten years repeated paul thoughtfully and i am thirteen so you have been here nearly all my lifetime has mr mudge been here all that time only the last two years before that we had mrs perkins did she treat you any better than mrs mudge any better than mrs mudge vociferated that lady who had ascended the stairs without being heard by aunt lucy of paul and had thus caught the last sentence any better than mrs mudge she repeated thoroughly provoked so youve been talking about me you trollop have you ill come up with you you may depend upon that thats to pay for my giving you tea sunday night is it perhaps youll get some more its pretty well in paupers conspiring together because they aint treated like princes and princesses perhaps youd like to got boarded with queen victoria the old lady sat very quiet during this tirade she had been the subject of similar invective before and knew that it would do no good to oppose mrs mudge in her present excited state i dont wonder you havent anything to say said the infuriated dame i should think youd want to hide your face in shame you trollop paul was not quite so patient as his attendant her kindness had produced such an impression on him that mrs mudge by her taunts stirred up his indignation shes no more of a trollop than you are said he with spirit mrs mudge whirled round at this unexpected attack and shook her fist menacingly at paul so youve put in your oar you little jackanapes said she if youre well enough to be impudent youre well enough to go to work you aint a goin to lie here idle much longer i can tell you if you deceive dr townsend and make him believe youre sick you cant deceive me no doubt you feel mighty comfortable lyin here with nothing to do while im a slavin myself to death down stairs waitin upon you this was a slight exaggeration as aunt lucy took the entire charge of paul including the preparation of his food but youd better make the most of it for you wont lie here much longer youll miss not bein able to talk about me wont you mrs mudge paused a moment as if expecting an answer to her highly sarcastic question but paul felt that no advantage would be gained by saying more he was not naturally a quicktempered buy and had only been led to this little ebullition by the wanton attack by mrs mudge this lady after standing a moment as if defying the twain to a further contest went out slamming the door violently after her you did wrong to provoke her paul said aunt lucy gravely how could i help it asked paul earnestly if she had only abused me i should not have cared so much but when she spoke about you who have been so kind to me i could not be silent i thank you paul for your kind feeling said the old lady gently but we must learn to bear and forbear the best of us have our faults and failings what are yours aunt lucy o a great many such as what i am afraid i am sometimes discontented with the station which god has assigned me i dont think you can be very much to blame for that i should never learn to be contented here if i lived to the age of methuselah paul lay quite still for an hour or more during that time he formed a determination which will be announced in the next chapter vi pauls determination at the close of the last chapter it was stated that paul had come to a determination this was to run away that he had good reason for this we have already seen he was now improving rapidly and only waited till he was well enough to put his design into execution aunt lucy said he one day ive got something to tell you the old lady looked up inquiringly its something ive been thinking of a long time at least most of the time since ive been sick it isnt pleasant for me to stay here and ive pretty much made up my mind that i shant where will you go asked the old lady dropping her work in surprise i dont know of any particular place but i should be better off most anywhere than here but you are so young paul god will take care of me aunt lucy mother used to tell me that besides here i have no hope of learning anything or improving my condition then again if i stay here i can never do what father wished me to do what is that paul paul told the story of his fathers indebtedness to squire conant and the cruel letter which the squire had written i mean to pay that debt he concluded firmly i wont let anybody say that my father kept them out of their money there is no chance here somewhere else i may find work and money it is a great undertaking for a boy like you paul said aunt lucy thoughtfully to whom is the money due squire conant of cedarville aunt lucy seemed surprised and agitated by the mention of this name paul said she squire conant is my brother your brother repeated he in great surprise then why does he allow you to live here he is rich enough to take care of you it is a long story said the old lady sadly all that you will be interested to know is that i married against the wishes of my family my husband died and i was left destitute my brother has never noticed me since it is a great shame said paul we wont judge him paul have you fixed upon any time to go i shall wait a few days till i get stronger can you tell me how far it is to new york o a great distance a hundred miles at least you cant think of going so far as that i think it would be the best plan said paul in a great city like new york there must be a great many things to do which i cant do here i dont feel strong enough to work on a farm besides i dont like it o it must be a fine thing to live in a great city then too pursued paul his face lighting up with the hopeful confidence of youth i may become rich if i do aunt lucy i will build a fine house and you shall come and live with me aunt lucy had seen more of life than paul and was less sanguine the thought came to her that her life was already declining while his was but just begun and in the course of nature even if his bright dreams should be realized she could hardly hope to live long enough to see it but of this she said nothing she would not for the world have dimmed the brightness of his anticipations by the expression of a single doubt i wish you all success paul and i thank you for wishing me to share in your good fortune god helps those who help themselves and he will help you if you only deserve it i shall miss you very much when you are gone it will seem more lonely than ever if it were not for you aunt lucy i should not mind going at all but i shall be sorry to leave you behind god will care for both of us my dear boy i shall hope to hear from you now and then and if i learn that you are prosperous and happy i shall be better contented with my own lot but have you thought of all the labor and weariness that you will have to encounter it is best to consider well all this before entering upon such an undertaking i have thought of all that and if there were any prospect of my being happy here i might stay for the present but you know how mrs mudge has treated me and how she feels towards me now i acknowledge paul that it has proved a hard apprenticeship and perhaps it might be made yet harder if you should stay longer you must let me know when you are going i shall want to bid you goodby no fear that i shall forget that aunt lucy next to my mother you have been most kind to me and i love you for it lightly pressing her lips to pauls forehead aunt lucy left the room to conceal the emotion called forth by his approaching departure of all the inmates of the establishment she had felt most closely drawn to the orphan boy whose loneliness and bereavement had appealed to her womans heart this feeling had been strengthened by the care she had been called to bestow upon him in his illness for it is natural to love those whom we have benefited but aunt lucy was the most unselfish of living creatures and the idea of dissuading paul from a course which he felt was right never occurred to her she determined that she would do what she could to further his plans now that he had decided to go accordingly she commenced knitting him a pair of stockings knowing that this would prove a useful present this came near being the means of discovering pauls plan to mrs mudge the latter who notwithstanding her numerous duties managed to see everything that was going on had her attention directed to aunt lucys work have you finished the stockings that i set you to knitting for mr mudge she asked no said aunt lucy in some confusion then whose are those i should like to know somebody of more importance than my husband i suppose they are for paul returned the old lady in some uneasiness paul repeated mrs mudge in her haste putting a double quantity of salaeratus into the bread she was mixing pauls are they and who asked you to knit him a pair i should like to be informed no one then what are you doing it for i thought he might want them mighty considerate i declare and i shouldnt be at all surprised if you were knitting them with the yarn i gave you for mr mudges stockings you are mistaken said aunt lucy shortly oh youre putting on your airs are you ill tell you what madam youd better put those stockings away in doublequick time and finish my husbands or ill throw them into the fire and paul prescott may wait till he goes barefoot before he gets them there was no alternative aunt lucy was obliged to obey at least while her persecutor was in the room when alone for any length of time she took out pauls stockings from under her apron and worked on them till the approaching steps of mrs mudge warned her to desist three days passed the shadows of twilight were already upon the earth the paupers were collected in the common room appropriated to their use aunt lucy had suspended her work in consequence of the darkness for in this economical household a lamp was considered a useless piece of extravagance paul crept quietly to her side and whispered in tones audible to her alone i am going tomorrow tomorrow so soon yes said paul i am as ready now as i shall ever be i wanted to tell you because i thought maybe you might like to know that this is the last evening we shall spend together at present do you go in the morning yes aunt lucy early in the morning mr mudge usually calls me at five i must be gone an hour before that time i suppose i must bid you goodby tonight not tonight paul i shall be up in the morning to see you go but if mrs mudge finds it out she will abuse you i am used to that paul said aunt lucy with a sorrowful smile i have borne it many times and i can again but i cant lie quiet and let you go without one word of parting you are quite determined to go quite aunt lucy i never could stay here there is no pleasure in the present and no hope for the future i want to see something of life and pauls boyish figure dilated with enthusiasm god grant that you do not see too much said aunt lucy half to herself is the world then so very sad a place asked paul both joy and sorrow are mingled in the cup of human life said aunt lucy solemnly which shall preponderate it is partly in our power to determine he who follows the path of duty steadfastly cannot be wholly miserable whatever misfortunes may come upon him he will be sustained by the conviction that his own errors have not brought them upon him i will try to do right said paul placing his hand in that of his companion and if ever i am tempted to do wrong i will think of you and of my mother and that thought shall restrain me its time to go bed folks proclaimed mrs mudge appearing at the door i cant have you sitting up all night as ive no doubt youd like to do it was only eight oclock but no one thought of interposing an objection the word of mrs mudge was law in her household as even her husband was sometimes made aware all quietly rose from their seats and repaired to bed it was an affecting sight to watch the tottering gait of those on whose heads the snows of many winters had drifted heavily as they meekly obeyed the behest of one whose coarse nature forbade her sympathizing with them in their clouded age and many infirmities come said she impatient of their slow movements move a little quicker if its perfectly convenient anybodyd think youd been hard at work all day as i have youre about the laziest set i ever had anything to do with ive got to be up early in the morning and cant stay here dawdling shes got a sweet temper said paul in a whisper to aunt lucy hush said the old lady she may hear you whats that youre whispering about said mrs mudge suspiciously something youre ashamed to have heard most likely paul thought it best to remain silent tomorrow morning at four he whispered to aunt lucy as he pressed her hand in the darkness vii paul begins his journey paul ascended the stairs to his hard pallet for the last time for the last time there is sadness in the thought even when the future which lies before us glows with brighter colors than the past has ever worn but to paul whose future was veiled in uncertainty and who was about to part with the only friend who felt an interest in his welfare this thought brought increased sorrow he stood before the dirtbegrimed window through which alone the struggling sunbeams found an inlet into the gloomy little attic and looked wistfully out upon the barren fields that surrounded the poorhouse where would he be on the morrow at that time he did not know he knew little or nothing of the great world without yet his resolution did not for an instant falter if it had the thought of mrs mudge would have been enough to remove all his hesitation he threw himself on his hard bed and a few minutes brought him that dreamless sleep which comes so easily to the young meanwhile aunt lucy whose thoughts were also occupied with pauls approaching departure had taken from the pocket of her other dress for she had but two something wrapped in a piece of brown paper one by one she removed the many folds in which it was enveloped and came at length to the contents it was a coin paul will need some money poor boy said she softly to herself i will give him this it will never do me any good and it may be of some service to him so saying she looked carefully at the coin in the moonlight but what made her start and utter a half exclamation instead of the gold eagle the accumulation of many years which she had been saving for some extraordinary occasion like the presents she held in her hand a copper cent i have been robbed she exclaimed indignantly in the suddenness of her surprise whats the matter now inquired mrs mudge appearing at the door why are you not in bed aunt lucy lee how dare you disobey my orders i have been robbed exclaimed the old lady in unwonted excitement of what pray asked mrs mudge with a sneer i had a gold eagle wrapped up in that paper returned aunt lucy pointing to the fragments on the floor and now tonight when i come to open it i find but this cent a likely story retorted mrs mudge very likely indeed that a common pauper should have a gold eagle if you found a cent in the paper most likely thats what you put there youre growing old and forgetful so dont get foolish and flighty youd better go to bed but i did have the gold and its been stolen persisted aunt lucy whose disappointment was the greater because she intended the money for paul again exclaimed mrs mudge will you never have done with this folly even if you did have the gold which i dont for an instant believe you couldnt keep it a pauper has no right to hold property then why did the one who stole the little i had leave me this said the old lady scornfully holding up the cent which had been substituted for the gold how should i know exclaimed mrs mudge wrathfully you talk as if you thought i had taken your trumpery money so you did chimed in an unexpected voice which made mrs mudge start nervously it was the young woman already mentioned who was bereft of reason but who at times as often happens in such cases seemed gifted with preternatural acuteness so you did i saw you i did i saw you creep up when you thought nobody was looking and search her pocket you opened that paper and took out the bright yellow piece and put in another you didnt think i was looking at you ha ha how i laughed as i stood behind the door and saw you tremble for fear some one would catch you thieving you didnt think of me dear did you and the wild creature burst into an unmeaning laugh mrs mudge stood for a moment mute overwhelmed by this sudden revelation but for the darkness aunt lucy could have seen the sudden flush which overspread her face with the crimson hue of detected guilt but this was only for a moment it was quickly succeeded by a feeling of intense anger towards the unhappy creature who had been the means of exposing her ill teach you to slander your betters you crazy fool she exclaimed in a voice almost inarticulate with passion as she seized her rudely by the arm and dragged her violently from the room she returned immediately i suppose said she abruptly confronting aunt lucy that you are fool enough to believe her ravings i bring no accusation said the old lady calmly if your conscience acquits you it is not for me to accuse you but what do you think persisted mrs mudge whose consciousness of guilt did not leave her quite at ease i cannot read the heart said aunt lucy composedly i can only say that pauper as i am i would not exchange places with the one who has done this deed do you mean me demanded mrs mudge you can tell best i tell you what aunt lucy lee said mrs mudge her eyes blazing with anger if you dare insinuate to any living soul that i stole your paltry money which i dont believe you ever had i will be bitterly revenged upon you she flaunted out of the room and aunt lucy the first bitterness of her disappointment over retired to bed and slept more tranquilly than the unscrupulous woman who had robbed her at a quarter before four paul started from his humble couch and hastily dressed himself took up a little bundle containing all his scanty stock of clothing and noiselessly descended the two flights of stairs which separated him from the lower story here he paused a moment for aunt lucy to appear her sharp ears had distinguished his stealthy steps as he passed her door and she came down to bid him goodby she had in her hands a pair of stockings which she slipped into his bundle i wish i had something else to give you paul she said but you know that i am not very rich dear aunt lucy said paul kissing her you are my only friend on earth you have been very kind to me and i never will forget you never byandby when i am rich i will build a fine house and you will come and live with me wont you pauls bright anticipations improbable as they were had the effect of turning his companions thoughts into a more cheerful channel she bent down and kissed him whispering softly yes i will paul then its a bargain said he joyously mind you dont forget it i shall come for you one of these days when you least expect it have you any money inquired aunt lucy paul shook his head then said she drawing from her finger a gold ring which had held its place for many long years here is something which will bring you a little money if you are ever in distress paul hung back i would rather not take it indeed i would he said earnestly i would rather go hungry for two or three days than sell your ring besides i shall not need it god will provide for me but you need not sell it urged aunt lucy unless it is absolutely necessary you can take it and keep it in remembrance of me keep it till you see me again paul it will be a pledge to me that you will come back again some day on that condition i will take it said paul and some day i will bring it back a slight noise above as of some one stirring in sleep excited the apprehensions of the two and warned them that it was imprudent for them to remain longer in conversation after a hurried goodby aunt lucy quietly went upstairs again and paul shouldering his bundle walked rapidly away the birds awakening from their nights repose were beginning to carol forth their rich songs of thanksgiving for the blessing of a new day from the flowers beneath his feet and the blossomladen branches above his head a delicious perfume floated out upon the morning air and filled the heart of the young wanderer with a sense of the joyousness of existence and inspired him with a hopeful confidence in the future for the first time he felt that he belonged to himself at the age of thirteen he had taken his fortune in his own hand and was about to mold it as best he might there were care and toil and privations before him no doubt but in that bright morning hour he could harbor only cheerful and trusting thoughts hopefully he looked forward to the time when he could fulfil his fathers dying injunction and lift from his name the burden of a debt unpaid then his mind reverting to another thought he could not help smiling at the surprise and anger of mr mudge when he should find that his assistant had taken french leave he thought he should like to be concealed somewhere where he could witness the commotion excited by his own departure but as he could not be in two places at the same time he must lose that satisfaction he had cut loose from the mudge household as he trusted forever he felt that a new and brighter life was opening before him viii a friend in need our hero did not stop till he had put a good five miles between himself and the poorhouse he knew that it would not be long before mr mudge would discover his absence and the thought of being carried back was doubly distasteful to him now that he had even for a short time felt the joy of being his own master his hurried walk taken in the fresh morning air gave him quite a sharp appetite luckily he had the means of gratifying it the night before he had secreted half his supper knowing that he should need it more the next morning he thought he might now venture to sit down and eat it at a little distance from the road was a spring doubtless used for cattle since it was situated at the lower end of a pasture close beside and bending over it was a broad branching oak which promised a cool and comfortable shelter thats just the place for me thought paul who felt thirsty as well as hungry i think i will take breakfast here and rest awhile before i go any farther so saying he leaped lightly over the rail fence and making his way to the place indicated sat down in the shadow of the tree scooping up some water in the hollow of his hand he drank a deep and refreshing draught he next proceeded to pull out of his pocket a small package which proved to contain two small pieces of bread his long morning walk had given him such an appetite that he was not long in despatching all he had it is said by some learned physicians who no doubt understand the matter that we should always rise from the table with an appetite probably paul had never heard of this rule nevertheless he seemed in a fair way of putting it into practice for the best of reasons because he could not help it his breakfast though not the most inviting being simply unbuttered bread and rather dry at that seemed more delicious than ever before but unfortunately there was not enough of it however as there seemed likely to be no more forthcoming he concluded in default of breakfast to lie down under the tree for a few minutes before resuming his walk though he could not help wondering vaguely where his dinner was to come from as that time was several hours distant he wisely decided not to anticipate trouble till it came lying down under the tree paul began to consider what mr mudge would say when he discovered that he had run away hell have to milk the cows himself thought paul he wont fancy that much wont mrs mudge scold thought im glad i shant be within hearing holloa it was a boys voice that paul heard looking up he saw a sedate company of cows entering the pasture single file through an aperture made by letting down the bars behind them walked a boy of about his own size flourishing a stout hickory stick the cows went directly to the spring from which paul had already drunk the young driver looked at our hero with some curiosity wondering doubtless what brought him there so early in the morning after a little hesitation he said remarking pauls bundle where are you traveling i dont know exactly said paul who was not quite sure whether it would be politic to avow his destination dont know returned the other evidently surprised not exactly i may go to new york new york thats a great ways off do you know the way there no but i can find it are you going all alone asked his new acquaintance who evidently thought paul had undertaken a very formidable journey yes are you going to walk all the way yes unless somebody offers me a ride now and then but why dont you ride in the stage or in the cars you would get there a good deal quicker one reason said paul hesitating a little is because i have no money to pay for riding then how do you expect to live have you had any breakfast this morning i brought some with me and just got through eating it when you came along and where do you expect to get any dinner pursued his questioner who was evidently not a little puzzled by the answers he received i dont know returned paul his companion looked not a little confounded at this view of the matter but presently a bright thought struck him i shouldnt wonder he said shrewdly if you were running away paul hesitated a moment he knew that his case must look a little suspicious thus unexplained and after a brief pause for reflection determined to take the questioner into his confidence he did this the more readily because his new acquaintance looked very pleasant youve guessed right he said if youll promise not to tell anybody ill tell you all about it this was readily promised and the boy who gave his name as john burgess sat down beside paul while he with the frankness of boyhood gave a circumstantial account of his fathers death and the illtreatment he had met with subsequently do you come from wrenville asked john interested why ive got relations there perhaps you know my cousin ben newcome is ben newcome your cousin o yes i know him very well hes a firstrate fellow he isnt much like his father not at all if he was you wouldnt like him so well uncle talks a little too much out of the dictionary and walks so straight that he bends backward but i say paul old mudge deserves to be choked and mrs mudge should be obliged to swallow a gallon of her own soup i dont know but that would be worse than choking i wouldnt have stayed so long if i had been in your place i shouldnt said paul if it hadnt been for aunt lucy was she an aunt of yours no but we used to call her so shes the best friend ive got and i dont know but the only one said paul a little sadly no she isnt said john quickly ill be your friend paul sometime perhaps i shall go to new york myself and then i will come and see you where do you expect to be i dont know anything about the city said paul but if you come i shall be sure to see you somewhere i wish you were going now neither paul nor his companion had much idea of the extent of the great metropolis or they would not have taken it so much as a matter of course that being in the same place they should meet each other their conversation was interrupted by the ringing of a bell from a farmhouse within sight thats our breakfastbell said john rising from the grass it is meant for me i suppose they wonder what keeps me so long wont you come and take breakfast with me paul i guess not said paul who would have been glad to do so had he followed the promptings of his appetite im afraid your folks would ask me questions and then it would be found out that i am running away i didnt think of that returned john after a pause you havent got any dinner with you he said a moment after no well ill tell you what ill do come with me as far as the fence and lie down there till ive finished breakfast then ill bring something out for you and maybe ill walk along a little way with you you are very kind said paul gratefully oh nonsense said john thats nothing besides you know we are going to be friends john breakfasts ready theres nelson calling me said john hurriedly i must leave you theres the fence lie down there and ill be back in a jiffy john i say why dont you come im coming you mustnt think everybodys got such a thundering great appetite as you nelson i guess youve got enough to keep you from pining away said nelson goodnaturedly youre twice as fat as i am thats because i work harder said john rather illogically the brothers went in to breakfast but a few minutes elapsed before john reappeared bearing under his arm a parcel wrapped up in an old newspaper he came up panting with the haste he had made it didnt take you long to eat breakfast said paul no i hurried through it i thought you would get tired of waiting and now ill walk along with you a little ways but wait heres something for you so saying he unrolled the newspaper and displayed a loaf of bread fresh and warm which looked particularly inviting to paul whose scanty breakfast had by no means satisfied his appetite besides this there was a loaf of molasses gingerbread with which all who were born in the country or know anything of new england housekeeping are familiar there said john i guess thatll be enough for your dinner but how did you get it without having any questions asked inquired our hero oh said john i asked mother for them and when she asked what i wanted of them i told her that id answer that question tomorrow you see i wanted to give you a chance to get off out of the way though mother wouldnt tell even if she knew all right said paul with satisfaction he could not help looking wistfully at the bread which looked very inviting to one accustomed to poorhouse fare if you wouldnt mind he said hesitating i would like to eat a little of the bread now mind of course not said john breaking off a liberal slice why didnt i think of that before walking must have given you a famous appetite john looked on with evident approbation while paul ate with great apparent appetite there said he with a sigh of gratification as he swallowed the last morsel i havent tasted anything so good for a long time is it as good as mrs mudges soup asked john mischievously almost returned paul smiling we must now leave the boys to pursue their way and return to the dwelling from which our hero had so unceremoniously taken his departure and from which danger now threatened him ix a cloud in the mudge horizon mr mudge was accustomed to call paul at five oclock to milk the cows and perform other chores he himself did not rise till an hour later during pauls sickness he was obliged to take his place a thing he did not relish overmuch now that our hero had recovered he gladly prepared to indulge himself in an extra nap paul called mr mudge from the bottom of the staircase leading up into the attic its five oclock time you were downstairs mr mudge waited for an answer but none came paul repeated mr mudge in a louder tone its time to get up tumble out there again there was no answer at first mr mudge thought it might be in consequence of pauls sleeping so soundly but on listening attentively he could not distinguish the deep and regular breathing which usually accompanies such slumber he must be sullen he concluded with a feeling of irritation if he is ill teach him without taking time to finish the sentence he bounded up the rickety staircase and turned towards the bed with the intention of giving our hero a smart shaking he looked with astonishment at the empty bed is it possible he thought that paul has already got up he isnt apt to do so before he is called at this juncture mrs mudge surprised at her husbands prolonged absence called from below mr mudge well wife what in the name of wonder keeps you up there so long just come up and see mrs mudge did come up her husband pointed to the empty bed what do you think of that he asked what about it she inquired not quite comprehending about that boy paul when i called him i got no answer so i came up and behold he is among the missing you dont think hes run away do you asked mrs mudge startled that is more than i know ill see if his clothes are here said his wife now fully aroused her search was unavailing pauls clothes had disappeared as mysteriously as their owner its a clear case said mr mudge shaking his head hes gone i wouldnt have lost him for considerable he was only a boy but i managed to get as much work out of him as a man the question is now what shall we do about it he must be pursued said mrs mudge with vehemence ill have him back if it costs me twenty dollars ill tell you what husband she exclaimed with a sudden light breaking in upon her if theres anybody in this house knows where hes gone it is aunt lucy lee only last week i caught her knitting him a pair of stockings i might have known what it meant if i hadnt been a fool ha ha so you might if you hadnt been a fool echoed a mocking voice turning with sudden anger mrs mudge beheld the face of the crazy girl peering up at her from below this turned her thoughts into a different channel ill teach you what i am she exclaimed wrathfully descending the stairs more rapidly than she had mounted them and if you know anything about the little scamp ill have it out of you the girl narrowly succeeded in eluding the grasp of her pursuer but alas for mrs mudge in her impetuosity she lost her footing and fell backward into a pail of water which had been brought up the night before and set in the entry for purposes of ablution more wrathful than ever mrs mudge bounced into her room and sat down in her dripping garments in a very uncomfortable frame of mind as for paul she felt a personal dislike for him and was not sorry on some accounts to have him out of the house the knowledge however that he had in a manner defied her authority by running away filled her with an earnest desire to get him back if only to prove that it was not to be defied with impunity hoping to elicit some information from aunt lucy who she felt sure was in pauls confidence she paid her a visit well heres a pretty goings on she commenced abruptly finding that aunt lucy manifested no curiosity on the subject she continued in a significant tone of course you dont know anything about it i can tell better when i know what you refer to said the old lady calmly oh you are very ignorant all at once i suppose you didnt know paul prescott had run away i am not surprised said the old lady in the same quiet manner mrs mudge had expected a show of astonishment and this calmness disconcerted her you are not surprised she retorted i presume not since you knew all about it beforehand thats why you were knitting him some stockings deny it if you dare i have no disposition to deny it you havent exclaimed the questioner almost struck dumb with this audacity no said aunt lucy why should i there was no particular inducement for him to stay here wherever he goes i hope he will meet with good friends and good treatment as much as to say he didnt find them here is that what you mean i have no charges to bring but i have said mrs mudge her eyes lighting with malicious satisfaction last night you missed a tendollar gold piece which you saw was stolen from you this morning it appears that paul prescott has run away i charge him with the theft you do not can not believe this said the old lady uneasily of course i do returned mrs mudge triumphantly perceiving her advantage i have no doubt of it and when we get the boy back he shall be made to confess it aunt lucy looked troubled much to the gratification of mrs mudge it was but for a short time however rising from her seat she stood confronting mrs mudge and said quietly but firmly i have no doubt mrs mudge you are capable of doing what you say i would advise you however to pause you know as well as i do that paul is incapable of this theft even if he were wicked enough to form the idea he would have no need since it was my intention to give him this money who did actually steal the gold you perhaps know better than i should it be necessary i shall not hesitate to say so i advise you not to render it necessary the threat which lay in these words was understood it came with the force of a sudden blow to mrs mudge who had supposed it would be no difficult task to frighten and silence aunt lucy the latter had always been so yielding in all matters relating to herself that this intrepid championship of pauls interests was unlooked for the tables were completely turned pale with rage and a mortified sense of having been foiled with her own weapons mrs mudge left the room meanwhile her husband milked the cows and was now occupied in performing certain other duties that could not be postponed being resolved immediately after breakfast was over to harness up and pursue the runaway well did you get anything out of the old lady he inquired as he came from the barn with the full milkpails she said she knew beforehand that he was going eh said mr mudge pricking up his ears did she say where no and she wont she knit him a pair of stockings to help him off and doesnt pretend to deny it shes taken a wonderful fancy to the young scamp and has been as obstinate as could be ever since he has been here if i get him back said mr mudge he shall have a good flogging if i am able to give him one and she shall be present to see it thats right said mrs mudge approvingly when are you going to set out after him right after breakfast so be spry and get it ready as soon as you can under the stimulus of this inspiring motive mrs mudge bustled about with new energy and before many minutes the meal was in readiness it did not take long to dispatch it immediately afterwards mr mudge harnessed up as he had determined and started off in pursuit of our hero in the meantime the two boys had walked leisurely along conversing on various subjects when you get to the city paul said john i shall want to hear from you will you write to me paul promised readily you can direct to john burges burrville the postmaster knows me and i shall be sure to get it i wish you were going with me said paul sometimes when i think that i am all alone it discourages me it would be so much pleasanter to have some one with me i shall come sometime said john when i am a little older i heard father say something the other day about my going into a store in the city so we may meet again i hope we shall they were just turning a bend of the road when paul chanced to look backward about a quarter of a mile back he descried a horse and wagon wearing a familiar look fixing his eyes anxiously upon them he was soon made aware that his suspicions were only too well founded it was mr mudge doubtless in quest of him what shall i do he asked hurriedly of his companion whats the matter this was quickly explained john was quickwitted and he instantly decided upon the course proper to be pursued on either side of the road was a growth of underbrush so thick as to be almost impenetrable creep in behind there and be quick about it directed john there is no time to lose there said he after paul had followed his advice if he can see you now he must have sharp eyes wont you come in too not i said john i am anxious to see this mr mudge since you have told me so much about him i hope he will ask me some questions what will you tell him trust me for that dont say any more hes close by x mr mudge meets his match john lounged along appearing to be very busily engaged in making a whistle from a slip of willow which he had a short time before cut from the tree he purposely kept in the middle of the road apparently quite unaware of the approach of the vehicle until he was aroused by the sound of a voice behind him be a little more careful if you dont want to get run over john assumed a look of surprise and with comic terror ran to the side of the road mr mudge checked his horse and came to a sudden halt i say youngster havent you seen a boy of about your own size walking along with a bundle in his hand tied up in a red cotton handkerchief inquired john yes i believe so said mr mudge eagerly where did you with a blue cloth cap yes where gray jacket and pants yes yes where with a patch on one knee yes the very one when did you see him said mr mudge getting ready to start his horse perhaps it isnt the one you mean continued john who took a mischievous delight in playing with the evident impatience of mr mudge the boy that i saw looked thin as if he hadnt had enough to eat mr mudge winced slightly and looked at john with some suspicion but john put on so innocent and artless a look that mr mudge at once dismissed the idea that there was any covert meaning in what he said meanwhile paul from his hidingplace in the bushes had listened with anxiety to the foregoing colloquy when john described his appearance so minutely he was seized with a sudden apprehension that the boy meant to betray him but he dismissed it instantly in his own singleness of heart he could not believe such duplicity possible still it was not without anxiety that he waited to hear what would be said next well said mr mudge slowly i dont know but he is a little peaked hes been sick lately and thats took off his flesh was he your son asked john in a sympathizing tone you must feel quite troubled about him he looked askance at mr mudge enjoying that gentlemans growing irritation my son no where nephews perhaps suggested the imperturbable john leisurely continuing the manufacture of a whistle no i tell you nothing of the kind but i cant sit waiting here oh i hope youll excuse me said john apologetically i hope you wont stop on my account i didnt know you were in a hurry well you know it now said mr mudge crossly when and where did you see the boy you have described i am in pursuit of him has he run away inquired john in assumed surprise are you going to answer my question or not demanded mr mudge angrily oh i beg your pardon i shouldnt have asked so many questions only i thought he was a nicelooking boy and i felt interested in him hes a young scamp said mr mudge impetuously and its my belief that youre another now answer my question when and where did you see this boy this time mr mudges menacing look warned john that he had gone far enough accordingly he answered promptly he passed by our farm this morning how far back is that about three miles did he stop there yes he stopped a while to rest have you seen him since yes i saw him about half a mile back on this road yes but he turned up the road that branches off there just what i wanted to find out said mr mudge in a tone of satisfaction im sure to catch him so saying he turned about and put his horse to its utmost speed determined to make up for lost time when he was fairly out of sight paul came forth from his hidingplace how could you do so he asked in a reproachful tone could i do what asked john turning a laughing face towards paul didnt i tell old mudge the exact truth you know you did turn up that road to be sure you didnt go two rods before turning back but he didnt stop to ask about that if he hadnt been in such a hurry perhaps i should have told him success to him you cant think how i trembled when you described me so particularly you didnt think i would betray you said john quickly no but i was afraid you would venture too far and get us both into trouble trust me for that paul ive got my eyes wide open and aint easily caught but wasnt it fun to see old mudge fuming while i kept him waiting what would he have said if he had known the bird was so near at hand he looked foolish enough when i asked him if you were his son john sat down and gave vent to his pentup laughter which he had felt obliged to restrain in the presence of mr mudge he laughed so heartily that paul notwithstanding his recent fright and anxiety could not resist the infection together they laughed till the very air seemed vocal with merriment john was the first to recover his gravity i am sorry paul he said but i must bid you goodby they will miss me from the house i am glad i have got acquainted with you and i hope i shall see you again some time before very long goodby paul goodby john the two boys shook hands and parted one went in one direction the other in the opposite each looked back repeatedly till the other was out of sight then came over paul once more a feeling of sadness and desolation which the high spirits of his companion had for the time kept off occasionally he cast a glance backwards to make sure that mr mudge was not following him but paul had no cause to fear on that score the object of his dread was already some miles distant in a different direction for an hour longer paul trudged on he met few persons the road not being very much frequented he was now at least twelve miles from his startingplace and began to feel very sensibly the effects of heat and fatigue combined he threw himself down upon the grass under the overhanging branches of an appletree to rest after his long walk repose seemed delicious and with a feeling of exquisite enjoyment he stretched himself out at full length upon the soft turf and closed his eyes insensibly he fell asleep how long he slept he could not tell he was finally roused from his slumber by something cold touching his cheek starting up he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment and gradually became aware that this something was the nose of a newfoundland dog whose keen scent had enabled him to discover the whereabouts of the small stock of provisions with which paul had been supplied by his late companion fortunately he awoke in time to save its becoming the prey of its canine visitor i reckon you came nigh losing your dinner fell upon his ears in a rough but hearty tone at the same time he heard the noise of wheels and looking up beheld a specimen of a class well known throughout new england a tin pedler he was seated on a cart liberally stocked with articles of tin ware from the rear depended two immense bags one of which served as a receptacle for white rags the other for bits of calico and whatever else may fall under the designation of colored his shop for such it was was drawn at a brisk pace by a stout horse who in this respect presented a contrast to his master who was long and lank the pedler himself was a man of perhaps forty with a face in which shrewdness and good humor seemed alike indicated take him for all in all you might travel some distance without falling in with a more complete specimen of the yankee so you came nigh losing your dinner he repeated in a pleasant tone yes said paul i got tired and fell asleep and i dont know when i should have waked up but for your dog yes boneys got a keen scent for provisions laughed the pedler hes a little graspin like his namesake you see his real name is bonaparte we only call him boney for short meanwhile he had stopped his horse he was about to start afresh when a thought struck him maybe youre goin my way said he turning to paul if you are youre welcome to a ride paul was very glad to accept the invitation he clambered into the cart and took a seat behind the pedler while boney who took his recent disappointment very goodnaturedly jogged on contentedly behind how far are you goin asked pauls new acquaintance as he whipped up his horse paul felt a little embarrassed if he had been acquainted with the names of any of the villages on the route he might easily have answered as it was only one name occurred to him i think said he with some hesitation that i shall go to new york new york repeated the pedler with a whistle expressive of his astonishment well youve a journey before you got any relations there no no uncles aunts cousins nor nothing paul shook his head then what makes you go havent run away from your father and mother hey asked the pedler with a knowing look i have no father nor mother said paul sadly enough well you had somebody to take care of you i calculate where did you live if i tell you you wont carry me back said paul anxiously not a bit of it ive got too much business on hand for that relieved by this assurance paul told his story encouraged thereto by frequent questions from his companion who seemed to take a lively interest in the adventures of his young companion thats a capital trick you played on old mudge he said with a hearty laugh which almost made the tins rattle i dont blame you a bit for running away ive got a story to tell you about mrs mudge shes a regular skinflint xi wayside gossip this was the pedlers promised story about mrs mudge the last time i was round that way i stopped thinking maybe they might have some rags to dispose of for tinware the old lady seemed glad to see me and pretty soon she brought down a lot of white rags i thought they seemed quite heavy for their bulk howsomever i wasnt looking for any tricks and i let it go byandby when i happened to be ransacking one of the bags i came across half a dozen pounds or more of old iron tied up in a white cloth that let the cat out of the bag i knew why they were so heavy then i reckon i shant call on mrs mudge next time i go by so youve run off he continued after a pause i like your spunk just what i should have done myself but tell me how you managed to get off without the old chaps finding it out paul related such of his adventures as he had not before told his companion listening with marked approval i wish id been there he said id have given fifty cents right out to see how old mudge looked i calclate hes pretty well tired with his wildgoose chase by this time it was now twelve oclock and both the travelers began to feel the pangs of hunger its about time to bait i calclate remarked the pedler the unsophisticated reader is informed that the word bait in new england phraseology is applied to taking lunch or dining at this point a green lane opened out of the public road skirted on either side by a row of trees carpeted with green it made a very pleasant diningroom a redandwhite heifer browsing at a little distance looked up from her meal and surveyed the intruders with mild attention but apparently satisfied that they contemplated no invasion of her rights resumed her agreeable employment over an irregular stone wall our travelers looked into a thrifty appleorchard laden with fruit they halted beneath a spreading chestnuttree which towered above its neighbors and offered them a grateful shelter from the noonday sun from the box underneath the seat the pedler took out a loaf of bread a slice of butter and a tin pail full of doughnuts paul on his side brought out his bread and gingerbread i most generally carry round my own provisions remarked the pedler between two mouthfuls its a good deal cheaper and more convenient too help yourself to the doughnuts i always calclate to have some with me id give more for em any day than for rich cake that aint fit for anybody my mother used to beat everybody in the neighborhood on making doughnuts she made em so good that we never knew when to stop eating you wouldnt hardly believe it but when i was a little shaver i remember eating twentythree doughnuts at one time pretty nigh killed me i should think it might said paul laughing mother got so scared that she vowed she wouldnt fry another for three months but i guess she kinder lost the run of the almanac for in less than a week she turned out about a bushel more all this time the pedler was engaged in practically refuting the saying that a man cannot do two things at once with a little assistance from paul the stock of doughnuts on which he had been lavishing encomiums diminished rapidly it was evident that his attachment to this homely article of diet was quite as strong as ever dont be afraid of them said he seeing that paul desisted from his efforts ive got plenty more in the box paul signified that his appetite was already appeased then we might as well be jogging on hey goliah said he addressing the horse who with an air of great content had been browsing while his master was engaged in a similar manner queer name for a horse isnt it i wanted something out of the common way so i asked mother for a name and she gave me that shes great on scripture names mother is she gave one to every one of her children it didnt make much difference to her what they were as long as they were in the bible i believe she used to open the bible at random and take the first name she happened to come across there are eight of us and nary a decent name in the lot my oldest brothers name is abimelech then theres pharaoh and ishmael and jonadab for the boys and leah and naomi for the girls but my name beats all you couldnt guess it paul shook his head i dont believe you could said the pedler shaking his head in comic indignation its jehoshaphat aint that a respectable name for the son of christian parents paul laughed it wouldnt be so bad continued the pedler if my other name was longer but jehoshaphat seems rather a long handle to put before stubbs i cant say i feel particularly proud of the name though for use itll do as well as any other at any rate it aint quite so bad as the name mother pitched on for my youngest sister who was lucky enough to die before she needed a name what was it inquired paul really curious to know what name could be considered less desirable than jehoshaphat it was jezebel responded the pedler everybody told mother twould never do but she was kind of superstitious about it because that was the first name she came to in the bible and so she thought it was the lords will that that name should be given to the child as mr stubbs finished his disquisition upon names there came in sight a small house dark and discolored with age and neglect he pointed this out to paul with his whiphandle that said he is where old keziah onthank lives ever heard of him paul had not hes the oldest man in these parts pursued his loquacious companion theres some folks that seem a dyin all the time and for all that manage to outlive half the young folks in the neighborhood old keziah onthank is a complete case in pint as long ago as when i was cutting my teeth he was so old that nobody knowd how old he was he was so bowed over that he couldnt see himself in the lookingglass unless you put it on the floor and i guess even then what he saw wouldnt pay him for his trouble he was always ailin some way or other now it was rheumatism now the palsy and then again the asthma he had that awful he lived in the same tumbledown old shanty we have just passed so poor that nobodyd take the gift of it people said that hed orter go to the poorhouse so that when he was sick which was pretty much all the time hed have somebody to take care of him but hed got kinder attached to the old place seein he was born there and never lived anywhere else and go he wouldnt everybody expected he was near his end and nobodyd have been surprised to hear of his death at any minute but its strange how some folks are determined to live on as i said before so keziah though he looked so old when i was a boy that it didnt seem as if he could look any older kept on livin and livin and arter i got married to betsy sprague he was livin still one day i remember i was passin by the old mans shanty when i heard a dreadful groanin and thinks i to myself i shouldnt wonder if the old man was on his last legs so in i bolted there he was to be sure a lyin on the bed all curled up into a heap breathin dreadful hard and lookin as white and pale as any ghost i didnt know exactly what to do so i went and got some water but he motioned it away and wouldnt drink it but kept on groanin he mustnt be left here to die without any assistance thinks i so i ran off as fast i could to find the doctor i found him eatin dinner come quick says i to old keziah onthanks hes dyin as sure as my name is jehoshaphat well said the doctor die or no die i cant come till ive eaten my dinner but hes dyin doctor oh nonsense talk of old keziah onthanks dyin hell live longer than i shall i recollect i thought the doctor very unfeelin to talk so of a fellow creetur just stepping into eternity as a body may say however its no use drivin a horse thats made up his mind he wont go so although i did think the doctor dreadful deliberate about eatin his dinner he always would take half an hour for it i didnt dare to say a word for fear he wouldnt come at all you see the doctor was dreadful independent and was bent on havin his own way pretty much though for that matter i think its the case with most folks however to come back to my story i didnt feel particularly comfortable while i was waitin his motions after a long while the doctor got ready i was in such a hurry that i actilly pulled him along he walked so slow but he only laughed and i couldnt help thinkin that doctorin had a hardinin effect on the heart i was determined if ever i fell sick i wouldnt send for him at last we got there i went in all of a tremble and crept to the bed thinkin i should see his dead body but he wasnt there at all i felt a little bothered youd better believe well said the doctor turning to me with a smile what do you think now i dont know what to think said i then ill help you said he so sayin he took me to the winder and what do you think i see as sure as im alive there was the old man in the back yard a squattin down and pickin up chips and is he still living yes or he was when i come along last the doctors been dead these ten years he told me old keziah would outlive him but i didnt believe him i shouldnt be surprised if he lived forever paul listened with amused interest to this and other stories with which his companion beguiled the way they served to divert his mind from the realities of his condition and the uncertainty which hung over his worldly prospects xii on the brink of discovery if youre in no great hurry to go to new york said the pedler i should like to have you stay with me for a day or two i live about twentyfive miles from here straight ahead so it will be on your way i always manage to get home by saturday night if it is any way possible it doesnt seem comfortable to be away sunday as today is friday i shall get there tomorrow so you can lie over a day and rest yourself paul felt grateful for this unexpected invitation it lifted quite a load from his mind since as the day declined certain anxious thoughts as to where he should find shelter had obtruded themselves even now the same trouble would be experienced on monday night but it is the characteristic of youth to pay little regard to anticipated difficulties as long as the present is provided for it must not be supposed that the pedler neglected his business on account of his companion on the road he had been traveling the houses were few and far between he had therefore but few calls to make paul remarked however that when he did call he seldom failed to sell something yes said mr stubbs on being interrogated i make it a pint to sell something if its no more than a tin dipper i find some hard cases sometimes and sometimes i have to give it up altogether i cant quite come up to a friend of mine daniel watson who used to be in the same line of business i never knew him to stop at a place without selling something he had a good deal of judgment daniel had and knew just when to use soft sodder and when not to on the road that he traveled there lived a widow woman who had the reputation of being as ugly crossgrained a critter as ever lived people used to say that it was enough to turn milk sour for her even to look at it well it so happened that daniel had never called there one night he was boasting that he never called at a house without driving a bargain when one of the company asked him with a laugh if he had ever sold the widow anything why no said daniel i never called there but ive no doubt i could whatll you bet of it im not a betting man said daniel but i feel so sure of it that i dont mind risking five dollars agreed the next morning daniel drove leisurely up to the widows door and knocked she had a great aversion to pedlers and declared they were cheats every one of them she was busy sweeping when daniel knocked she came to the door in a dreadful hurry hoping it might be an old widower in the neighborhood that she was trying to catch when she saw how much she was mistaken she looked as black as a thundercloud want any tin ware today maam inquired daniel noways discomposed no sir snapped she got all kinds warranted the best in the market couldnt i sell you something not a single thing said she preparing to shut the door but daniel knowing all would then be lost stepped in before she could shut it quite to and began to name over some of the articles he had in his wagon you may talk till doomsday said the widow as mad as could be and it wont do a particle of good now youve got your answer and youd better leave the house before you are driven out brooms brushes lamps here the widow who had been trying to keep in her anger couldnt hold out any longer she seized the broom she had been sweeping with and brought it down with a tremendous whack upon daniels back you can imagine how hard it was when i tell you that the force of the blow snapped the broom in the middle you might have thought daniel would resent it but he didnt appear to notice it though it must have hurt him awful he picked up the pieces and handing them with a polite bow to the widow said now maam im sure you need a new broom ive got some capital ones out in the cart the widow seemed kind of overpowered by his coolness she hardly knew what to say or what to think however she had broken her old broom that was certain and must have a new one so when daniel ran out and brought in a bundle of them she picked out one and paid for it without saying a word only when daniel asked if he might have the pleasure of calling again she looked a little queer and told him that if he considered it a pleasure she had no objection and did he call again yes whenever he went that way the widow was always very polite to him after that and though she had a mortal dislike to pedlers in general she was always ready to trade with him daniel used to say that he gained his bet and the widows custom at one blow they were now descending a little hill at the foot of which stood a country tavern here mr stubbs declared his intention of spending the night he drove into the barn the large door of which stood invitingly open and unharnessed his horse taking especial care to rub him down and set before him an ample supply of provender i always take care of goliah myself said he hes a good friend to me and its no more than right that i should take good care of him now well go into the house and see what we can get for supper he was surprised to see that paul hung back and seemed disinclined to follow whats the matter asked mr stubbs in surprise why dont you come because said paul looking embarrassed ive got no money well i have said mr stubbs and that will answer just as well so come along and dont be bashful im about as hungry as a bear and i guess you are too before many minutes paul sat down to a more bountiful repast than he had partaken of for many a day there were warm biscuits and fresh butter such as might please the palate of an epicure while at the other end of the table was a plate of cake flanked on one side by an applepie on the other by one of pumpkin with its rich golden hue such as is to be found in its perfection only in new england it will scarcely be doubted that our hungry travellers did full justice to the fare set before them when they had finished they went into the public room where were engaged some of the village worthies intent on discussing the news and the political questions of the day it was a time of considerable political excitement and this naturally supplied the topic of conversation in this the pedler joined for his frequent travel on this route had made him familiarly acquainted with many of those present paul sat in a corner trying to feel interested in the conversation but the day had been a long one and he had undergone an unusual amount of fatigue gradually his drowsiness increased the many voices fell upon his ears like a lullaby and in a few minutes he was fast asleep early next morning they were up and on their way it was the second morning since pauls departure already a sense of freedom gave his spirits unwonted elasticity and encouraged him to hope for the best had his knowledge of the future been greater his confidence might have been less but would he have been any happier so many miles separated him from his late home that he supposed himself quite safe from detection a slight circumstance warned him that he must still be watchful and cautious as they were jogging easily along they heard the noise of wheels at a little distance paul looked up to his great alarms he recognized in the driver of the approaching vehicle one of the selectmen of wrenville whats the matter asked his companion noticing his sudden look of apprehension paul quickly communicated the ground of his alarm and you are afraid he will want to carry you back are you yes not a bit of it well circumvent the old fellow unless hes sharper than i think he is youve only got to do as i tell you to this paul quickly agreed the selectman was already within a hundred rods he had not yet apparently noticed the pedlers cart so that this was in our heros favor mr stubbs had already arranged his plan of operations this is what you are to do paul said he quickly cock your hat on the side of your head considerably forward so that he cant see much of your face then heres a cigar to stick in your mouth you can make believe that you are smoking if you are the sort of boy i reckon you are hell never think its you paul instantly adopted this suggestion slipping his hat to one side in the jaunty manner characteristic of young america he began to puff very gravely at a cigar the pedler handed him frequently taking it from his mouth as he had seen older persons do to knock away the ashes nothwithstanding his alarm his love of fun made him enjoy this little stratagem in which he bore his part successfully the selectman eyed him intently paul began to tremble from fear of discovery but his apprehensions were speedily dissipated by a remark of the newcomer my boy you are forming a very bad habit paul did not dare to answer lest his voice should betray him to his relief the pedler spoke just what i tell him sir but i suppose he thinks he must do as his father does by this time the vehicles had passed each other and the immediate peril was over now paul said his companion laughing ill trouble you for that cigar if you have done with it the old gentlemans advice was good if id never learned to smoke i wouldnt begin now our hero was glad to take the cigar from his mouth the brief time he had held it was sufficient to make him slightly dizzy xiii paul reaches the city towards evening they drew up before a small house with a neat yard in front i guess well get out here said mr stubbs theres a gentleman lives here that i feel pretty well acquainted with shouldnt wonder if hed let us stop over sunday whoa goliah glad to get home hey as the horse pricked up his ears and showed manifest signs of satisfaction now youngster follow me and i guess i can promise you some supper if mrs stubbs hasnt forgotten her old tricks they passed through the entry into the kitchen where mrs stubbs was discovered before the fire toasting slices of bread lor jehoshaphat said she i didnt expect you so soon and she looked inquiringly at his companion a young friend who is going to stay with us till monday explained the pedler his name is paul prescott im glad to see you paul said mrs stubbs with a friendly smile you must be tired if youve been traveling far take a seat heres a rockingchair for you this friendly greeting made paul feel quite at home having no children the pedler and his wife exerted themselves to make the time pass pleasantly to their young acquaintance paul could not help contrasting them with mr and mrs mudge not very much to the advantage of the latter on sunday he went to church with them and the peculiar circumstances in which he was placed made him listen to the sermon with unusual attention it was an exposition of the text my help cometh from the lord and paul could not help feeling that it was particularly applicable to his own case it encouraged him to hope that however uncertain his prospects appeared god would help him if he put his trust in him on monday morning paul resumed his journey with an ample stock of provisions supplied by mrs stubbs in the list of which doughnuts occupied a prominent place this being at the particular suggestion of mr stubbs forty or fifty miles remained to be traversed before his destination would be reached the road was not a difficult one to find and he made it out without much questioning the first night he sought permission to sleep in a barn he met with a decided refusal he was about to turn away in disappointment when he was called back you are a little too fast youngster i said i wouldnt let you sleep in my barn and i wont but ive got a spare bed in the house and if you choose you shall occupy it under the guise of roughness this man had a kind heart he inquired into the particulars of pauls story and at the conclusion terrified him by saying that he had been very foolish and ought to be sent back nevertheless when paul took leave of him the next morning he did not go away emptyhanded if you must be so foolish as to set up for yourself take this said the farmer placing half a dollar in his hand you may reach the city after the banks are closed for the day you know he added jocularly but it was in the morning that paul came in sight of the city he climbed up into a high tree which having the benefit of an elevated situation afforded him an extensive prospect before him lay the great city of which he had so often heard teeming with life and activity half in eager anticipation half in awe and wonder at its vastness our young pilgrim stood upon the threshold of this great babel everything looked new and strange it had never entered pauls mind that there could be so many houses in the whole state as now rose up before him he got into broadway and walked on and on thinking that the street must end somewhere but the farther he walked the thicker the houses seemed crowded together every few rods too he came to a cross street which seemed quite as densely peopled as the one on which he was walking one part of the city was the same as another to paul since he was equally a stranger to all he wandered listlessly along whither fancy led his mind was constantly excited by the new and strange objects which met him at every step as he was looking in at a shop window a boy of about his own age stopped and inquired confidentially when did you come from the country this morning said paul wondering how a stranger should know that he was a country boy could you tell me what is the price of potatoes up your way asked the other boy with perfect gravity i dont know said paul innocently im sorry for that said the other as i have got to buy some for my wife and family paul stared in surprise for a moment and then realizing that he was being made game of began to grow angry youd better go home to your wife and family he said with spirit or you may get hurt bully for you country answered the other with a laugh youre not as green as you look thank you said paul i wish i could say as much for you tired with walking paul at length sat down in a doorway and watched with interest the hurrying crowds that passed before him everybody seemed to be in a hurry pressing forward as if life and death depended on his haste there were lawyers with their sharp keen glances merchants with calculating faces speculators pondering on the chances of a rise or fall in stocks errand boys with bundles under their arms business men hurrying to the slip to take the boat for brooklyn or jersey city all seemed intent on business of some kind even to the ragged newsboys who had just obtained their supply of evening papers and were now crying them at the top of their voices and very discordant ones at that so paul thought of the hundreds passing and repassing before him every one had something to do every one had a home to go to perhaps it was not altogether strange that a feeling of desolation should come over paul as he recollected that he stood alone homeless friendless and it might be shelterless for the coming night yet thought he with something of hopefulness there must be something for me to do as well as the rest just then a boy some two years older than paul paced slowly by and in passing chanced to fix his eyes upon our hero he probably saw something in paul which attracted him for he stepped up and extending his hand said why tom how came you here my name isnt tom said paul feeling a little puzzled by this address why so it isnt but you look just like my friend tom crocker to this succeeded a few inquiries which paul unsuspiciously answered do you like oysters inquired the newcomer after a while very much because i know of a tip top place to get some just round the corner wouldnt you like some paul thanked his new acquaintance and said he would without more ado his companion ushered him into a basement room near by he led the way into a curtained recess and both boys took seats one on each side of a small table just pull the bell will you and tell the waiter well have two stews paul did so i suppose continued the other the governor wouldnt like it much if he knew where i was the governor repeated paul why it isnt against the laws is it no laughed the other i mean my father how jolly queer you are he meant to say green but had a purpose in not offending paul are you the governors son asked paul in amazement to be sure carelessly replied the other pauls wonder had been excited many times in the course of the day but this was more surprising than anything which had yet befallen him that he should have the luck to fall in with the son of the governor on his first arrival in the city and that the latter should prove so affable and condescending was indeed surprising paul inwardly determined to mention it in his first letter to aunt lucy he could imagine her astonishment while he was busy with these thoughts his companion had finished his oysters most through he inquired nonchalantly ive got to step out a minute wait till i come back paul unsuspectingly assented he heard his companion say a word to the barkeeper and then go out he waited patiently for fifteen minutes and he did not return another quarter of an hour and he was still absent thinking he might have been unexpectedly detained he rose to go but was called back by the barkeeper hallo youngster are you going off without paying for what inquired paul in surprise for the oysters of course you dont suppose i give em away do you i thought hesitated paul that the one who was with me paid the governors son he added conscious of a certain pride in his intimacy with one so nearly related to the chief magistrate of the commonwealth the governors son laughed the barkeeper why the governor lives a hundred miles off and more that wasnt the governors son any more than i am he called his father governor said paul beginning to be afraid that he had made some ridiculous blunder well i wouldnt advise you to trust him again even if hes the presidents son he only got you in here to pay for his oysters he told me when he went out that you would pay for them and didnt he say he was coming back asked paul quite dumbfounded he said you hadnt quite finished but would pay for both when you came out its two shillings paul rather ruefully took out the half dollar which constituted his entire stock of money and tendered it to the barkeeper who returned him the change so paul went out into the streets with his confidence in human nature somewhat lessened here then is our hero with twentyfive cents in his pocket and his fortune to make xiv a strange bedchamber although paul could not help being vexed at having been so cleverly taken in by his late companion he felt the better for having eaten the oysters carefully depositing his only remaining coin in his pocket he resumed his wanderings it is said that a hearty meal is a good promoter of cheerfulness it was so in pauls case and although he had as yet had no idea where he should find shelter for the night he did not allow that consideration to trouble him so the day passed and the evening came on pauls appetite returned to him once more he invested onehalf of his money at an old womans stall for cakes and apples and then he ate leisurely while leaning against the iron railing which encircles the park he began to watch with interest the movements of those about him already the lamplighter had started on his accustomed round and with ladder in hand was making his way from one lamppost to another paul quite marvelled at the celerity with which the lamps were lighted never before having witnessed the use of gas he was so much interested in the process that he sauntered along behind the lamplighter for some time at length his eye fell upon a group common enough in our cities but new to him an italian short and darkfeatured with a velvet cap was grinding out music from a handorgan while a woman with a complexion equally dark and black sorrowfullooking eyes accompanied her husband on the tambourine they were playing a lively tune as paul came up but quickly glided into home sweet home paul listened with pleased yet sad interest for him home was only a sad remembrance he wandered on pausing now and then to look into one of the brilliantly illuminated shop windows or catching a glimpse through the open doors of the gay scene within and as one after another of these lively scenes passed before him he began to think that all the strange and wonderful things in the world must be collected in these rich stores next he came to a place of public amusement crowds were entering constantly and paul from curiosity entered too he passed on to a little wicket when a man stopped him wheres your ticket he asked i havent got any said paul then what business have you here said the man roughly isnt this a meetinghouse asked paul this remark seemed to amuse two boys who were standing by looking up with some indignation paul recognized in one of them the boy who had cheated him out of the oysters look here said paul what made you go off and leave me to pay for the oysters this morning which of us do you mean inquired the governors son carelessly i mean you really i dont understand your meaning perhaps you mistake me for somebody else what said paul in great astonishment dont you remember me and how you told me you were the governors son both boys laughed you must be mistaken i havent the honor of being related to the distinguished gentleman you name the speaker made a mocking bow to paul i know that said paul with spirit but you said you were for all that it must have been some other goodlooking boy that you are mistaking me for what are you going to do about it i hope by the way that the oysters agreed with you yes they did said paul for i came honestly by them hes got you there gerald said the other boy paul made his way out of the theater as his funds were reduced to twelve cents he could not have purchased a ticket if he had desired it still he moved on soon he came to another building which was in like manner lighted up but not so brilliantly as the theater this time from the appearance of the building and from the tall steeple so tall that his eye could scarcely reach the tapering spire he knew that it must be a church there was not such a crowd gathered about the door as at the place he had just left but he saw a few persons entering and he joined them the interior of the church was far more gorgeous than the plain village meetinghouse which he had been accustomed to attend with his mother he gazed about him with a feeling of awe and sank quietly into a back pew as it was a weekday evening and nothing of unusual interest was anticipated there were but few present here and there one scattered through the capacious edifice byandby the organist commenced playing and a flood of music grander and more solemn than he had ever heard filled the whole edifice he listened with rapt attention and suspended breath till the last note died away and then sank back upon the richly cushioned seat with a feeling of enjoyment in the services which followed he was not so much interested the officiating clergyman delivered a long homily in a dull unimpassioned manner which failed to awaken his interest already disposed to be drowsy it acted upon him like a gentle soporific he tried to pay attention as he had always been used to do but owing to his occupying a back seat and the low voice of the preacher but few words reached him and those for the most part were above his comprehension gradually the feeling of fatigue for he had been walking the streets all day became so powerful that his struggles to keep awake became harder and harder in vain he sat erect resolved not to yield the moment afterwards his head inclined to one side the lights began to swim before his eyes the voice of the preacher subsided into a low and undistinguishable hum pauls head sank upon the cushion his bundle which had been his constant companion during the day fell softly to the floor and he fell into a deep sleep meanwhile the sermon came to a close and another hymn was sung but even the music was insufficient to wake our hero now so the benediction was pronounced and the people opened the doors of their pews and left the church last of all the sexton walked up and down the aisles closing such of the pew doors as were open then he shut off the gas and after looking around to see that nothing was forgotten went out apparently satisfied and locked the outer door behind him paul meanwhile wholly unconscious of his situation slept on as tranquilly as if there were nothing unusual in the circumstances in which he was placed through the stained windows the softened light fell upon his tranquil countenance on which a smile played as if his dreams were pleasant what would aunt lucy have thought if she could have seen her young friend at this moment xv a turn of fortune notwithstanding his singular bedchamber paul had a refreshing nights sleep from which he did not awake till the sun had fairly risen and its rays colored by the medium through which they were reflected streamed in at the windows and rested in many fantastic lines on the richly carved pulpit and luxurious pews paul sprang to his feet and looked around him in bewilderment where am i he exclaimed in astonishment in the momentary confusion of ideas which is apt to follow a sudden awakening he could not remember where he was or how he chanced to be there but in a moment memory came to his aid and he recalled the events of the preceding day and saw that he must have been locked up in the church how am i going to get out paul asked himself in dismay this was the important question just now he remembered that the village meetinghouse which he had been accustomed to attend was rarely opened except on sundays what if this should be the case here it was thursday morning and three days must elapse before his release this would never do he must seek some earlier mode of deliverance he went first to the windows but found them so secured that it was impossible for him to get them open he tried the doors but found as he had anticipated that they were fast his last resource failing he was at liberty to follow the dictates of his curiosity finding a small door partly open he peeped within and found a flight of steep stairs rising before him they wound round and round and seemed almost interminable at length after he had become almost weary of ascending he came to a small window out of which he looked at his feet lay the numberless roofs of the city while not far away his eye rested on thousands of masts the river sparkled in the sun and paul in spite of his concern could not help enjoying the scene the sound of horses and carriages moving along the great thoroughfare below came confusedly to his ears he leaned forward to look down but the distance was so much greater than he had thought that he drew back in alarm what shall i do paul asked himself rather frightened i wonder if i can stand going without food for three days i suppose nobody would hear me if i should scream as loud as i could paul shouted but there was so much noise in the streets that nobody probably heard him he descended the staircase and once more found himself in the body of the church he went up into the pulpit but there seemed no hope of escape in that direction there was a door leading out on one side but this only led to a little room into which the minister retired before service it seemed rather odd to paul to find himself the sole occupant of so large a building he began to wonder whether it would not have been better for him to stay in the poorhouse than come to new york to die of starvation just at this moment paul heard a key rattle in the outer door filled with new hope he ran down the pulpit stairs and out into the porch just in time to see the entrance of the sexton the sexton started in surprise as his eye fell upon paul standing before him with his bundle under his arm where did you come from and how came you here he asked with some suspicion i came in last night and fell asleep so you passed the night here yes sir what made you come in at all inquired the sexton who knew enough of boys to be curious upon this point i didnt know where else to go said paul where do you live paul answered with perfect truth i dont live anywhere what have you no home asked the sexton in surprise paul shook his head where should you have slept if you hadnt come in here i dont know im sure and i suppose you dont know where you shall sleep tonight paul signified that he did not i knew there were plenty of such cases said the sexton meditatively but i never seemed to realize it before how long have you been in new york was his next inquiry not very long said paul i only got here yesterday then you dont know anybody in the city no why did you come here then because i wanted to go somewhere where i could earn a living and i thought i might find something to do here but suppose you shouldnt find anything to do i dont know said paul slowly i havent thought much about that well my lad said the sexton not unkindly i cant say your prospects look very bright you should have good reasons for entering on such an undertaking i i dont think you are a bad boy you dont look like a bad one he added half to himself i hope not sir said paul i hope not too i was going to say that i wish i could help you to some kind of work if you will come home with me you shall be welcome to a dinner and perhaps i may be able to think of something for you paul gladly prepared to follow his new acquaintance what is your name inquired the sexton paul prescott that sounds like a good name i suppose you havent got much money only twelve cents bless me only twelve cents poor boy you are indeed poor but i can work said paul spiritedly i ought to be able to earn my living yes yes thats the way to feel heaven helps those who help themselves when they were fairly out of the church paul had an opportunity of observing his companions external appearance he was an elderly man with harsh features which would have been forbidding but for a certain air of benevolence which softened their expression as paul walked along he related with less of detail the story which is already known to the reader the sexton said little except in the way of questions designed to elicit further particulars till at the conclusion he said must tell hester at length they came to a small house in a respectable but not fashionable quarter of the city onehalf of this was occupied by the sexton he opened the door and led the way into the sittingroom it was plainly but neatly furnished the only ornament being one or two engravings cheaply framed and hung over the mantelpiece they were by no means gems of art but then the sexton did not claim to be a connoisseur and would probably not have understood the meaning of the word sit here a moment said the sexton pointing to a chair ill go and speak to hester paul whiled away the time in looking at the pictures in a copy of the pilgrims progress which lay on the table in the next room sat a woman of perhaps fifty engaged in knitting it was very easy to see that she could never have possessed the perishable gift of beauty hers was one of the faces on which nature has written plain in unmistakable characters yet if the outward features had been a reflex of the soul within few faces would have been more attractive than that of hester cameron at the feet of the sextons wife for such she was reposed a maltese cat purring softly by way of showing her contentment indeed she had good reason to be satisfied in default of children puss had become a privileged pet being well fed and carefully shielded from all the perils that beset cathood home so soon said hester inquiringly as her husband opened the door yes hester and i have brought company with me said the sexton company repeated his wife who is it it is a poor boy who was accidentally locked up in the church last night and he had to stay there all night yes but perhaps it was lucky for him for he had no other place to sleep and not money enough to pay for one poor child said hester compassionately is it not terrible to think that any human creature should be without the comforts of a home which even our tabby possesses it ought to make you thankful that you are so well cared for tab the cat opened her eyes and winked drowsily at her mistress so you brought the poor boy home hugh yes hester i thought we ought not to begrudge a meal to one less favored by fortune than ourselves you know we should consider ourselves the almoners of gods bounties surely hugh i knew you would feel so hester and suppose we have the chicken for dinner that i sent in the morning i begin to have a famous appetite i think i should enjoy it hester knew perfectly well that it was for pauls sake and not for his own that her husband spoke but she so far entered into his feelings that she determined to expend her utmost skill as cook upon the dinner that paul might have at least one good meal now i will bring the boy in said he i am obliged to go to work but you will find some way to entertain him i dare say if you will come out this he said to paul i will introduce you to a new friend paul was kindly welcomed by the sextons wife who questioned him in a sympathizing tone about his enforced stay in the church to all her questions paul answered in a modest yet manly fashion so as to produce a decidedly favorable impression upon his entertainer our hero was a handsome boy just at present he was somewhat thin not having entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness and poor fare while a member of mr mudges family but he was well made and bade fair to become a stout boy his manner was free and unembarrassed and he carried a letter of recommendation in his face it must be admitted however that there were two points in which his appearance might have been improved both his hands and face had suffered from the dust of travel his clothes too were full of dust a single glance told hester all this and she resolved to remedy it she quietly got some water and a towel and requested paul to pull off his jacket which she dusted while he was performing his ablutions then with the help of a comb to arrange his disordered hair he seemed quite like a new boy and felt quite refreshed by the operation really it improves him very much said hester to herself she couldnt help recalling a boy of her own the only child she ever had who had been accidentally drowned when about the age of paul if he had only lived she thought how different might have been our lives a thought came into her mind and she looked earnestly at paul i yes i will speak to hugh about it she said speaking aloud unconsciously did you speak to me asked paul no i was thinking of something she observed that paul was looking rather wistfully at a loaf of bread on the table dont you feel hungry she asked kindly i dare say you have had no breakfast i have eaten nothing since yesterday afternoon bless my soul how hungry you must be said the good woman as she bustled about to get a plate of butter and a knife she must have been convinced of it by the rapid manner in which the slices of bread and butter disappeared at one oclock the sexton came home dinner was laid and paul partook of it with an appetite little affected by his lunch of the morning as he rose from the table he took his cap and saying goodby i thank you very much for your kindness he was about to depart where are you going asked the sexton in surprise i dont know answered paul stop a minute hester i want to speak to you they went into the sittingroom together this boy hester he commenced with hesitation well hugh he has no home it is a hard lot do you think we should be the worse off if we offered to share our home with him it is like your kind heart hugh let us go and tell him we have been talking of you paul said the sexton we have thought hester and myself that as you had no home and we no child we should all be the gainers by your staying with us do you consent consent echoed paul in joyful surprise how can i ever repay your kindness if you are the boy we take you for we shall feel abundantly repaid hester we can give paul the little bedroom where where john used to sleep his voice faltered a little for john was the name of his boy who had been drowned xvi young stupid paul found the sextons dwelling very different from his last home if the poorhouse under the charge of mr and mrs mudge deserved such a name his present home was an humble one but he was provided with every needful comfort and the atmosphere of kindness which surrounded him gave him a feeling of peace and happiness which he had not enjoyed for a long time paul supposed that he would be at once set to work and even then would have accounted himself fortunate in possessing such a home but mr cameron had other views for him are you fond of studying asked the sexton as they were all three gathered in the little sitting room an evening or two after paul first came very much replied our hero and would you like to go to school what here in new york yes oh very much indeed i am glad to hear you say so my lad there is nothing like a good education if i had a son of my own i would rather leave him that than money for while the last may be lost the first never can be and though you are not my son paul providence has in a manner conducted you to me and i feel responsible for your future so you shall go to school next monday morning and i hope you will do yourself much credit there thank you very much said paul i feel very grateful but you surely are not going to object said the sexton no but well paul go on seeing that the boy hesitated why said our hero with a sense of delicacy which did him credit if i go to school i shall not be able to earn my board and shall be living at your expense though i have no claim upon you oh is that all said the sexton cheerfully i was afraid that it was something more serious as to that i am not rich and never expect to be but what little expense you will be will not ruin me besides when you are grown up and doing well you can repay me if i ever need it that i will said paul mind if i ever need it not otherwise there now its a bargain on that condition you havent any other objection seeing that paul still hesitated no or at least i should like to ask your advice said paul just before my father died he told me of a debt of five hundred dollars which he had not been able to pay i saw that it troubled him and i promised to pay it whenever i was able i dont know but i ought to go to work so as to keep my promise no said the sexton after a moments reflection the best course will be to go to school at present knowledge is power and a good education will help you to make money by and by i approve your resolution my lad and if you keep it resolutely in mind i have no doubt you will accomplish your object but the quickest road to success is through the schoolroom at present you are not able to earn much two or three years hence will be time enough pauls face brightened as the sexton said this he instinctively felt that mr cameron was right he had never forgotten his fathers dying injunction and this was one reason that impelled him to run away from the almshouse because he felt that while he remained he never would be in a situation to carry out his fathers wishes now his duty was reconciled with his pleasure and he gratefully accepted the sextons suggestions the next monday morning in accordance with the arrangement which had just been agreed upon paul repaired to school he was at once placed in a class and lessons were assigned him at first his progress was not rapid while living in wrenville he had an opportunity only of attending a country school kept less than six months in the year and then not affording advantages to be compared with those of a city school during his fathers sickness besides he had been kept from school altogether of course all this lost time could not be made up in a moment therefore it was that paul lagged behind his class there are generally some in every school who are disposed to take unfair advantage of their schoolmates or to ridicule those whom they consider inferior to themselves there was one such in pauls class his name was george dawkins he was rather a showy boy and learned easily he might have stood a class above where he was if he had not been lazy and depended too much on his natural talent as it was he maintained the foremost rank in his class better be the first man in a village than the second man in rome he used to say and as his present position not only gave him the preeminence which he desired but cost him very little exertion to maintain he was quite well satisfied with it this boy stood first in his class while paul entered at the foot he laughed unmercifully at the frequent mistakes of our hero and jeeringly dubbed him young stupid do you know what dawkins calls you asked one of the boys no what does he call me asked paul seriously he calls you young stupid pauls face flushed painfully ridicule was as painful to him as it is to most boys and he felt the insult deeply id fight him if i were you was the volunteered advice of his informant no said paul that wouldnt mend the matter besides i dont know but he has some reason for thinking so dont call yourself stupid do you no but i am not as far advanced as most boys of my age that isnt my fault though i never had a chance to go to school much if i had been to school all my life as dawkins has it would be time to find out whether i am stupid or not then you aint going to do anything about it yes i am you said you wasnt going to fight him that wouldnt do any good but im going to study up and see if i cant get ahead of him dont you think that will be the best way of showing him that he is mistaken yes capital but but you think i cant do it i suppose said paul you know he is at the head of the class and you are at the foot i know that said paul resolutely but wait awhile and see in some way george dawkins learned that paul had expressed the determination to dispute his place it occasioned him considerable amusement halloa young stupid he called out at recess paul did not answer why dont you answer when you are spoken to he asked angrily when you call me by my right name said paul quietly i will answer and not before youre mighty independent sneered dawkins i dont know but i may have to teach you manners you had better wait till you are qualified said paul coolly dawkins approached our hero menacingly but paul did not look in the least alarmed and he concluded to attack him with words only i understand you have set yourself up as my rival he said mockingly not just yet said paul but in time i expect to be so you expect my place said dawkins glancing about him well talk about that three months hence said paul dont hurt yourself studying sneered dawkins scornfully to this paul did not deign a reply but the same day he rose one in his class our hero had a large stock of energy and determination when he had once set his mind upon a thing he kept steadily at work till he accomplished it this is the great secret of success it sometimes happens that a man who has done nothing will at once accomplish a brilliant success by one spasmodic effort but such cases are extremely rare slow and sure wins the race is an old proverb that has a great deal of truth in it paul worked industriously the kind sexton and his wife who noticed his assiduity strove to dissuade him from working so steadily you are working too hard paul they said do i look pale asked paul pointing with a smile to his red cheeks no but you will before long when i am i will study less but you know uncle hugh so the sexton instructed him to call him i want to make the most of my present advantages besides theres a particular boy who thinks i am stupid i want to convince him that he is mistaken you are a little ambitious then paul yes but it isnt that alone i know the value of knowledge and i want to secure as much as i can that is an excellent motive paul then you wont make me study less not unless i see you are getting sick paul took good care of this he knew how to play as well as to study and his laugh on the playground was as merry as any his cheerful obliging disposition made him a favorite with his companions only george dawkins held out he had for some reason imbibed a dislike for paul pauls industry was not without effect he gradually gained position in his class take care dawkins said one of his companions the same one who had before spoken to paul paul prescott will be disputing your place with you he has come up seventeen places in a month much good itll do him said dawkins contemptuously for all that you will have to be careful i can tell you that im not in the least afraid im a little too firm in my position to be ousted by young stupid just wait and see dawkins really entertained no apprehension he had unbounded confidence in himself and felt a sense of power in the rapidity with which he could master a lesson he therefore did not study much and though he could not but see that paul was rapidly advancing he rejected with scorn the idea that young stupid could displace him this however was the object at which paul was aiming he had not forgotten the nickname which dawkins had given him and this was the revenge which he sought a strictly honorable one at length the day of his triumph came at the end of the month the master read off the classlist and much to his disgust george dawkins found himself playing second fiddle to young stupid xvii bens practical joke mrs mudge was in the back room bending over a tub it was washingday and she was particularly busy she was a driving bustling woman and whatever might be her faults of temper she was at least industrious and energetic had mr mudge been equally so they would have been better off in a worldly point of view but her husband was constitutionally lazy and was never disposed to do more than was needful mrs mudge was in a bad humor that morning one of the cows had got into the garden through a gap in the fence and made sad havoc among the cabbages now if mrs mudge had a weakness it was for cabbages she was excessively fond of them and had persuaded her husband to set out a large number of plants from which she expected a large crop they were planted in one corner of the garden adjoining a piece of land which since mowing had been used for pasturing the cows there was a weak place in the fence separating the two inclosures and this mrs mudge had requested her husband to attend to he readily promised this and mrs mudge supposed it done until that same morning her sharp eyes had detected old brindle munching the treasured cabbages with a provoking air of enjoyment the angry lady seized a broom and repaired quickly to the scene of devastation brindle scented the danger from afar and beat a disorderly retreat trampling down the cabbages which she had hitherto spared leaping over the broken fence she had just cleared the gap as the broomhandle missing her came forcibly down upon the rail and was snapped in sunder by the blow here was a new vexation brindle had not only escaped scotfree but the broom a new one bought only the week before was broken its a plaguy shame said mrs mudge angrily theres my best broom broken cost fortytwo cents only last week she turned and contemplated the scene of devastation this yielded her little consolation at least thirty cabbages destroyed by that scamp of a cow she exclaimed in a tone bordering on despair i wish id a hit her if id broken my broom over her back i wouldnt a cared so much and its all mudges fault hes the most shiftless man i ever see ill give him a dressing down see if i dont mrs mudges eyes snapped viciously and she clutched the relics of the broom with a degree of energy which rendered it uncertain what sort of a dressing down she intended for her husband ten minutes after she had reentered the kitchen the luckless man made his appearance he wore his usual look little dreaming of the storm that awaited him im glad youve come said mrs mudge grimly whats amiss now inquired mudge for he understood her look whats amiss blazed mrs mudge ill let you know do you see this she seized the broken broom and flourished it in his face broken your broom have you you must have been careless careless was i demanded mrs mudge sarcastically yes of course its always i that am in fault you havent broken it over the back of any of the paupers have you asked her husband who knowing his helpmeets infirmity of temper thought it possible she might have indulged in such an amusement if i had broken it over anybodys back it would have been yours said the lady mine what have i been doing its what you havent done said mrs mudge youre about the laziest and most shiftless man i ever came across come what does all this mean demanded mr mudge who was getting a little angry in his turn ill let you know just look out of that window will you well said mr mudge innocently i dont see anything in particular you dont said mrs mudge with withering sarcasm then youd better put on your glasses if youd been here quarter of an hour ago youd have seen brindle among the cabbages did she do any harm asked mr mudge hastily theres scarcely a cabbage left returned mrs mudge purposely exaggerating the mischief done if you had mended that fence as i told you to do time and again it wouldnt have happened you didnt tell me but once said mr mudge trying to get up a feeble defence once should have been enough and more than enough you expect me to slave myself to death in the house and see to all your work besides if id known what a lazy shiftless man you were at the time i married you id have cut off my right hand first by this time mr mudge had become angry if you hadnt married me youd a died an old maid he retorted this was too much for mrs mudge to bear she snatched the larger half of the broom and fetched it down with considerable emphasis upon the back of her liege lord who perceiving that her temper was up retreated hastily from the kitchen as he got into the yard he descried brindle whose appetite had been whetted by her previous raid reentering the garden through the gap it was an unfortunate attempt on the part of brindle mr mudge angry with his wife and smarting with the blow from the broomstick determined to avenge himself upon the original cause of all the trouble revenge suggested craft he seized a hoe and crept stealthily to the cabbageplot brindle whose back was turned did not perceive his approach until she felt a shower of blows upon her back confused at the unexpected attack she darted wildly away forgetting the gap in the fence and raced at random over beds of vegetables uprooting beets parsnips and turnips while mr mudge mad with rage followed close in her tracks hitting her with the hoe whenever he got a chance brindle galloped through the yard and out at the open gate thence she ran up the road at the top of her speed with mr mudge still pursuing her it may be mentioned here that mr mudge was compelled to chase the terrified cow over two miles before he succeeded with the help of a neighbor in capturing her all this took time meanwhile mrs mudge at home was subjected to yet another trial of her temper it has already been mentioned that squire newcome was chairman of the overseers of the poor in virtue of his office he was expected to exercise a general supervision over the almshouse and its management it was his custom to call about once a month to look after matters and ascertain whether any official action or interference was needed ben saw his father take his goldheaded cane from behind the door and start down the road he understood his destination and instantly the plan of a stupendous practical joke dawned upon him itll be jolly fun he said to himself his eyes dancing with fun ill try it anyway he took his way across the fields so as to reach the almshouse before his father he then commenced his plan of operations mrs mudge had returned to her tub and was washing away with bitter energy thinking over her grievances in the matter of mr mudge when a knock was heard at the front door taking her hands from the tub she wiped them on her apron i wish folks wouldnt come on washing day she said in a tone of vexation she went to the door and opened it there was nobody there i thought somebody knocked thought she a little mystified perhaps i was mistaken she went back to her tub and had no sooner got her hands in the suds than another knock was heard this time on the back door i declare said she in increased vexation theres another knock i shant get through my washing today again mrs mudge wiped her hands on her apron and went to the door there was nobody there i need hardly say that it was ben who had knocked both times and instantly dodged round the corner of the house its some plaguy boy said mrs mudge her eyes blazing with anger oh if i could only get hold of him dont you wish you could chuckled ben to himself as he caught a sly glimpse of the indignant woman meanwhile squire newcome had walked along in his usual slow and dignified manner until he had reached the front door of the poorhouse and knocked its that plaguy boy again said mrs mudge furiously i wont go this time but if he knocks again ill fix him she took a dipper of hot suds from the tub in which she had been washing and crept carefully into the entry taking up a station close to the front door i wonder if mrs mudge heard me knock thought squire newcome i should think she might i believe i will knock again this time he knocked with his cane rattattat sounded on the door the echo had not died away when the door was pulled suddenly open and a dipper full of hot suds was dashed into the face of the astonished squire accompanied with take that you young scamp wh what does all this mean gasped squire newcome nearly strangled with the suds a part of which had found its way into his mouth i beg your pardon squire newcome said the horrified mrs mudge i didnt mean it what did you mean then demanded squire newcome sternly i think you addressed me ahem as a scamp oh i didnt mean you said mrs mudge almost out of her wits with perplexity come in sir and let me give you a towel youve no idea how ive been tried this morning i trust said the squire in his stateliest tone you will be able to give a satisfactory explanation of this ahem extraordinary proceeding while mrs mudge was endeavoring to sooth the ruffled dignity of the aggrieved squire the young scamp who had caused all the mischief made his escape through the fields oh wasnt it bully he exclaimed i believe i shall die of laughing i wish paul had been here to see it mrs mudge has got herself into a scrape now im thinking having attained a safe distance from the poorhouse ben doubled himself up and rolled over and over upon the grass convulsed with laughter id give five dollars to see it all over again he said to himself i never had such splendid fun in my life presently the squire emerged his tall dicky looking decidedly limp and drooping his face expressing annoyance and outraged dignity mrs mudge attended him to the door with an expression of anxious concern i guess id better make tracks said ben to himself it wont do for the old gentleman to see me here or he may smell a rat he accordingly scrambled over a stone wall and lay quietly hidden behind it till he judged it would be safe to make his appearance xviii more about ben benjamin said squire newcome two days after the occurrence mentioned in the last chapter what made the dog howl so this morning was you a doing anything to him i gave him his breakfast said ben innocently perhaps he was hungry and howling for that i do not refer to that said the squire he howled as if in pain or terror i repeat was you a doing anything to him ben shifted from one foot to the other and looked out of the window i desire a categorical answer said squire newcome dont know what categorical means said ben assuming a perplexed look i desire you to answer me immegiately explained the squire what was you a doing to watch i was tying a tinkettle to his tail said ben a little reluctantly and what was you a doing that for pursued the squire i wanted to see how he would look said ben glancing demurely at his father out of the corner of his eye did it ever occur to you that it must be disagreeable to watch to have such an appendage to his tail queried the squire i dont know said ben how should you like to have a tin pail suspended to your ahem your coat tail i havent got any coat tail said ben i wear jackets but i think i am old enough to wear coats cant i have one made father ahem said the squire blowing his nose we will speak of that at some future period fred newell wears a coat and he isnt any older than i am persisted ben who was desirous of interrupting his fathers inquiries i apprehend that we are wandering from the question said the squire would you like to be treated as you treated watch no said ben slowly i dont know as i should then take care not to repeat your conduct of this morning said his father stay a moment as ben was about to leave the room hastily i desire that you should go to the postoffice and inquire for letters yes sir ben left the room and sauntered out in the direction of the postoffice a chaise driven by a stranger stopped as it came up with him the driver looked towards ben and inquired boy is this the way to sparta ben who was walking leisurely along the path whistling as he went never turned his head are you deaf boy said the driver impatiently i want to know if this is the road to sparta ben turned round fine morning sir he said politely i know that well enough without your telling me will you tell me whether this is the road to sparta ben put his hand to his ear and seemed to listen attentively then he slowly shook his head and said would you be kind enough to speak a little louder sir the boy is deaf after all said the driver to himself is this the road to sparta yes sir this is wrenville said ben politely plague take it he dont hear me yet is this the road to sparta just a little louder if you please said ben keeping his hand to his ear and appearing anxious to hear deaf as a post muttered the driver i couldnt scream any louder if i should try go along poor man i hope he hasnt injured his voice thought ben his eyes dancing with fun by gracious he continued a moment later bursting into a laugh if he isnt going to ask the way of old tom haven hes as deaf as i pretended to be the driver had reined up again and inquired the way to sparta what did you say said the old man putting his hand to his ear im rather hard of hearing the traveller repeated his question in a louder voice the old man shook his head i guess youd better ask that boy he said pointing to ben who by this time had nearly come up with the chaise i have had enough of him said the traveller disgusted i believe youre all deaf in this town ill get out of it as soon as possible he whipped up his horse somewhat to the old mans surprise and drove rapidly away i desire my young readers to understand that i am describing ben as he was and not as he ought to be there is no doubt that he carried his love of fun too far we will hope that as he grows older he will grow wiser ben pursued the remainder of his way to the postoffice without any further adventure entering a small building appropriated to this purpose he inquired for letters theres nothing for your father today said the postmaster perhaps theres something for me benjamin newcome esq said ben let me see said the postmaster putting on his spectacles yes i believe there is postmarked at new york too i didnt know you had any correspondents there its probably from the mayor of new york said ben in a tone of comical importance asking my advice about laying out central park probably it is said the postmaster its a pretty thick letter looks like an official document by this time ben who was really surprised by the reception of the letter had opened it it proved to be from our hero paul prescott and inclosed one for aunt lucy mr crosby said ben suddenly addressing the postmaster you remember about paul prescotts running away from the poorhouse yes i didnt blame the poor boy a bit i never liked mudge and they say his wife is worse than he well suppose the town should find out where he is could they get him back again bless you no they aint so fond of supporting paupers if hes able to earn his own living they wont want to interfere with him well this letter is from him said ben hes found a pleasant family in new york who have adopted him im glad of it said mr crosby heartily i always liked him he was a fine fellow thats just what i think ill read his letter to you if you would like to hear it i should very much come in behind here and sit down ben went inside the office and sitting down on a stool read pauls letter as our reader may be interested in the contents we will take the liberty of looking over bens shoulder while he reads new york oct dear ben i have been intending to write to you before knowing the kind interest which you take in me i got safely to new york a few days after i left wrenville i didnt have so hard a time as i expected having fallen in with a pedler who was very kind to me with whom i rode thirty or forty miles i wish i had time to tell all the adventures i met with on the way but i must wait till i see you when i got to the city i was astonished to find how large it was the first day i got pretty tired wandering about and strayed into a church in the evening not knowing where else to go i was so tired i fell asleep there and didnt wake up till morning when i found myself locked up in a great church i was frightened i can tell you it was only thursday morning and i was afraid i should have to stay there till sunday if i had i am afraid i should have starved to death but fortunately for me the sexton came in the morning and let me out that wasnt all he very kindly took me home with him and then told me i might live with him and go to school i like him very much and his wife too i call them uncle hugh and aunt hester when you write to me you must direct to the care of mr hugh cameron r street then it will be sure to reach me i am going to one of the city schools at first i was a good deal troubled because i was so far behind boys of my age you know i hadnt been to school for a long time before i left wrenville on account of fathers sickness but i studied pretty hard and now i stand very well i sometimes think ben that you dont care quite so much about study as you ought to i wish you would come to feel the importance of it you must excuse me saying this as we have always been such good friends i sometimes think of mr and mrs mudge and wonder whether they miss me much i am sure mr mudge misses me for now he is obliged to get up early and milk unless he has found another boy to do it if he has i pity the boy write me what they said about my going away i inclose a letter for aunt lucy lee which i should like to have you give her with your own hands dont trust it to mrs mudge for she doesnt like aunt lucy and i dont think she would give it to her write soon ben and i will answer without delay your affectionate friend paul prescott thats a very good letter said mr crosby i am glad paul is doing so well i should like to see him so should i said ben he was a prime fellow twice as good as i am thats true what he said about my not liking study i guess ill try to do better youll make a smart boy if you only try said the postmaster with whom ben was rather a favorite in spite of his mischievous propensities thank you said ben laughing thats what my friend the mayor of new york often writes me but honestly i know i can do a good deal better than i am doing now i dont know but i shall turn over a new leaf i suppose i like fun a little too well such jolly sport as i had coming to the office this morning ben related the story of the traveller who inquired the way to sparta much to the amusement of the postmaster who in his enjoyment of the joke forgot to tell ben that his conduct was hardly justifiable now said ben as soon as i have been home i must go and see my particular friend mrs mudge im a great favorite of hers he added with a sly wink xix mrs mudges discomfiture ben knocked at the door of the poorhouse in due time mrs mudge appeared she was a little alarmed on seeing ben not knowing how squire newcome might be affected by the reception she had given him on his last visit accordingly she received him with unusual politeness how do you do master newcome she inquired as well as could be expected said ben hesitatingly why is there anything the matter with you inquired mrs mudge her curiosity excited by his manner of speaking no one can tell what i suffer from rheumatism said ben sadly this was very true since not even ben himself could have told you are very young to be troubled in that way said mrs mudge and how is your respected father today she inquired with some anxiety i was just going to ask you mrs mudge said ben whether anything happened to disturb him when he called here day before yesterday why said mrs mudge turning a little pale nothing of any consequence that is not much what makes you ask i thought it might be so from his manner said ben enjoying mrs mudges evident alarm there was a little accident said mrs mudge reluctantly some mischievous boy had been knocking and running away so when your father knocked i thought it might be he and and i believe i threw some water on him but i hope he has forgiven it as it wasnt intentional i should like to get hold of that boy said mrs mudge wrathfully i should like to shake him up have you any idea who it was asked ben gravely no said mrs mudge i havent but i shall try to find out whoever it is hes a scamp very complimentary old lady thought ben he said in a sober tone which would have imposed upon any one there are a good many mischievous boys around here mrs mudge grimly assented oh by the way mrs mudge asked ben suddenly have you ever heard anything of paul prescott since he left you no snapped mrs mudge her countenance growing dark i havent but i can tell pretty well where he is where in the penitentiary at any rate if he isnt he ought to be but what was you wanting i want to see mrs lee aunt lucy lee yes ive got a letter for her if youll give me the letter ill carry it to her thank you said ben but i would like to see her never mind thought mrs mudge ill get hold of it yet i shouldnt wonder at all if it was from that rascal paul poor paul it was fortunate that he had some better friends than mr and mrs mudge otherwise he would have been pretty poorly off aunt lucy came to the door ben placed the letter in her hands is it from paul she asked hopefully yes said ben she opened it eagerly is he well she asked yes well and happy said ben who treated the old lady for whom he had much respect very differently from mrs mudge im truly thankful for that said aunt lucy ive laid awake more than one night thinking of him so has mrs mudge im thinking said ben slyly aunt lucy laughed there isnt much love lost between them said aunt lucy smiling he was very badly treated here poor boy was he though repeated mrs mudge who had been listening at the keyhole but not in an audible voice perhaps he will be again if i get him back i thought that letter was from paul i must get hold of it some time today i believe i must go said ben if you answer the letter i will put it into the office for you i shall be passing here tomorrow you are very kind said aunt lucy i am very much obliged to you for bringing me this letter today you cant tell how happy it makes me i have been so afraid the dear boy might be suffering its no trouble at all said ben shes a pretty good woman thought he as he left the house i wouldnt play a trick on her for a good deal but that mrs mudge is a hard case i wonder what she would have said if she had known that i was the scamp that troubled her so much monday if i had such a mother as that by jingo id run away to sea mrs mudge was bent upon reading aunt lucys letter knowing it to be from paul she had a strong curiosity to know what had become of him if she could only get him back her heart bounded with delight as she thought of the annoyances to which in that case she could subject him it would be a double triumph over him and aunt lucy against whom she felt that mean spite with which a superior nature is often regarded by one of a lower order after some reflection mrs mudge concluded that aunt lucy would probably leave the letter in the little chest which was appropriated to her use and which was kept in the room where she slept the key of this chest had been lost and although aunt lucy had repeatedly requested that a new one should be obtained mrs mudge had seen fit to pay no attention to her request as it would interfere with purposes of her own the character of which may easily be guessed as she suspected pauls letter had been deposited in this chest accordingly the same afternoon she left her work in the kitchen in order to institute a search for it as a prudent precaution however she just opened the door of the common room to make sure that aunt lucy was at work therein she made her way upstairs and entering the room in which the old lady lodged together with two others she at once went to the chest and opened it she began to rummage round among the old ladys scanty treasures and at length much to her joy happened upon the letter laid carefully away in one corner of the chest she knew it was the one she sought from the recent postmark and the address which was in the unformed handwriting of a boy to make absolutely certain she drew the letter from the envelope and looked at the signature she was right as she saw at a glance it was from paul now ill see what the little rascal has to say for himself she muttered i hope hes in distress oh how id like to get hold of him mrs mudge began eagerly to read the letter not dreaming of interruption but she was destined to be disappointed to account for this we must explain that shortly after mrs mudge looked into the common room aunt lucy was reminded of something essential which she had left upstairs she accordingly laid down her work upon the chair in which she had been sitting and went up to her chamber mrs mudge was too much preoccupied to hear the advancing steps as the old lady entered the chamber what was her mingled indignation and dismay at seeing mrs mudge on her knees before her chest with the precious letter whose arrival had gladdened her so much in her hands what are you doing there mrs mudge she said sternly mrs mudge rose from her knees in confusion even she had the grace to be ashamed of her conduct put down that letter said the old lady in an authoritative voice quite new to her mrs mudge who had not yet collected her scattered senses did as she was requested aunt lucy walked hastily to the chest and closed it first securing the letter which she put in her pocket i hope it will be safe now she said rather contemptuously aint you ashamed of yourself mrs mudge ashamed of myself shrieked that amiable lady indignant with herself for having quailed for a moment before the old lady what do you mean you you pauper i may be a pauper said aunt lucy calmly but i am thankful to say that i mind my own business and dont meddle with other peoples chests a red spot glowed on either cheek of mrs mudge she was trying hard to find some vantageground over the old lady do you mean to say that i dont mind my business she blustered folding her arms defiantly what were you at my trunk for said the old lady significantly because it was my duty was the brazen reply mrs mudge had rapidly determined upon her line of defense and thought it best to carry the war into the enemys country yes i felt sure that your letter was from paul prescott and as he ran away from my husband and me who were his lawful guardians it was my duty to take that means of finding out where he is i knew that you were in league with him and would do all you could to screen him this is why i went to your chest and i would do it again if necessary perhaps you have been before said aunt lucy scornfully i think i understand now why you were unwilling to give me another key fortunately there has been nothing there until now to reward your search you impudent trollop shrieked mrs mudge furiously her anger was the greater because aunt lucy was entirely correct in her supposition that this was not the first visit her landlady had made to the little green chest ill give paul the worst whipping he ever had when i get him back said mrs mudge angrily he is beyond your reach thank providence said aunt lucy whose equanimity was not disturbed by this menace which she knew to be an idle one that is enough for you to know i will take care that you never have another chance to see this letter and if you ever go to my chest again well maam what then i shall appeal for protection to squire newcome hoity toity said mrs mudge but she was a little alarmed nevertheless as such an appeal would probably be prejudicial to her interest so from time to time aunt lucy received through ben letters from paul which kept her acquainted with his progress at school these letters were very precious to the old lady and she read them over many times they formed a bright link of interest which bound her to the outside world and enabled her to bear up with greater cheerfulness against the tyranny of mrs mudge xx paul obtains a situation the month after paul prescott succeeded in reaching the head of his class george dawkins exerted himself to rise above him he studied better than usual and proved in truth a formidable rival but pauls spirit was roused he resolved to maintain his position if possible he had now become accustomed to study and it cost him less effort when the end of the month came there was considerable speculation in the minds of the boys as to the result of the rivalry the majority had faith in paul but there were some who remembering how long dawkins had been at the head of the class thought he would easily regain his lost rank the eventful day the first of the month at length came and the classlist was read paul prescott ranked first george dawkins ranked second a flush spread over the pale face of dawkins and he darted a malignant glance at paul who was naturally pleased at having retained his rank dawkins had his satellites one of these came to him at recess and expressed his regret that dawkins had failed of success dawkins repelled the sympathy with cold disdain what do you suppose i care for the head of the class he demanded haughtily i thought you had been studying for it then you thought wrong let the sextons son have it if he wants it it would be of no use to me as i leave this school at the end of the week leave school the boys gathered about dawkins curiously is it really so dawkins they inquired yes said dawkins with an air of importance i shall go to a private school where the advantages are greater than here my father does not wish me to attend a public school any longer this statement was made on the spur of the moment to cover the mortification which his defeat had occasioned him it proved true however on his return home dawkins succeeded in persuading his father to transfer him to a private school and he took away his books at the end of the week had he recovered his lost rank there is no doubt that he would have remained truth to tell there were few who mourned much for the departure of george dawkins he had never been a favorite his imperious temper and arrogance rendered this impossible after he left school paul saw little of him for two or three years at their first encounter paul bowed and spoke pleasantly but dawkins looked superciliously at him without appearing to know him pauls face flushed proudly and afterwards he abstained from making advances which were likely to be repulsed he had too much selfrespect to submit voluntarily to such slights meanwhile pauls school life fled rapidly it was a happy time happy in its freedom from care and happy for him though all school boys do not appreciate that consideration in the opportunities for improvement which it afforded these opportunities it is only just to paul to say were fully improved he left school with an enviable reputation and with the good wishes of his schoolmates and teachers paul was now sixteen years old a stout handsome boy with a frank open countenance and a general air of health which formed quite a contrast to the appearance he presented when he left the hospitable mansion which mr nicholas mudge kept open at the public expense paul was now very desirous of procuring a situation he felt that it was time he was doing something for himself he was ambitious to relieve the kind sexton and his wife of some portion at least of the burden of his support besides there was the legacy of debt which his father had bequeathed him never for a moment had paul forgotten it never for a moment had he faltered in his determination to liquidate it at whatever sacrifice to himself my fathers name shall be cleared he said to himself proudly neither squire conant nor any one else shall have it in his power to cast reproach upon his memory the sexton applauded his purpose you are quite right paul he said but you need not feel in haste obtain your education first and the money will come byandby as long as you repay the amount principal and interest you will have done all that you are in honor bound to do squire conant as i understand from you is a rich man so that he will experience no hardship in waiting paul was now solicitous about a place the sexton had little influence so that he must depend mainly upon his own inquiries he went into the readingroom of the astor house every day to look over the advertised wants in the daily papers every day he noted down some addresses and presented himself as an applicant for a position generally however he found that some one else had been before him one day his attention was drawn to the following advertisement wanted a smart active wideawake boy of sixteen or seventeen in a retail drygoods store apply immediately at broadway paul walked up to the address mentioned over the door he read smith thompson this then was the firm that had advertised the store ran back some distance there appeared to be six or eight clerks in attendance upon quite a respectable number of customers is mr smith in inquired paul of the nearest clerk youll find him at the lower end of the store how many yards maam this last was of course addressed to a customer paul made his way as directed to the lower end of the store a short wiry nervous man was writing at a desk is mr smith in asked paul my name what can i do for you said the short man crisply i saw an advertisement in the tribune for a boy and you have applied for the situation said mr smith yes sir how old are you with a rapid glance at our hero sixteen nearly seventeen i suppose that means that you will be seventeen in eleven months and a half no sir said paul i shall be seventeen in three months all right most boys call themselves a year older whats your name paul prescott p p any relation to fanny fern no sir said paul rather astonished didnt know but you might be p p and f f where do you live paul mentioned the street and number thats well you are near by said mr smith now are you afraid of work no sir said paul smiling not much well thats important how much wages do you expect i suppose said paul hesitating i couldnt expect very much at first of course not green you know what do you say to a dollar a week a dollar a week exclaimed paul in dismay i hoped to get enough to pay for my board nonsense there are plenty of boys glad enough to come for a dollar a week at first you know but ill stretch a point with you and offer you a dollar and a quarter what do you say how soon could i expect to have my wages advanced inquired our hero with considerable anxiety well said smith at the end of a month or two ill go home and speak to my uncle about it said paul feeling undecided cant keep the place open for you ah theres another boy at the door ill accept said paul jumping to a decision he had applied in so many different quarters without success that he could not make up his mind to throw away this chance poor as it seemed when shall i come come tomorrow at what time sir at seven oclock this seemed rather early however paul was prepared to expect some discomforts and signified that he would come as he turned to go away another boy passed him probably bent on the same errand with himself paul hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry he had expected at least three dollars a week and the descent to a dollar and a quarter was rather disheartening still he was encouraged by the promise of a rise at the end of a month or two so on the whole he went home cheerful well paul what luck today asked mr cameron who had just got home as paul entered ive got a place uncle hugh you have where with smith thompson no broadway what sort of a store i dont remember the name it is a retail drygoods store did you like the looks of your future employer i dont know said paul hesitating he looked as if he might be a pretty sharp man in business but i have seen others that i would rather work for however beggars mustnt be choosers but there was one thing i was disappointed about what was that paul about the wages how much will they give you only a dollar and a quarter a week at first that is small to be sure the most i think of uncle hugh is that i shall still be an expense to you i hoped to get enough to be able to pay my board from the first my dear boy said the sexton kindly dont trouble yourself on that score it costs little more for three than for two and the little i expend on your account is richly made up by the satisfaction we feel in your society and your good conduct you say that to encourage me uncle hugh said paul you have done all for me i have done nothing for you no paul i spoke the truth hester and i have both been happier since you came to us we hope you will long remain with us you are already as dear to us as the son that we lost thank you uncle hugh said paul in a voice tremulous with feeling i will do all i can to deserve your kindness xxi smith and thompsons young man at seven oclock the next morning paul stood before smith thompsons store as he came up on one side another boy came down on the other and crossed the street are you the new boy he asked surveying paul attentively i suppose so said paul ive engaged to work for smith thompson all right im glad to see you said the other this looked kind and paul thanked him for his welcome o said the other bursting into a laugh you neednt trouble yourself about thanking me im glad youve come because now i shant have to open the store and sweep out just lend a hand there ill help you about taking down the shutters this morning and tomorrow youll have to get along alone the two boys opened the store whats your name asked pauls new acquaintance paul prescott what is yours nicholas benton you may call me mr benton mr benton repeated paul in some astonishment yes im a young man now ive been smith thompsons boy till now now im promoted paul looked at mr benton with some amusement that young man was somewhat shorter than himself and sole proprietor of a stock of pale yellow hair which required an abundant stock of bears grease to keep it in order his face was freckled and expressionless his eyebrows and eyelashes were of the same faded color he was dressed however with some pretensions to smartness he wore a blue necktie of large dimensions fastened by an enormous breastpin which in its already tarnished splendor suggested strong doubts as to the apparent gold being genuine theres the broom paul said mr benton assuming a graceful position on the counter youll have to sweep out only look sharp about raising a dust or smithll be into your wool what sort of a man is mr smith asked paul with some curiosity o hes an out and outer sharp as a steel trap hell make you toe the mark do you like him asked paul not quite sure whether he understood his employers character from the description i dont like him well enough to advise any of my folks to trade with him said mr benton why not hed cheat em out of their eye teeth if they happened to have any said the young man coolly beginning to pick his teeth with a knife paul began to doubt whether he should like mr smith i say said mr benton after a pause have you begun to shave yet paul looked up to see if his companion were in earnest no said he i havent got along as far as that have you i repeated the young man a little contemptuously of course i have ive shaved for a year and a half do you find it hard shaving asked paul a little slyly well my beard is rather stiff said the late boy with an important air but ive got used to it aint you rather young to shave nicholas asked paul mr benton if you please i mean mr benton perhaps i was when i begun but now i am nineteen nineteen yes that is to say im within a few months of being nineteen what do you think of my moustache i hadnt noticed it the stores rather dark muttered mr benton who seemed a little annoyed by this answer if youll come a little nearer you can see it drawing near paul after some trouble descried a few scattering hairs yes said he wanting to laugh i see it coming on finely isnt it asked mr nicholas benton complacently yes said paul rather doubtfully i dont mind letting you into a secret said benton affably if you wont mention it ive been using some of the six weeks stuff the what asked paul opening his eyes havent you heard of it inquired benton a little contemptuously where have you been living all your life havent you seen it advertised warranted to produce a full set of whiskers or moustaches upon the smoothest face etc i got some a week ago only a dollar five weeks from now youll see something thatll astonish you paul was not a little amused by his new companion and would have laughed but that he feared to offend him youd better get some said mr benton ill let you just try mine once if you want to thank you said paul i dont think i want to have a moustache just yet well perhaps youre right being a boy perhaps it wouldnt be advisable when does mr smith come in not till nine and the other clerks about eight oclock i shant come till eight tomorrow morning theres one thing i should like to ask you said paul of course you wont answer unless you like out with it how much does mr smith pay you ahem said benton what does he pay you a dollar and a quarter a week he paid me a dollar and a half to begin with did he he wanted me to come first at a dollar just like him didnt i tell you he was an out and outer hell be sure to take you in if you will let him but said paul anxiously he said hed raise it in a month or two he wont offer to youll have to tease him and then how muchll he raise it not more than a quarter how much do you think i get now how long have you been here a year and a half five dollars a week guessed paul five he only gives me two and a half that is he hasnt been paying me but that now of course hell raise as ive been promoted how much do you expect to get now maybe four dollars and im worth ten any day hes a mean old skinflint smith is this glimpse at his own prospects did not tend to make paul feel very comfortable he could not repress a sigh of disappointment when he thought of this mortifying termination of all his brilliant prospects he had long nourished the hope of being able to repay the good sexton for his outlay in his behalf besides discharging the debt which his father had left behind him now there seemed to be little prospect of either he had half a mind to resign his place immediately upon the entrance of mr smith but two considerations dissuaded him one that the sum which he was to receive though small would at least buy his clothes and besides he was not at all certain of obtaining another situation with a sigh therefore he went about his duties he had scarcely got the store ready when some of the clerks entered and the business of the day commenced at nine mr smith appeared so youre here peter remarked he as he caught sight of our hero paul corrected the owner of that name well well peter or paul dont make much difference both were apostles if i remember right all ready for work eh yes sir said paul neither very briskly nor cheerfully well said mr smith after a pause i guess ill put you into the calico department williams you may take him under your wing and now peter all the same paul ive got a word or two to say to you as i always do to every boy who comes into my store dont forget what youre here for its to sell goods take care to sell something to every man woman and child that comes in your way thats the way to do business follow it up and youll be a rich man some day but suppose they dont want anything said paul make em want something returned smith dont let em off without buying thats my motto however youll learn smith bustled off and began in his nervous way to exercise a general supervision over all that was going on in the store he seemed to be all eyes while apparently entirely occupied in waiting upon a customer he took notice of all the customers in the store and could tell what they bought and how much they paid paul listened attentively to the clerk under whom he was placed for instruction whats the price of this calico inquired a commonlooking woman a shilling a yard maam this was not in war times it looks rather coarse coarse maam what can you be thinking of it is a superfine piece of goods we sell more of it than of any other figure the mayors wife was in here yesterday and bought two dress patterns off of it did she asked the woman who appeared favorably impressed by this circumstance yes and she promised to send her friends here after some of it youd better take it while you can get it will it wash to be sure it will then i guess you may cut me off ten yards this was quickly done and the woman departed with her purchase five minutes later another woman entered with a bundle of the same figured calico seeing her coming williams hastily slipped the remnant of the piece out of sight i got this calico here said the newcomer one day last week you warranted it to wash but i find it wont heres a piece ive tried she showed a pattern which had a faded look youve come to the wrong store said williams coolly you must have got the calico somewhere else no im sure i got it here i remember particularly buying it of you youve got a better memory than i have then we havent got a piece of calico like that in the store paul listened to this assertion with unutterable surprise i am quite certain i bought it here said the woman perplexed must have been the next store blake hastings better go over there the woman went out thats the way to do business said williams winking at paul paul said nothing but he felt more than ever doubtful about retaining his place xxii mr bentons adventure one evening about a fortnight after his entrance into smith thompsons employment paul was putting up the shutters the business of the day being over it devolved upon him to open and close the store and usually he was the last one to go home this evening however mr nicholas benton graciously remained behind and assisted paul in closing the store this was unusual and surprised paul a little it was soon explained however goodnight nicholas i mean mr benton said paul not quite yet i want you to walk a little way with me this evening paul hesitated come no backing out i want to confide to you a very important secret he looked so mysterious that pauls curiosity was aroused and reflecting that it was yet early he took his companions proffered arm and sauntered along by his side whats the secret he asked at length perceiving that nicholas was silent wait till we get to a more retired place he turned out of broadway into a side street where the passers were less numerous i dont think you could guess said the young man turning towards our hero i dont think i could and yet continued benton meditatively it is possible that you may have noticed something in my appearance just a little unusual within the last week havent you now paul could not say that he had mr benton looked a little disappointed nobody can tell what has been the state of my feelings he resumed after a pause you aint sick questioned paul hastily nothing of the sort only my appetite has been a good deal affected i dont think i have eaten as much in a week as you would in a day he added complacently if i felt that way i should think i was going to be sick said paul ill let you into the secret said mr benton lowering his voice and looking carefully about him to make sure that no one was within hearing distance im in love this seemed so utterly ludicrous to paul that he came very near losing mr bentons friendship forever by bursting into a hearty laugh i didnt think of that he said its taken away my appetite and i havent been able to sleep nights continued mr benton in a cheerful tone i feel just as howard courtenay did in the great story thats coming out in the weekly budget youve read it havent you i dont think i have said paul then you ought to its tiptop its rather curious too that the lady looks just as miranda does in the same story how is that wait a minute and ill read the description mr benton pulled a paper from his pocket the last copy of the weekly budget and by the light of a street lamp read the following extract to his amused auditor miranda was just eighteen her form was queenly and majestic tall and stately she moved among her handmaidens with a dignity which revealed her superior rank her eyes were dark as night her luxuriant tresses there the rest is torn off said mr benton in a tone of vexation she is tall then said paul yes just like miranda then said our hero in some hesitation i should think she would not be very well suited to you why not asked mr benton quickly because said paul youre rather short you know im about the medium height said mr benton raising himself upon his toes as he spoke not quite said paul trying not to laugh im as tall as mr smith resumed mr benton in a tone which warned paul that this was a forbidden subject but you dont ask me who she is i didnt know as you would be willing to tell i shant tell any one but you its miss hawkins firm of hawkins brewer that is her father belongs to the firm not she and paul here he clutched our heros arm convulsively ive made a declaration of my love and and well she has answered my letter has she asked paul with some curiosity what did she say she has written me to be under her window this evening why under her window why didnt she write you to call probably she will but its more romantic to say be under my window well perhaps it is only you know i dont know much about such things of course not paul said mr benton youre only a boy you know are you going to be under her window nich i mean mr benton of course do you think i would miss the appointment no earthly power could prevent my doing it then i had better leave you said paul making a movement to go no i want you to accompany me as far as the door i feel a little agitated i suppose everybody does when they are in love added mr benton complacently well said paul i will see you to the door but i cant stay for they will wonder at home what has become of me all right are we anywhere near the house yes its only in the next street said mr benton o paul how my heart beats you cant imagine how i feel mr benton gasped for breath and looked as if he had swallowed a fish bone which he had some difficulty in getting down youll know how to understand my feelings sometime paul said mr benton when your time comes i will remember your service of tonight and i will stand by you paul inwardly hoped that he should never fall in love if it was likely to affect him in the same way as his companion but he thought it best not to say so by this time they had come in sight of a threestory brick house with benjamin hawkins on the doorplate thats the house said mr benton in an agitated whisper is it yes and that window on the lefthand side is the window of her chamber how do you know she told me in the letter and where are you to stand just underneath as the clock strikes nine it must be about the time at that moment the city clock struck nine mr benton left paul and crossing the street took up his position beneath the window of his charmer beginning to sing in a thin piping voice as preconcerted between them ever of thee im fooondly dreaming the song was destined never to be finished from his post in a doorway opposite paul saw the window softly open he could distinguish a tall female figure doubtless miss hawkins herself she held in her hand a pitcher of water which she emptied with welldirected aim full upon the small person of her luckless admirer the falling column struck upon his beaver thence spreading on all sides his carefully starched collar became instantly as limp as a rag while his coat suffered severely from the shower his tuneful accents died away in dismay ow he exclaimed jumping at least a yard and involuntarily shaking himself like a dog who did that there was no answer save a low musical laugh from the window above which was involuntarily echoed by paul what do you mean by laughing at me demanded mr benton smarting with mortification as he strode across the street trying to dry his hat with the help of his handkerchief is this what you call friendship excuse me gasped paul but i really couldnt help it i dont see anything to laugh at continued mr benton in a resentful tone because i have been subjected to unmanly persecution you must laugh at me instead of extending to me the sympathy of a friend i suppose you wont think of her any more said paul recovering himself think of her exclaimed mr benton would you have me tear her from my heart because her mercenary parent chooses to frown upon our love and follow me with base persecution her parent yes it was he who threw the water upon me but it shall not avail the young man continued folding his arms and speaking in a tone of resolution bolts and bars shall not keep two loving hearts asunder but it wasnt her father urged paul perceiving that mr benton was under a mistake who was it then it was the young lady herself who threw the water upon me it is a base slander but i saw her saw who a tall young lady with black hair and was it she who threw the water asked mr benton aghast at this unexpected revelation yes then she did it at the command of her proud parent paul did not dispute this since it seemed to comfort mr benton it is doubtful however whether the young man believed it himself since he straightway fell into a fit of gloomy abstraction and made no response when paul bade him goodnight xxiii paul loses his situation and gains a friend paul had a presentiment that he should not long remain in the employ of smith thompson it was not many weeks before this presentiment was verified after having received such instruction as was necessary the calico department was left in pauls charge one day a customer in turning over the patterns shown her took up a piece which paul knew from complaints made by purchasers would not wash this is pretty said she it is just what i have been looking for you may cut me off twelve yards yes maam wait a minute though interposed the lady will it wash i dont think it will said paul frankly there have been some complaints made about that then i shall not want it let me see what else you have got the customer finally departed having found nothing to suit her no sooner had she left the store than mr smith called paul well did you sell that lady anything no sir and why not demanded smith harshly because she did not like any of the pieces wouldnt she have ordered a dress pattern if you had not told her the calico would not wash yes sir i suppose so said paul preparing for a storm then why did you tell her demanded his employer angrily because she asked me couldnt you have told her that it would wash that would not have been the truth said paul sturdily youre a mighty conscientious young man sneered smith youre altogether too pious to succeed in business i discharge you from my employment very well sir said paul his heart sinking but keeping up a brave exterior then i have only to bid you goodmorning goodmorning sir said his employer with mock deference i advise you to study for the ministry and no longer waste your talents in selling calico paul made no reply but putting on his cap walked out of the store it was the middle of the week and mr smith was of course owing him a small sum for his services but paul was too proud to ask for his money which that gentleman did not see fit to volunteer i am sure i have done right thought paul i had no right to misrepresent the goods to that lady i wonder what uncle hugh will say you did perfectly right said the sexton after paul had related the circumstances of his dismissal i wouldnt have had you act differently for twenty situations i have no doubt you will get a better position elsewhere i hope so said paul now that i have lost the situation uncle hugh i dont mind saying that i never liked it now commenced a search for another place day after day paul went out and day after day he returned with the same want of success never mind paul said the sexton encouragingly when you do succeed perhaps youll get something worth waiting for one morning paul went out feeling that something was going to happen he didnt exactly know what but he felt somehow that there was to be a change in his luck he went out therefore with more hopefulness than usual yet when four oclock came and nothing had occurred except failure and disappointment which unhappily were not at all out of the ordinary course paul began to think that he was very foolish to have expected anything he was walking listlessly along a narrow street when on a sudden he heard an exclamation of terror of which on turning round he easily discovered the cause two spirited horses attached to an elegant carriage had been terrified in some way and were now running at the top of their speed there was no coachman on the box he had dismounted in order to ring at some door when the horses started he was now doing his best to overtake the horses but in a race between man and horse it is easy to predict which will have the advantage there seemed to be but one person in the carriage it was a lady whose face pale with terror could be seen from the carriage window her loud cries of alarm no doubt terrified the horses still more and by accelerating their speed tended to make matters worse paul was roused from a train of despondent reflections by seeing the horses coming up the street he instantly comprehended the whole danger of the ladys situation most boys would have thought of nothing but getting out of the way and leaving the carriage and its inmate to their fate what indeed could a boy do against a pair of powerful horses almost beside themselves with fright but our hero as we have already had occasion to see was brave and selfpossessed and felt an instant desire to rescue the lady whose glance of helpless terror as she leaned her head from the window he could see naturally quickwitted it flashed upon him that the only way to relieve a horse from one terror was to bring another to bear upon him with scarcely a moments premeditation he rushed out into the middle of the street full in the path of the furious horses and with his cheeks pale for he knew his danger but with determined air he waved his arms aloft and cried whoa at the top of his voice the horses saw the sudden movement they saw the boy standing directly in front of them they heard the word of command to which they had been used and by a sudden impulse relieved from the blind terror which had urged them on they stopped suddenly and stood still in the middle of the street still showing in their quivering limbs the agitation through which they had passed just then the coachman panting with his hurried running came up and seized them by the head youngster said he youre a brave fellow youve done us a good service today youre a pretty cool hand you are i dont know what these foolish horses would have done with the carriage if it had not been for you let me get out exclaimed the lady not yet recovered from her fright i will open the door said paul observing that the coachman was fully occupied in soothing the horses he sprang forward and opening the door of the carriage assisted the lady to descend she breathed quickly i have been very much frightened she said and i believe i have been in very great danger are you the brave boy who stopped the horses paul modestly answered in the affirmative and how did you do it i was so terrified that i was hardly conscious of what was passing till the horses stopped paul modestly related his agency in the matter the lady gazed at his flushed face admiringly how could you have so much courage she asked you might have been trampled to death under the hoofs of the horses i didnt think of that i only thought of stopping the horses you are a brave boy i shudder when i think of your danger and mine i shall not dare to get into the carriage again this afternoon allow me to accompany you home said paul politely thank you i will trouble you to go with me as far as broadway and then i can get into an omnibus she turned and addressed some words to the coachman directing him to drive home as soon as the horses were quieted adding that she would trust herself to the escort of the young hero who had rescued her from the late peril youre a lucky boy thought john the coachman my mistress is one that never does anything by halves it wont be for nothing that you have rescued her this afternoon as they walked along the lady by delicate questioning succeeded in drawing from our hero his hopes and wishes for the future paul who was of a frank and open nature found it very natural to tell her all he felt and wished he seems a remarkably fine boy thought the lady to herself i should like to do something for him they emerged into broadway i will detain you a little longer said the lady and perhaps trouble you with a parcel i shall be very glad to take it said paul politely appletons bookstore was close at hand into this the lady went followed by her young companion a clerk advanced and inquired her wishes will you show me some writingdesks i am going to purchase a writingdesk for a young friend of mine she explained to paul as he is a boy like yourself perhaps you can guide me in the selection certainly said paul unsuspiciously several desks were shown paul expressed himself admiringly of one made of rosewood inlaid with pearl i think i will take it said the lady the price was paid and the desk was wrapped up now said mrs danforth for this proved to be her name i will trouble you paul to take the desk for me and accompany me in the omnibus that is if you have no other occupation for your time i am quite at leisure said paul i shall be most happy to do so paul left the lady at the door of her residence in fifth avenue and promised to call on his new friend the next day he went home feeling that though he had met with no success in obtaining a place he had been very fortunate in rendering so important a service to a lady whose friendship might be of essential service to him xxiv paul calls on mrs danforth mrs edward danforth repeated the sexton on hearing the story of pauls exploit why she attends our church do you know mr danforth asked paul with interest only by sight i know him by reputation however i suppose he is very rich yes i should judge so at any rate he is doing an extensive business what is his business he is a merchant a merchant thought paul that is just what i should like to be but i dont see much prospect of it how do you like mrs danforth inquired the sexton very much said paul warmly she was very kind and made me feel quite at home in her company i hope she may be disposed to assist you she can easily do so in her position the next day paul did not as usual go out in search of a situation his mind was occupied with thoughts of his coming interview with mrs danforth and he thought he would defer his business plans till the succeeding day at an early hour in the evening he paused before an imposing residence on fifth avenue which he had seen but not entered the day previous he mounted the steps and pulled the bell a smartlooking manservant answered his ring is mrs danforth at home asked paul yes i believe so i have called to see her does she expect you asked the servant looking surprised yes i come at her appointment said paul then i suppose its all right said the man will you come in he asked a little doubtfully paul followed him into the house and was shown into the drawingroom the magnificence of which somewhat dazzled his eyes accustomed only to the plain sittingroom of mr cameron the servant reappeared after a brief absence and with rather more politeness than he had before shown invited paul to follow him to a private sittingroom upstairs where he would see mrs danforth looking at pauls plain though neat clothes the servant was a little puzzled to understand what had obtained for paul the honor of being on visiting terms with mrs danforth good evening paul said mrs danforth rising from her seat and welcoming our hero with extended hand so you did not forget your appointment there was no fear of that said paul with his usual frankness i have been looking forward to coming all day have you indeed said the lady with a pleasant smile then i must endeavor to make your visit agreeable to you do you recognize this desk upon a table close by was the desk which had been purchased the day previous at appletons yes said paul it is the one you bought yesterday i think it is very handsome i am glad you think so i think i told you that i intended it for a present i have had the new owners name engraved upon it paul read the name upon the plate provided for the purpose his face flushed with surprise and pleasure that name was his own do you really mean it for me he asked if you will accept it said mrs danforth smiling i shall value it very much said paul gratefully and i feel very much indebted to your kindness we wont talk of indebtedness for you remember mine is much the greater if you will open the desk you will find that it is furnished with what will i hope prove of use to you the desk being opened proved to contain a liberal supply of stationery sealing wax postage stamps and pens paul was delighted with his new present and mrs danforth seemed to enjoy the evident gratification with which it inspired him now said she tell me a little about yourself have you always lived in new york only about three years said paul and where did you live before at wrenville in connecticut i have heard of the place a small country town is it not paul answered in the affirmative how did you happen to leave wrenville and come to new york paul blushed and hesitated a moment i ran away he said at length determined to keep nothing back ran away not from home i hope i had no home said paul soberly i should never have left there if my father had not died then i was thrown upon the world i was sent to the poorhouse i did not want to go for i thought i could support myself that is a very honorable feeling i suppose you did not fare very well at the poorhouse in reply paul detailed some of the grievances to which he had been subjected mrs danforth listened with sympathizing attention you were entirely justified in running away she said as he concluded i can hardly imagine so great a lack of humanity as these people showed you are now i hope pleasantly situated yes said paul mr and mrs cameron treat me with as great kindness as if i were their own child cameron is not that the name of the sexton of our church said mrs danforth meditatively it is with him that i have a pleasant home indeed i am glad to hear it you have been attending school i suppose yes it is not more than two months since i left off school and now i suppose you are thinking of entering upon some business yes i have been trying to obtain a place in some merchants countingroom you think then that you would like the career of a merchant there is nothing that would suit me better you have not succeeded in obtaining a place yet i suppose no they are very difficult to get and i have no influential friends to assist me i have heard mr danforth say that he experienced equal difficulty when he came to new york a poor boy paul looked surprised i see that you are surprised said mrs danforth smiling you think perhaps judging from what you see that my husband was always rich but he was the son of a poor farmer and was obliged to make his own way in the world by the blessing of god he has been prospered in business and become rich but he often speaks of his early discouragements and small beginnings i am sorry he is not here this evening by the way he left word for you to call at his countingroom tomorrow at eleven oclock i will give you his address she handed paul a card containing the specified number and soon after he withdrew bearing with him his handsome gift and a cordial invitation to repeat his call he looked back at the elegant mansion which he had just left and could not help feeling surprised that the owner of such a palace should have started in life with no greater advantages than himself xxv an old acquaintance paul slept late the next morning he did not hear the breakfastbell and when the sexton came up to awaken him he rubbed his eyes with such an expression of bewilderment that mr cameron could not forbear laughing you must have had queer dreams paul said he yes uncle hugh said paul laughing i believe i have when you have collected your wits which at present seem absent on a woolgathering expedition perhaps you will tell what you have been dreaming about so i will said paul and perhaps you can interpret it for me i dreamed that i was back again at mr mudges and that he sent me out into the field to dig potatoes i worked away at the first hill but found no potatoes in place of them were several gold pieces i picked them up in great surprise and instead of putting them into the basket concluded to put them in my pocket but as all the hills turned out in the same way i got my pockets full and had to put the rest in the basket i was just wondering what they would do for potatoes when all at once a great dog came up and seized me by the arm and you opened your eyes and saw me said the sexton finishing out his narrative upon my word thats very complimentary to me however some of our potatoes have escaped transformation into gold pieces but i am afraid you will find them rather cold if you dont get down to breakfast pretty quick all right uncle hugh ill be down in a jiffy about halfpast ten paul started on his way to mr danforths countingroom it was located on wall street as he learned from the card which had been given him by mrs danforth he felt a little awkward in making this call it seemed as if he were going to receive thanks for the service which he had rendered and he felt that he had already been abundantly repaid however he was bound in courtesy to call since he did so at the request of mrs danforth it was a large stone building divided up into offices to which paul had been directed mr danforths office he found after a little search upon the second floor he opened the door with a little embarrassment and looked about him in one corner was a small room used as a more private office the door of which was closed in the larger room the only one whom he saw was a boy apparently about his own age who was standing at a desk and writing this boy looked around as paul entered and he at once recognized in him an old acquaintance george dawkins he exclaimed in surprise the latter answered in a careless indifferent tone not exhibiting any very decided pleasure at meeting his old schoolmate oh its you prescott is it yes said paul i havent met you since you left our school no i believe we have not met said dawkins in the same tone as before how long have you been in this office asked our hero i really cant say said dawkins not looking up you cant say no im rather forgetful paul could not help feeling chilled at the indifferent manner in which his advances were met he had been really glad to see dawkins and had addressed him with cordiality he could not conceal from himself that dawkins did not seem inclined to respond to it still thought paul extenuatingly perhaps that is his way as the conversation began to flag paul was reminded of his errand by dawkins saying in a tone which was half a sneer have you any business with mr danforth this morning or did you merely come in out of curiosity i have called to see mr danforth said paul he is usually pretty busy in the morning said dawkins he directed me to call in the morning said paul sturdily oh indeed said dawkins a little surprised i wonder he thought what business this fellow can have with mr danforth can he be fishing for a place mr danforth is engaged with a visitor just now he at length condescended to say if your time is not too valuable to wait you can see him byandby thank you said paul rather nettled you are very polite to this dawkins made no reply but resumed his pen and for the next ten minutes seemed entirely oblivious of pauls presence our hero took up the morning paper and began as he had so often done before to look over the list of wants thinking it possible he might find some opening for himself about ten minutes later the door of the inner office opened and two gentlemen came out one was a gentleman of fifty a business friend of mr danforths the other was mr danforth himself the former remarked on seeing paul is this your son danforth no said the merchant nodding in a friendly manner to paul thats a good joke thought dawkins chuckling to himself mr danforth must be immensely flattered at having a sextons adopted son taken for his after a final word or two on business matters and arrangements for another interview the visitor departed and mr danforth now at leisure turned to paul now my lad he said kindly if you will follow me we shall have a chance to talk a little paul followed the merchant into his office the door of which was closed much to the regret of dawkins who had a tolerably large share of curiosity and was very anxious to find out what business paul could possibly have with his employer take that seat if you please said mr danforth motioning paul to an armchair and sitting down himself mrs danforth told me from how great a peril you rescued her you are a brave boy i dont know said paul modestly i didnt think of the danger if i had perhaps i should have hesitated if you had not been brave you would have thought of your own risk my wife and myself are under very great obligations to you that more than repays me for all i did said paul in a tone of mingled modesty and manliness i like the boy thought mr danforth he is certainly quite superior to the common run have you left school he inquired after a pause yes sir last term closed my school life then you have never been in a situation yes sir indeed before you left school no sir since you did not like it then no sir said paul and was that the reason of your leaving no sir my employer was not satisfied with me said paul frankly indeed i am surprised to hear this if you have no objection will you tell me the circumstances paul related in a straightforward manner the difficulty he had had with smith thompson i hope you dont think i did wrong he concluded by no means said mr danforth warmly your conduct was entirely creditable as for smith i know of him he is a sharper it would have done you no good to remain in his employ paul was pleased with this commendation he had thought it possible that his dismissal from his former situation might operate against him with the merchant what are your present plans and wishes asked mr danforth after a slight pause i should like to enter a merchants countingroom said paul but as such places are hard to get i think i shall try to get into a store mr danforth reflected a moment then placing a piece of paper before our hero he said will you write your name and address on this piece of paper that i may know where to find you in case i hear of a place paul did as directed he had an excellent handwriting a point on which the merchant set a high value the latter surveyed the address with approval and said i am glad you write so excellent a hand it will be of material assistance to you in securing a place in a countingroom indeed it has been already for i have just thought of a place which i can obtain for you can you sir said paul eagerly where is it in my own countingroom said mr danforth smiling i am very much obliged to you said paul hardly believing his ears i was prepared to give it to you when you came in in case i found you qualified the superiority of your handwriting decides me when can you come tomorrow if you like sir i like your promptness as it is the middle of the week however you may take a vacation till monday your salary will begin tomorrow thank you sir i will give you five dollars per week at first and more as your services become more valuable will that be satisfactory i shall feel rich sir mr smith only gave me a dollar and a quarter i hope you will find other differences between me and mr smith said the merchant smiling these preliminaries over mr danforth opened the door and glancing at dawkins said dawkins i wish you to become acquainted with your fellow clerk paul prescott dawkins looked surprised and anything but gratified as he responded stiffly i have the honor of being already acquainted with mr prescott he is a little jealous of an interloper thought mr danforth noticing the repellent manner of young dawkins never mind they will get acquainted after awhile when george dawkins went home to dinner his father observed the dissatisfied look he wore is anything amiss my son he inquired i should think there was grumbled his son what is it weve got a new clerk and who do you think it is who is it the adopted son of old cameron the sexton indeed said mrs dawkins i really wonder at mr danforths bad taste there are many boys of genteel family who would have been glad of the chance this boy is a low fellow of course certainly said her son though he was quite aware that this was not true what could have brought the boy to danforths notice asked dawkins senior i dont know im sure the boy has managed to get round him in some way he is very artful i really think husband that you ought to remonstrate with mr danforth about taking such a low fellow into his countingroom with our george pooh said mr dawkins who was a shade more sensible than his wife hed think me a meddler at any rate george pursued his mother theres one thing that is due to your family and bringing up not to associate with this low fellow any more than business requires i certainly shall not said george promptly he was the worthy son of such a mother xxvi a vulgar relation at the end of the first week paul received five dollars the sum which the merchant had agreed to pay him for his services with this he felt very rich he hurried home and displayed to the sexton the crisp bank note which had been given him you will soon be a rich man paul said mr cameron with a benevolent smile returning the bill but i want you to keep it uncle hugh shall i put it in the savings bank for you paul i didnt mean that you have been supporting me giving me board and clothes for three years it is only right that you should have what i earn the offer is an honorable one on your part paul said the sexton but i dont need it if it will please you i will take two dollars a week for your board now and out of the balance you may clothe yourself and save what you can this arrangement seemed to be a fair one mr cameron deposited the five dollar note in his pocketbook and passed one of three dollars to paul this sum our hero deposited the next monday morning in a savings bank he estimated that he could clothe himself comfortably for fifty dollars a year this would leave him one hundred towards the payment of the debt due to squire conant byandby my salary will be raised thought paul then i can save more he looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when he should be able to redeem his fathers name and no one would be entitled to cast reproach upon his memory he endeavored to perform his duties faithfully in the office and to learn as rapidly as he could the business upon which he had entered he soon found that he must depend mainly upon himself george dawkins seemed disposed to afford him no assistance but repelled scornfully the advances which paul made towards cordiality he was by no means as faithful as paul but whenever mr danforth was absent from the office spent his time in lounging at the window or reading a cheap novel with one of which he was usually provided when paul became satisfied that dawkins was not inclined to accept his overtures he ceased to court his acquaintance and confined himself to his own desk one day as he was returning from dinner he was startled by an unceremonious slap upon the shoulder looking up in some surprise he found that this greeting had come from a man just behind him whose goodhumored face and small twinkling eyes he at once recognized how do you do mr stubbs inquired paul his face lighting up with pleasure im sos to be round how be you returned the worthy pedler seizing our heros hand and shaking it heartily mr stubbs was attired in all the glory of a blue coat with brass buttons and swallow tails when did you come to new york asked paul just arrived that is i got in this mornin but i say how youve grown i shouldnt hardly have known you shouldnt you though said paul gratified as most boys are on being told that he had grown have you come to the city on business well kinder on business and kinder not i thought id like to have a vacation besides the old lady wanted a silk dress and she was sot on havin it bought in york so i come to the city where are you stopping mr stubbs over to the astor house pretty big hotel aint it yes i see you are traveling in style yes i suppose they charge considerable but i guess i can stand it i haint been drivin a tincart for nothin the last ten years how have you been enjoying yourself since you arrived oh pretty well ive been round seeing the lions and came pretty near seeing the elephant at one of them peter funk places you did tell me about it you see i was walkin along when a fellow came out of one of them places and asked me if i wouldnt go in i didnt want to refuse such a polite invitation and besides i had a curiosity to see what there was to be seen so i went in they put up a silver watch i could see that it was a good one and so i bid on it it ran up to eight dollars and a quarter i thought it was a pity it should go off so cheap so i bid eight and a half eight and a half and sold said the man shall i put it up for you no i thank you said i ill take it as it is but ill put it up in a nice box for you said he i told him i didnt care for the box he seemed very unwilling to let it go but i took it out of his hand and he couldnt help himself well when they made out the bill what do you suppose they charged i dont know why eighteen and a half look here said i i guess heres something of a mistake youve got ten dollars too much i think you must be mistaken said he smiling a foxy smile you know i am not said i rather cross we cant let that watch go for any thing shorter said he coolly just then a man that was present stepped up and said the man is right dont attempt to impose upon him with that he calmed right down it seems it was a policeman who was sent to watch them that spoke so i paid the money but as i went out i heard the auctioneer say that the sale was closed for the day i afterwards learned that if i had allowed them to put the watch in a box they would have exchanged it for another that was only plated do you know anybody in the city asked paul ive got some relations but i dont know where they live what is the name asked paul we can look into the directory the name is dawkins answered the pedler dawkins repeated paul in surprise yes do you happen to know anybody of the name yes but i believe it is a rich family well so are my relations said jehoshaphat you didnt think jehoshaphat stubbs had any rich relations did you these as ive heard tell hold their heads as high as anybody perhaps i may be mistaken said paul what is the name the christian name i mean of your relation george it must be he then there is a boy of about my own age of that name he works in the same office you dont say so well that is curious i declare to think that i should have happened to hit upon you so by accident too how are you related to them inquired paul why you see im own cousin to mr dawkins his father and my mother were brother and sister what was his fathers business asked paul i dont know what his regular business was but he was a sexton in some church this tallied with the account paul had received from mr cameron and he could no longer doubt that strange as it seemed the wealthy mr dawkins was own cousin to the pedler didnt you say the boy was in the same office with you paul yes well ive a great mind to go and see him and find out where his father lives perhaps i may get an invite to his house how shocked dawkins will be thought paul not it must be confessed without a feeling of amusement he felt no compunction in being the instrument of mortifying the false pride of his fellow clerk and he accordingly signified to mr stubbs that he was on his way to the countingroom are you though well i guess ill go along with you is it far off only in the next street the pedler it must be acknowledged had a thoroughly countrified appearance he was a genuine specimen of the yankee a long gaunt figure somewhat stooping and with a long aquiline nose his dress has already been described as dawkins beheld him entering with paul he turned up his nose in disgust at what he considered pauls friend what was his consternation when the visitor approaching him with a benignant smile extended his brown hand and said how dye do george how are ye all to hum dawkins drew back haughtily what do you mean he said pale with passion mr dawkins said paul with suppressed merriment allow me to introduce your cousin mr stubbs jehoshaphat stubbs explained that individual didnt your father never mention my name to you sir said dawkins darting a furious glance at paul you are entirely mistaken if you suppose that any relationship exists between me and that person no its you that are mistaken said mr stubbs persevering my mother was roxana jane dawkins she was own sister to your grandfather that makes me and your father cousins dont you see i see that you are intending to insult me said dawkins the more furiously because he began to fear there might be some truth in the mans claims mr prescott i leave you to entertain your company yourself and he threw on his hat and dashed out of the countingroom well said the pedler drawing a long breath thats cool denyin his own flesh and blood rather stuck up aint he he is somewhat said paul if i were you i shouldnt be disposed to own him as a relation darned ef i will said jehoshaphat sturdily i have some pride ef i am a pedler guess im as good as he any day xxvii mr mudges fright squire newcome sat in a highbacked chair before the fire with his heels on the fender he was engaged in solemnly perusing the leading editorial in the evening paper when all at once the table at his side gave a sudden lurch the lamp slid into his lap setting the paper on fire and before the squire realized his situation the flames singed his whiskers and made his face unpleasantly warm creation he exclaimed jumping briskly to his feet the lamp had gone out so that the cause of the accident remained involved in mystery the squire had little trouble in conjecturing however that ben was at the bottom of it opening the door hastily he saw by the light in the next room that young gentleman rising from his knees in the immediate vicinity of the table benjamin said the squire sternly what have you been adoing ben looked sheepish but said nothing i repeat benjamin what have you been adoing i didnt mean to said ben that does not answer my interrogatory what have you been adoing i was chasing the cat said ben and she got under the table i went after her and somehow it upset guess my head might have knocked against the legs how old are you benjamin fifteen a boy of fifteen is too old to play with cats you may retire to your dormitory its only seven oclock father said ben in dismay boys that play with cats are young enough to retire at seven remarked the squire sagaciously there was nothing for ben but to obey accordingly with reluctant steps he went up to his chamber and went to bed his active mind together with the early hour prevented his sleeping instead his fertile imagination was employed in devising some new scheme in which of course fun was to be the object attained while he was thinking one scheme flashed upon him which he at once pronounced bully i wish i could do it tonight he sighed why cant i he thought after a moments reflection the more he thought of it the more feasible it seemed and at length he decided to attempt it rising from his bed he quickly dressed himself and then carefully took the sheet and folding it up in small compass put it under his arm next opening the window he stepped out upon the sloping roof of the ell part and slid down to the end where he jumped off the height not being more than four feet from the ground by some accident a tub of suds was standing under the eaves and ben much to his disgust jumped into it whew exclaimed he ive jumped into that plaguy tub what possessed hannah to put it in a fellows way at this moment the back door opened and hannah called out in a shrill voice whos there ben hastily hid himself and thought it best not to answer i guess twas the cat said hannah as she closed the door a twolegged cat thought ben to himself thunder what sopping wet feet ive got well it cant be helped with the sheet still under his arm ben climbed a fence and running across the fields reached the fork of the road here he concealed himself under a hedge and waited silently till the opportunity for playing his practical joke arrived i regret to say that mr mudge with whom we have already had considerable to do was not a member of the temperance society latterly influenced perhaps by mrs mudges tongue which made his home far from a happy one he had got into the habit of spending his evenings at the tavern in the village where he occasionally indulged in potations that were not good for him generally he kept within the bounds of moderation but occasionally he exceeded these as he had done on the present occasion some fifteen minutes after ben had taken his station he saw in the moonlight mr mudge coming up the road on his way home judging from his zigzag course he was not quite himself ben waited till mr mudge was close at hand when all at once he started from his place of concealment completely enveloped in the sheet with which he was provided he stood motionless before the astounded mudge who are you exclaimed mudge his knees knocking together in terror clinging to an overhanging branch for support there was no answer who are you he again asked in affright sally baker returned ben in as sepulchral a voice as he could command sally baker was an old pauper who had recently died the name occurred to ben on the spur of the moment it was with some difficulty that he succeeded in getting out the name such was his amusement at mr mudges evident terror what do you want of me inquired mudge nervously you half starved me when i was alive returned ben in a hollow voice i must be revenged so saying he took one step forward spreading out his arms this was too much for mr mudge with a cry he started and ran towards home at the top of his speed with ben in pursuit i believe i shall die of laughing exclaimed ben pausing out of breath and sitting down on a stone what a donkey he is to be sure to think there are such things as ghosts id like to be by when he tells mrs mudge after a moments thought ben wrapped up the sheet took it under his arm and once more ran in pursuit of mr mudge meanwhile mrs mudge was sitting in the kitchen of the poorhouse mending stockings she was not in the pleasantest humor for one of the paupers had managed to break a plate at teatable if that can be called tea where no tea is provided and trifles were sufficient to ruffle mrs mudges temper wheres mudge i wonder she said sharply over to the tavern i spose as usual there never was such a shiftless goodfornothing man id better have stayed unmarried all the days of my life than have married him if he dont get in by ten ill lock the door and it shall stay locked twill serve him right to stay out doors all night minutes slipped away and the decisive hour approached ill go to the door and look out thought mrs mudge if he aint anywhere in sight ill fasten the door she laid down her work and went to the door she had not quite reached it when it was flung open violently and mr mudge with a wild disordered look rushed in nearly overturning his wife who gazed at him with mingled anger and astonishment what do you mean by this foolery mudge she demanded sternly what do i mean repeated her husband vaguely i neednt ask you said his wife contemptuously i see how it is well enough youre drunk drunk yes drunk as drunk as a beast well mrs mudge hiccoughed her husband in what he endeavored to make a dignified tone youd be drunk too if youd seen what ive seen and what have you seen i should like to know said mrs mudge mudge rose with some difficulty steadied himself on his feet and approaching his wife whispered in a tragic tone mrs mudge ive seen a sperrit its plain enough that youve seen spirit retorted his wife tisnt many nights that you dont for that matter you ought to be ashamed of yourself mudge it isnt that said her husband shaking his hand its a sperrit a ghost that ive seen indeed said mrs mudge sarcastically perhaps you can tell whose it is it was the sperrit of sally baker said mudge solemnly what did she say demanded mrs mudge a little curiously she said that i that we half starved her and then she started to run after me and oh lordy there she is now mudge jumped trembling to his feet following the direction of his outstretched finger mrs mudge caught a glimpse of a white figure just before the window i need hardly say that it was ben who had just arrived upon the scene mrs mudge was at first stupefied by what she saw but being a woman of courage she speedily recovered herself and seizing the broom from behind the door darted out in search of the spirit but ben perceiving that he was discovered had disappeared and there was nothing to be seen didnt i tell you so muttered mudge as his wife reentered baffled in her attempt youll believe its a sperrit now go to bed you fool retorted his wife this was all that passed between mr and mrs mudge on the subject mr mudge firmly believes to this day that the figure which appeared to him was the spirit of sally baker xxviii how ben got home delighted with the complete success of his practical joke ben took his way homeward with the sheet under his arm by the time he reached his fathers house it was ten oclock the question for ben to consider now was how to get in if his father had not fastened the front door he might steal in and slip up stairs on tiptoe without being heard this would be the easiest way of overcoming the difficulty and ben perceiving that the light was still burning in the sittingroom had some hopes that he would be able to adopt it but while he was only a couple of rods distant he saw the lamp taken up by his father who appeared to be moving from the room hes going to lock the front door thought ben in disappointment if i had only got along five minutes sooner from his post outside he heard the key turn in the lock the squire little dreamed that the son whom he imagined fast asleep in his room was just outside the door he was locking i guess ill go round to the back part of the house thought ben perhaps i can get in the same way i came out accordingly he went round and managed to clamber upon the roof which was only four feet from the ground but a brief trial served to convince our young adventurer that it is a good deal easier sliding down a roof than it is climbing up the shingles being old were slippery and though the ascent was not steep ben found the progress he made was very much like that of a man at the bottom of a well who is reported as falling back two feet for every three that he ascended what increased the difficulty of his attempt was that the soles of his shoes were well worn and slippery as well as the shingles i never can get up this way ben concluded after several fruitless attempts i know what ill do he decided after a moments perplexity ill pull off my shoes and stockings and then i guess i can get along better ben accordingly got down from the roof and pulled off his shoes and stockings as he wanted to carry these with him he was at first a little puzzled by this new difficulty he finally tied the shoes together by the strings and hung them round his neck he disposed of the stockings by stuffing one in each pocket now thought ben i guess i can get along better i dont know what to do with the plaguy sheet though but necessity is the mother of invention and ben found that he could throw the sheet over his shoulders as a lady does with her shawl thus accoutered he recommenced the ascent with considerable confidence he found that his bare feet clung to the roof more tenaciously than the shoes had done and success was already within his grasp when an unforeseen mishap frustrated his plans he had accomplished about three quarters of the ascent when all at once the string which united the shoes which he had hung round his neck gave way and both fell with a great thump on the roof ben made a clutch for them in which he lost his own hold and made a hurried descent in their company alighting with his bare feet on some flinty gravel stones which he found by no means agreeable ow ejaculated ben limping painfully them plaguy gravel stones hurt like thunder ill move em away the first thing tomorrow if that confounded shoestring hadnt broken id have been in bed by this time meanwhile hannah had been sitting over the kitchen fire enjoying a social chat with a cousin of hers from ireland a young man whom she had never seen or heard of three months before in what way he had succeeded in convincing her of the relationship i have never been able to learn but he had managed to place himself on familiar visiting terms with the inmate of squire newcomes kitchen its only me cousin sir hannah explained to the squire when he had questioned her on the subject hes just from ireland sir and it seems like home to see him on the present occasion tim flaherty had outstayed his usual time and was still in the kitchen when ben reached home they did not at first hear him but when he made his last abortive attempt and the shoes came clattering down they could not help hearing whats that asked hannah listening attentively she went to the door to look out her cousin following there was nothing to be seen perhaps you was dramin hannah said tim more by token its time we was both doin that same so ill bid you goodnight come again soon tim said hannah preparing to close the door a new plan of entrance flashed upon ben he quickly put on his shoes and stockings unfolded the sheet and prepared to enact the part of a ghost once more this time for the special benefit of hannah after fully attiring himself he came to the back door which hannah had already locked and tapped three times hannah was engaged in raking out the kitchen fire sure its tim come back thought she as she went to the door perhaps hes forgotten something she opened the door unsuspiciously fully expecting to see her irish cousin standing before her what was her terror on beholding a whiterobed figure with extended arms howly virgin defend me she exclaimed in paralyzing terror which was increased by a guttural sound which proceeded from the throat of the ghost who at the same time waved his arms aloft and made a step towards hannah hannah with a wild howl dropped the lamp and fed towards the sittingroom where squire newcome was still sitting ben sped upstairs at the top of his speed dashed into his own chamber spread the sheet on the bed and undressed so rapidly that he seemed only to shake his clothes off and jumped into bed he closed his eyes and appeared to be in a profound slumber hannahs sudden appearance in the sittingroom in such a state naturally astonished the squire whats the matter he demanded of the affrighted servant oh sir she gasped im almost kilt entirely are you said the squire you appear to be more frightened than hurt yes sir shure i am frightened which indeed i couldnt help it sir for i never saw a ghost before in all my life a ghost what nonsense are you talking hannah shure its not nonsense for its just now that the ghost came to the door sir and knocked and i went to the door thinking it might be me cousin whos been passing the evening with me when i saw a great white ghost ten foot tall standing forninst me ten feet tall yes sir and he spread out his arms and spoke in a terrible voice and was going to carry me off wid him but i dropped the lamp and o sir im kilt entirely this is a strange story said squire newcome rather suspiciously i hope you have not been drinking hannah protested vehemently that not a drop of liquor had passed her lips which was true ill go out and hunt for the ghost said the squire oh dont sir hell carry you off said hannah terrified nonsense exclaimed the squire follow me or you may stay here if you are frightened this hannah would by no means do since the squire had taken the lamp and she would be left in the dark accordingly she followed him with a trembling step as he penetrated through the kitchen into the back room ready to run at the least alarm the backdoor was wide open but nothing was to be seen of the ghost perhaps the ghosts upstairs said hannah i cant sleep up there this night shure but something had attracted squire newcomes attention it was quite muddy out of doors and ben had tracked in considerable mud with him the footprints were very perceptible on the painted floor the ghost seems to have had muddy shoes said the squire dryly i guess i can find him he followed the tracks which witnessed so strongly against ben to whose chamber they led ben though still awake appeared to be in a profound slumber benjamin said his father stooping over the bed there was no answer benjamin repeated his father giving him a shake what does all this mean what inquired ben opening his eyes and looking very innocent where have you been tonight you sent me to bed said ben and i came but the squire was not to be deceived he was already in possession of too much information to be put off so ben who with all his love of mischief was a boy of truth finally owned up everything his father said very little but told him the next morning that he had made up his mind to send him to a military boardingschool where the discipline was very strict ben hardly knew whether to be glad or sorry but finally as boys like change and variety came to look upon his new prospects with considerable cheerfulness xxix dawkins in difficulties george dawkins was standing at his desk one morning when a man entered the office and stepping up to him unceremoniously tapped him on the shoulder dawkins turned he looked extremely annoyed on perceiving his visitor whose outward appearance was certainly far from prepossessing his face exhibited unmistakable marks of dissipation nor did the huge breast pin and other cheap finery which he wore conceal the fact of his intense vulgarity his eyes were black and twinkling his complexion very dark and his air that of a foreigner he was in fact a frenchman though his language would hardly have betrayed him unless as sometimes he chose to interlard his discourse with french phrases how are you this morning my friend said the newcomer what are you here for asked dawkins roughly that does not seem to me a very polite way of receiving your friends friends retorted dawkins scornfully who authorized you to call yourself my friend creditor then if it will suit you better mon ami hush said dawkins in an alarmed whisper he will hear here he indicated paul with his finger and why should i care i have no secrets from the young man stop duval exclaimed dawkins in an angry whisper leave the office at once your appearing here will injure me but i am not your friend why should i care sneered duval listen to reason leave me now and i will meet you when and where you will come that sounds better now go im afraid mr danforth will be in if he comes introduce me dawkins would like to have knocked the fellow over name your place and time and be quick about it said he impatiently eight oclock this evening you know where was the answer very well goodmorning mind you bring some money goodmorning returned dawkins angrily at length much to his relief duval left the office dawkins stole a side glance at paul to see what impression the interview had made upon him but our hero who had overheard some portions of the dialogue perceiving that dawkins wished it to be private took as little notice of the visitor as possible he could not help thinking however that duval was a man whose acquaintance was likely to be of little benefit to his fellow clerk throughout the day dawkins appeared unusually nervous and made several blunders which annoyed mr danforth evidently he had something on his mind not to keep the reader in suspense george had fallen among bad companions where he had learned both to drink and to gamble in this way he had made the acquaintance of duval an unscrupulous sharper who had contrived to get away all his ready money and persuading him to play longer in the hope of making up his losses had run him into debt one hundred and fifty dollars dawkins gave him an acknowledgment of indebtedness to that amount this of course placed him in duvals power since he knew of no means of raising such a sum he therefore kept out of the frenchmans way avoiding the old haunts where he would have been likely to meet him dawkins supposed duval ignorant of the whereabouts of his employers countingroom so he had been but he made it his business to ascertain where it was he had no idea of losing sight of so valuable a prize dawkins would willingly have broken the appointment he had made with duval but he did not dare to do so he knew that the man was well able to annoy him and he would not on any account have had the affair disclosed to his father or mr danforth as trinity clock struck eight he entered a low barroom in the neighborhood of the docks a young man with pale sandy hair stood behind the counter with his sleeves rolled up he was supplying the wants of a sailor who already appeared to have taken more drink than was good for him good evening mr dawkins said he youre a stranger is duval in inquired dawkins coldly his pride revolted at the place and company he had never been here but once before having met duval elsewhere hes up in his room john show the young gentleman up to no wont you have a glass of something this evening no said dawkins abruptly the boy preceded him up a dark and dirty staircase thats the room sir he said stop a minute said dawkins he may not be in he inwardly hoped he might not but duval answered his knock by coming to the door himself delighted to see you mon ami john may leave the lamp thats all unless mr dawkins wishes to order something i want nothing said dawkins they have some capital brandy i am not in the mood for drinking tonight as you please said the frenchman disappointed be seated dawkins sat down in a wooden rockingchair minus an arm well said duval how much money have you brought me none the frenchman frowned and stroked his mustache fiercely what does all this mean are you going to put me off longer i would pay it if i could said dawkins but i havent got the money you could get it how ask your father my father would rave if he knew that i had lost money in such a way but you need not tell him if i ask for money he will be sure to ask what i want it for tell him you want clothes or a watch or a hundred things dawkins shook his head it wont do said he he wouldnt give me a hundred and fifty dollars then ask seventyfive and i will wait a month for the rest look here duval you have no rightful claim to this money youve got enough out of me just tear up the paper duval laughed scornfully aha mr dawkins he said that would be a very pretty arrangement for you but i dont see how it is going to benefit me no no i cant afford to throw away a hundred and fifty dollars so easily if i was a rich man like your father it would make a difference then you wont remit the debt said dawkins sullenly you would think me a great ninny if i did then you may collect it the best way you can what do you mean by that demanded the frenchman his face darkening i mean what i say said dawkins desperately gambling debts are not recognizable in law nothing is said about its being a gambling debt i have your note which is worth nothing since i am a minor duvals face became black with rage aha my friend said he showing his teeth this is a very nice game to cheat me out of my money but it wont do it wont do why wont it i shall say a word in your fathers ear mon ami and in the ear of your worthy employer whom you were so anxious for me not to see and perhaps that would be worse for you than to pay me my money dawkinss brief exultation passed away he saw that he was indeed in the power of an unscrupulous man who was disposed to push his advantage to the utmost he subsided into a moody silence which duval watched with satisfaction well my friend what will you do about it i dont know what i can do you will think of something you will find it best said the frenchman in a tone which veiled a threat i will try said dawkins gloomily that is well i thought you would listen to reason mon ami now we will have a pleasant chat hold i will order some brandy myself not for me said dawkins rising from his chair i must be going will you not have one little game asked duval coaxingly no no i have had enough of that goodnight then you wont stop and when shall i have the pleasure of seeing you at my little apartment once more i dont know if it is any trouble to you to come i will call at your office said duval significantly dont trouble yourself said dawkins hastily i will come here a week from today a week is a long time long or short i must have it very well mon ami a week let it be goodnight mind the stairs as you go down dawkins breathed more freely as he passed out into the open air he was beginning to realize that the way of the transgressor is hard xxx a trap is laid for paul three months before george dawkins had made his first visit to a gambling house at first he had entered only from curiosity he watched the play with an interest which gradually deepened until he was easily persuaded to try his own luck the stakes were small but fortune favored him and he came out some dollars richer than he entered it would have been fortunate for him if he had failed as it was his good fortune encouraged him to another visit this time he was less fortunate but his gains about balanced his losses so that he came out even on the next occasion he left off with empty pockets so it went on until at length he fell into the hands of duval who had no scruple in fleecing him to as great an extent as he could be induced to go george dawkinss reflections were not of the most cheerful character as leaving duval he slowly pursued his way homeward he felt that he had fallen into the power of an unscrupulous villain who would have no mercy upon him he execrated his own folly without which all the machination of duval would have been without effect the question now however was to raise the money he knew of no one to whom he could apply except his father nor did he have much hope from that quarter still he would make the effort reaching home he found his father seated in the library he looked up from the evening paper as george entered only halfpast nine he said with an air of sarcasm you spend your evenings out so systematically that your early return surprises me how is it has the theater begun to lose its charm there was no great sympathy between father and son and if either felt affection for the other it was never manifested mutual recrimination was the rule between them and george would now have made an angry answer but that he had a favor to ask and felt it politic to be conciliatory if i had supposed you cared for my society sir i would have remained at home oftener umph was the only reply elicited from his father however there was a good reason for my not going to the theater tonight indeed i had no money your explanation is quite satisfactory said his father with a slight sneer i sympathize in your disappointment there is no occasion sir said george good humoredly for him i had no great desire to go dawkins took down a book from the library and tried to read but without much success his thoughts continually recurred to his pecuniary embarrassments and the debt which he owed to duval seemed to hang like a millstone around his neck how should he approach his father on the subject in his present humor he feared he would have little chance as his father laid down the newspaper dawkins said wouldnt you like a game of checkers sir this as he well knew was a favorite game with his father i dont know but i should said mr dawkins more graciously than was his wont the checkerboard was brought and the two commenced playing three games were played all of which his father won this appeared to put him in a good humor for as the two ceased playing he drew a tendollarbill from his pocketbook and handed to his son with the remark there george i dont want you to be penniless you are a little extravagant though i think your pay from mr danforth ought to keep you in spending money yes sir i have been rather extravagant but i am going to reform i am very glad to hear it i wish sir said george a moment afterwards that you would allow me to buy my own clothes ive no sort of an objection i am sure you select them now dont you yes sir but i mean to suggest that you should make me an allowance for that purpose about as much as it costs now and give me the money to spend where i please mr dawkins looked sharply at his son the result would probably be he said that the money would be expended in other ways and i should have to pay for the clothes twice over dawkins would have indignantly disclaimed this if he had not felt that he was not altogether sincere in the request he had made no continued his father i dont like the arrangement you propose when you need clothing you can go to my tailor and order it of course not exceeding reasonable limits but said dawkins desperately i dont like bradshaws style of making clothes i would prefer trying some other tailor what fault have you to find with bradshaw is he not one of the most fashionable tailors in the city yes sir i suppose so but come sir you are growing altogether too particular all your garments set well so far as i can judge yes sir but one likes a change sometimes persisted george a little embarrassed for further objections well said mr dawkins after a pause if you are so strongly bent upon a new tailor select one and order what you need you can tell him to send in his bill to me thank you sir said his son by no means pleased at the manner in which his request had been granted he saw that it would in no manner promote the plan which he had in view since it would give him no command of the ready money it is hardly necessary to say that his alleged dissatisfaction with his fathers tailor had all been trumped up for the occasion and would never have been thought of but for the present emergency what shall i do thought dawkins in perplexity as he slowly undressed himself and retired to bed the only true course undoubtedly was to confess all to his father to incur the storm of reproaches which would have followed as the just penalty of his transgression and then the haunting fear of discovery would have been once and forever removed but dawkins was not brave enough for this he thought only of escaping from his present difficulty without his fathers knowledge he rose the next morning with the burden of care still weighing upon him in the evening the thought occurred to him that he might retrieve his losses where he had incurred them and again he bent his steps to the gambling house he risked five dollars being onehalf of what he had this was lost desperately he hazarded the remaining five dollars and lost again with a muttered oath he sprang to his feet and left the brilliant room more gloomy and discouraged than ever he was as badly off as before and penniless beside he would have finished the evening at the theater but his recent loss prevented that he lounged about the streets till it was time to go to bed and then went home in a very unsatisfactory state of mind a day or two after he met on broadway the man whom of all others he would gladly have avoided aha my friend i am glad to meet you said duval for it was he dawkins muttered something unintelligible and would have hurried on but duval detained him why are you in such a hurry my friend he said business returned dawkins shortly that reminds me of the little business affair between us mon ami have you got any money for me not yet not yet it is three days since we saw each other could you not do something in three days i told you i required a week said dawkins roughly let go my arm i tell you i am in haste very well mon ami said duval slowly relinquishing his hold take care that you do not forget there are four days more to the week dawkins hurried on feeling very uncomfortable he was quite aware that four days hence he would be as unprepared to encounter the frenchman as now still something might happen something unfortunately did happen the next day mr danforth was counting a roll of bills which had been just paid in when he was unexpectedly called out of the countingroom he unguardedly left the bills upon his own desk dawkins saw them lying there the thought flashed upon him there lies what will relieve me from all my embarrassment allowing himself scarcely a minute to think he took from the roll four fifty dollar notes thrust one into the pocket of pauls overcoat which hung up in the office drew off his right boot and slipped the other three into the bottom of it and put it on again he then nervously resumed his place at his desk a moment afterwards paul who had been to the postoffice entered with letters which he carried into the inner office and deposited on mr danforths desk he observed the roll of bills and thought his employer careless in leaving so much money exposed but said nothing on the subject to dawkins between whom and himself there was little communication xxxi convicted of theft half an hour later mr danforth returned has any one been here he asked as he passed through the outer office no sir said dawkins with outward composure though his heart was beating rapidly while apparently intent upon his writing he listened attentively to what might be going on in the next room one two three minutes passed mr danforth again showed himself did you say that no one has been here he demanded abruptly no sir have either of you been into my office since i have been out i have not sir said dawkins i went in to carry your letters said paul did you see a roll of bills lying on my desk yes sir said paul a little surprised at the question i have just counted it over and find but six hundred dollars instead of eight hundred can you account for the discrepancy mr danforth looked keenly at the two boys dawkins who had schooled himself to the ordeal maintained his outward calmness paul beginning to perceive that his honesty was called in question flushed no sir said the boys simultaneously it can hardly be possible that mr thompson who is a very careful man should have made such a mistake in paying me resumed mr danforth as we have been the only persons here said dawkins the only way to vindicate ourselves from suspicion is to submit to a search yes sir said paul promptly both boys turned their pockets inside out but the missing money was not found there is my overcoat sir said dawkins will you be kind enough to search it for yourself next of course pauls overcoat was searched what was our heros dismay when from one of the pockets mr danforth produced a fifty dollar bill is it possible he exclaimed in as much grief as surprise unhappy boy how came you by this money in your pocket i dont know sir returned paul his cheek alternately flushing and growing pale i wish i could believe you said mr danforth where have you put the other bills produce them and i may overlook this first offense indeed sir said paul in great distress i have not the slightest knowledge of how this bill came into my pocket i hope you will believe me sir how can i the money evidently did not go into your pocket without hands a sudden thought came to paul dawkins said he did you put that money into my pocket what do you mean sir returned dawkins haughtily is it your intention to insult me dawkins could not prevent his face from flushing as he spoke but this might easily be referred to a natural resentment of the imputation cast upon him paul said his employer coldly you will not help your own cause by seeking to involve another after what has happened you can hardly expect me to retain you in my employment i will not make public your disgrace nor will i inquire farther for the remainder of the money for which you have been willing to barter your integrity i will pay your wages up to the end of this week and mr danforth said paul manfully though the tears almost choked his utterance i am sorry that you have no better opinion of me i do not want the balance of my wages if i have taken so large a sum which did not belong to me i have no claim to them goodmorning sir sometime i hope you will think better of me paul put on his coat and taking his cap from the nail on which it hung bowed respectfully to his employer and left the office mr danforth looked after him and seemed perplexed could paul be guilty after all i never could have suspected him if i had not this evidence in my hand said mr danforth to himself fixing his eyes upon the bill which he had drawn from pauls overcoat dawkins did you observe whether paul remained long in the office he asked longer than sufficient to lay the letters on the desk yes sir i think he did did you notice whether he went to his overcoat after coming out yes sir he did said dawkins anxious to fix in mr danforths mind the impression of pauls guilt then i am afraid it is true said his employer sadly and yet what a fine manly boy he is too but it is a terrible fault mr danforth was essentially a kindhearted man and he cared much more for pauls dereliction from honesty than for the loss of the money going home early to dinner he communicated to his wife the unpleasant discovery which he had made respecting paul now from the first paul had been a great favorite with mrs danforth and she scouted at the idea of his dishonesty depend upon it mr danforth she said decisively you have done the boy an injustice i have some skill in reading faces and i tell you that a boy with paul prescotts open frank expression is incapable of such a crime so i should have said my dear but we men learn to be less trustful than you ladies who stay at home and take rosecolored views of life unfortunately we see too much of the dark side of human nature so that you conclude all to be dark not so bad as that tell me all the circumstances and perhaps a womans wit may help you mr danforth communicated all the details with which the reader is already familiar what sort of a boy is this dawkins she asked do you like him not particularly he does his duties passably well i took him into my countingroom to oblige his father perhaps he is the thief to tell the truth i would sooner have suspected him has he cleared himself from suspicion he was the first to suggest a search precisely the thing he would have done if he had placed the bill in pauls pocket of course he would know that the search must result favorably for him there is something in that besides what could have been more foolish if paul wished to hide the money than to multiply his chances of detection by hiding it in two different places especially where one was so obvious as to afford no concealment at all admitting this to be true how am i to arrive at the proof of pauls innocence my own opinion is that george dawkins has the greater part of the money stolen probably he has taken it for some particular purpose what it is you may learn perhaps by watching him i will be guided by your suggestion nothing would afford me greater pleasure than to find that i have been mistaken in assuming pauls guilt though on evidence that seemed convincing this conversation took place at the dinnertable mr danforth understood that no time was to be lost if he expected to gain any information from the movements of his clerk george dawkins had ventured upon a bold act but he had been apparently favored by fortune and had succeeded that he should have committed this crime without compunction could hardly be expected his uneasiness however sprang chiefly from the fear that in some way he might yet be detected he resolved to get rid of the money which he had obtained dishonestly and obtain back from duval the acknowledgment of indebtedness which he had given him you will perhaps ask whether the wrong which he had done paul affected him with uneasiness on the contrary it gratified the dislike which from the first he had cherished towards our hero i am well rid of him at all events he muttered to himself that is worth risking some thing for when office hours were over dawkins gladly threw down his pen and left the countingroom he bent his steps rapidly towards the locality where he had before met duval he had decided to wait some time before meeting that worthy he had to wait till another day when as he was emerging from the tavern he encountered the frenchman on the threshold aha my good friend said duval offering his hand which dawkins did not appear to see i am very glad to see you will you come in no i have not time said dawkins shortly have you brought me my money yes aha that is well i was just about what you call cleaned out have you my note with you duval fumbled in his pocketbook and finally produced the desired document give it to me i must have the money first said the frenchman shrewdly take it said dawkins contemptuously do you judge me by yourself he tore the note which he received into small pieces and left duval without another word sheltered by the darkness mr danforth who had tracked the steps of dawkins had been an unseen witness of this whole transaction xxxii right triumphant george dawkins resumed his duties the next morning as usual notwithstanding the crime he had committed to screen himself from the consequences of a lighter fault he felt immeasurably relieved at the thought that he had shaken himself free from the clutches of duval his satisfaction was heightened by the disgrace and summary dismissal of paul whom he had never liked he decided to ask the place for a cousin of his own whose society would be more agreeable to him than that of his late associate goodmorning sir he said as mr danforth entered goodmorning returned his employer coldly have you selected any one in prescotts place yet sir why do you ask because i have a cousin malcolm harcourt who would be glad to take it indeed said mr danforth whose manner somewhat puzzled dawkins i should enjoy having him with me continued dawkins did you like prescott no sir said dawkins promptly i didnt want to say so before but now since hes turned out so badly i dont mind saying that i never thought much of him on the contrary said mr danforth i liked him from the first perhaps we are wrong in thinking that he took the money i should think there could be no doubt of it said dawkins not liking the sympathy and returning good feeling for paul which his employer manifested i dont agree with you said mr danforth coldly i have decided to reinstate paul in his former place then if any more money is missing you will know where it has gone said dawkins hastily i shall then there is no chance for my cousin i am expecting to have a vacancy dawkins looked up in surprise i shall require some one to fill your place said mr danforth significantly sir exclaimed dawkins in astonishment and dismay his employer bent a searching glance upon him as he asked sternly where did you obtain the money which you paid away last evening i dont understand you sir gasped dawkins who understood only too well you met a man at the door of a low tavern in street last evening to whom you paid one hundred and fifty dollars precisely the sum which i lost yesterday who has been slandering me sir asked dawkins very pale an eyewitness of the meeting who heard the conversation between you if you want more satisfactory proof here it is mr danforth took from his pocketbook the torn fragments of the note which dawkins had given to duval here is an obligation to pay a certain duval the sum of one hundred and fifty dollars it bears your signature how you could have incurred such a debt to him you best know dawkins maintained a sullen silence i suppose you wish me to leave your employment he said at length you are right hold he added as dawkins was about leaving the room a word more it is only just that you should make a restitution of the sum which you have taken if you belonged to a poor family and there were extenuating circumstances i might forego my claim but your father is abundantly able to make good the loss and i shall require you to lay the matter before him without loss of time in consideration of your youth i shall not bring the matter before the public tribunals as i have a right to do dawkins turned pale at this allusion and muttering some words to the effect that he would do what he could left the countingroom this threat proved not to be without its effect the next day he came to mr danforth and brought the sum for which he had become responsible he had represented to his father that he had had his pocket picked of this sum belonging to mr danforth and in that manner obtained an equal amount to replace it it was some time before mr dawkins learned the truth then came a storm of reproaches in which all the bitterness of his fathers nature was fully exhibited there had never been much love between father and son henceforth there was open hatred we must return to paul whom we left in much trouble it was a sad walk which he took homeward on the morning of his dismissal what brings you home so early asked mrs cameron looking up from her baking as paul entered paul tried to explain but tears came to his eyes and sobs choked his utterance are you sick paul exclaimed mrs cameron in alarm no aunt hester then what is the matter she asked anxiously i have lost my place poor boy i am very sorry to hear it but it might have been worse no not very well aunt hester for mr danforth thinks i have taken some of his money he is very unjust exclaimed aunt hester indignantly he ought to have known better than to think you would steal why no said paul candidly i must confess the evidence was against me and he doesnt know me as well as you do aunt hester tell me all about it paul aunt hester sat down and listened attentively to our heros story how do you account for the money being found in your pocket she asked at length i think it must have been put there by some one else have you any suspicions yes said paul a little reluctantly but i dont know whether i ought to have i may be wronging an innocent person at any rate it wont do any harm to tell me youve heard me speak of george dawkins yes i cant help thinking that he put the fifty dollars into my pocket and took the rest himself how very wicked he must be exclaimed mrs cameron indignantly dont judge him too hastily aunt hester he may not be guilty and i know from my own experience how hard it is to be accused when you are innocent soon after the sexton came in and paul of course told his story over again never mind paul said uncle hugh cheerily you know your own innocence that is the main thing its a great thing to have a clear conscience but i liked mr danforth and i think he liked me its hard to feel that he and mrs danforth will both think me guilty especially after the kindness which i have experienced from them we all have our crosses my boy some light and others heavy yours i admit is a heavy one for a boy to bear but when men are unjust there is one above who will deal justly with us you have not forgotten him no uncle hugh said paul reverently trust in him paul and all will come out right at last he can prove your innocence and you may be sure he will in his own good time only be patient paul i will try to be uncle hugh the simple hearty trust in god which the sexton manifested was not lost upon paul sustained by his own consciousness of innocence and the confidence reposed in him by those who knew him best his mind soon regained its cheerful tone he felt an inward conviction that god would vindicate his innocence his vindication came sooner than he anticipated the next day as the sextons family were seated at their plain dinner a knock was heard upon the outer door sit still hester said mr cameron i will go to the door opening the door he recognized mr danforth who attended the same church mr cameron i believe said mr danforth pleasantly yes sir may i come in i am here on a little business certainly mr danforth excuse my not inviting you before but in my surprise at seeing you i forgot my politeness the sexton led the way into the plain sittingroom i believe paul prescott is an inmate of your family yes sir i am sorry i know what you would say sir but it is needless may i see paul a moment paul was surprised at the summons and still more surprised at finding who it was that wished to see him he entered the room slowly uncertain how to accost mr danforth his employer solved the doubt in his mind by advancing cordially and taking his hand paul he said pleasantly i have come here to ask your forgiveness for an injustice and to beg you to resume your place in my countingroom have you found out who took the money sir asked paul eagerly yes who was it sir it was dawkins mr danforth explained how he had become acquainted with the real thief in conclusion he said i shall expect you back tomorrow morning paul thank you sir dawkins of course leaves my employ you will take his place and receive his salary seven dollars a week instead of five have you any friend whom you would like to have in your own place paul reflected a moment and finally named a schoolmate of his the son of poor parents whom he knew to be anxiously seeking a situation but without influential friends to help him i will take him on your recommendation said mr danforth promptly can you see him this afternoon yes sir said paul the next day paul resumed his place in mr danforths countingroom xxxiii paul redeems his pledge two years passed unmarked by any incident of importance paul continued in mr danforths employment giving if possible increased satisfaction he was not only faithful but exhibited a rare aptitude for business which made his services of great value to his employer from time to time mr danforth increased his salary so that though only nineteen he was now receiving twelve dollars per week with the prospect of a speedy increase but with his increasing salary he did not increase his expenses he continued as economical as ever he had not forgotten his fathers dying injunction he remained true to the charge which he had taken upon himself that of redeeming his fathers memory from reproach this at times subjected him to the imputation of meanness but for this he cared little he would not swerve from the line of duty which he had marked out one evening as he was walking down broadway with an acquaintance edward hastings who was employed in a countingroom near him they paused before a transparency in front of a hall brilliantly lighted the hutchinsons are going to sing tonight paul said hastings did you ever hear them no but i have often wished to then suppose we go in no i believe not why not paul it seems to me you never go anywhere you ought to amuse yourself now and then some other time i will not now you are not required to be at home in the evening are you no then why not come in now its only twentyfive cents to tell the truth ned i am saving up my money for a particular purpose and until that is accomplished i avoid all unnecessary expense going to invest in a house in fifth avenue when you do ill call however never mind the expense ill pay you in im much obliged to you ned but i cant accept why not because at present i cant afford to return the favor never mind that but i do mind it byandby i shall feel more free goodnight if you are going in goodnight paul hes a strange fellow mused hastings its impossible to think him mean and yet it looks a great deal like it he spends nothing for dress or amusements i do believe that ive had three coats since hes been wearing that old brown one yet he always looks neat i wonder what hes saving up his money for meanwhile paul went home the sexton and his wife looked the same as ever paul sometimes fancied that uncle hugh stooped a little more than he used to do but his life moved on so placidly and evenly that he grew old but slowly aunt hester was the same good kind benevolent friend that she had always been no mother could have been more devoted to paul he felt that he had much to be grateful for in his chance meeting with this worthy couple it was the first of january a clear cold day a pleasant fire burned in the little stove mr cameron sat at one side reading the evening paper mrs cameron at the other knitting a stocking for paul a large comfortablelooking cat was dozing tranquilly on the hearthrug paul who had been seated at the table rose and lighted a candle where are you going paul asked aunt hester upstairs for a moment paul speedily returned bearing in his hand a small blue bankbook with his name on the cover he took out his pencil and figured a few minutes uncle hugh said he looking up when i get a hundred dollars more i shall have enough to pay fathers debt principal and interest yes principal and interest reckoning the interest for a year to come i did not suppose you had so much money paul you must have been very economical yes uncle hugh more so than i have wanted to be oftentimes but whenever i have been tempted to spend a cent unnecessarily i have always called to mind my promise made to father on his deathbed and i have denied myself you have done well paul there are few who would have had the resolution to do as you have oh yes uncle hugh said paul modestly i think there are a great many i begin to feel repaid already in a few months i shall be able to pay up the whole debt at this moment a knock was heard at the door mr cameron answered the summons does mr paul prescott live here inquired a boy yes do you want to see him here is a letter for him there is no answer the messenger departed leaving the letter in mr camerons hand somewhat surprised he returned to the sittingroom and handed it to paul paul opened it hastily and discovered inclosed a banknote for one hundred dollars it was accompanied with a note from his employer stating that it was intended as a new years gift but in the hurry of business he had forgotten to give it to him during the day pauls face lighted up with joy oh uncle hugh he exclaimed almost breathless with delight dont you see that this will enable me to pay my debt at once so it will paul i wish you joy and my fathers memory will be vindicated said paul in a tone of deep satisfaction if he could only have lived to see this day a fortnight later paul obtained permission from his employer to be absent from the office for a week it was his purpose to visit cedarville and repay squire conant the debt due him and then to go across the country to wrenville thirty miles distant to see aunt lucy lee first however he ordered a new suit of a tailor feeling a desire to appear to the best advantage on his return to the scene of his former humiliation i must not omit to say that paul was now a finelooking young fellow of nineteen with a frank manly face that won favor wherever he went in due course of time he arrived at cedarville and found his way without difficulty to the house of squire conant it was a large house rather imposing in its exterior being quite the finest residence in the village paul went up the walk and rang the bell can i see squire conant he asked of the servant who answered the bell youll find him in that room said the girl pointing to a door on the left hand of the hall as he doesnt know me perhaps you had better go before the door was opened and paul found himself in the presence of his fathers creditor squire conant was looking pale and thin he was just recovering from a severe sickness i presume you dont recognize me sir said paul did i ever see you before yes sir my name is paul prescott not the son of john prescott the same sir i believe my father died in your debt yes i lent him five hundred dollars which he never repaid he tried to do so sir he had saved up a hundred and fifty dollars towards it but sickness came upon him and he was obliged to use it squire conants temper had been subdued by the long and dangerous illness through which he had passed it had made him set a smaller value on his earthly possessions from which he might be separated at any moment when he answered paul it was in a manner which our hero did not expect never mind i can afford to lose it i have no doubt he did what he could but i have come to pay it sir said paul you exclaimed squire conant in the greatest astonishment yes sir where did you get the money i earned it sir but you are very young how could you have earned so much paul frankly told the story of his struggles how for years he had practised a pinching economy in order to redeem his fathers memory from reproach squire conant listened attentively you are a good boy he said at length shall you have anything left after paying this money no sir but i shall soon earn more still you ought to have something to begin the world with you shall pay me half the money and i will cancel the note but sir not a word i am satisfied and that is enough if i hadnt lent your father the money i might have invested it with the rest and lost all squire conant produced the note from a little trunk of papers and handed it to paul who paid him the amount which he had stipulated expressing at the same time his gratitude for his unexpected generosity never mind about thanks my boy said squire conant i am afraid i have loved money too well heretofore i hope i am not too old to turn over a new leaf xxxiv how paul goes back to wrenville while squire conant was speaking paul formed a sudden resolution he remembered that aunt lucy lee was a sister of squire conant perhaps in his present frame of mind it might be possible to induce him to do something for her i believe i am acquainted with a sister of yours squire conant he commenced ha exclaimed the squire mrs lucy lee yes was the slow reply she is my sister where did you meet her at the wrenville poorhouse how long ago about six years since is she there still yes sir since i have been in new york i have heard from her frequently i am going from here to visit her have you any message sir i am sure she would be glad to hear from you she shall hear from me said the squire in a low voice sit down and i will write her a letter which i hope will not prove unwelcome five minutes afterwards he handed paul an open letter you may read it he said abruptly you have been a better friend to my sister than i you shall witness my late reparation the letter was as follows cedarville jan my dear sister i hope you will forgive me for my long neglect it is not fitting that while i am possessed of abundant means you should longer remain the tenant of an almshouse i send you by the bearer of this note paul prescott who i understand is a friend of yours the sum of three hundred dollars the same sum will be sent you annually i hope it will be sufficient to maintain you comfortably i shall endeavor to call upon you soon and meanwhile remain your affectionate brother ezekiel conant paul read this letter with grateful joy it seemed almost to good to be true aunt lucy would be released from the petty tyranny of mrs mudges household and perhaps he felt almost sure aunt hester would be willing to receive her as a boarder thus insuring her a peaceful and happy home in her declining years oh sir said he seizing squire conants hand you cannot tell how happy you have made me it is what i ought to have done before here is the money referred to in the letter three hundred dollars mind you dont lose it i will take every care sir you may tell my sister that i shall be happy to have her write me i will sir paul left squire conants house feeling that he had great cause for joy the squires refusal to receive more than half the debt left him master of over three hundred dollars but i am not sure whether he did not rejoice even more over the good fortune which had come to aunt lucy lee whose kindness to him in his unfriended boyhood he would ever hold in grateful remembrance he enjoyed in anticipation the joy which he knew aunt lucy would feel when the change in her fortunes was communicated to her he knew also how great would be the chagrin of mr and mrs mudge when they found that the meek old lady whom they hated was about to be rescued from their clutches on the whole paul felt that this was the happiest day of his life it was a satisfaction to feel that the good fortune of his early friend was all due to his own intercession he was able to take the cars to a point four miles distant from wrenville on getting out on the platform he inquired whether there was a livery stable near by he was directed to one but a few rods distant entering he asked can you let me have a horse and chaise to go to wrenville yes sir said the groom let me have the best horse in the stable said paul and charge me accordingly yes sir said the groom respectfully judging from pauls dress and tone that he was a young gentleman of fortune a spirited animal was brought out and paul was soon seated in the chaise driving along the wrenville road pauls city friends would hardly have recognized their economical acquaintance in the welldressed young man who now sat behind a fast horse putting him through his best paces it might have been a weakness in paul but he remembered the manner in which he left wrenville an unfriended boy compelled to fly from persecution under the cover of darkness and he felt a certain pride in showing the mudges that his circumstances were now entirely changed it was over this very road that he had walked with his little bundle in the early morning six years before it seemed to him almost like a dream at length he reached wrenville though he had not been there for six years he recognized the places that had once been familiar to him but everything seemed to have dwindled accustomed to large city warehouses the houses in the village seemed very diminutive even squire benjamin newcomes house which he had once regarded as a stately mansion now looked like a very ordinary dwelling as he rode up the main street of the village many eyes were fixed upon him and his carriage but no one thought of recognizing in the welldressed youth the boy who had run away from the wrenville poorhouse xxxv conclusion at the very moment that paul was driving through the village street mr nicholas mudge entered the poorhouse in high spirits certainly illfortune must have befallen some one to make the good man so exhilarant to explain mr mudge had just been to the village store to purchase some groceries one of his parcels was tied up in a stray leaf of a recent new york daily in which he discovered an item which he felt sure would make aunt lucy unhappy he communicated it to mrs mudge who highly approved his design she called the old lady from the common room here aunt lucy she said is something that will interest you aunt lucy came in wondering a little at such an unusual mark of attention mrs mudge immediately commenced reading with malicious emphasis a paragraph concerning a certain paul prescott who had been arrested for thieving and sentenced to the house of reformation for a term of months there said mrs mudge triumphantly what do you say to your favorite now turned out well hasnt he didnt i always say so i always knew that boy was bad at heart and that hed come to a bad end i dont believe its the same boy declared aunt lucy who was nevertheless unpleasantly affected by the paragraph she thought it possible that paul might have yielded to a powerful temptation perhaps you think ive been making it up if you dont believe it look at the paper for yourself thrusting it into aunt lucys hands yes said the old lady i see that the name is the same but for all that there is a mistake somewhere i do not believe it is the same boy you dont just as if there would be more than one boy of that name there may be other prescotts but there isnt but one paul prescott take my word for it if it is he said aunt lucy indignantly is it christianlike to rejoice over the poor boys misfortune misfortune retorted mrs mudge with a sneer you call it a misfortune to steal then i call it a crime its often misfortune that drives people to it though continued the old lady looking keenly at mrs mudge i have known cases where they didnt have that excuse mrs mudge colored go back to your room said she sharply and dont stay here accusing me and mr mudge of unchristian conduct youre the most troublesome pauper we have on our hands and i do wish the town would provide for you somewhere else so do i sighed the old lady to herself though she did not think fit to give audible voice to her thoughts it was at this moment that paul halted his chaise at the gate and lightly jumping out fastened his horse to a tree and walked up to the front door who can it be thought mrs mudge hastily adjusting her cap and taking off her apron i dont know im sure said mr mudge unsuspiciously i declare i look like a fright no worse than usual said her husband gallantly by this time paul had knocked goodmorning sir said mrs mudge deferentially her respect excited by pauls dress and handsome chaise is mrs lee in inquired paul not caring to declare himself yet to his old enemy yes said mrs mudge obsequiously though not overpleased to find that this was aunt lucys visitor would you like to see her if you please what can he want of the old lady thought mrs mudge as she went to summon her a visitor for me asked aunt lucy looking at mrs mudge somewhat suspiciously yes and as hes come in a carriage youd better slick up a little put on a clean cap or something aunt lucy was soon ready she looked wonderingly at paul not recognizing him you are not very good at remembering your old friends said paul with a smile what exclaimed aunt lucy her face lighting up with joy are you little paul not very little now said our hero laughing but im the same paul you used to know mrs mudge who through the half open door had heard this revelation was overwhelmed with astonishment and confusion she hurried to her husband wonders will never cease she exclaimed holding up both hands if that doesnt turn out to be paul prescott of course hes up in the world or he wouldnt dress so well and ride in such a handsome carriage you dont say so returned mr mudge who looked as if he had heard of a heavy misfortune yes i do i heard him say so with his own lips its a pity you showed that paragraph to aunt lucy this morning that you showed you mean retorted her husband no i dont you know it was you that did it hush theyll hear meanwhile the two friends were conversing together happily im so glad youre doing so well paul said aunt lucy it was a lucky day when you left the poorhouse behind you yes aunt lucy and today is a lucky day for you theres room for two in that chaise and im going to take you away with me i should enjoy a ride paul its a long time since i have taken one you dont understand me youre going away not to return the old lady smiled sadly no no paul i cant consent to become a burden upon your generosity you cant afford it and it will not be right o said paul smiling you give me credit for too much i mean that you shall pay your board but you know i have no money no i dont i dont consider that a lady is penniless who has an income of three hundred dollars a year i dont understand you paul then perhaps you will understand this said our hero enjoying the old ladys astonishment he drew from his pocket a roll of bills and passed them to aunt lucy the old lady looked so bewildered that he lost no time in explaining the matter to her then indeed aunt lucy was happy not only because she had become suddenly independent but because after years of coldness and estrangement her brother had at last become reconciled to her now aunt lucy resumed paul ill tell you what my plans are you shall get into the chaise with me and go at once to new york i think aunt hester will be willing to receive you as a boarder if not i will find you a pleasant place near by will that suit you it will make me very happy but i cannot realize it it seems like a dream at this moment mrs mudge entered the room and after a moments scrutiny pretended to recognize paul her husband followed close behind her can i believe my eyes she exclaimed is this indeed paul prescott i am very glad to see you back only a visit mrs mudge said paul smiling youll stop to dinner i hope paul thought of the soup and dry bread which he used to find so uninviting and said that he should not have time to do so weve thought of you often said mr mudge writhing his harsh features into a smile theres scarcely a day that we havent spoken of you i ought to feel grateful for your remembrance said paul his eyes twinkling with mirth but i dont think mr mudge you always thought so much of me mr mudge coughed in some embarrassment and not thinking of anything in particular to say said nothing i am going to take from you another of your boarders said paul can you spare aunt lucy for how long asked mrs mudge for all the time she has just come into possession of a little property several hundred dollars a year and i have persuaded her to go to new york to board is this true exclaimed mrs mudge in astonishment yes said the old lady god has been bountiful to me when i least expected it can i be of any service in assisting you to pack up mrs lee asked mrs mudge with newborn politeness she felt that as a lady of property aunt lucy was entitled to much greater respect and deference than before thank you mrs mudge said paul answering for her she wont have occasion for anything in this house she will get a supply of new things when she gets to new york the old lady looked very happy and mrs mudge in spite of her outward deference felt thoroughly provoked at her good fortune i will not dwell upon the journey to new york aunt lucy though somewhat fatigued bore it much better than she had anticipated mr and mrs cameron entered very heartily into pauls plans and readily agreed to receive aunt lucy as an inmate of their happy and united household the old lady felt it to be a happy and blessed change from the poorhouse where scanty food and poor accommodations had been made harder to bear by the ill temper of mr and mrs mudge to a home whose atmosphere was peace and kindness and now dear reader it behooves us to draw together the different threads of our story and bring all to a satisfactory end mr and mrs mudge are no longer in charge of the wrenville poorhouse after aunt lucys departure mrs mudge became so morose and despotic that her rule became intolerable loud complaints came to the ears of squire newcome chairman of the overseers of the poor one fine morning he was compelled to ride over and give the interesting couple warning to leave immediately mr mudge undertook the charge of a farm but his habits of intoxication increased upon him to such an extent that he was found dead one winter night in a snowdrift between his own house and the tavern mrs mudge was not extravagant in her expressions of grief not having a very strong affection for her husband at last accounts she was keeping a boardinghouse in a manufacturing town some time since her boarders held an indignation meeting and threatened to leave in a body unless she improved her fare a course to which she was obliged to submit george dawkins unable to obtain a recommendation from mr danforth did not succeed in securing another place in new york he finally prevailed upon his father to advance him a sum of money with which he went to california let us hope that he may turn over a new leaf there and establish a better reputation than he did in new york mr stubbs is still in the tin business he is as happy as the day is long and so are his wife and children once a year he comes to new york and pays paul a visit this supplies him with something to talk about for the rest of the year he is frugal in his expenses and is able to lay up a couple of hundred dollars every year which he confides to paul in whose financial skill he has the utmost confidence i am sure my boy readers would not forgive me for omitting to tell them something more about ben newcome although his mirthful spirit sometimes led him into mischief he was goodhearted and i have known him do many an act of kindness even at considerable trouble to himself it will be remembered that in consequence of his night adventure during which he personated a ghost much to the terror of mr mudge his father determined to send him to a military school this proved to be a wise arrangement the discipline was such as ben needed and he soon distinguished himself by his excellence in the military drill soon after he graduated the rebellion broke out and ben was at once in spite of his youth elected captain of the wrenville company at the battle of antietam he acquitted himself with so much credit that he was promoted to a major he was again promoted and when richmond was evacuated he was one of the first officers to enter the streets of the rebel capital a colonel in command of his regiment i have heard on high authority that he is considered one of the best officers in the service mr and mrs cameron are still living they are happy in the success and increasing prosperity of paul whom they regard as a son between them and aunt lucy he would stand a very fair chance of being spoiled if his own good sense and good judgment were not sufficient to save him from such a misfortune paul is now admitted to a small interest in the firm which entitles him to a share in the profits as danforth and co have done a very extensive business of late years this interest brings him in a very handsome income there is only one cause of difference between him and the sexton he insists that uncle hugh who is getting infirm should resign his office as he is abundantly able to support the whole family but the good sexton loves his duties and will continue to discharge them as long as he is able and now we must bid farewell to paul he has battled bravely with the difficulties and discouragements that beset him in early life he has been faithful to the charge which he voluntarily assumed and his fathers memory is free from reproach he often wishes that his father could have lived to witness his prosperity but god has decreed it otherwise happy in the love of friends and in the enjoyment of all that can make life desirable so far as external circumstances have that power let us all wish him god speed
