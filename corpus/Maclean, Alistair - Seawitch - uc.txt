sea witch chapter n certain places and among certain people the seawitch was a very bad name indeed but overwhelmingly their venom was reserved for a certain lord worth a multisome said bulti millionaire chairman and sole owner of north hudson oil company and incidentally owner of the seawitch when his name was mentioned by any of the ten men present at that shoreside house on lake tahoe it was in tones of less than hushed reverence their meeting was announced in neither the national nor local press this was due to two factors the delegates arrived and departed either ii ahstalr maclean singly or in couples and among the heterogeneous summer population of lake tahoe such comings and goings went unremarked or were ignored more importantly the delegates to the meeting were understandably reluctant that their assembly become common knowledge the day was friday the thirteenth a date that boded no good for someone there were nine delegates present plus their host four of them mattered but only two seriouslycorral who represented the oil and mineral leases in the florida area and benson who represented the rigs off southern california of the other six only two mattered one was patinos of venezuela the other known as borosoff of russia whose interest in american oil supplies could only be regarded as minimal it was widely assumed among the others that his only interest in attending the meeting was to stir up as much trouble as possible an assumption that was probably correct all ten were in various degrees suppliers of oil to the united states and had one common interest to see that the price of those supplies did not drop the last thing they ah wanted to see was an oilvalue depreciation benson whose holiday home this was and who was nominally hosting the meeting opened the discussion gentlemen does anyone have any objections if i bring a third partythat is a man who rep seawitch resents neither ourselves nor lord worthinto this meeting practically everyone had and there were some moments of bedlamic confusion they had not only objections but very strong ones at that borosoff the russian said no it is too dangerous he glanced around the group with calculated suspiciousness there are already too many of us privy to these discussions benson who had not become head of one of europes biggest oil companies a britishbased one just because someone had handed him the job as a birthday present could be disconcertingly blunt you borosoff are the one with the slenderest claims to be present at this meeting you might well bear that in mind name your suspect borosoff remained silent remember gentlemen the objective of this meetingto maintain at least the present oilprice levels the opec is now actively considering hiking the oil pricesthat doesnt hurt us much here hi the us well just hike our own prices and pass them on to the public patinos said youre every bit as unscrupulous and ruthless as you claim us to be realism is not the same as rathlessness nobodys going to hike anything while north hudson is around they are already undercutting us the majors a slight pinch but we feel it if we raise our prices more and his remain steady alistair maclean the slight pinch is going to increase and if he gets some more tlps into operation then the pinch will begin to hurt it will also hurt the opec for the demand for your products will undoubtedly fall off we all subscribe to the gentlemens agreement among major oil companies that they will not prospect for oil in international watersthat is to say outside their own legally and internationally recognized territorial limits without observance of this agreement the possibilities of legal diplomatic political and international strife ranging from scenes of political violence to outright armed confrontation are only too real let us suppose that nation aas some countries have already doneclaims all rights for all waters a hundred miles offshore from its coasts let us further suppose that nation b comes along and starts drilling thirty miles outside those limits then let us suppose that nation a makes a unilateral decision to extend its offshore limits to a hundred and fifty milesand dont forget that peru has claimed two hundred miles as its limits the subsequent possibilities are too awesome to contemplate alas not all are gentlemen the chairman of the north hudson oil company lord worth and his entire pestiferous board of directors would have been the first to vehemently deny any suggestion that they were gentlemen a fact held in almost universal acceptance by their seawiteh competitors in oil they would also have denied equally vehemently that they were criminals a fact that may or may not have been true but it most certainly is not true now he has in short committed two of what should be indictable offenses should i say the first is unprovable the second although an offense in moral terms is not as yet strictly illegal the facts of the firstand what i consider much the minor offenseconcerns the building of lord worths tlp in houston it is no secret in the industry that the plans were stolenthose for the platform from the mobil oil company those for the legs and anchoring systems from the chevron oilfield research company but as i say unprovable it is commonplace for new inventions and developments to occur at two or more places simultaneously and he can always claim that his design team working in secret beat the others to the punch benson was perfectly correct in the design of the seawitch lord worth had adopted shortcuts which the narrowminded could have regarded as unscrupulous if not illegal like all oil companies north hudson had its own design team they were all cronies of lord worth employed solely for taxdeduction purposes their combined talents would have been incapable of designing a rowboat this did not worry lord worth he had no need for a design team he was a vastly wealthy alistatr maclean sea witch man had powerful friendsnone of them needless to say among the oil companiesand was a master of industrial espionage with these resources at his disposal he found little trouble in obtaining those two secret advance plans which he passed on to a firm of highly competent marine designers whose exorbitant fees were matched only by then extreme discretion the designers found little difficulty in marrying the two sets of plans adding just sufficient modifications and improvements to discourage those with a penchant for patentrights litigation benson went on but what really worries me and what should worry all you gentlemen here is lord worths violation of the tacit agreement never to indulge in drilling in international waters he paused deliberately for effect and looked slowly at each of the other nine in turn i say in all seriousness gentlemen that lord worths foolhardiness and greed may well prove to be the spark that triggers a third world war apart from protecting our own interests i maintain that for the good of mankindand i speak from no motive of spurious selfjustificationif the governments of the world do not intervene then it is imperative that we should as the governments show no sign of intervention then i suggest that the burden lies upon us this madman must be stopped i think you gentlemen would agree that only we realize the full implications of all of this and that only we have the technical expertise to stop him there were murmurs of approval from around the room a sincere and disinterested concern for the good of mankind was a much more morally justifiable reason for action than the protection of ones own selfish interest patinos the man from venezuela looked at benson with a smile of mild cynicism on his face the smile signified nothing patinos a sincere and devout catholic wore the same expression when he passed through the doors of his church you seem very sure of this mr benson tve given quite some thought to it borosoff said and just how do you propose to stop this madman mr benson al dont know you dont know one of the others at the table lifted his eyebrows a millimeterfor him a sign of complete disapproval then why did you summon us all this distance i didnt summon you i asked you i asked you to approve whatever course of action we might take this course of action being again i dont know the eyebrows returned to normal a twitch of the mans lip showed that he was contemplating smiling thisahthird party yes he has a name cronkite john cronkite a hush descended upon the company the m alistair maclean open objections had turned into pensive hesitation which in turn gave way to a nodding acceptance benson apart no one there had ever met cronkite but his name was a household word to all of them in the oil business that name had long been a legend although at times a far from savory one they all knew that any of them might require his incomparable services at any time while at the same time hoping that that day would never come when it came to the capping of blazing gushers cronkite was without peer wherever in the world a gusher blew fire no one even considered putting it out themselves they just sent for cronkite to wincing observers his modus operandi seemed nothing short of draconian but cronkite would blasphemously brook no interference despite the extortionate fees he charged it was more common than not for a fourengined jet to be put at his disposal to get him to the scene of the disaster as quickly as possible cronkite always delivered he also knew all there was to know about the oil business and he was hardly surprisingly extremely tough and utterly ruthless henderson who represented oil interests in honduras said why should a man with his extraordinary qualifications the worlds number one as we all know choose to engage himself inahan enterprise of this nature from his reputation i would hardly have thought that he sea witch was one to be concerned about the woes of suffering mankind he isnt money cronkite comes very high a fresh challengethe mans a born adventurer but basically its because he hates lord worths guts henderson said not an uncommon sentiment it seems why lord worth sent his own private boeing for him to come cap a blazing gusher in the middle east by the time cronkite arrived lord worths own men had capped it this alone cronkite regarded as a mortal insult he then made the mistake of demanding the full fee for his services lord worth has a reputation for notorious scottish meanness which while an insult to the scots is more than justified in his case he refused and said that he would pay him for his time no more cronkite then compounded his error by taking him to court with the kind of lawyers lord worth can afford cronkite never had a chance not only did he lose but he had to pay the costs which wouldnt be low henderson said mediumhigh to massive i dont know all j know is that cronkite has done quite a bit of brooding about it ever since such a man would not have to be sworn to secrecy a man can swear a hundred different oaths and break them all besides because of the alls fair maclean exorbitant fees cronkite charges his feelings toward lord worth and the fact that he might just have to step outside the law his silence is ensured it was the turn of another of those grouped round the table to raise his eyebrows outside the law we cannot risk being involved might i said for us the element of risk does not exist may we see this man benson nodded rose went to a door and admitted cronkite cronkite was a texan in height build and cragginess of features he bore a remarkable resemblance to john wayne unlike wayne he never smiled his face was of a peculiarly yellow complexion typical of those who have had an overdose of antimalarial tablets which was just what had happened to cronkite mepacrine does not make for a peachesandcream complexion not that cronkites had ever remotely resembled that he was newly returned from indonesia where he had inevitably maintained his per cent record mr cronkite benson said mr cronkite this is cronkite was brusque in a gravelly voice he said i dont want to know their names in spite of the abruptness of his tone several of the oilmen round the table almost beamed sea witch here was a man of discretion a man after their own hearts cronkite went on all i understand from mr benson is that i am required to attend to a matter involving lord worth and the seawitch mr benson has given me a pretty full briefing i know the background i would like first of all to hear any suggestions you gentlemen may have to offer cronkite sat down lit what proved to be a very foulsmelling cigar and waited expectantly he kept silent during the following halfhour discussion for ten of the worlds top businessmen they proved to be an extraordinarily inept not to say inane lot they talked in an evernarrowing series of concentric circles henderson said first of all there must be no violence used is that agreed everybody nodded agreement each of them was a pillar of business respectability who could not afford to have his reputation besmirched in any way no one appeared to notice that except for lifting a hand to his cigar and puffing out increasingly vile clouds of smoke cronkite did not move throughout the discussion he also remained totally silent after agreeing that there should be no violence the meeting of ten agreed on nothing finally patinos spoke up why dont you one of you four americans i meanapproach alistair maclean your congress to pass an emergency law banning offshore drilling in extraterritorial waters benson looked at him with something akin to pity i am afraid sir that you do not quite understand the relations between the american majors and congress on the few occasions we have met with themsomething to do with too much profits and too little taxim afraid we have treated them in soahcavalier a fashion that nothing would give them greater pleasure than to refuse any request we might make one of the others known simply as mr a said how about an approach to that international legal ombudsman the hague after all this is an international matter henderson shook his head forget it the dilatoriness of that august body is so legendary that all present would be long retiredor worsebefore a decision is made the decision would just as likely be negative anyway united nations mr a said that talkshop benson obviously had a low and not uncommon view of the un they havent even got the power to order new york to install a new parking meter outside their front door the next revolutionary idea came from one of the americans why shouldnt we all agree for an unspecified timelets see how it goesto lower our sea witch price below that of north hudson in that case no one would want to buy their oil this proposal was met with stunned disbelief corral spoke in a kind voice not only would that lead to vast losses to the major oil companies but would almost certainly and immediately lead lord worth to lower his prices fractionally below their new ones the man has sufficient working capital to keep him going for a hundred years at a lossin the unlikely event that is of his running at a loss at all a lengthy silence followed cronkite was not quite as immobile as he had been the granitic expression on his face remained unchanged but the fingers of his nonsmoking hand had begun to drum gently on the armrest of his chair for cronkite this was equivalent to throwing a fit of hysterics it was during this period that all thoughts of maintaining high gentlemanly and ethical standards against drilling hi international waters were forgotten by the ten why not mr a said buy him out in fairness it has to be said that mr a did not appreciate just how wealthy lord worth was and that immensely wealthy though he mr a was lord worth could have bought him out lock stock and barrel the seawitch rights i mean a hundred million dollars lets be generous two hundred million dollars why not allstair corral looked depressed the answer to why not is easy by the latest reckoning lord worth is one of the worlds five richest men and even two hundred million dollars would be pennies as far as he was concerned now mr a looked depressed benson said sure hed sell mr a visibly brightened for two reasons only in the first place hed make a quick and splendid profit in the second place for less than half the selling price he could build another seawitch anchor it a couple of miles away from the present seawitchthere are no leasehold rights in extraterritorial waters and start sending oil ashore at his same old price a temporarily deflated mr a slumped back in his armchair a partnership then mr b said his tone was that of a man in a state of quiet despair out of the question henderson was very positive like all very rich men lord worth is a born loner he wouldnt have a combined partnership with the king of saudi arabia and the shah of iran even if it were offered him free in the gloom of baffled and exhausted silence thoroughly bored and hitherto nearwordless john cronkite rose he said without preamble my personal fee will be one million dollars i will require ten million dollars for operating expenses every seawitch cent of this will be accounted for and any unspent balance returned i demand a completely free hand and no interference from any of you if i do encounter interference ill retain the balance of the expenses and abandon the mission i refuse to disclose what my plans areor will be when i have made them finally i would prefer to have no further contact with any of you now or at any time the assurance and confidence of the man were astonishing agreement among the mightily relieved ten was immediate and total the ten million dollarsa trifling sum to those accustomed to spending as much in bribes every month or sowould be delivered within twentyfour at the most fortyeighthours to a cuban numbered account in miami the only place in the united states where swisstype numbered accounts were permitted for taxevasion purposes the money of course would not come from any of their respective countries instead ironically enough from their bulging offshore funds chapter jlord worth was tall lean and erect his complexion was the mahogany hue of the playboy millionaire who spends his life in the sun lord worth seldom worked less than sixteen hours a day his abundant hair and mustache were snowwhite according to his mood and expression and to the eye of the beholder he could have been a biblical patriarch a betterclass roman senator or a gentlemanly seventeenthcentury pirateexcept for the fact of course that none of those ever far less habitually wore lightweight alpaca suits of the same color as lord worths hair fi sea witch he looked and was every inch an aristocrat unlike the many americans who bore the christian names of duke or earl lord worth really was a lord the fifteenth in succession of a highly distinguished family of scottish peers of the realm the fact that their distinction had lain mainly in the fields of assassination endless clan warfare the stealing of women and cattle and the selling of their fellow peers down the river was beside the point the earlier scottish peers didnt go in too much for the more cultural activities the blue blood that had run in their veins ran in lord worths as ruthless predatory acquisitive and courageous as any of his ancestors lord worth simply went about his business with a degree of refinement and sophistication that would have lain several lightyears beyond their understanding he had reversed the trend of canadians coming to britain making their fortunes and eventually being elevated to the peerage he had already been a peer and an extremely wealthy one before emigrating to canada his emigration which had been discreet and precipitous had not been entirely voluntary he had made a fortune hi real estate in london before the internal revenue had become embarrassingly interested in his activities fortunately for him whatever charges might have been laid at his door were not extraditable he had spent several years in canada invest alistatr maclean ing his millions in the north hudson oil company and proving himself to be even more ablein the oil business than he had been in real estate his tankers and refineries spanned the globe before he had decided that the climate was too cold for him and moved south to florida his splendid mansion was the envy of the many millionairesof a lesser financial breed admittedlywho almost literally jostled for elbowroom in the fort lauderdale area the dining room in that mansion was something to behold monks by the very nature of their calling are supposed to be devoid of all earthly lusts but no monk past or present could ever have gazed on the gleaming magnificence of that splendid oaken refectory table without turning pale chartreuse with envy the chairs inevitably were louis xiv the splendidly embroidered silken carpet with a pile deep enough for a fairsized mouse to take cover in would have been judged by an expert to come from damascus and to have cost a fortune the expert would have been right on both counts the heavy drapes and embroidered silken walls were of the same pale gray the latter being enhanced by a series of original impressionist paintings no less than three by matisse and the same number by renoir lord worth was no dilettante and was clearly trying to make amends for his ancestors shortcomings in cultural fields it was in those suitably princely surroundings seawiteh that lord worth was at the moment taking his ease reveling in his second brandy and the two beings whomafter moneyhe loved most in the world his two daughters marina and melinda who had been so named by their now divorced spanish mother both were young both were beautiful and could have been mistaken for twins which they werent they were easily distinguishable by the fact that while marinas hair was black as a ravens melindas was pure titian there were two other guests at the table many a local millionaire would have given a fair slice of his illgotten gains for the privilege and honor of sitting at lord worths table few were invited and then but seldom those two young men comparatively as poor as church mice had the unique privilege without invitation of coming and going as they pleased which was pretty often they were mitchell and roomer two pleasant men in their early thirties for whom lord worth had a strong if concealed admiration and whom he held in something close to aweinasmuch as they were the only two completely honest men he had ever met not that lord worth had ever stepped on the wrong side of the law although he frequently had a clear view of what happened on the other side it was simply that he was not hi the habit of dealing with honest men they had both been two highly efficient police alistalr maclean seawitch sergeants only they had been too efficient much given to arresting the wrong people such as crooked politicians and equally crooked wealthy businessmen who had previously labored under the misapprehension that they were above the law they were fired not to put too fine a point on it for their total incorruptibility of the two michael mitchell was the taller the broader and the less goodlooking with slightly craggy face ruffled dark hair and blue chin he could never have made it as a matinee idol john roomer with his brown hair and trimmed brown mustache was altogether betterlooking both were shrewd intelligent and highly experienced roomer was the intuitive one mitchell the one long on action apart from being charming both men were astute and highly resourceful and they were possessed of one other not inconsiderable quality both were deadly marksmen two years previously they had set up their own private investigative practice and in that brief space of time had established such a reputation that people in real trouble now made a practice of going to them instead of to the police a fact that hardly endeared them to the local law they lived near lord worths estate where they were frequent and welcome visitors that they did not come for the exclusive pleasure of his company lord worth was well aware nor he knew were they even in the slightest way interested in his money a fact that lord worth found astonishing as he had never previously encountered anyone who wasnt thus interested what they were interested in and deeply so were marina and melinda the door opened and lord worths butler jenkinsenglish of course as were the two footmenmade his usual soundless entrance approached the head of the table and murmured discreetly hi lord worths ear lord worth nodded and rose excuse me girls gentlemen visitors fra sure you can get along together quite well without me he made his way to his study entered and closed the door behind hima very special padded door that when shut rendered the room completely soundproof the study in its own waylord worth was no sybarite but he liked his creature comforts as well as the next manwas as sumptuous as the dining room oak leather a wholly unnecessary log fire burning in one corner all straight from the best english baronial mansions the walls were lined with thousands of books many of which lord worth had actually read a fact that must have caused great distress to his illiterate ancestors who had despised degeneracy above all else a tall bronzed man with aquiline features and gray hair rose to his feet both men smiled and shook hands warmly lord worth said corral my dear chap how allstair maclean very nice to see you again its been quite some time my pleasure lord worth nothing recently that would have interested you but now now is something else again the corral who stood before lord worth was indeed the corral who in his capacity as representative of the florida offshore leases had been present at the meeting of ten at lake tahoe some years had passed since he and lord worth had arrived at an amicable and mutually satisfactory agreement corral widely regarded as lord worths most avowedly determined enemy and certainly the most vociferous of his critics reported regularly to lord worth on the current activities and more importantly the projected plans of the major companies which didnt hurt lord worth at all corral in return received an annual taxfree retainer of which didnt hurt him very much either lord worth pressed a bell and within seconds jenkins entered bearing a silver tray with two large brandies there was no telepathy involved just years of experience and a longestablished foreknowledge of lord worths desires when he left both men sat lord worth said well what news from the west the cherokee i regret to say are after you seawitch lord worth sighed and said it had to come sometime tell me all corral told him all he had a nearphotographic memory and a gift for concise and accurate reportage within five minutes lord worth knew all that was worth knowing about the lake tahoe meeting lord worth who because of the unfortunate misunderstanding that had arisen between himself and cronkite knew the latter as well as any and better than most said at the end of corrals report did cronkite subscribe to the tens agreement to abjure any form of violence no not that it would have mattered if he had mans a total stranger to the truth and ten million dollars expenses you tell me it did seem a bit excessive can you see a massive outlay like that being concomitant with anything except violence no do you think the others believed that there was no connection between them let me put it this way sir any group of people who can convince themselves or appear to convince themselves that any proposed action against you is for the betterment of mankind is also prepared to convince themselves or appear to convince themselves that the word cronkite is synonymous with peace on earth alistair maelean so their consciences are clear if cronkite goes to any excessive lengths in death and destruction to achieve their ends they can always throw up their hands in horror and say good god we never thought the man would go that far not that any connection between them and cronkite would ever have to be established what a bunch of devious mealymouthed hypocrites he paused for a moment i suppose cronkite refused to divulge his plans absolutely but there is one odd circumstance just as we were leaving cronkite drew two of the ten to one side and spoke to them privately it would be interesting to know why any chance of finding out a fair chance nothing guaranteed but im sure benson could find outafter all it was benson who invited us all to lake tahoe and you think you could persuade benson to tell you a fair chance nothing more lord worth put on his resigned expression all right how much nothing money wont buy benson corral shook his head hi disbelief extraordinary in this day and age but benson is not a mercenary man but he does owe me some favors one of them being that without me he wouldnt be the president of the oil company that he is now corral paused im surprised you havent asked seawitch me the identities of the two men cronkite took aside so am i borosoff of the soviet union and patinos of venezuela lord worth appeared to lapse into a trance that mean anything to you lord worth bestirred himself yes units of the russian navy are making a socalled goodwill tour of the caribbean they are inevitably based in cuba of the ten those are the only two that could bring swiftahnaval intervention to bear against the seawitch he shook his head diabolical utterly diabolical my way of thinking too sir theres no knowing but ill check as soon as possible and hope to get results and i shall take immediate precautions both men rose corral we shall have to give serious consideration to the question of increasing this paltry retainer of yours we try to be of service lord worth lord worths private radio room bore more than a passing resemblance to the flight deck of his private the variety of knobs switches buttons and dials was bewildering lord worth seemed perfectly at home with them all and proceeded to make a number of calls the first were to his four helicopter pilots instructing them to have his two largest helicoptersnever a man to do things by halves alistair maclean lord worth owned no fewer than six of these machinesready at his own private airfield shortly before dawn the next four were to people of whose existence his fellow directors were totally unaware the first of these calls was to cuba the second to venezuela lord worths worldwide range of contactsemployees ratherwas vast the instructions to both were simple and explicit a constant monitoring watch was to be kept on the naval bases in both countries and any sudden departures of any naval vessels and their type was to be reported to him immediately the third to a person who lived not too many miles away was addressed to a certain giuseppe palermo whose name sounded as if he might be a member of the mafia but who definitely wasnt the mafia palermo despised as a mollycoddling organization which had become so ludicrously gentle in its methods of persuasion as to be in imminent danger of becoming respectable the next call was to baton rouge in louisiana where lived a person who called himself only conde and whose main claim to fame lay in the fact that he was the highestranking naval officer to have been courtmartialed and dishonorably discharged since world war ii he like the others received very explicit instructions not only was lord worth a master organizer but the efficiency he displayed was matched only by his speed in operation ft sea witch the noble lord who would have stoutly maintainedif anyone had the temerity to accuse him which no one ever hadthat he was no criminal was about to become just that even this he would have strongly denied and that on three grounds the constitution upheld the right of every citizen to bear arms every man had the right to defend himself and his property against criminal attack by whatever means lay to hand and the only way to fight fire was with fire the final call lord worth put through and this time with total confidence was to his tried and trusted lieutenant commander larsen commander larsen was the captain of the seawitch larsenno one knew why he called himself commander and he wasnt the kind of person you askedwas a rather different breed of man from his employer except in a public court or in the presence of a law officer he would cheerfully admit to anyone that he was both a nongentleman and a criminal and he certainly bore no resemblance to any aristocrat alive or dead but there did exist a genuine rapport and mutual respect between lord worth and himself in all likelihood they were simply brothers under the skin as a criminal and nonaristocratand casting no aspersions on honest unfortunates who may resemble himhe certainly looked the part he alls lair macleam sea witch had the general build and appearance of the more viciously daunting heavyweight wrestler deepset black eyes that peered out under the overhanging foliage of hugely bushy eyebrows an equally bushy black beard a hooked nose and a face that looked as if it had been in regular contact with a series of heavy objects no one with the possible exception of lord worth knew who he was what he had been or from where he had come his voice when he spoke came as a positive shock beneath that neanderthalic facade was the voice and the mind of an educated man it really ought not to have come as such a shock beneath the facade of many an exquisite fop lies the mind of a retarded fourthgrader larsen was in the radio room at that moment listening attentively nodding from tune to time then he flicked a switch that put the incoming call on the loudspeaker he said all clear sir everything understood well make the preparations but havent you overlooked something sir overlooked what lord worths voice over the telephone carried the overtones of a man who couldnt possibly have overlooked anything youve suggested that armed surface vessels may be used against us if theyre prepared to go to such lengths isnt it feasible that theyll go to any lengths get to the point man the point is that its easy enough to keep an eye on a couple of naval bases but i suggest its a bit more difficult to keep an eye on a dozen maybe two dozen airfields good god there was a long pause during which the rattle of cogs and the meshing of gear wheels in lord worths brain couldnt be heard do you really think if i were the seawitch lord worth it would be six and halfadozen to me whether i was clobbered by shells or bombs and planes could get away from the scene of the crime a damn sight faster than ships they could get clean away whereas the u s navy or landbased bombers would have a good chance of intercepting surface vessels and another thing lord wortha ship could stop at a distance of a hundred miles no distance at all for the guided missile i believe they have a range of four thousand miles these days when the missile was say twenty miles from us they could switch on its heatsource tracking device god knows were the only heat source for a hundred miles around another lengthy pause then any more encouraging thoughts occur to you commander larsen yes sir just one if i were the enemyi may call them the enemy call the devils what you want if i were the enemy fd use a submarine they dont even have to break the surface to loose off a missile poof no seawitch no signs alistalr maclean seawlteh of any attacker could well be put down to a massive explosion aboard the seawitch far from impossible sir youll be telling me next that theyll be atomicheaded missiles to be picked up by a dozen seismological stations i should think it hardly likely sir but that may just be wishful thinking i personally have no wish to be vaporized ill see you hi the morning the speaker went dead larsen hung up his phone and smiled widely one might have expected this action to reveal a set of yellowed fangs instead it revealed a perfect set of gleamingjy white teeth he turned to look at scoffield his head driller and righthand man scoffield was a large rubicund smiling man apparently the easygoing essence of good nature to the fact that this was not precisely the case any member of his drilling crews would have eagerly and blasphemously testified scoffield was a very tough citizen indeed and one could assume that it was not innate modesty that made him conceal the fact much more probably it was a permanent stricture of the facial muscles caused by the four long vertical scars on his cheeks two on either side clearly he like larsen was no great advocate of plastic surgery he looked at larsen with understandable curiosity o what was all that about the day of reckoning is at hand prepare to meet thy doom more specifically his lordship is beset by enemies larsen outlined lord worths plight hes sending what sounds like a battalion of hard men out here in the early morning accompanied by suitable weaponry then in the afternoon we are to expect a boat of some sort loaded with even heavier weaponry i wonder where hes getting all those hard men and weaponry from one wonders one does not ask all this talkyour talkabout bombers and submarines and missiles do you believe that no its just that its hard to pass up the opportunity to ruffle the aristocratic plumage he paused then said thoughtfully at least i hope i dont believe it come on let us examine our defenses youve got a pistol ive got a pistol thats defenses well where well mount the defenses when they arrive fixed largebore guns i should imagine they arrive give the devil his due lord worth delivers from his own private armory i suppose it wouldnt surprise me what do you really think commander i dont know all i know is that if lord ahstair maclean worth is even halfway right life aboard may become slightly less monotonous in the next few days the two men moved out into the gathering dusk on the platform the seawitch was moored in a hundred and fifty fathoms of waternine hundred feet which was well within the tensioning cables capacitiessafely south of the us mineral leasing blocks and the great eastwest fairway right on top of the biggest oil reservoir yet discovered around the shores of the gulf of mexico the two men paused at the drilling derrick where a drill at its maximum angled capacity was trying to determine the extent of the oilfield the crew looked at them without any particular affection but not with hostility there was reason for the lack of warmth before any laws were passed making such drilling illegal lord worth wanted to scrape the bottom of this gigantic barrel of oil not that he was particularly worried for government agencies are notoriously slow to act but there was always the possibility that they might bestir themselves this time and that horror of horrors the bonanza might turn out to be vastly larger than estimated hence the present attempt to discover the limits of the strike and hence the lack of warmth hence the reason why larsen and scoffield both highly gifted slave drivers born centuries out of their time drove their men day and night the seawitck men disliked it but not to the point of rebellion they were highly paid wellhoused and wellfed true there was little enough in the way of wine women and song but then after an exhausting twelvehour shift those frivolities couldnt hope to compete with the attractions of a massive meal then a long deep sleep more importantly and most unusually the men were paid a bonus on every thousand barrels of oil larsen and scoffield made their way to the western apex of the platform and gazed out at the massive bulk of the storage tank its topsides festooned with warning lights they gazed at this for some tune then turned and walked back toward the accommodation quarters scoffield said decided on your gun emplacements yet commanderif there are any guns therell be guns larsen was confident but we wont need any in this quarter why work it out for yourself as for the rest fm not too sure itll come to me in my sleep my turn for an early night see you at four the oil was not stored aboard the rigit is forbidden by a law based strictly on common sense to store hydrocarbons at or near the working platform of an oil rig instead lord worth on larsens instructionswhich had prudently come in the form of suggestionshad had built alistair maclean a huge floating tank which was anchored on a basis precisely similar to that of the seawitch herself at a distance of about three hundred yards cleaned oil was pumped into this after it came up from the ocean floor or more precisely from a massive limestone reef deep down below the ocean floor a reef caused by tiny marine creatures of a now longcovered shallow sea of some half a billion years ago once sometimes twice a day a toncapacity tanker would stop by and empty the huge tank there were three of those tankers employed on the crisscross run to the southern united states the north hudson oil company did in fact have supertankers but the use of them in this case did not serve lord worths purpose even the entire contents of the seawitchs tank would not have filled a quarter of the supertankers carrying capacity and the possibility of a supertanker running at a loss however small would have been the source of waking nightmares for the north hudson equally importantly the more isolated ports which lord worth favored for the delivery of his oil were unable to offer deepwater berthside facilities for anything in excess of fifty thousand tons it might be explained in passing that lord worths choice of those obscure ports was not entirely fortuitous among the parties to the gentlemens agreement against offshore drilling some of the most vociferous of those who roundly seawit h condemned north hudsons nefarious practices were regrettably north hudsons best customers they were the smaller companies who operated on marginal profits and lacked the resources to engage in research and exploration which the larger companies did investing allegedly vast sums in those projects and then to the continuous fury of the internal revenue service and the anger of numerous congressional investigation committees claiming even vaster tax exemptions but to the smaller companies the lure of cheaper oil was irresistible the seawitch which probably produced as much oil as all the government official leasing areas combined seemed a sure and perpetual source of cheap oilat least until the government stepped in which might or might not happen in the next decade the big companies had already demonstrated their capacity to deal with inept congressional inquiries and as long as the energy crisis continued nobody was going to worry very much about where oil came from as long as it came in addition the smaller companies felt if the opecthe organization of petroleum exporting countries could play ducks and drakes with oil prices whenever they fet like it why couldnt they less than two miles from lord worths estate were the adjacent homes and combined office of michael mitchell and john roomer it was mitchell who answered the doorbell alistatr mao loan the visitor was of medium height slightly tubby wore wirerimmed glasses and alopecia had hit him hard he said may i come in in a clipped but courteous enough voice sure michael mitchell let him in to their apartment we dont usually see people this late thank you i come on unusual business james bentley a little sleight of hand and a card appeared fbi mitchell didnt even look at it you can have those things made at any joke shop where you from miami phone number bentley reversed the card which mitchell handed to roomer my memory man saves me from having to have a memory of my own roomer didnt glance at the card either its okay mike i have him youre the boss man up there arent you a nod please sit down mr bentley one thing clear first mitchell said are we under investigation on the contrary the state department has asked us to ask you to help them status at last mitchell said weve got it made johnexcept for one thing the state department doesnt know who the hell we are do discussion closed i understand you gentlemen are friendly with lord worth seawiteh roomer was careful we know him slightly sociallyjust as you seem to know a little about us i know a lot about you including the fact that you are a couple of excops who never learned to look the right way at the right time and the wrong way at the wrong time bars the ladder to promotion i want you to carry out a little investigation of lord worth no deal mitchell said we know him slightly better than slightly hear him out mike but roomers face too had lost whatever little friendliness it may have held lord worth has been making loud noises over the phoneto the state department he seems to be suffering from a persecution complex this interests the state department because they see him more in the role of the persecutor than persecuted you mean the fbi does roomer said youve had him in your files for years lord worth always gives the impression of being very capable of looking out for himself thaf s precisely what intrigues the state department mitchell said what kind of noises nonsense noises you know he has an oil rig out in the gulf of mexico the seawiteh yes he appears to be under the impression that alistalr maelean the seawitck is in mortal danger he wants protection very modest in his demands as becomes a multimillionairea missile frigate or two some missile fighters standing by just in case in case of what thats the question he refused to say just said he had secret informationwhich in fact wouldnt surprise me the lord worths of this world have their secret agents everywhere youd better level with us mitchell said ive told you all i know the rest is surmise calling the state department means that there are foreign countries involved there are soviet naval vessels in the caribbean at present the state department smells an international incident or worse what do you want us to do not much just to find out lord worths intended movements for the next day or two mitchell said and if we refuse we have our licenses rescinded i am not a corrupt police chief if you refuse you can just forget that you ever saw me but i thought you might care enough about lord worth to help protect him against himself or the consequences of any rash action he might take i thought you might care even more about the reactions of his two daughters if anything were to happen to their father mitchell stood up jerked a thumb the door you know too damn much sea witch sit down a suddenchill asperity dont be foolish its my job to know too damn much but apart from lord worth and his family i thought you might have some little concern for your countrys welfare roomer said isnt that pitching it a little high very possibly but it is the policy of the state department the justice department and the fbi not to take any chances roomer said youre putting us in a damned awkward situation dont think i dont appreciate that i know tve put you on a spot and im sorry but im afraid youll have to resolve that particular dilemma yourselves mitchell said thanks for dropping this little problem in our laps what do you expect us to do go to lord worth ask him why hes been hollering to the state department ask him what hes up to and what his immediate plans are bentley smiled nothing so crude you have a reputationexcept of course in the police departmentof being in the street phrase a couple of slick operators the approach is up to you he stood keep that card and let me know when you find out anything how long would that take do you think roomer said a couple of hours a couple of hours even bentley seemed alto lair macleaa momentarily taken aback you dont then require an invitation to visit the baronial mansion no millionaires do we arent even thousandaires it makes a difference well thank you very much gentlemen goodnight after bentleys departure the two men sat for a couple of minutes in silence then mitchell said we play it both ways we play it every way roomer reached for a phone dialed a number and asked for lord worth he had to identify himself before he was put throughlord worth was a man who respected his privacy roomer said lord worth roomer mitchell and i have something to discuss with you sir which may or may not be of urgency and importance we would prefer not to discuss it over the phone he paused listened for a few moments murmured a thank you and hung up hell see us right away says to park the car in the lane side door study says the girls have gone upstairs think our friend bentley already has our phone tapped not worth his fbi salt if he hasnt five minutes later car parked in the lane they were making their way through the trees to sea witch the side door their progress was observed with interest by marina standing by the window inher upstairs bedroom she looked thoughtful for a moment then turned and unhurriedly left the room lord worth welcomed the two men in his study and securely closed the padded door behind them he swung open the doors of a concealed bar and poured three brandies there were times when one rang for jenkins and there were times when one didnt he lifted his glass health an unexpected pleasure its no pleasure for us roomer said gloomay then you havent come to ask me for my daughters hands in marriage no sir mitchell said no such luck john here is better at explaining these things what things weve just had a visit from a senior fbi agent roomer handed over bentleys card theres a number on the back that were to ring when weve extracted some information from you how very interesting there was a long pause then lord worth looked at each man in turn what kind of information in bentleys words you have been making loud noises to the state department according to them you seem to think that the seawitch alisftalr mactean is under threat they want to know where you got this secret information and what your proposed movements are why didnt the fbi come directly to me because you wouldnt have told them any more than you told the state department if that is to say youd even let them over the threshold of your house but they knowbentley told us thisthat we come across here now and again so i suppose they figured youd be less off your guard with us so bentley figures that youd craftily wring some careless talk from me without my being aware that i was talking carelessly something like that but doesnt this put you in a somewhat invidious position not really but youre supposed to uphold the law no yes mitchell spoke with some feeling but not organized law or have you forgotten lord worth that were a couple of excops because we wouldnt go along with your socalled organized law our only responsibility is to our clients tm not your client no would you like me to be your client roomer said what on earth for its never something for nothing in this world john services have to be rewarded sea witch failure of a mission mitchell was on his feet nice of you to see us lord worth i apologize lord worth sounded genuinely contrite tm afraid i rather stepped out of line there he paused ruminatively then smiled just trying to recall when last i apologized to anybody i seem to have a short memory bjess my lovely daughters information for our friends of the fbi first i received my information in context of several anonymous threatstelephone callson the lives of my daughters a doublebarreled threat if you will against the girls if i didnt stop the flow of oil as they pointed out i cant hide them forever and theres nothing one can do against a snipers bulletand if i were too difficult theyd have the seawitch blown out of the water as for my future movements im going out to the seawitch tomorrow afternoon and will remain there for twentyfour hours perhaps fortyeight roomer said any truth in either of those two statements dont be preposterous of course not i am going out to the rigbut before dawn i dont want those beadyeyed bandits watching me from the undergrowth at my heliport as i take off you are referring to the fbi sir who else will that do for the moment splendidly they walked back to the lane in silence s allstair maelean roomer got in behind the wheel of the car mitchell beside him roomer said well well well well as you say well well well crafty old devil marinas voice came from the back crafty he may be but she broke off in a gasp as mitchell whirled hi his seat and roomer switched on his interior lights the barrel of mitchelfs was lined up between her eyes eyes at the moment wide with shock and fear mitchell said in a soft voice dont ever do that to me again next time it may be too late she licked her lips she was normally as highspirited and independent as she was beautiful but it is a rather disconcerting thing to look down the muzzle of a pistol for the first time in your life i was just going to say that he may be crafty but hes neither old nor a devil will you please put that gun away you dont point guns at people you love mitchelts gun disappeared he said you shouldnt fall in love with crazy young fools or spies roomer was looking at melinda what are you two doing here melinda was more composed than her sister after all she hadnt had to look down the barrel of a pistol she said and you john roomer are a crafty young devil youre just stalling for time which was quite true seawitch whats that supposed to mean it means youre thinking furiously of the answer to the same question were about to ask you what are you two doing here thats none of your business roomers normally softspoken voice was unaccustomedly and deliberately harsh there was a silence from the back seat both girls realizing that there was more to the men than they had thought and the gap between their social and professional lives wider than they had thought mitchell sighed lets cool it john an ungrateful child is sharper than a serpents tooth jesus roomer shook his head you can say that again he hadnt the faintest idea what mitchell was talking about mitchell said why dont you go to your father and ask him im sure hell tell you along with the roughest chewingout youve ever had for interfering in his private business he got out opened the rear door waited until the sisters got out closed the rear door said goodnight and returned to his seat leaving the girls standing uncertainly at the side of the road roomer drove off he said very masterful though i didnt like our doing it god knows they meant no harm in any case it may stand us in good stead in the future itll stand us in even better stead if we get alistaftr maclean to the phone booth right around the corner as soon as we can they reached the booth in fifteen seconds and one minute later mitchell emerged from it as he took his seat roomer said what was all that about sorry private matter mitchell handed roomer a piece of paper roomer switched on the overhead light on the paper mitchell had scrawled this car bugged roomer said okay by me they drove home in sitence standing in his carport roomer said what makes you think my cars bugged nothing how far do you trust bentley you know how far but heor one of his menwouldnt have had time five seconds isnt a long time thats all the tune it takes to attach a magnetic clamp they searched the car then mitchelts both were clean in mitchells kitchen roomer said your phone call the old boy of course i got to him before the girls did told him what had happened and that he was to tell them hed received threats against their lives that he knew the source that he didnt trust the local law and so had sent for us to deal with the matter caught on at once also to give them hell for interfering roomer said hell convince them more importantly did he convince you no he thinks fast on his feet and lies even ft seawtteh faster he wanted to find out how seriously he would be taken in the case of a real emergency he now has the preliminary evidence that he is being taken seriously you have to hand it to himas devious as they come i suppose we tell bentley exactly what he told us to tell him what else do you believe what he told us that he has his own private intelligence corps i wouldnt question it for a moment that hes going out to the seawitch i believe that too im not so sure about his timing though were to tell bentley that hes leaving in the afternoon he told us hes leaving about dawn if he can lie to bentley he can lie to us i dont know why he should think it necessary to lie to us probably just his second nature i think hes going to leave much sooner than that roomer said me too im afraid if i intended to be up at dawns early light id be in bed by now or heading that way he showed no sign of going to bed so i conclude he has no intention of going to bed because it wouldnt be worth his while he paused so a double stakeout i thought so up by lord worths house and down by his heliport you for the heliport me for the tail job what else mitchell was possessed of phenomenal nightsight except on the very blackest of nights he could drive without any lights at all alistair maclean til hole up behind the west spinney you know it i know it how about you feeding the story to bentley while i make a couple of thermoses of coffee and some sandwiches fine roomer reached for the phone then paused listen why are we doing all this we dont owe the fbi anything we have no authority from anyone to do anything you said it yourself we and organized law walk in different directions i dont feel im under any obligation to save my country from a nonexistent threat weve got no client no commission no prospect of fees why should we care if lord worth sticks his head into a noose mitchell paused in slicing bread as far as your last question is concerned why dont you call up melinda and ask her roomer gave him a long quizzical look sighed and reached for the telephone ss chapter coffield had been wrong in his guess lord worth was possessed of no private arsenal but the united states armed services were and in their dozens at that the two breakins were accomplished with the professional expertise born of a long and arduous practice that precluded any possibility of mistakes the targets in both cases were government arsenals one army and one naval both naturally were manned by roundtheclock guards none of whom was killed or even injured if one were to disregard the cranial contusionsand those were fewcaused by sandbagging and ahstair maclean sapping lord worth had been very explicit on the use of minimal violence giuseppe palermo who looked and dressed like a successful wall street broker had the more difficult task of the two although as a man who held the mafia in tolerant contempt he regarded the exercise as almost childishly easy accompanied by nine almost equally respectable mensartorially respectable that isthree of whom were dressed as army majors he arrived at the florida arms depot at fifteen minutes to midnight the six young guards none of whom had even seen or heard a shot fired in anger were at their drowsiest and expecting nothing but their midnight reliefs only two were really fully awakethe other four had dozed awayand those two responding to a heavy and peremptory hammering on the main entrance door were disturbed not to say highly alarmed by the appearance of three army officers who announced that they were making a snap inspection to test security and alertness five minutes later all six were bound and gaggedtwo of them unconcious and due to wake up with very sore heads because of their misguided attempts to put up a show of resistanceand safely locked up in one of the many socalled secure rooms in the depot during this period and the next twenty minutes one of palermos men an electronics expert called jamieson made a thorough search for all the external alarm signals to both the police and bo seawitch nearest military hq he either bypassed or disconnected them all it was when he was engaged in this that the relief guards almost as drowsy as those whom they had been expecting to find made their appearance and were highly disconcerted to find themselves looking at the muzzles of three machine carbines within minutes securely bound but not gagged they had joined the previous guards whose gags were now removed they could now shout until doomsday as the nearest habitation was more than a mile away the temporary gagging of the first six guards had been merely for the purpose of preventing their warning off their reliefs palermo now had almost eight hours before the breakin could be discovered he sent one of his men watkins to bring round to the front the concealed minibus in which they had arrived all of them watkins excepted changed from their conservative clothing and military uniforms into rough workclothes which resulted in rather remarkable changes in their appearance and character while they were doing this watkins went to the depot garage picked a surprisingly ineffectual lock selected a twoton truck hotwired the ignitionthe keys were understandably missingand drove out to the already open main loading doors of the depot palermo had brought along with him one by alistair maelean the name of jacobson who between sojourns in various penitentiaries had developed to a remarkable degree the fine art of opening any type of lock combination or otherwise fortunately his services were not needed for nobody curiously enough had taken the trouble to conceal some score of keys hanging on the wall in the main office in less than half an hour palermo and his men had loaded aboard the truckchosen because it was a coveredvan typea staggering variety of weaponry ranging from bazookas to machine pistols together with sufficient ammunition for a battalion and a considerable amount of high explosives then they relocked the doors and took the keys with themwhen the next relief arrived at eight in the morning it would take them that much longer to discover what had actually happened after that they locked the loading and main entrance doors watkins drove the minibus with its load of discarded clothes back to its place of concealment returned to the truck and drove off the other nine sat or lay in varying degrees of discomfort among the weaponry in the back it was as well for them that it was only twenty minutes drive to lord worths private isolated and deserted heliportdeserted that is except for two helicopters their pilots and copilots the truck using only its sidelights came seawitch through the gates of the heliport and drew up alongside one of the helicopters discreet portable loading lights were switched on casting hardly more than a dull glow but sufficient for a man only eighty yards away and equipped with a pair of night glasses to distinguish clearly what was going on and roomer prone in the spinney with the binoculars to his eyes was only eighty yards away no attempt had been made to wrap or in any way to disguise the nature of the cargo it took only twenty minutes to unload the truck and stow its contents away in the helicopter under the watchful eye of a pilot with a keen regard for weight distribution palermo and his men with the exception of watkins boarded the other helicopter and sat back to await promised reinforcements the pilot of this helicopter had already as was customary radiofiled his flight plan to the nearest airport accurately giving his destination as the seawitch to have done otherwise would have been foolish indeed the radar tracking systems along the gulf states are as efficient as any in the world and any course deviation from a falsely declared destination would have meant that in very short order two highly suspicious pilots in supersonic jets would be flying alongside and asking some very unpleasant questions watkins drove the truck back to the garage jewired the ignition locked the door retrieved the minibus and left before dawn all his friends clothes would have been returned to their apartments and the minibus which had of course been stolen to its parking lot roomer was getting bored and his elbows were becoming sore since the minibus had driven away some half hour ago he had remained in the same prone position his night glasses seldom far from his eyes his sandwiches were gone as was all his coffee and he would have given much for a cigarette but decided it would be unwise clearly those aboard the helicopters were waiting for something and that something could only be the arrival of lord worth he heard the sound of an approaching engine and saw another vehicle with only sidelights on turn through the gateway it was another minibus whoever was inside was not the man he was waiting for he knew lord worth was not much given to traveling in minibuses the vehicle drew up alongside the passenger helicopter and its passengers disembarked and climbed aboard the helicooter roomer counted twelve in all the last was just disappearing inside the helicopter when another vehicle arrived this one didnt pass through the gateway it swept through it with only parking lights on a rolls royce lord worth for a certainty as if to redouble his certainty there caine to his ears the soft seawftch swish of tires on the grass he twisted round to see a car both lights and engine off coasting to a soundless stop beside his own over here roomer called softly mitchell joined him and together they watched the whiteclad figure of lord worth leave the rolls and mount the steps to the helicopter i guess that completes the payload for the night the payload being there are twentyone other passengers aboard that machine i cant swear to it but instinct tells me they are not honest upright citizens they say that every multimillionaire has his own private army i think ive just seen one of lord worths platoons filing by the second choppers not involved it sure is its the star of the showloaded to the gunwales with armament that s not a crime in itself could be part of lord worths private collection hes got one of the biggest in the country private citizens arent allowed to have bazookas machine guns and high explosives in their collections he borrowed them you think yeah without payment or receipt the nearest government arsenal id say so theyre still sitting there maybe theyre waiting a preset time before takeoff might be some all stair maelean time lets go to one of the cars and radio the law the nearest army command post is seven miles from here right the two men were on their feet and had taken only two steps toward the cars when almost simultaneously the engines of both helicopters started up with their usual clattering roar seconds later both machines lifted off mitchell said well it was a thought was is right look at em go honest godfearing citizens with all their navigational lights on thats in case someone bumps into them mitchell said we could call up the nearest air force base and have them forced down on what grounds stolen government property no evidence just our sayso theyll find out lord worth is aboard whos going to take the word of a couple of busted cops against his no one a sobering thought ever felt like a pariah like now i feel goddamned helpless well lets go and find some evidence wheres the nearest arsenal from here about a mile from the command post i know where why dont they keep their damned arsenals inside the command posts sea witch because ammunition can and does blow up how would you like to be sitting in a crowded barracks when an ammo dump blew up next door roomer straightened from the keyhole of the main door of the arms depot and reluctantly pocketed the very large set of keys which any illdisposed law officer could have jailed him for carrying i thought i could open any door with this bunch but not this one give you one guess where the keys are now probably sailing down from a chopper into the gulf right those loading doors have the same lock besides that nothing but barred windows you dont have a hacksaw on you do you mike i will next time he shone his flashlight through one of the barred windows all he could see was his own reflection he took out his pistol and holding it by the barrel struck the heavy butt several times against the glass without any noticeable effecthardly surprising considering that the window lay several inches beyond the bars and the force of the blows was minimal roomer said what are you trying to do mitchell was patient break the glass breaking the glass wont help you get inside alistuir maclean itll help me see and maybe hear i wonder if thats just plate glass or armored stuff how should i know well well find out if its armored the bullet will ricochet get down both men crouched and mitchell fired one shot at an upward angle the bullet did not ricochet it passed through leaving a jagged hole with radiating cracks mitchell began chipping away round the hole but desisted when roomer appeared with a heavy car j ackhandle a few powerful blows and roomer had a hole almost a foot in diameter mitchell shone his flash through this an office lined with filing cabinets and an open door beyond he put his ear as close to the hole as possible and he heard it at once the faint but unmistakable sound of metal clanging against metal and the shouting of unmistakably hoarse voices mitchell withdrew his head and nodded to roomer who leaned forward and listened in turn roomer straightened and said there are a lot of frustrated people in there about a mile beyond the entrance to the army command post they stopped by a roadside telephone booth mitchell telephoned the army post told them the state of defenses at their arsenal building would bear investigation and that it would be advisable for them to bring along a duplicate set of keys for the main door when asked who was speaking he hung up and returned to roomers car sea witch too late to call in the air force now i suppose too late theyll be well out over extraterritorial waters by now theres no state of war not yet he sighed why oh why didnt i have an infrared movie camera tonight over in mississippi condes task of breaking into the naval depot there turned out to be ridiculously easy he had with him only six men although he had sixteen more waiting in reserve aboard the foot vessel roomer which was tied up dockside less than thirty feet from the arsenal those men had already effectively neutralized the three armed guards who patrolled the dock area at night the arsenal was guarded by only two retired naval petty officers who regarded their job not only as a sinecure but downright nonsense for who in his right mind would want to steal depth charges and naval guns it was their invariable custom to prepare themselves for sleep immediately upon arrival and asleep they soundly were when conde and his men entered through the door they hadnt even bothered to lock they used two forklift trucks to trundle depth charges light dualpurpose antiaircraft guns and a sufficiency of shells down to the dockside then used one of the scores of cranes that lined the dockside to lower the stolen equipment into the hold of the roamer which was then battened down clearing customs was the merest formal alistatr maclean ity the customs official had seen the roamer come and go so many times that they had long ago lost count besides no one was going to have the temerity to inspect the oceangoing property of one of the very richest men in the world the roamer was lord worths seismological survey vessel at its base not far from havana a small conventionally powered and russianbuilt submarine slipped its moorings and quietly put out to sea the hastily assembled but nonetheless handpicked crew was informed that they were on a training cruise designed to test the seagoing readiness of castros tiny fleet not a man aboard believed a word of this meanwhile cronkite had not been idle unlike the others he had no need to break into any place to obtain explosives he had merely to use his own key as the worlds top expert in capping blazing gushers he had access to an unlimited number and great variety of explosives he made a selection of those and had them trucked down to galveston from houston where he lived apart from the fact that houston was the oilrig center of the south the nature of cronkites business made it essential for him to live within easy reach of an airport with international connections as the truck was on its way another seismo o seawiteh logical vessel a converted coast guard cutter was also closing in on galveston without explaining his reasons for needing the vessel cronkite had obtained it through the good offices of durant who had represented the galvestonarea companies at the meeting of the ten at lake tahoe the cutter which went by the name of tiburon was normally based at freeport and cronkite could quite easily have taken the shipment there but this would not have suited his purpose the tanker crusader was unloading at galveston and the crusader was one of the three tankers that plied regularly between the seawitch and the gulf ports the tiburon and cronkite arrived almost simultaneously sometime after midnight mulhooney the tiburorfs skipper eased his ship into a berth conveniently close to the crusader mulhooney was not the regular captain of the tiburon that gentleman had been so overcome by the sight of two thousand dollars in cash that he had fallen ill and would remain so for a few days cronkite had recommended his friend mulhooney cronkite didnt immediately go aboard the tiburon instead he chatted with a nightduty dock inspector who watched with an idle eye as what were obviously explosives were transferred to the tiburon the two men had known each other for years apart from observing that someone out in the gulf must have been careless with matches again the port official had maclean no further pertinent comment to make in response to idle questioning cronkite learned that the crusader had finished offloading its cargo and would be sailing in approximately one hour he boarded the tiburon greeted mulhooney and went straight to the crews mess seated among the others at this early hour were three divers already fully clad in wetsuits he gave brief instructions and the three men went on deck under cover of the superstructure and on the side of the ship remote from the dock the three men donned scuba gear went down a rope ladder and slid quietly into the water six objects radiodetonated magnetic mines equipped with metallic clamps were lowered to them they were so constructed as to have a very slight negative buoyancy which made them easy to tow under water in the predawn darkness the hulls of the vessels cast so heavy a shadow from the powerful shorelights that the men could have swum unobserved on the surface but cronkite was not much given to taking chances the mines were attached along the stern half of the crusaders hull thirty feet apart and at a depth of about ten feet five minutes after their departure the scuba divers were back after a further five minutes the tiburon put out to sea despite his nearlegendary reputation for ruthlessness cronkite had not lost touch with humanity to say that he was possessed of an innate seawitch kindliness would have been a distortion of the truth for he was above all an uncompromising and singleminded realist but one with no innate killer instinct nonetheless there were two things that would at that moment have given him considerable satisfaction the first of those was that he would have preferred to have the crusader at sea before pressing the sheathed button before him on the bridge he had no wish that innocent lives should be lost in galveston but it was a chance that he had to take limpet mines as the italian divers had proved at alexandria in world war iiand this to the great distress of the royal navy could be devastating effective against moored vessels but what might happen to highbuoyancy limpets when a ship got under way and worked up to maximum speed was impossible to forecast as there was no known case of a vessel under way having been destroyed by limpet mines it was at least possible that water pressure on a ship under way might well overcome the tenuous magnetic hold of the limpets and tear them free the second temptation was to board the helicopter on the tiburorfs after helipadmany such vessels carried helicopters for the purpose of having them drop patterned explosives on the seabed to register on the seismological computerand have a close look at what would be the ensuing havoc a temptation he immediately regarded as pure selfindulgence alistair maclean he put both thoughts from his mind eight miles out from galveston he unscrewed the covered switch and leaned firmly on the button beneath the immediate results were wholly unspectacular and cronkite feared that they might be out of radio range but in the port area in galveston the results were highly spectacular six shattering explosions occurred almost simultaneously and within twenty seconds the crusader her stern section torn in half developed a marked list to starboard as thousands of tons of water poured through the ruptured side another twenty seconds later the distant rumble of the explosions reached the ears of listeners on the tiburon cronkite and mulhooney alone on the bridgethe ship was on automatic pilot looked at each other with grim satisfaction mulhooney an irishman with a true irishmans sense of occasion produced an opened bottle of champagne and poured two brimming glassfuls cronkite who normally detested the stuff consumed his drink with considerable relish and set his glass down it was then that the crusader caught fire its gasoline tanks true were empty but its engine diesel fuel tanks were almost completely topped up in normal circumstances ignited diesel does not explode but burns with a ferocious intensity within seconds the smokeveined flames had risen to a height of two hundred feet the height increasing with each moment until the seawitch whole city was bathed in a crimson glow a phenomenon which the citizens of galveston had never seen before and would almost certainly never see again even aboard the tiburon the spectacle had an aweinspiring and unearthly quality about it then as suddenly as it had begun the fire stopped as the crusader turned completely over on its side the harbor waters quenching the flames into hissing extinction some patches of floating oil still flickered feebly across the harbor but that was all that there was to it clearly lord worth was going to require a new tanker a requirement that presented quite a problem in this area of a gross oversupply of tankers any one of scores of laidup supertankers could be had just through exercising enough strength to lift a telephone but ton tankers though not a dying breed were a dwindling breed principally because the main shipyards throughout the world had stopped producing them had is the operative word keels of that size and even smaller were now being hastily laid down but would not be in full operation for a year or two to come the reason was perfectly simple supertankers on the arabian gulfeurope run had to make the long and prohibitively expensive circuit around the cape of good hope because the newly reopened suez canal could not accommodate their immense draft a problem that presented no difficulties to altstair maclean smaller tankers it was said and probably with more than a grain of truth that the notoriously wily greek shipowners had established a corner on this particular market the dawn was in the sky at that precise moment there were scenes of considerable activity around and aboard the seawitch the panamanianregistered tanker torbetto was just finishing offloading the contents of the seawitcws massive floating conical oil tank as they were doing so two helicopters appeared over the northeastern horizon both were very large sikorsky machines which had been bought by the thrifty lord worth for the traditional song not because they were obsolete but because they were two of the scores that had become redundant since the end of the vietnam war and the armed forces had been only too anxious to get rid of them civilian demand for exgunships is not high the first of those to land on the helipad debarked twentytwo men led by lord worth and giuseppe palermo the other twenty who from their appearance were not much given to caring for widows and orphans all carried with them the impeccable credentials of oil experts of one type or another that they were experts was beyond question what was equally beyond question was that none of them would have recognized a barrel of oil if he had fallen into it they were experts in diving underwater demolition the handling of high explosives and the accurate firing of a variety of unpleasant weapons the second helicopter arrived immediately after the first had taken off except for the pilot and copilot it carried no other human cargo what it did carry was the immense and varied quantity of highly offensive weapons from the florida arsenal the loss of which had not yet been reported in the newspapers the oilrig crew watched the arrival of gunmen and weapons with an oddly dispassionate curiosity they were men to whom the unusual was familiar the odd the incongruous the inexplicable part and parcel of their daily lives oilrig crews are a race apart and lord worths men formed a very special subdivision of that race lord worth called them all together told of the threat to the seawitch and the defensive measures he was undertaking measures which were thoroughly approved of by the crew who had as much regard for their own skins as had the rest of mankind lord worth finished by saying that he knew he had no need to swear them to secrecy in this the noble lord was perfectly correct though they were all experienced hardly a man aboard had not at one time or another had a close and painful acquaintanceship with the law there were exconvicts among them there were escaped convicts among them there were those allstalr maclean whom the law was very anxious to interview and there were parolees who had broken their parole there could be no safer hideouts for those men than the seawitch and lord worths privately owned motel where they put up during then offduty spells no law officer in his sane mind was going to question the towering respectability and integrity of one of the most powerful oil barons in the world and by inevitable implication this attitude of mind extended to those in his employ in other words lord worth through the invaluable intermediacy of commander larsen picked his men with extreme care accommodation for the newly arrived men and storage for the weaponry presented no problem like many jackups drill ships and submersibles the seawitch had two complete sets of accommodation and messesone for westerners the other for orientals there were at that time no orientals aboard lord worth commander larsen and palermo held their own private council of war in the luxuriously equipped sitting room which lord worth kept permanently reserved for himself they agreed on everything they agreed that cronkites campaign against them would be distinguished by a noticeable lack of subtlety outright violence was the only course open to him once the oil was offloaded ashore there was nothing cronkite could do about it he would seawitch not attempt to attack and sink a loaded tanker just as he would not attempt to destroy their huge floating storage tank either method would cause a massive oil slick comparable to or probably exceeding the great oil slick caused by the torrey canyon disaster off the southwest coast of england some years previously the ensuing international uproar would be bound to uncover something and if cronkite were implicated he would undoubtedly implicate the major oil companieswho wouldnt like that at all and that there would be a massive investigation was inevitable ecology and pollution were still the watchwords of the day cronkite could attack the flexible oil pipe that connected the rig with the tank but the three men agreed that this could be taken care of after conde and the roamer arrived and its cargo had been hoisted aboard the roamer would maintain a constant dayandnight patrol between the rig and the tank the seawitch was wellequipped with sensory devices apart from those which controlled the tensioning anchor cables a radar scanner was in constant operation atop the derrick and sonar devices were attached to each of the three giant legs some twenty feet under water the radar could detect any hostile approach from air or sea and the dualpurpose antiaircraft guns aboard and installed could take care of those in the highly unlikely event of an underwater attack sonar allstair maclean would locate the source and a suitably placed depth charge from the roamer would attend to that lord worth of course was unaware that at that very moment another craft was moving out at high speed to join cronkite on the tiburon it was a standard and wellestablished design irreverently known as the pushpull in which water was ducted in through a tube forward under the hull and forced out under pressure at the rear it had no propeller and had been designed primarily for work close inshore or in swamps where there was always the danger of the propeller being fouled the only difference between this vesselthe starlightand others was that it was equipped with a bank of storage batteries and could be electrically powered sonar could detect and accurately pinpoint a ships engines and propeller vibrations it was virtually helpless against an electric pushpull lord worth and the others considered the possibility of a direct attack on the seawitch because of her high degree of compartmentalization and her great positive buoyancy nothing short of an atom bomb was capable of disposing of something as large as a football field certainly no conventional weapon could the attack when it came would be localized the drilling derrick was an obvious target but how cronkite could approach it unseen could not be imagined but lord worth was certain of one bo seawitch thing when the attack came it would be leveled against the seawitch the next half hour was to prove twice just how wrong lord worth could be the first intimations of disaster came as lord worth was watching the fully laden torbello just disappearing over the northern horizon the crusader he knew was due alongside the tank late that afternoon larsen his face one huge scowl of fury silently handed lord worth a signal just received in the radio office lord worth read it and his subsequent language would have disbarred him forever from a seat in the house of lords the message told in cruelly unsparing fashion of the spectacular end of the crusader hi galveston both men hurried to the radio room larsen contacted the jupiter their third tanker then offloading at an obscure louisiana port told its captain the unhappy fate of the crusader and warned him to have every man on board on constant lookout until they had cleared harbor lord worth personally called the chief of police in galveston identified himself and demanded more details of the sinking of the crusader these he duly received and none of them made him any happier on inspiration he asked if there had been a man called john cronkite or a vessel belonging to a man of that name in the vicinity at the time he was told to hang on while a check was made with customs two minutes alistair maclean later he was told yes there had been a john cronkite aboard a vessel called the tiburon which had been moored directly aft of the crusader it was not known whether cronkite was the owner or not the tiburon had sailed half an hour before the crusader blew up lord worth peremptorily demanded that the tiburon be apprehended and returned to port and that cronkite be arrested the police chief pointed out that international law prohibited the arrest of vessels on the high seas except in time of war and as for cronkite there wasnt a shred of evidence to connect him with the sinking of the crusader lord worth then asked if he would trace the owner of the tiburon this the police chief promised to do but warned that there might be a considerable delay there were many registers to be consulted at that moment the cuban submarine steaming on the surface at full speed was in the vicinity of key west and heading directly for the seawitch at almost the same time a missilearmed russian destroyer slipped its moorings in havana and set off in apparent pursuit of the cuban submarine and very shortly after that a destroyer departed its home base in venezuela the roamer lord worths survey vessel seawitch under the command of conde was now halfway to its destination the starlight under the command of easton was just moving away from the tiburon which was lying stopped in the water men on slings had already painted out the ships name and with the aid of cardboard stencils were painting in a new namegeorgia cronkite had no wish that any vessel with whom they might make contact could radio for confirmation of the existence of a cutter called tiburon from aft there came the unmistakable racket of a helicopter engine starting up then the machine took off circled and headed southeast not on its usual patternbombing circuit but to locate and radio back to the tiburon the location and course of the torbello if and when it found it within minutes the tiburon was on its way again heading in approximately the same direction as the helicopter chapter worth enjoying a very early morning cup of tea was in his living room with larsen and palermo when the radio operator knocked and entered a message sheet in his hand he handed it to lord worth and said for you sir but its hi some sort of code do you have a code book no need lord worth smiled with some selfsatisfaction his first smile of any kind for quite some tune i invented this code myself he tapped his head heres my code book the operator left the other two watched in mild anticipation as lord worth began to de fti sea witch code the anticipation turned into apprehension as the smile disappeared from lord worths face and the apprehension gave way hi turn to deep concern as reddishpurple spots the size of pennies touched either cheekbone he laid down the message sheet took a deep breath then proceeded to give a repeat performancethough this time more deeply felt more impassioned of the unparliamentary language he had used at the news of the loss of the crusader after some time he desisted less because he had nothing fresh to say than from sheer loss of breath larsen had more wit than to ask lord worth ft something were the matter instead he said in a quiet voice suppose you tell us lord worth lord worth with no little effort composed himself and said it seems that cor he broke off and corrected himself it was one of his many axioms that the right hand shouldnt know what the left hand doeth i was informedall too reliably as it now appears that a couple of countries hostile to us might well be prepared to use naval force against us one it appears is already prepared to do so a destroyer has just cleared its venezuelan home port and is heading in what is approximately our direction they wouldnt dare palermo said when people are power and moneymad theyll stop at nothing it apparently never oc alintalr maclean curred to lord worth that his description of people applied in excelsis to himself whos the other power said larsen the soviet union is it now larsen seemed quite unmoved i dont know if i like the sound of that we could do without them lord worth was back on balance again he flipped out a notebook and consulted it i think til have a talk with washington his hand was just reaching out for the phone when it rang he lifted the instrument at the same time turning the switch that cut the incoming call into the bulkhead speaker worth a vaguely disembodied voice came through the speaker you know who i am disembodied or not the voice was known to worth corral yes tve checked my contact sir tm afraid our guesses were only too accurate both x and y are willing to commit themselves to naval support i know one of them has just moved out and appears to be heading in our general direction which one the one to the south any talk of air commitment none that ive heard sir but i dont have to tell you that that doesnt rule out its use seawitch let me know if there is any more good news naturally goodbye sir lord worth replaced the instrument then lifted it again i want a number in washington can you hold a moment sir why theres another code message coming through looks like the same code as the last one sir i shouldnt be surprised lord worths tone was somber bring it across as soon as possible he replaced the phone pressed a button on the small console before him lifting the phone again as he did chambers chambers was his senior pilot sir your chopper refueled ready to go when you are sir may be any second now stand by your phone he replaced the receiver larsen said washington beckons sir i have the odd feeling that its about to there are things that one can achieve in person that one cant over the phone depends upon this next message if you go anything to be done in your absence therell be dualpurpose antiaircraft guns arriving aboard the roamer this afternoon secure them to the platform all stair jtfaelean to the north south east but not west as you wish we dont want to start blowing holes in our own oil tank theres that therell easo be mines three piles each halfway between a pair of legs an underwater explosion from a mine wouldnt damage the legs i shouldnt think so well just have to find out wont we keep in constant halfhourly touch with both the torbetto and the jupiter keep the radar and sonar stations constantly manned eternal vigilance if you will hell commander i dont have to tell you what to do he wrote some figures on a piece of paper if i do have to go contact this number in washington tell them that tm coming five hours or so this is the state department yes tell them that at least the under secretary must be there remind him tactfully of future campaign contributions then contact my aircraft pilot dawson tell him to be standing by with a filed flight plan for washington the radio operator knocked entered handed lord worth a message sheet and left lord worth hands steady and face now untroubled decoded the message reached for the phone and told chambers to get to the helicopter at once he said to the two men a russianbuilt cuban submarine is on its way from havana its seawltch being followed by a russian guidedmissile destroyer both are heading this way a visit to the state department or the pentagon would appear to be indicated larsen said there isnt too much we can do about guided missiles looks like there might be quite some activity hereabouts that makes five vessels arrowing in on usthree naval vessels the jupiter and the roomer larsen might have been even more concerned had he known that the number of vessels was seven not five but then larsen was not to know that the tiburon and the starlight were heading that way also lord worth rose well keep an eye on the shop back this evening sometime ill be in frequent radio contact lord worth was to fly four legs that day by helicopter to the mainland by his private boeing to washington the return flight to florida and the final leg by helicopter out to the seawitch on each of those four legs something very unpleasant was going to happenunpleasant for lord worth that is fortunately for lord worth he was not blessed with the alleged scottish second sightthe ability to look into the future the first of those unpleasantnesses happened when lord worth was en route to the mainland a large station wagon swept up to the alistair maclean front door of lord worths mansion carrying five rather large men who would have been difficult later to identify for au five wore stocking masks one of them carried what appeared to be a large coil of clothesline rope another a roll of adhesive tape all carried guns macpherson the elderly head gardener was taking his customary prework dawn patrol to see what damage the fauna had wreaked on his flora during the night when the men emerged from the station wagon even allowing for the fact that shock had temporarily paralyzed his vocal cords he never had a chance in just over a minute bound hand and foot and with his lips sealed with adhesive tape he had been dumped unceremoniously into a clump of bushes the leader of the group a man by the name of durand pressed the frontdoor bell durand a man who had a powerful affinity with banks and who was a threetime exconvict was by definition a man of dubious reputation a reputation confirmed by the fact that he was a close and longtime term associate of cronkite half a minute passed then he rang again by and by the door opened to reveal a robewrapped jenkins touslehaired and blinking the sleep from his eyesit was still very early in the morning his eyes stopped blinking and opened wide when he saw the pistol in durands hand durand touched the cylinder screwed onto the muzzle of ms gun as hooked a tv addict as the o sea witch next man jenkins recognized a silencer when he saw one you know what this is a fully awake jenkins nodded silently we dont want to harm anyone in the house especially no harm will come to you if you do what you are told doing what you are told includes not telling lies understood jenkins understood how many staff do you have here there was a noticeable quaver in jenkinss voice well theres meim the butler durand was patient you we can see two footmen a chauffeur a radio operator a secretary a cook and two housemaids theres a cleaning lady but she doesnt come until eight tape him durand said jenkinss lips were taped sorry about that but people can be silly at times take us to those eight bedrooms jenkins reluctantly led the way ten minutes later all eight of the staff were securely bound and silenced durand said and now the two young ladies jenkins led them to a door durand picked out three of his men and said softly the butler will take you to the other girl check what she packs and especially her purse durand followed by his men entered the room his gun in its concealed holster so as not to arouse too much alarm that the bed was occupied was beyond doubt although all that could ei alistalr maclean be seen was a mop of black hair on the pillow durand said in a conversational voice i think you better get up maam durand was not normally given to gentleness but he did not want a case of screaming hysterics on his hands a case of hysterics he did not have marina turned round in bed and looked at him with drowsy eyes the drowsiness did not last long the eyes opened wide either in fear or shock then returned to normal she reached for a robe arranged it strategically on the bed cover then sat bolt upright wrapping the robe round her who are you and what do you want her voice was not quite as steady as she might have wished well would you look at that now durand said admiringly youd think she was used to being kidnaped every morning of her life this is a kidnap tin afraid so durand sounded genuinely apologetic where are you taking me vacation little island hi the sun durand smiled you wont be needing any swimsuit though please get up and get dressed and if i refuse well dress you im not going to get dressed with you two watching me durand was soothing my friend will stand out in the corridor ill go into the bathroom sea witch there and leave the door open just a cracknot to watch you but to watch the window to make sure that you dont leave by it call me when youre ready and be quick about it she was quick about it she called him within three minutes blue blouse blue slacks and her hair combed durand nodded his approval pack a traveling bag enough for a few days he watched her while she packed she zipped the bag shut and picked up her purse im ready he took the purse from her undid the clasp and upended the contents on the bed from the jumble on the bed he selected a small pearlhandled pistol which he slipped into his pocket lets pack the purse again shall we marina did so her face flushed with mortification a somewhat similar scene had just taken place in melindas bedroom twentyfive minutes had elapsed since the arrival of durand and his men and their departure with the two girls no one had been hurt except in pride and the intruders had even been considerate to the extent of seating jenkins in a deep armchair in the front hall jenkins as he was now securely bound hand and foot did not appreciate this courtesy as much as he might have done about ten minutes after their departure lord worths helicopter touched down beside his boeing in the city airport there were no customs no clearance formalities lord worth had made it plain some years previously that he did not much care for that sort of thing and when lord worth made things plain they tended to remain that way it was during the second leg of this flight that the second unfortunate occurrence happened again lord worth was happily unaware of what was taking place the tiburons helicopter had located the torbello the pilot reported that he had sighted the vessel two minutes previously and gave her latitude and longitude as accurately as he could judge more importantly he gave her course as approximately degrees which was virtually on a collision course with the georgia they were approximately fortyfive miles apart cronkite gave his congratulations to the pilot and asked him to return to the georgia on the bridge of the georgia cronkite and mulhooney looked at each other with satisfaction between planning and execution there often exists an unbridgeable gap in this case however things appeared to be going exactly according to plan cronkite said to mulhooney time i think to change into more respectable clothes and dont forget to powder your nose sea witch mulhooney smiled and left the bridge cronkite paused only to give a few instructions to the helmsman then left the bridge also less than an hour later the torbello stood clear over the horizon the georgia headed straight for it then at about three miles distance made a thirtydegree alteration to starboard judged the timing to a nicety and came round in a wide sweeping turn to port two minutes later the georgia was on a parallel course to the torbello alongside its port quarterthe bridge of a tanker lies very far aftparalleling its course at the same speed and not more than thirty yards away cronkite moved out onto the wing of the georgias bridge and lifted his loudhailer coast guard please stop this is a request not an order we think your vessels in great danger your permission please to bring a trained research party aboard for the safety of your men and the ship dont break radio silence on any account captain thompson an honest sailor with no criminal propensities whatsoever used his own loudhailer whats wrong why is this boarding necessary its not a boarding i am making a request for your own good believe me id rather not be within five miles of you it is necessary id rather alistair maclean come aboard with my lieutenant and explain privately dont forget what happened to your sister ship the crusader in galveston harbor last night captain thompson clearly had not forgotten and was of course completely unaware that cronkite was the man responsible for what had happened to his sister ship a ringing of bells from the bridge was indication enough of that three minutes later the torbello lay stopped in the calm waters the georgia edged up alongside the torbello until its midships were just ahead of the bulk of the tankers superstructure at this point it was possible to step from the georgias deck straight onto the deck of the deepladen tanker which was what cronkite and mulhooney proceeded to do they paused there until they had made sure that the georgia was securely moored fore and aft to the tanker then climbed a series of companionways and ladders up to the bridge both men were quite unrecognizable cronkite had acquired a splendidly bushy black beard a neatly trimmed mustache and dark glasses and with his smartly tailored uniform and slightly rakish peaked cap looked the epitome of the competent and dashing coastguardcutter captain which he was not mulhooney was similarly disguised there was only captain thompson and an idle sea witch helmsman on the bridge cronkite shook the captains hand good morning sorry to disturb you when you are proceeding about your lawful business and all that but you may be glad we stopped you first where is your radio room captain thompson nodded to a door set in back of the bridge fd like my lieutenant to check on the radio silence this is imperative again captain thompson now feeling distinctly uneasy nodded cronkite looked at mulhooney go check dixon will you mulhooney passed through into the radio room closing the door behind him the radio operator looked up from his transceiver with an air of mild surprise sorry to disturb mulhooney sounded almost genial a remarkable feat for a man totally devoid of geniality im from the coast guard cutter alongside the captain told you to keep radio silence thats just what im doing made any radio calls since leaving the seawitch only the routine halfhourly oncourse ontime calls do they acknowledge those i have my reasons for asking mulhooney carefully refrained from saying what his reasons were no well just the usual roger and out business allstair maclean whats the callup frequency the operator pointed to the console preset mulhooney nodded and walked casually behind the operator just to make sure that the operator kept on maintaining radio silence mulhooney clipped him over the right ear with his pistol he then returned to the bridge where he found captain thompson in a state of considerable and understandable perturbation captain thompson a deep anxiety compounded by a selfdefensive disbelief said what youre telling me in effect is that the torbello is a floating time bomb a bomb certainly maybe lots of bombs not only possible but almost certain our sources of informationsorry fm not at liberty to divulge thoseare as nearly perfect as can be gods sake man no one would be so crazy as to cause a huge oil slick in the gulf cronkite said its your assumption not mine that were dealing with sane minds who but a crazy man would have endangered galveston by blowing up your sister tanker there the captain fell silent and pondered the question gloomily cronkite went on anyway its my intentionwith your consent of courseto search the engine room living accommodations and every storage space on the ship with the kind of search crew i have it shouldnt take more than half an hour seawitch what kind of preset time bomb do you think it might be i dont think its a time bombor bombs at all i think that the detonatoror detonators will be a certain radioactivated device that can be triggered by any nearby craft plane or helicopter but i dont think its fixing to happen till youre close to the us coast why so well have maximum pollution along the shores therell be a national holler against lord worth and the safety standards aboard ms ahrather superannuated tankers maybe resulting in closing down the seawitch or the seizing of any of worths tankers that might enter american territorial waters in addition to his many other specialized qualifications cronkite was a consummate liar okay if i call my men captain thompson nodded without any noticeable enthusiasm cronkite lifted the loudhailer and ordered the search party aboard they came immediately fourteen of them all of them wearing stocking masks all of them carrying machine pistols captain thompson stared at them in stupefaction then turned and stared some more at cronkite and mulhooney both of whom had pistols leveled at him cronkite may have been looking satisfied or even triumphant but such was the abundance of his ersatz facial foliage that it was impossible to tell allstalr maclean captain thompson in a stupefaction that was slowly turning into a slow burn said what the hell goes you can see what goes hijack a very popular pastime nowadays i agree that nobodys ever hijacked a tanker before but there always has to be a first time besides its not really something new piracy on the high seas theyve been at it for thousands of years dont try anything rash captain and please dont try to be a hero if you all behave no harm will come to you anyway what could you possibly do with fourteen submachine guns lined up against you within five minutes all the crew officers and men including the recovered radio operator but with one other exception were herded into the crews mess under armed guard nobody had even as much as contemplated offering resistance the exception was an unhappylooking duty engineer in the engine room there are few people who dont look slightly unhappy when staring at the muzzle of a schmeisser from a distance of five feet cronkite was on the bridge giving mulhooney his final instructions keep on sending the seawitch its halfhour ontime oncourse reports then report a minor breakdown in two or three hoursa fractured fuel line or something of the sortenough that would keep the torbello immobilized for a few seawitch hours youre due in galveston tonight and i need time and room to maneuver rather you need time and room to maneuver when it gets dark keep every navigational light extinguished in fact every light extinguished lets dont underestimate lord worth cronkite was speaking with an unaccustomed degree of bitterness doubtless recalling the day lord worth had taken him to the cleaners in court hes a very powerful man and its quite in the cards that he can have an airandsea search mounted for his missing tanker cronkite rejoined the georgia cast off and pulled away mulhooney too got under way but altered course ninety degrees to port so that he was heading southwest instead of northwest on the first half hour he sent the reassuring report to the seawitchon course on time cronkite waited for the starlight to join him then both vessels proceeded together in a generally southeasterly direction until they were about thirtyfive nautical miles from the seawitch safely over the horizon and out of reach of the seawitchs radar and sonar they stopped their engines and settled down to wait the big boeing had almost halved the distance between florida and washington lord worth in his luxurious stateroom immediately abaft the flight deck was making up for time lost during alistatr muiloan the previous night and blissfully unaware of the slings and arrows that were coming at him from all sides was soundly asleep mitchell had been unusually but perhaps not unexpectedly late in waking that morning he showered shaved and dressed while the coffee percolated all the time conscious of a peculiar and unaccustomed sense of unease he paced up and down the kitchen drinking his coffee then abruptly decided to put his unease at rest he lifted the phone and dialed lord worths mansion the other end rang rang again and kept on ringing mitchell replaced the receiver then tried again with the same result he finished his coffee went across to roomers house and let himself in with his passkey he went into the bedroom to find roomer still asleep he woke him up roomer regarded him with disfavor what do you mean by waking up a man in the middle of the night its not the middle of the night he pulled open the drapes and the bright summer sunlight flooded the room its broad daylight as you will be able to see when you open your eyes your house on fire or something then i wish it were something as trivial as that fm worried john i woke up feeling bugged by something and the feeling got worse and worse five minutes ago i called up lord worths house i tried twice there was no reply must seawiteh have been at least eight or ten people in that house but there was no reply what do you think youre supposed to be the man with the intuition get ready til go make some coffee long before the coffee was ready in fact less than ninety seconds later roomer was in the kitchen he had of course neither showered nor shaved but had had time to run a comb through his hair he was looking the same way the expressionless mitchell was feeling never mind the coffee roomer bore an almost savage expression on his face but mitchell knew that it wasnt directed at him lets get up to the house they took roomers car it was nearer mitchell said god were really bright hit us over the head often enough and maybejust maybewell begin to see the obvious he held on to his seat as roomer tires screeching rounded a blind corner easy boy easy too late to lock the stable now with what was a clearly conscious effort of will roomer slowed down he said yeah were real clever lord worth used a threat of the girls abduction as an excuse for his actions and you told him to offer the threat of the abduction as an excuse for our being there last night and it never occurred to either of our staggering intellects that their kidnaping would be both logical and inevitable worth wasnt o allstair macleaa exaggeratinghe has enemies and vicious enemies who are out to get him two trump cards and what trumps hes powerless now hell give away half his money to get them back just half hell use the other half to hunt those people down money can buy any cooperation in the world and the old boy has all the money in the world mitchell now seemed relaxed comfortable even calm he said but well get to them first wont we john roomer stirred uncomfortably in his seat as they swung into the mansions driveway he said tm just as sore as you are but i dont like it when you start talking that way you know that im expressing an intentionor at least a hope he smiled well see roomer stopped his car in a fashion that did little good to lord worths immaculately raked gravel the first thing that caught mitchells eye as he left the car was an odd movement by the side of the driveway hi a clump of bushes he took out his gun and went to investigate then put his gun away opened his clasp knife and sliced through macphersons bonds the head gardener after forty years in florida had never lost a trace of a very pronounced scottish accent an accent that tended to thicken according to the degree of mental stress he was undergoingon this occasion with the adhesive removed his o sea witch language was wholly indecipherablewhich in view of what he was almost certainly trying to say was probably just as well they went through the front doorway jenkins apparently taking his ease in a comfortable armchair greeted them with a baleful glare the glare was in no way intended for them jenkins was just in a baleful mood a mood scarcely bettered by mitchells swift and painful yanking away of the adhesive from his lips jenkins took a deep breath preparatory to lodging some form of protest but mitchell cut in before he could speak where does jim sleep jim was the radio operator jenkins stared at him in astonishment was this the way to greet a man who had been through a living hellsnatched one might almost say from the jaws of death where was the sympathy the condolence the anxious questioning mitchell put his hands on his shoulders and shook him violently are you deaf jims room jenkins looked at the grim face less than a foot from his own and decided against remonstrating in back first floor first right mitchell left so after a second or two did roomer jenkins called after him in a plaintive voice you arent leaving me too mr roomer roomer turned and said patiently tm going to the kitchen to get a nice sharp carver mr o all stair mitchell has taken the only knife we have between us jim robertson was young freshfaced and just out of college a graduate in electrical engineering in no hurry to proceed with his profession he sat on the bed massaging his now unbound wrists wincing slightly as the circulation began to return as tiers of knots durands henchmen had been nothing if not enthusiastic mitchell said how do you feel mad i dont blame you are you okay to operate your set im okay for anything if it means getting hold of those bastards thats the general idea did you get a good look at the kidnapers i can give you a general description he broke off and stared at mitchell kidnapers looks as though lord worths daughters have been abducted holy christ the assimilation of this news took some little time therell be all hell to pay for this it should cause a considerable flap do you know where marinas room is til show you her room showed all signs of a hasty and unpremeditated departure cupboard doors were open drawers the same and some spilled clothing lay on the floor mitchell was interested in seawiteh none of this he quickly riffled through drawers in the room until he found what he had hoped to findher states passport he opened it and it was valid he made a mental note that she had lied about her ageshe was two years older than she claimed to bereturned the passport and hurried down to the radio room with robertson who unlocked the door to let them in robertson looked questioningly at mitchell the county police chief his name is mcgarrity i dont want anyone else tell him youre speaking for lord worth that should work wonders then let me take over roomer entered while robertson was trying to make contact seven more of the staff all suitably immobilized makes nine in all ive left jenkins to cut them loose his hands are shaking so bad hell probably slice an artery or two but for me freeing elderly cooks and young housemaids is above and beyond the call of duty they must have been carrying a mile of rope mitchell said absently he was figuring out how much not to tell the police chief roomer nodded to the operator whos he trying to contact mcgarrity that hypocritical old brownnoser most people would regard that as a charitable description but he has his uses robertson looked up on the line mr mitchell that phone he made discreetly to re o alistair maeleu place his own but roomer took it from him and listened in chief mcgarrity speaking please listen very carefully this is extremely important and urgent and the biggest thing thats ever come your way are you alone yes im all alone mcgarritys tone held an odd mixture of suspicion and aroused interest nobody listening in no recorder goddam it no get to the point were speaking from lord worths house you know of him dont be a damned fool whos we my name is michael mitchell my partner is john roomer were licensed private investigators tve heard of you youre the guys who give the local law so much trouble td put it the other way around but thats beside the point what is to the point is that lord worths two daughters have been kidnaped merciful god in heaven there ensued what could fairly have been described as a stunned silence at the other end of the line roomer smiled sardonically and covered the mouthpiece cant you see the old phony grabbing his seat with his eyes popping and big signs saying promotion flashing in front of him sea wit eh kidnaped you said mcgarritys voice had suddenly developed a certain hoarseness kidnaped abducted snatched sure of this sure as can be the girls rooms have all the signs of hurried and unplanned departure nine of the staff were bound and gagged what would you conclude from that kidnap mcgarrity made it sound as if hed made the discovery all by himself can you put a block on all escape routes they havent taken the girls passports so that rules out international flights i hardly think the kidnapers would have taken any commercial domestic flight can you see lord worths daughters going through any airline terminal without being recognized id put a stop order and guard at every private airfield and helicopter pad in the southern part of the state and likewise at every port big and small in the same area mcgarrity sounded bemused befuddled thatd call for hundreds of policemen the tone of anguished protest was unmistakable mitchell sighed cupped the mouthpiece looked at roomer and said mans out of his depth can i call him lunkhead he removed his hand look chief mcgarrity i dont think you realize what youre sitting on were talking about the daughters of lord worth you could pick up your phone and get a thousand cops for alistali maeleani the asking you could call out the national guard if you wanted toim sure lord worth would pick up the tab for every cent of expenses good god man theres been nothing like this since the lindbergh kidnaping thats so thats so it wasnt difficult to visualize mcgarrity licking his lips descriptions not much help there im afraid they all wore stocking masks the leader wore gloves which may or may not indicate a criminal record all were big wellbuilt men and all wore dark business suits i dont have to give you a description of the girls i guess marina and melinda mcgarrity was a classic snob of awesome proportions who followed with avid interest the comings and goings of alleged society of the internationally famous and infamous hell no of course not theyre probably the most photographed pair in the state youll keep this under wraps tight as possible for the moment i will i will mcgarrity had his baby clutched close to his heart and nobody but nobody was going to take it away from him lord worth will have to be informed first of all til refer him to you you mean you havent told him yet mcgarrity could hardly believe his good fortune no tell him to take it easywell as easy as he scan itch can that is tell him tm taking complete and personal charge of the investigation ill do that chief roomer winced and screwed his eyes shut mcgarrity sounded positively brisk now about the local law i suppose ive got to call them in im not too happy about it they dont exactly like us what if they refuse to keep this under wraps in which case mcgarrity said ominously just put the person concerned directly on the line to me anyone else know about this yet of course not youre the only man with the power to authorize the closing of the escape routes naturally we contacted you first and you were perfectly right mr mitchell mcgarrity was warm and appreciative as well he might have been for he had a very shaky reelection coming up and the massive publicity the kidnaping was bound to generate would guarantee him a virtual shooin fu get the wheels turning at this end keep me posted of course chief mitchell hung up roomer looked at him admiringly you are an even bigger and stickier hypocrite than mcgarrity practice anyway we got what we wanted mitchells face was somber has it occurred to you that the birds may have flown roomer looked equally unhappy yeah but first things first lord worth next mitchell ill alistair mael ean nodded til pass this one up they say that under provocation he has a rich command of the english language not at all aristocratic td be better employed interviewing the staff til ply them with strong drink to help them overcome the rigors of their ordeal and to loosen their tongueslord worths reserve dom perignon for choiceand see what i can get out of them i dont expect much ah i can do is ask them about descriptions and voices and whether or not they touched anything that might give us fingerprints not that that will help if their prints arent on file the brandy bit sounds the best part of your program ask jenkins to bring a large one he looked at robertsontwo large ones roomer was at the door when he turned do you know what happened in ancient times to the bearers of bad news i know they got their heads cut off hell probably blame us for carelessness and lack of foresightand hell be right too even though hes just as guilty as we are roomer left get me lord worth jim i would if i knew where he was he was here last night when i left hes on the seawitch robertson raised an eyebrow lowered it said nothing and turned his attention to the switch seawitch board he raised the seawitch in fifteen seconds mitchell took the phone lord worth please hold on another voice came on a rasping gravelly voice not as friendly whatdyou want lord worth please how do you know hes here how do iwhat does that matter may i speak to him look mister tm here to protect lord worths privacy we get far too many oddball calls from oddball characters how did you know he was here because he told me when last night about midnight whats your name mitchell michael mitchell mitchell larsens tone changed why didnt you say so in the first place because i didnt expect a gestapo third degree thats why you must be commander larsen thats me not very civil are you ive got a job to do lord worth hes not here allstair maclean he wouldnt lie to me mitchell thought it impolitic to add that hed actually seen lord worth take off he didnt lie to you he was here he left hours ago for washington mitchell was silent for a few moments while he considered any number where he can be reached yes why i didnt ask you why hed gone to washington its an urgent private and personal matter from what ive heard of you from lord worth and thats quite a bit youd react in exactly the same way give me the number and til call back and fill you in just as soon as lord worth gives me clearance your word on that mitchell gave his promise and larsen gave him the number mitchell replaced the receiver he said to robertson lord worth has left the seawitch and gone to washington he does get around in his boeing i presume i didnt ask i took that for granted do you think you can reach him on the plane robertson didnt look encouraging when did he leave the seawitch i dont know should have asked i suppose hours ago larsen said seawitch robertson looked even more discouraged i wouldnt hold out any hope mr mitchell with this set i can reach out a couple of thousand miles lord worths boeing can reach any airport not quite as far away just as the airport can reach him but the receiving equipment aboard the boeing hasnt been modified to receive longrange transmissions from this set which is very specialized shortrange only five hundred miles if that the boeing is bound to be well out of range by now freak weather conditions mighty rare mr mitchell try anyway jim he tried and kept on trying for five minutes during which it became steadily more apparent that lord worth would have at least a bit more time before being set up for his coronary at the end of five minutes robertson shrugged his shoulders and looked up at mitchell thanks for the try jim he gave robertson a piece of paper with a number on it washington think you can reach that that i can guarantee try for it in half an hour ask for lord worth emphasize the urgency if you dont contact him try again every twenty minutes you have a direct line to the study yes til be there i have to welcome the law alia air maelean lord worth still happily unaware of his disintegrating world slept soundly the boeing at thirtythree thousand feet was just beginning its descent to dulles airport lift chapter worth a glass of scotch in one hand and an illegal cuban cigar in the other was comfortably ensconced in a deep armchair in the very plush office of the assistant secretary of state he should have been contented and relaxed he was in fact highly discontented and completely unrelaxed he was becoming mad steadily and far from slowly at the world in general and at the four other people in that room in particular the four consisted of howell the assistant secretary a tall thin keenfaced man with steelframed glasses who looked like and in fact was alistair a yale professor the second was his personal assistant whose name fittingly enough lord worth had failed to catch for he had about him the gray anonymity of a topflight civil servant the third was lieutenantgeneral zweicker and all that could be said about him was that he looked every inch a general the fourth was a middleaged stenographer who appeared to take notes of the discussion whenever the mood struck her which didnt appear to be very often most likely long experience had taught her that most of what was said at any conference wasnt worth noting anyway lord worth said tm a very tired man who has just flown up from the gulf of mexico i have spent twentyfive minutes here and appear to have wasted my time well gentlemen i have no intention of wasting my time my time is as important as yours correction its a damn sight more important the big brushoff i believe its called how can you call it a brushoff youre sitting in my office and general zweicker is here how many other citizens rate that kind of treatment the bigger the facade the bigger the brushoff i am not accustomed to dealing with underlings i am accustomed to dealing with the very top which i havent quite reached yet but will the cool diplomatic deepfreeze treatment will not work i am no troublemaker but til go any seawitch lengths to secure justice you cant sweep me under your diplomatic carpet mr howell i told you recently that there were international threats against the seawitch and you chose either to disbelieve me or ignore me i come to you now with additional proof that i am threatenedthree naval vessels heading for the seawitchand still you propose to take no action and i would point out incidentally if you still dont know independently of the movements of those vessels then its time you got yourselves a new intelligence service general zweicker said we are aware of those movements but as yet we see no justification for taking any kind of action you have no proof that what you claim is true suspicions no more do you seriously expect us to alert naval units and a squadron of fighterbombers on the unproven and what may well be the unfounded suspicions of a private citizen thats it in a nutshell howell said and i would remind you lord worth that youre not even an american citizen not even an american citizen he turned to the stenographer i trust you made a note of that he lifted his hand as howell made to speak too late howell too late to retrieve your blundera blunder i may say of classical proportions not an american citizen i would point out that i paid more taxes last year than all your precious oil companies in the states all stair maelean combinedthis apart from supplying the cheapest oil to the united states if the level of competence of the state department is typical of the way this country is run then i can only rejoice in the fact that i still retain a british passport one law for americans another for the heathen beyond the pale evenhanded justice not an american citizen this should make a particularly juicy tidbit for the news conference i intend to hold immediately after i leave a news conference howeu betrayed unmistakable signs of agitation certainly lord worths tone was as grim as his face if you people wont protect me then by god til protect myself howell looked at the general then back to lord worth he strove to inject an official and intimidating note into his voice i would remind you that any discussions that take place here are strictly confidential lord worth eyed him coldly its always sad to see a man who has missed his true vocation you should have been a comedian howell not a senior member of government confidential thats good how can you remind me of something you never even mentioned before confidential if there wasnt a lady present fd tell you what i really think of your asinine remark god its rich a statement like that coming from the number two in a government department with so splendid a record of leaking state secrets to sea witch muckraking journalists doubless in return for a suitable quid pro quo i cannot abide hypocrisy and this makes another juicy tidbit for the press conferencethe state department tried to gag me classical blunder number two howell howell said nothing he looked as if he were considering the advisability of wringing his hands i shall inform the press conference of the indecision reluctance inaction incompetence and plain runningscared vacillation of a state department which will be responsible for the loss of a hundredmilliondollar oil rig the stopping of cheap supplies of fuel to the american people the biggest oil slick in history and the possibleno i would say probablebeginnings of a third major war in addition to holding this news conference i shall buy tv and radio time explain the whole situation and further explain that i am forced to go to those extraordinary lengths because of the refusal and inability of the state department to protect me he paused that was rather silly of me i have my own tv and radio stations its going to be such a burninghot topic that the big three companies will jump at it and it wont cost me a cent by tonight ill have the name of the state department particularly the names of you and your boss if not exactly blackened at least tarnished across the country im a desperate man gentle alislair maclean men and im prepared to adopt desperate methods he paused for their reactions facially they were all he could have wished howell his assistant and the general all too clearly realized that lord worth meant every word he said the implications were too horrendous to contemplate but no one said anything so lord worth took up the conversational burden again finally gentlemen you base your pusillanimous refusal to act on the fact that i have no proof of evil intent i do in fact possess such proof and its cast iron i will not lay this proof before you because it is apparent that i will achieve nothing here i require a decisionmaker and the secretary has the reputation for being just that i suggest you get him here get the secretary howelts ears were clearly appalled by this suggested l se majeste one doesnt get the secretary people make appointments days even weeks in advance besides he is in a very important conference lord worth remained unmoved get him this conference hed better have with me will be the most important of his life if he elects not to come then hes probably holding the last conference of his political career i know hes not twenty yards from here get him ii dont really think lord worth rose i hope your immediate successorsand the operative word is immedi seawith atewin for the countrys sake display more common sense and intestinal fortitude than you have tell the man who through your gross negligence and cowardly refusal to face facts will be held primarily responsible for the outbreak of the next war to watch tv tonight you have had your chanceas your stenographers notebook will showand youve thrown it away lord worth shook his head almost in sadness there are none so blind as those who will not see especially a spluttering fuse leading to a keg of dynamite i bid you good day gentlemen no no howell was in a state of very considerable agitation sit down sit down ill see what i can do he practically ran from the room during his rather protracted absencehe was gone for exactly thirteen minutesconversation in the room was minimal zweicker said you really mean what you say dont you do you doubt me general not any more you really intend to carry out those threats i think the word you want is promises after this effective conversationstopper an uncomfortable silence fell on the room only lord worth appeared hi no way discomforted he was or appeared to be calm and relaxed which was quite a feat because he knew that the alistair maclean appearance or nonappearance of the secretary meant whether he had won or lost hed won the secretary john benton when howell nervously ushered him in didnt look at all like his reputationwhich was that of a tough shrewdminded hardnosed negotiator ruthless when the situation demanded and not much given to consulting his cabinet colleagues when it came to decisionmaking he looked like a prosperous farmer and exuded warmth and genialitywhich deceived lord worth a man who specialized in warmth and geniality not a whit here indeed was a very different kettle of fish from howell a man worthy of lord worths mettle lord worth rose benton shook his hand warmly lord worth this is a rare privilegeto have if i may be forgiven the unoriginal turn of speech to have americas top oil tycoon calling on us lord worth was courteous but not deferential i wish it were under happier circumstances my pleasure mr secretary its most kind of you to spare a few moments well five minutes no more my promise take as long as you like benton smiled you have the reputation for not bandying words i happen to share that sentiment thank you he looked at howell thirteen minutes to cover forty yards he looked back at the secretary mr howell will haveah apprised you of the situation seawiteh i have been fairly well briefed what do you require of us lord worth refrained from beaming here was a man after his own heart john benton continued we can of course approach the soviet and venezuelan ambassadors but thats like approaching a pair of powderpuffs all they can do is report our suspicions and veiled threats to their respective governments theyre powerless really even ten years ago ambassadors carried weight they could negotiate and make decisions not any more they have become through no fault of their own faceless and empty people who are consistently bypassed in statetostate negotiations even their second chauffeurs who are customarily trained espionage agents wield vastly more power than the ambassadors themselves alternatively we can make a direct approach to the governments concerned but for that we would have to have proof your word doesnt come into question but its not enough we must be able to adduce positive proof of shall we say nefarious intent lord worth replied immediately such proof i can adduce and can give you the outline now i am extremely reluctant to name names because it will mean the end of a professional career of a friend of mine but if i have to that i will do whether i release those names to you or to the public will depend entirely upon the departments reaction if i cant receive a promise of action altstair maelean after i have given you this outline then i have no recourse other than to approach the public this is not blackmail tin in a corner and the only solution is to fight my way out of it if you will as i hope you will give me a favorable reaction i shall of course give you a list of names which i would hope will not be published by your department secrecy in other words not of course that this will prevent you from lettingloose the fbi the moment i board my helicopter out there the great warm heart of the american public versus the incompetent bumbling of the state department benton smiled one begins to understand why you are a millionairei do apologize billionaire earlier this week a highly secret meeting was held in a lakeside resort out west ten people all of them very senior oilmen attended this meeting four were americans representing many of the major oil companies in the states a fifth was from honduras a sixth was from venezuela a seventh from nigeria numbers eight and nine were oil sheikhs from the gulf the last was from the soviet union as he was the only one there who had no interest whatsoever hi the flow of oil into the united states one can only presume that he was there to stir up as much trouble as possible lord worth looked around at the five people ixe seawiteh in the room that he had their collective ear was beyond dispute satisfied he continued the meeting had one purpose and one only in mind to stop me and to stop me at all costs more precisely they wanted to stop the flow of oil from the seawitchthat is the name of my oil rigbecause i was considerably undercutting them in price and thereby raising all sorts of fiscal problems if there are any rules or ethics in the oil business i have as yet to detect any i believe your congressional investigative committees agree one hundred per cent with me on that incidentally north hudsonthats the official name of my companyhas never been investigated the only permanent way to stop the flow of oil is to destroy the seawitch halfway through the meeting they called in a professional troubleshooter a man whom i know well and a highly dangerous man at that for reasons i wont explain until i get some sort of guarantee of help he has a deep and bitter grudge against me he also happensjust coincidentally of courseto be one of the worlds top experts if not the very top on the use of high explosives after the meeting this troubleshooter called aside the venezuelan and soviet delegates and asked for naval cooperation this he was guaranteed lord worth looked at the company with a singular lack of enthusiasm now perhaps you people will believe me alistair maclean i would add that this man so hates me that he would probably do the job for nothing however he has asked forand gota fee of a million dollars he also asked forand got ten million dollars operating expenses what does ten million dollars mean to youexcept the unlimited use of violence preposterous incredible the secretary shook his head it has of course to be true you are singularly wellinformed lord worth you would appear to have an intelligence service to rival our own better i pay them more this oil business is a jungle and its a case of survival of the most devious industrial espionage most certainly not it was just possible that lord worth actually believed this this friend who may be coming to the end of his yes give me all the details including a list of the names put a cross against the name of your friend i shall see to it that he is not implicated and that only i will see that list you are very considerate mr secretary in return i shall consult with defense and the pentagon he paused even that will not be necessary in return i can personally guarantee you a sufficiency of air and sea cover against any normal or even considerable hazard sea witch lord worth didnt doubt him benton had the reputation of being a man of unshakable integrity more important he had the justly deserved reputation of being the presidents indispensable righthand man benton delivered lord worth decided against showing too much relief i cannot tell you how deeply grateful i am he looked at the stenographer and then at howell if i could borrow this ladys services of course the stenographer turned a fresh page in her notebook and waited expectantly lord worth said the placelake tahoe california the address the telephone jangled the stenographer gave lord worth an excuse me smile and picked up the handset howell said to the secretary dammit i gave the strictest instructions its for lord worth she was looking at benton a mr mitchell from florida extremely urgent the secretary nodded and the stenographer rose and handed the phone to lord worth michael how did you know i was here yes im listening he listened without interruption as he did so to the considerable consternation of those watching him the color drained from his tanned cheeks and left them an unhealthy sallow color it was benton himself who rose poured out a brandy and brought it across to lord worth who took it blindly and drained the not incon allstair maelean siderable contents at a gulp benton took the glass from him and went for a refill when he came back lord worth took the drink but left it untouched instead he handed the instrument to benton and held his left hand over ms now screwedshut eyes benton spoke into the phone state department whos speaking mitchells voice was faint but clear michael mitchell from lord worths home is thatis that dr benton yes lord worth seems to have received a severe shock yes sir his two daughters have been kidnaped good god above bentons habitual imperturbability had received a severe dent no one had even seen him register shock before perhaps it was the bluntness of the announcement are you sure i wish to hell i wasnt sir who are you wemy partner john roomer and iare private investigators we are not here in an investigative capacity we are here because we are neighbors and friends of lord worth and his daughters called the police yes whats been done io seawitch we have arranged for the blocking of all air and sea escape routes you have descriptions poor five men heavily armed wearing stocking masks whats your opinion of the local law low ill call in the fbi yes sir but as the criminals havent been traced theres no evidence that theyve crossed the state line hell with state lines and regulations if i say theyre called in thats it hold on i think lord worth would like another word lord worth took the receiver some color had returned to his cheeks im leaving now less than three hours i should say ill radio from the boeing half an hour out meet me at the airport yes sir commander larsen would like to know tell him lord worth replaced the phone took another sip of his brandy theres no fool like an old fool and only a blind fool would have overlooked so obvious a move this is war even if undeclared war and in war no holds are barred to think that it should come to this before you had incontrovertible proof that i am indeed under siege unforgivable to have left my daughters unguarded was wholly unforgivable why didnt i have the sense to leave mitchell alistair maelean and roomer on guard he looked at his nowempty glass and the stenographer took it away benton was faintly skeptical but against five armed men lord worth looked at him morosely i had forgotten that you dont know those men mitchell for example could have taken care of them all by himself hes lethal so theyre your friends and you respect them dont take offense lord worth but is there any way that they could be implicated in this you must be out of your mind lord worth still morose sipped his third brandy sorry im not myself sure theyd like to kidnap my daughters almost as much as my daughters would like to be kidnaped by them that the way it is benton seemed mildly astonished in his experience billionaires daughters did not normally associate with the likes of private investigators thats the way and hi answer to your next two questions yes i approve and no they dont give a damn about my money he shook his head wonderingly it is extremely odd and i shall forecast this mr secretary when marina and melinda are brought back to me it wont be through the good offices of either the local police or your precious fbi mitchell and roomer will bring them back one does not wish to sound overly dramatic but they would quite literally give their lives for my daughters and as a corollary they would cut down anyone who got in their way for the first time since the phone call lord worth smiled albeit faintly ill take the fifth amendment on that one i must meet those paragons sometime just as long as its not over the wrong end of mitchells gun he rose leaving his drink unfinished and looked round the room i must go thank you all for your kindness and consideration not to say forbearance he left with the secretary by his side when the door closed behind him general zweicker rose and poured himself a brandy well what may be the kidnaping of the century pales into insignificance compared to the likelihood of the russkies starting to throw things at us he took some brandy dont tell me im the only person who can see the hellish witches brew lord worth is stirring up for us it was clear that all three listening to him had a very sharp view of the cauldron howell said lets give lord worth his due he could even be right when he says hes glad hes got a british passport the stirrersup are our own compatriots the holierthanthou major american oil companies who are willing to crucify lord worth and put their country at jeopardy because of their blind stupidity i dont care whos responsible the stenog allstair maclean sea witch raphers voice was plaintive does anyone know where i can get a bomb shelter cheap benton led worth down one flight of stairs and out onto the sunlit lawn where the helicopter was waiting benton said ever tried to find words to tell someone how damnably sorry you feel i know from experience dont trybut thanks i could have our personal physician accompany you down to florida thanks again but im fine now and you havent had lunch benton clearly was finding conversational gambits heavy going as i dont much care for plastic lunches from plastic trays i have an excellent french chef aboard my plane again a faint smile and two stewardesses chosen solely for their good looks i shall not want they reached the steps of the helicopter benton said youve had neither the time nor opportunity to give me that list of names for the moment thats of no consequence i just want you to know that my guarantee of protection remains in force lord worth shook his hand silently and climbed the steps by this time conde aboard the roomer had arrived at the s awitch and the big derrick crane aboard the platform was unloading the heavy weaponry and mines from the louisiana arsenal it was a slow and difficult task for the tip of the derrick boom was two hundred feet above sea level and in all the transfer was to take about three hours as each dualpurpose antiaircraft gun came aboard larsen selected its site and supervised palermo and some of his men in securing it in position this was done by drilling holes in the concrete platform then anchoring the guncarriage base with sledgehammerdriven steel spikes the guns were supposed to be recoilless but then neither larsen nor palermo was much given to taking chances the depth charges when they came were stacked together in three groups each halfway between the three apexes of the triangle that there was an inherent risk in this larsen was well aware a stray bullet or shellor perhaps not so straycould well trigger the detonating mechanism of one of the depth charges which would inevitably send up the other charges in sympathetic detonation but it was a risk that had to be taken if for no other reason than the fact there was no other place where they could be stored ready for immediate use and when and if the time came for their use the need would be immediate the drilling crew watched palermo and his men at work their expressions ranging from disinterest to approval neither group of men spoke sf alistair maelean to the other larsen was no great believer in fraternization things were going well the defensive system was being steadily installed the christmas tree the peculiar name given to the valve which controlled the flow of oil from the already tapped reservoir was wide open and oil was being steadily pumped to the huge storage tank while the derrick drill set at its widest angle was driving even deeper into the substratum of the ocean floor seeking to discover as yet untapped oil deposits all was going well there were no overt signs of attack or preparation for attack from air or sea but larsen was not as happy as he might have been even despite the fact that they were still receiving the halfhour regular on course on time reports from the prbello he was unhappy partly because of the nonexistence of the tiburon he had recently learned from galveston that there was no vessel listed in naval or coast guard registries under the name tiburon he had then asked that they check civilian registrations and had been told that this was a forlorn hope it would take many hours perhaps days to carry out this type of investigation and private vessels unless fully insured would show up neither in official registries nor in those of the major marineinsurance companies there was no law which said they had to be insured and the owners of the older sea witch and more decrepit craft didnt even bother to insure there are such things as tax writeoffs larsen was not to know that his quest was a hopeless one when mulhooney had first taken over the tiburon it had been called the hammond which he had thoughtfully had painted out and replaced by the name tiburon on the way to galveston since cronkite had since replaced that by the name georgia both the hammond and the tiburon had ceased to exist but what concerned larsen even more was his conviction that something was far wrong he was unable to put a finger on what this might be he was essentially a pragmatist of the first order but he was also a man who relied heavily on instinct and intuition he was a man occasionally given to powerful premonitions and more often than not those premonitions had turned into reality and so when the loudspeaker boomed commander larsen to the radio cabin commander larsen to the radio cabin he was possessed of an immediate certainty that the hour of his premonition had come he walked leisurely enough toward the radio cabin partly because it would never do for commander larsen to be seen hurrying anxiously anywhere partly because he was in no great hurry to hear the bad news he was convinced he was about to hear he told the radio operator that he would like to take this call privately all stair maclean waited until the man had left and closed the door behind him then picked up the telephone commander larsen mitchell i promised id call thanks heard from lord worth he said hed keep in touch but no word no wonder his daughters have been kidnaped larsen said nothing immediately judging from the ivoried knuckles the telephone handpiece seemed in danger of being crushed although caring basically only for tirmself he had formed an avuncular attachment toward lord worths daughters but even that was unimportant compared to the implications the kidnaping held for the welfare of the seawitch when he did speak it was in a steady controlled voice when did this happen this morning and no trace of them weve blocked every escape route in the southern part of the state and there is no report from any port or airport of any unusual departure since the time of the kidnaping vanished into thin air vanished anyway but not into thin air we think terra firma more likely we think theyve gone to earth and are holed up not far away but its only a euess no communication no demands from the kidnapers none thats what makes it all so odd seawiteh you think this is a ransom kidnap no the seawitchr yes do you know why lord worth went to washington no id like to to demand naval protection early this morning a russian destroyer and a cuban submarine left havana while another destroyer left venezuela they are on converging courses the point of convergence would appear to be the seawitch there was a silence then mitchell said this is for sure yes well lord worths cup of woes would seem to be fairly full the only consolation is that nothing much else can happen to him after this please keep me informed in lord worths radio room both mitchell and roomer hung up their phones mitchell briefly indulged in some improper language god i never thought his enemies would go to this length roomer said neither did i im not sure that i even think so now you mean uncle sams not going to let any foreign naval powers play games in our own backyard something like that i dont think the soviets alistair maelean would go so far as to risk a confrontation could be a bluff a diversionary move maybe the real attack is coming from elsewhere maybe anything could be a double blwff one things sure larsens right in saying that lord worths cup of woes is fairly full in fact id say it was running over looks that way roomer said absently his thoughts were clearly elsewhere mitchell said dont tell me youre in the throes of intuition again im not sure when you were talking to larsen just now you mentioned terra firma firm land dry land what if it werent dry land what if it were wnfirm land mitchell waited patiently roomer said if you wanted to hole up really get lost hi florida where would you go mitchell hardly had to think youre right unfirm laud infirm land whatever you want to call it the everglades of course where else man could hide out for a month there and a battalion of troops couldnt find him which explains why the cops have been unable to find the station wagon between them macpherson and jenkins had been able to give a fairly accurate description of the kidnapers wagon theyve been checking the highways and byways ill bet they never even thought of checking the roads into the swamps did we seawitch right we blew it there are dozens of those roads into the glades but most of them are very short and right away you reach a point where a wheeled vehicle cant go any further a few dozen police cars could comb the nearest swamps in an hour mitchell said to robertson get chief mcgarrity a knock came on the halfopen door and louise one of the young housemaids entered she held a card in her hand she said i was just making up miss marinas bed when i found this between the sheets mitchell took the card it was a plain calling card giving marinas name and address louise said other side mitchell reversed the card holding it so that roomer could see handwritten with a ballpoint were the words vacation little island in the sun no swimsuit you know marinas handwriting louise mitchell had suddenly realized that he didnt the girl looked at the card yes sir im sure thanks louise this could be very useful louise smiled and left mitchell said to roomer what kind of lousy detective are you why didnt you think of searching the bedrooms hmm she must have asked them to leave while she dressed alfstah youd have thought shed have been too scared to think of this the handwritings steady enough besides she doesnt scare easily except that is when you point a gun between her eyes i wish right here and now that i was pointing a gun between someone elses eyes little island in the sun where you cant go bathing an overconfident kidnaper can talk too much you thinking what im thinking roomer nodded the seawitch at thirtythree thousand feet lord worth had just completed a light but delicious lunch accompanied by a splendid bordeaux wine specially laid down for him in a rothschild winery he had regained his habitual calm he had he reckoned touched his nadir all that could happen had happened in common with larsen mitchell and roomer he was convinced that the fates could touch him no more ah four were completely and terribly wrong the worst was yet to come it was in fact happening right then colonel farquharson lieutenantcolonel dewings and major breckley were not in fact the people their id cards claimed they were for the sufficient reason that there were no officers of that rank with corresponding names in the u s army but then it was a very big army and nobody not even the officers could possibly be seawiteh expected to know the names of more than a tiny fraction of their fellow officers nor were their faces their normal faces although they could hardly be described as being heavily disguised the man responsible had been a hollywood makeup artist who preferred subtlety to false beards all three men were dressed in sober and wellcut business suits farquharson presented his card to the corporal at the outer reception desk colonel farquharson to see colonel pryce im afraid hes not here sir then the officer in charge soldier yes sir a minute later they were seated before a young and apprehensive captain martin who had just finished a rather reluctant and very perfunctory scrutiny of the id cards farquharson said so colonel pryce has been called to washington i can guess why he didnt have to guess he himself had put through the fake call that had led to pryces abrupt departure and his second in command flu sir martin sounded apologetic at this time of year how inconvenient especially today you can guess why were here yes sir martin looked slightly unhappy security check i had a phone call telling me of the breakins into the florida and louisiana depots dewings had put through that one im sure youll find everything in order sir alistair maclean doubtless i have already discovered something that is not in order sir there was a definite apprehension now in martins voice and appearance securityconsciousness do you know that there are literally dozens of shops where i cpuld buy perfectly legally a generals uniform those are the specialty shops that cater primarily to the film and stage industries if i walked in dressed in such a uniform would you accept me for what my uniform proclaimed me to be i suppose i would sir well dont not ever again he glanced at his identity card lying on the desk forging one of those presents no problems when a stranger makes an appearance in a top security place like this always always check his identity with area command and always talk only to the commanding officer yes sir do you happen to know his name fm new here majorgeneral harsworth martin had the corporal at the front desk put him through on the first ring a voice answered area command the voice did not in fact come from area command it came from a man less than half a mile away seated at the base of a telephone pole he had with him a batterypowered transceiver an insulated copper line from that led up to an alligator clip attached to one of the telephone wires martin said netley rowan arsenal captain martin id like to speak to general harsworth hold on please there was a series of clicks a pause of some seconds then the same voice said on the line captain martin said general harsworth speaking the man by the telephone pole had deepened his voice by an octave problems captain martin i have colonel farquharson with me he insists that i check out his identity with you the voice at the other end was sympathetic been getting a security lecture im afraid i have sir the colonels very hot on security hes with lieutenantcolonel dewings and major breckley yes sir well its hardly the end of your professional career but hes right you know farquharson himself took the wheel of the car on the threemile journey a chastened compliant martin sitting up front beside him a fifteenfoothigh electricalwarning barbedwire fence surrounded the arsenal a squat gray windowless building covering almost half an acre of land a sentry with a machine carbine barred the entrance to the compound he recognized captain alistair maclcan martin stepped back and saluted farquharson drove up to the one and only door of the building and halted the four men got out farquharson said to martin major breckley has never been inside a tnw installation before a few illuminating comments perhaps it would be illuminating for farquharson also he had never been inside an arsenal of any description in his life yes sir tnwtactical nuclear warfare walls thirtythree inches thick alternating steel and ferroconcrete door ten inches tungsten steels both walls and door capable of resisting the equivalent of a fourteeninch armorpiercing naval shell this glass panel is recording us on tv videotape this meshed grill is a twoway speaker which also records our voices he pressed a button sunk in the concrete a voice came through the grill identification please captain martin with colonel farquharson and security inspection code geronimo the massive door began to slide open and they could hear the hum of a powerful electrical motor it took all of ten seconds for the door to open to its fullest extent martin led them inside a corporal saluted their entrance martin said security inspection tour yes sir the corporal didnt seem too happy seawitch farquharson said you worried about something soldier no sir then you should be martin said something wrong sir he was patently nervous four things martin dipped his head so that farquharson couldnt see his nervous swallowing one thing would have been bad enough in the first place that sentry gate should be kept permanently locked it should only be opened after a phone call to your hq and an electronic link for opening the gate installed in your office whats to prevent a person or persons with a silenced automatic disposing of your sentry and driving straight up here second what would prevent people walking through the open doorway and spraying us all with submachine guns that door should have been shut the moment we passed through the corporal started to move but farquharson stopped him with upraised hand third all people who are not base personnelsuch as weshould be fingerprinted on arrival i will arrange to have your guards trained in those techniques fourth and most important show me the controls for those doors this way sir the corporal led the way to a small console the red button opens the green one closes farquharson pressed the green button the maclean massive door hissed slowly closed unsatisfactory totally those are the only controls to operate the door yes sir martin looked very unhappy indeed we shall have another electronic link established with your ho which will render those buttons inoperable until the correct signal is sent farquharson was showing signs of irritation i would have thought ah those things were selfevident martin smiled weakly they are now sir what percentage of explosives bombs and shells stored here are conventional close to ninetyfive per cent sir fd like to see the nuclear weapons first of course sir a now thoroughly demoralized martin led the way the tnw section was compartmented off but not sealed one side was lined with what appeared to be shells stowed on racks the other with pearshaped metal canisters about thirty inches high with buttons a clockface and a large knurled screw on top beyond them were stacked suitcases each with two leather handles breckley indicated the pearshaped canisters what are those bombs both bombs and land mines martin seemed glad to talk and take his mind off his troubles those controls on top are relatively simple before you get at those two red switches you seawitch have to unscrew those two transparent plastic covers the switches have then to be turned ninety degrees to the right they are then still in the safe position they then have to be flipped ninety degrees to the left this is the readytoactivate position before that is done you have to put the time setting on the clock that is done by means of this knurled knob here one complete turn means a oneminute time delay which will show up on this clockface here it registers in seconds as you can see total time delay is thirty minutes thirty turns and this black button the most important of them all no cover and no turning you might want to get at it in a hurry depressing that stops the clock and in fact deactivates the bomb whats the area of damage compared to the conventional atom bomb tiny the vaporization area would be a quartermile radius perhaps less the blast shock and radiation areas would of course be considerably greater you mean they can be used as both bombs and mines instead of mines maybe i should have said an explosive device for use on land as bombs the setting would probably be only six seconds in tactical warfare they would be carried by lowflying supersonic planes theyd be about two alistair maelean miles clear by the time the bomb went off and moving too fast for the shock waves to catch up with them for land usewell say you wanted to infiltrate an ammunition dump youd check how long it would take you to infiltrate there calculate how long it would take you to get out and clear of the blast zone and set the timer accordingly the missiles here weve seen and heard enough farquharson said kindly put your hands up five minutes later with the furiously reluctant assistance of martin they had loaded two of the bombs safely concealed in their carrying cases into the trunk of their car in the process the purpose of the two carrying handles became clear each bomb must have weighed at least ninety pounds farquharson went back inside looked indifferently at the two bound men pressed the button and slipped through the doorway as the door began to close he waited until the door was completely shut then climbed into the front seat beside martin who was at the wheel this time farquharson said remember one false move and youre a dead man we will of course have to kill the sentry too there were no false moves about a mile from the building the car stopped by a thicket of stunted trees martin was marched deep into the thicket bound gagged and attached to a tree seawitch just in case he might have any ideas about jackknifing his way down to the roadside farquharson looked down at him your security was lousy well phone your hq in an hour or so let them know where they can find you i trust there are not too many rattlesnakes around chapter jttobertson looked up from the radio console chief mcgarrity mitchell took the phone mitchell weve found the kidnapers estate wagon down by the wyanee swamp mcgarrity sounded positively elated im going there personally tracker dogs til wait for you at the walnut tree crossing mitchell replaced the receiver and said to roomer mcgarritys got it all wrapped up hes found the estate wagon well someone did but of course it will be made clear eventually that it was mcgarrity empty of course doesnt that old fool know seawitek that this makes it more difficult not easier at least we knew what transport they were using not any more he didnt mention anything about bringing along a newspaper photographer that he just sort of accidentally bumped into tracker dogs were all he mentioned did he suggest anything for the dogs to sniff at mitchell shook his head roomer shook his and called to jenkins will you get louise please louise appeared very quickly roomer said we need a piece of clothing that the ladies used to wear a lot she looked uncertain i dont understand some things we can give bloodhounds to sniff so that they pick up their scent oh it required only a seconds thought their dressing gowns of course this with but the slightest hint of disapproval as if the girls spent most of the day lounging about in those garments handle as little as possible please put each in a separate plastic bag a patrol car and a small closed police van awaited them at the walnut tree crossing mcgarrity was standing by the police car he was a small bouncy man who radiated goodwill and only stopped smiling when he was vehemently denouncing corruption in politics he was a police chief of incomparable incompetence but alistair macloan sea witch was a consummate and wholly corrupt politician whi h was whv he was police chief he shook the hands of mitchell and roomer with all the warmth and sincerity of an incumbent coming up for reelection which was precisely what he was glad to meet you two gentlemen at last heard very good reports about you he appeared to have conveniently forgotten his allegation that thev gave a lot of trouble to the local law appreciate all the cooperation youve given meand for turning up here now this is ron stewart of the herald he gestured through an open car window where a man apparently festooned in cameras sat in the back seat kind of acoilentallv bumped into him mitchell choked turning it into a cough too many cigarettes same failing myself drivers the dog handler driver of the van is the other one just follow us please five miles farther on they reached the turnoffone of manyinto the wyanee swamp the foliage of the trees almost touching overhead quickly reduced the light to that of a late winter afternoon the increase in the humidity was almost immediately noticeable as was the sour nosewrinkl i n g miasma as they neared the swamp a distinctly unhealthy atmosphere or such was the first impression but many people with a marked aversion to what passed for civilization lived there all their lives and seemed none the worse for it the increasingly rutted bumpy road had become almost intolerable until they rounded a blind corner and came across the abandoned station wagon the first essential was apparently that pictures be taken and the second that mcgarrity be wellplaced in each one his hand preferably resting in a proprietorial fashion on the hood that done the cameraman fitted a flash attachment and was reaching for the rear door when roomer clamped his wrist not too gently dont do that why not never been on a criminal case before fingerprints is why not he looked at mcgarrity expecting them soon shouldnt be long out on a case check on them don this to the driver who immediately got busy on his radio it was clear that the idea of bringing fingerprint experts along had never occurred to mcgarrity the dogs were released from the van roomer and mitchell opened up their plastic bags and allowed the dogs to sniff the dressing gowns mcgarrity said what you got there the girls dressing gowns to give your hounds a scent we knew youd want something of course but dressing gowns mcgarrity was a past master in covering up something else clearly that had not occurred to him alistalr maelean the dogs caught the scents at once and strained at their leashes as they nosed their way down a rutted path for the road had come to an abrupt end inside a hundred yards their path was blocked by water it wasnt a true part of the swamp but a slow meandering mudbrown creek perhaps twenty feet across if that there was a mooring post nearby with a similar one at the far bank also by the far bank was a warped and aged craft which not even the charitable could have called a boat it was built along the lines of an oversized coffin with a squaredoff end where the bow should have been the ferryprobably the most kindly name for it was attached to the two posts by an endless pulley line the two dog handlers hauled the boat across got into it with understandable caution and were joined by their dogs who kept on disolaying considerable signs of animation an animation which rapidly diminished then vanished shortly after they had landed on the far bank after making a few fruitless circles they lay down dejectedly on the ground well aint that a shame a voice said trail gone cold i guess the four men on the near bank turned to look at the source of the voice he was a bizarre character wearing a new panama hat with a tartan band gleaming thighlength leather boots and sea witch clothes discarded by a scarecrow you folks chasin someone were looking for someone mcgarrity said cautiously lawmen yes chief of police mcgarrity honored im sure well chief youre wasting your time hot trail here cold on the other side so the party youre looking for got off halfway across you saw them mcgarrity asked suspiciously hah more than one eh no sir just happened by right now but if i was on the run from the law thats what id do because its been done hundreds of times you can get out midway walk half a mile even a mile upstream or downstream dozens of little rivulets come into this creek you could turn up any of those go a mile into the swamp without setting foot on dry land wouldnt find them this side of christmas chief how deep is the creek fifteen inches if that then why the boat i mean with those boots you could walk across without getting your feet wet the stranger looked almost shocked no sirree takes me an hour every morning to polish up them critters it was assumed that he was alistair mslelean referring to his boots besides therere the water moccasins he seemed to have a rooted aversion to snakes the boat come the rains the creeks up to here he touched his chest mcgarrity called the dog handlers to return mitchell said to the stranger anyplace in the swamp where a helicopter could land sure more firm land out there than there is swampland never seen any helicopters though yes lots of clearings the dog handlers and dogs disembarked leaving the stranger to flick some invisible dust off his boots they made their way back to the station wagon mitchell said wait a minute ive got an idea he opened the two plastic bags containing the dressing gowns and presented them to the dogs again he then walked back up the rutted lane past the two cars and vans beckoning the dog handlers to follow him which they did almost having to drag the reluctant dogs behind them after about twenty yards the reluctance vanished the dogs yelped and strained at their leashes for another twenty yards they towed their handlers along behind them then abruptly stopped and circled a few times before sitting down dispiritedly mitchell crouched and examined the surface of the lane the others caught up with him mcgarritty said what gives then seawiteh this mitchell pointed to the ground there was another vehicle here you can see where its back wheels spun when it started to reverse the kidnapers guessed wed be using dogsit wasnt all that hard a guess so they carried the girls twenty yards or so to break the scent before setting them down again right smart of you mr mitchell right smart mcgarrity didnt look as pleased as his words suggested so the birds have flown eh and now we havent the faintest idea what the getaway vehicle looks like roomer said somebodys flown thats for sure but maybe only one or two maybe theyve gone to borrow a helicopter a helicopter the waters didnt have to be very deep for chief mcgarrity to start floundering with a trace of weary impatience mitchell said it could be a double bluff maybe they reversed the procedure and took the girls back to the station wagon again maybe theyre still in the swamp waiting for a helicopter to come arid pick them up you heard the old boy back therehe said there were plenty of places in the swamp where a helicopter could set down mcgarrity nodded sagely and appeared to ponder the matter deeply the time had come he felt for him to make a positive contribution the swamps out hopeless so ill have to concentrate on the helicopter angle ahstair mitchell said how do you propose to do that just you leave that to me roomer said thats hardly fair chief weve given you our complete confidence dont you think were entitled to some in return well now mcgarrity appeared to ruminate although he was secretly pleased to be asked the question as roomer had known he would be if the chopper doesnt get in there it cant very well lift them out can it thats a fact roomer said solemnly so i station marksmen round this side of the swamp its no big deal to bring down a lowflyine chopper mitchell said i wouldnt do that if i were you no indeed roomer shook his head the law frowns on murder murder mcgarrity stared at them whos talking about murder we are mitchell said rifle or machinegun fire could kill someone inside the helicopter if it brings down the helicopter theyd all probably die maybe there are criminals aboard but theyre entitled to a fair trial and has it occurred to you that the pilot will almost certainly be an innocent party with a pistol pointed at his head mcgarrity clearly had not thought of that not going to make us very popular is it seawttch mcgarrity winced even the thought of unpopularity and the forthcoming election made him feel weak inside so what the devil do we do roomer was frank ill be damned if i know you can post observers you can even have a grounded helicopter standing by to chase the other one when it takes off it ever comes in the first place were only guessing no more we can do here mitchell said weve already missed too many appointments today well be in touch back on the highway roomer said how do you think hed do as a dogcatcher place would be overrun by stray dogs in a few months how much faith have you got in this idea that they might use a helicopter a lot if they just wanted to change cars they wouldnt have gone through this elaborate rigmarole they could have parked their station wagon out of sight almost anyplace by apparently going into hiding in the swamp they wanted to make it look as though they were preparing to hole up in there for some time they hadnt figured on our backingyour backtrackingup the lane were pretty sure their destination is the seawitch were pretty sure theyll use a helicopter which helicopter and pilot would you use itti alistalr m aelean r lord worths not only are his pilots almost certainly the only ones who know the exact coordinates of the seawitch but those distinctly marked north hudson helicopters are the only ones that could approach the seawitch without raising suspicion roomer reached for the phone fiddled with the waveband control and raised lord worths house jim go ahead mr roomer were coming back there look for lord worths address book probably right by you in your radio room make us a list of the names and addresses of his helicopter pilots is the gatekeeper at the heliport on the radiophone too yes get that for us too please roger roomer said to mitchell still think we shouldnt warn larsen about our suspicions thats for sure mitchell was very definite the seawitch is larsens baby and the kind of reception hed prepare for them might be a bit overenthusiastic howd you like to explain to lord worth how come his daughters got caught in the crossfire no way roomer spoke with some feeling or even explain to yourself how melinda got shot through the lung roomer ignored him what if were wrong about worths pilots seawitch then we turn the whole thing over to that ace detective mcgarrity so wed better be right they were right they were also too late john campbell was both an avid fisherman and an avid reader he had long since mastered the techniques of indulging his two pleasures simultaneously a creek fairly popular with fish ran within twenty feet of his back porch campbell was sitting on a canvas chair parasol over his head alternating every page with a fresh cast of his line when durand and one of his men stockingmasked and holding guns in their hands came into his line of vision campbell rose to his feet book still in hand who are you and what do you want you youre campbell arent you what if i am like you to do a little job for us what job fly a helicopter for us ill be damned if i will so you are campbell come along following the gesturing of their guns campbell moved between the two men he was within one foot of durands gun hand when he chopped the side of his hand on the wrist that held the gun durand grunted hi pain the gun fell to the ground and a second later the two men were locked together wrestling kicking and punching alislnir ma icnn f with a fine disregard for the rules of sport altering position so frequently that durands henchman at first found no opportunity to intervene but the opportunity came very soon the unsportsmanlike but effective use of campbells right knee doubled durand over in gasping agony but enough instinct was left him to seize campbells shirt as he fell over backward this was campbells downfall in more ways than one for the back of his head was now nakedly vulnerable to a swung automatic the man who had felled campbell now pulled him clear allowing durand to climb painfully to his feet although still bent over at an angle of fortyfive degrees he pulled off his stocking mask as if to try to get more air to breathe durand was latin american with a pale coffeecolored face thick black curling hair and a pencilline mustache he might even qualify as handsome when the twisted lines of agony ceased to contort his face he straightened inch by inch and finally obtained a modicum of breath enough at least to allow him to announce what he would like to do with campbell some other time mr durand he cant very well fly a chopper from a hospital bed durand painfully acknowledged the truth of this i hope you didnt hit nun too hard just a tap tie him tape him and blindfold him sea witch durand was now a scarce twenty degrees off the vertical his helper left for the car and returned hi moments with cord tape and blindfold three minutes later they were on then way with a rugcovered and still unconscious campbell on the floor at the back resting comfortably on the rug were durands feethe still didnt feel quite up to driving both men had then masks off noweven in the freewheeling state of florida men driving with stocking masks on were likely to draw more than passing attention mitchell glanced briefly at the list of names and addresses robertson had given them fine but what are these checks opposite five of the names robertson sounded apologetic i hope you dont mindi dont want to butt inbut i took the liberty of phoning those gentlemen to see if they would be at home when you came around i assumed youd be seeing them because you asked for the addresses mitchell looked at roomer why the hell didnt you think of that roomer bestowed a cold glance on him and said to robertson maybe i should have you as a partner what did you find out one pilot is standing by at the airport four of the others are at home the one whose name i havent checkedjohn campbellisnt home alistair maclean i asked one of the other pilots about this and he seemed a bit surprised said that campbell usually spends his afternoons fishing outside the back of his house hes a bachelor and lives in a pretty isolated place it figures roomer said a bachelor in isolation the kidnapers seem to have an excellent intelligence system the fact that he doesnt answer the phone may mean nothinghe could have gone for a walk shopping visiting friends on the other hand yes especially on the other hand mitchell turned to leave then said to robertson does the gatekeeper have a listed phone number as well as the radiophone ive typed it on that list maybe we should both have you as a partner mitchell and roomer stood on campbells back lawn and surveyed the scene unemotionally the canvas chair on its side had a broken leg the parasol was upturned on the grass over an opened book the fishing rod was in the water up to its handle and would have floated away had not the reel snagged on a shrub root roomer retrieved the rod while mitchell hurried through the back doorwaythe back door was wide open as was the front he dialed a phone number and got an answer on the first ring lord worths heliport gorrie here seawiteh my names mitchell you have a police guard mr mitchell you lord worths friend yes sergeant roper is here that all let me speak to him there was hardly a pause before roper came on the phone mike nice to hear from you again listen sergeant this is urgent im speaking from the house of john campbell one of lord worths pilots he has been forcibly abducted almost certainly by some of the kidnapers of lord worths daughters i have every reason to believeno tune for explanations nowthat theyre heading in your direction with the intention of hijacking one of lord worths helicopters and forcing campbell to fly it therell be two of them at least maybe three armed and dangerous i suggest you call up reinforcements immediately if we get them well break them at least roomer and i will you cant youre a law officer and your hands are tiedand well find where the girls are and get them back reinforcements coming up then ill look the other way mitchell hung up roomer was by his side roomer said you prepared to go as far as backroom persuasion to get the information we want mitchell looked at him bleakly i look forward to it dont you alistair maclean no but til go along with you once again mitchell and roomer had guessed correctly and once again they were too late mitchell had driven to lord worths heliport with a minimum regard for traffic and speed regulations and now having arrived there he realized bitterly that his haste had been wholly unnecessary five men greeted their arrival although it was hardly a cheerful meeting gorrie the gateman and four policemen gome and sergeant roper were tenderly massaging their wrists mitchell looked at roper dont tell me mitchell sounded weary they jumped you before the reinforcements were to hand yeah ropers face was dark with anger i know it sounds like the old lame excuse but we never had a chance this car comes along and stops outside the gatehouse right here the driverhe was alone in the carseemed to be having a sneezing fit and was holding a big wad of kleenex to his face roomer said so you wouldnt recognize him again exactly well we were watching this dude when a voice from the backthe back window was opentold us to freeze i didnt even have my hand on my gun we froze then he told me to drop my gun well this guy was no more than seawlteh five feet away i dropped my gun dead heroes are no good to anyone then he told us to turn around he was wearing a stocking mask then the driver came and tied our wrists behind our backs when we turned around he was wearing a stocking mask too then they tied your feet and tied you together so that you wouldnt have any funny ideas about using a telephone thats how it was but they werent worried about the phones they cut the lines before they took off they took off immediately gome said no five minutes later the pilots always radiofile a flight plan before takeoff i suppose these guys forced campbell to do the same to make it look kosher mitchell shrugged his indifference means nothing you can file a flight plan to anyplace doesnt mean you have to keep it how about fuelfor the helicopters i mean fuels always kept topped up my job lord worths orders what direction did they go thataway gorrie indicated with an outstretched arm well the birds have flown might as well be on our way just like that roper registered surprise what do you expect me to do that the police cant alistair maclean well for starters we could call in the air force why they could force it down mitchell sighed theres a great deal of crap being talked about forcing planes down what if they refuse to be forced down then shoot it down with lord worths daughters aboard lord worth wouldnt be very pleased neither would you think of all the cops that would be out of a job lord worths daughters its all this routine police work roomer said atrophies the brain who the hell do you think that helicopter has gone to pick up once clear of the heliport roomer extended an arm thataway the man said thataway is northwest the wyanee swamp even if theyd taken off to the southeast theyd still have finished up in wyanee mitchell pulled up by a public booth how are you with mcgarritys voice roomer was an accomplished mimic its not the voice thats hard its the thought processes til give it a try he didnt say what he was going to try because he didnt have to he left for the booth and was back inside two minutes campbell filed a flight plan for the seawitch any questions asked o seawiteh not really told them that some fool had made a mistake anyone who knows mcgarrity would know who the fool was that made the mistake mitchell started the engine then switched off as the phone rang mitchell lifted the receiver jim here tried to ring you a couple of times fifteen minutes ago five minutes ago figures out of the car both times more bad news not unless you consider lord worth bad news touchdown in fifteen minutes we got time says hes coming up to the house sent for the rolls no probably wants to talk private and it looks as if hes planning to stay away some time ordered a bag packed for a week seven white suits mitchell hung up roomer said looks as if were going to have to do some bagpacking ourselves mitchell nodded and started up again lord worth was looking his old self when he settled in the back seat of their car not quite radiating his old bonhomie to be sure but calm and lucid and to all appearances relaxed he told of his success in washington for which he was duly and politely congratulated roomer then told him in detail what had happened in alistair maclean his absence this time the absence of congratulations was marked youve notified commander larsen of your suspicions of course not suspicions mitchell said certainties and theres no of course and no we didnt notify him tm primarily responsible for that taking the law into your own hands eh mind telling me why youre the person who knows larsen best you know how possessive he is about the seawitch you yourself have told us about his anger and violence do you think a man like that duly forewarned wouldnt have a very warm reception waiting for the kidnapers stray bullets ricocheting bullets are no respecter of persons lord worth you want a daughter crippled for life we prefer that the kidnapers establish a bloodless beachhead well all right the words came grudgingly but from now on keep me fully informed of your intentions and decisions lord worth roomer noted with sardonic amusement had no intention of dispensing with their unpaid services but no more taking the law into your own hands do you hear mitchell stopped car and engine roomers amusement changed to apprehension mitchell twisted in his seat and looked at lord worth in cool speculation x seawitch youre a fine one to talk what do you mean sir there were fifteen generations of highland aristocracy in the glacial voice mitchell remained unmoved for taking the law into your own hands by breaking into and robbing that arsenal last night if roomer and i were decent citizens and lawabiding detectives wed have had you behind bars last night not even a billionaire can get away with that sort of thing especially when it involves the assault and locking up of the arsenal guards john and i were there mitchell was not above a little prevarication when the need arose you were there most rarely for him lord worth was at a loss for words he recovered quickly but wasnt there we know that we also know you sanctioned the breakin ordered it rather balderdash and if you actually witnessed this why did you not stop it john and i take our chances but not against nine men armed with machine guns this gave lord worth pause they had their figures and facts right clearly they had been there he said supposing any of this rigmarole were true how in gods name do you tie me up with it now youre being a fool we were also at your heliport we saw the truck arrive we saw alistair madman nine men unload a fairly massive quantity of more than fairly lethal weaponry into one helicopter then a man drove the truck awayan army truck of courseback to the arsenal from where it had been stolen the other eight men boarded another helicopter then a minibus arrived carrying twelve heavily armed thugs who joined the other eight john and i recognized no fewer than five of themtwo of them weve personally put behind bars roomer looked at him admiringly but mitchell wasnt looking at roomer he was looking at lord worth and both voice and tone were devoid of any form of encouragement it came as a shock to both of us to find that lord worth was consorting with common criminals youre sweating a little lord worth why are you sweating lord worth didnt enlighten them as to why he was sweating and then of course you came along in the rolls one of the very best sequences we got on our infrared movie camera last night roomer blinked but that lord worth believed mitchell roomer did not for a moment doubt everything that mitchell had said even the slight embellishments lord worth knew or believed to be true so he had no reason to doubt the truth of the camera fiction we actually considered phoning the nearest army hq and having them send along some seawiteh armored cars and a trailered tank even your thugs wouldnt have stood a chance we thought of going down the road blocking the rolls and holding you until the army arrivedit was perfectly obvious that the helicopters had no intention of leaving until you turned up once captured god knows how many of themespecially those who had already served prison termswould have jumped at the chance of turning states evidence and incriminating you its quite true you knowthere is no honor among thieves if lord worth had any objections to being categorized as a thief it didnt register in his face but after the standard bit of soulsearching we decided against it why in gods name so you admit it mitchell sighed why couldnt you do that at the beginning and save me all this trouble why lord worth repeated his question it was roomer who answered partly because even though youre a confessed lawbreaker we still have a regard for you but mainly because we didnt want to see your daughters confronted with seeing their father behind bars in hindsight of course were glad we didnt in comparison with the kidnaping of your daughters your own capers outside the law fade into a peccadillo mitchell started the motor again and said it is understood that there will be no more pecca alistalr maclean dilloes it is also understood that there will be no more talk about our taking the law into our own hands lord worth lay back in his study armchair his second brandy tasted just as good as his firstit seemed to be his day for brandies he hadnt spoken a word for the rest of the trip which fortunately had been mercifully short for lord worth had felt urgently in need of restoratives not for the first time he found himself silently blessing his kidnaped daughters he cleared his throat and said i assume you are still willing to come out to the rig with me mitchell contemplated his glass we never expressed our intentions one way or another about that but i suppose someone has to look after you and your daughters lord worth frowned there had he felt been more than a subtle change in their relationship perhaps the establishment of an employeremployee status would help redress the balance he said i feel its time we put your cooperation on a businesslike footing i propose to retain you in your professional capacities as investigatorsin other words become your client i shall not quibble at your demanded fees he had no sooner finished than he realized that he had made a mistake roomers voice was coldly unenthusiastic money doesnt buy everything lord worth sea witch particularly it doesnt buy us we have no intention of being shackled of having our freedom of action curtailed and as far as the fees and your skyvthelimit implication are concerned the hell with it how often do we have to tell you we dont trade money for your daughters lives lord worth didnt even bother frowning the change in relationship he reflected sadly had been even greater than he had realized as you will one assumes that you will be suitably disguised mitchell said why lord worth was impatient you said you saw some exconvicts boarding the helicopter people you recognized theyll surely recognize you we never saw em before in our lives lord worth was properly shocked but you told me you told us big black lies whats a little white lie well go aboard assayyour technological advisers geologists seismologists its all the same to us we know nothing about geology or seismology all we need are business suits hornrimmed glassesfor the studious lookand briefcases he paused and well also need a doctor with full medical kit and a large supply of bandages a doctor for extracting bullets sewing up gunshot wounds or are you naive enough to believe that alfstafr maclean no shot will be fired in anger aboard the witch i abhor violence sure thats why you sent twenty heavily armed thugs out to the seawitch during the night fine so you abhor violence others welcome it can you find us a doctor dozens of them the average doctor hereabouts rates his scanning of xrays a very poor second to the scanning of his bank balances i know the man greenshaw after seven years in vietnam he should fill your bill roomer said and ask him to bring along two spare white hospital coats why mitchell said want to look scientific dont you lord worth picked up the phone made the arrangements replaced the instrument and said you must excuse me i have some private calls to make from the radio room lord worths sole reason for returning to his house was to contact his inside man corral and have him without incriminating himself inform benson who had hosted the lake tahoe meeting that the government intended to blast out of the water any foreign naval ships that approached the seawitch an exaggeration but lord worth thought a pardonable one despite the secretarys promise lord worth placed more faith in his direct approach alistair maclean mitchell said which one of us do you want to go with you what do you mean private i said his face darkened in anger am i to be ordered around in my own house supervised as if im an irresponsible child you behaved responsibly last night look lord worth if you dont want either of us around then its obvious you want to say something that you dont want us to hear mitchell gave him a speculative look i dont like that youre either up to something we wouldnt like something shady maybe or its a vote of no confidence in us its a personal and highly important business call i dont see why you should be privy to my business affairs roomer said i agree but it so happens that we dont think it is a business call that business would be the last thing in your mind right now both mitchell and roomer stood up give our regards to the girlsif you ever find them blackmail damned blackmail lord worth rapidly weighed the importance of his call to corral compared to the importance of having mitchell and roomer around it took all of two seconds to make up his mind and corral was clear out of sight at the wire he was sure that the two men were bluffing but there was no way he could call their bluff for that was the one sure way of provoking a genuine walkout maclean lord worth put on his stony face i suppose i have no option other than to accede to your threats i suggest you go and pack your bags and ill pick you up in the rolls mitchell said packing will take some time i think it would be more polite if we wait here until youre ready lord worth mentally gnashed his teeth you think id head for a telephone the moment your backs are turned mitchell smiled funny the same thought should occur to the three of us at the same instant isnt it chapter commander larsen and scoffield observed the approach of the north hudson helicopter with surprise but without undue concern lord worth customarily gave advance warning of his arrival but could occasionally be forgetful on this point in any event it was his helicopter and just about his expected time of arrival they sauntered across the platform and arrived at the northeast helipad just as the helicopter touched down surprisingly no one emerged immediately from the machine larsen and scoffield looked at each other in some perplexity a perplexity that alistafr maclean was considerably deepened when the disembarkation door slid back and durand appeared in the doorway with a machine pistol cradled in his hands just behind him stood a similarly equipped henchman from their shadowed position it was impossible for them to be observed by any of the rig duty crew durand said larsen and scoffield if you are carrying weapons please dont be so foolish as to try to use them the boarding steps swung down come and join us the two men had no option once aboard without taking his eyes off them durand said kowenski rindlersee if theyre armed both larsen and scoffield carried automatics but seemed quite indifferent to being deprived of them their attention was directed exclusively to the presence of lord worths daughters marina smiled albeit a trifle wanly we could have met under happier circumstances commander larsen nodded your kidnapers this can carry a death sentence he looked at campbell why did you fly those criminals out here because i get very cowardly when i have a pistol barrel stuck in the back of my neck all the way from takeoff to touchdown campbell spoke with a certain justifiable bitterness larsen looked at melinda have you been mistreated in any way no seawiteh and they wont be durand said unless of course you refuse to do as we tell you what does that mean you close down the christmas tree this meant closing off all the oil supplies from the ocean floor ill be damned if i do larsens dark piratical face was suffused with fury here durand realized was a man who even without arms could be highly dangerous he glanced briefly at rindler who struck larsen on the back of the neck with his machine pistol a blow calculated to daze but not knock out when larsens head had cleared he found that he had handcuffs and shackles around wrists and ankles his attention then focused on a pair of gleaming stainlesssteel medical cutters of the type favored by the surgical fraternity for snipping through ribs the handles were in durands firm grip the unpleasant operating end was closed lightly round the little finger of melindas right hand durand said lord worth isnt going to like you too much for this larsen larsen apparently was of the same opinion all right take those damned pliers away and get these bracelets off ill close down your damned christmas tree and fll come with you just to see that you really do turn it off not that i would recognize one if i saw it but i do know that there are such things as flow gauges til be carrying a walkie all stair jtflaclean talkie with me rindler here has another fu keep in constant contact with him if anything should happen to me durand looked consideringly at the medical cutters then handed them to heffer the fifth man in his team he told campbell to put his arms behind his seat back and handcuffed his wrists dont miss much do you larsens voice was sour you know how it is so many villains around these days come on the two men walked across the platform in the direction of the drilling rig after only a few paces durand stopped and looked around him admiringly well well now dualpurpose antiaircraft guns piles of depth charges youd almost think youre prepared to withstand a siege dear me dear me federal offense you know lord worth even with the millions he can pay for lawyers can get at least ten years in the pen for this whatre you talking about hardly standard equipment aboard an oil rig ill bet it wasnt here twentyfour hours ago fll bet it was inside the mississippi naval arsenal that was broken into last night the government takes a dim view of people who steal military equipment and of course you got to have specialists aboard whore skilled at handling stuff like that and thats hardly part of the basic training of oilrig crews i wonder if those crews sea witch are also carrying special equipmentlike for instance what was stolen from a florida arsenal last night i mean two unrelated arsenal breakins in the same night is too much coincidence twenty years in prison with no chance of parole for you too for aiding and abetting and people call us criminals larsen had a few choice observations to make in return none of which would have received the approval of even the most tolerant board of censors the christmas tree was duly neutralized the pressure gauges registered zero durand turned his attention to the roomer carrying out its short and wearisome patrol between the rig and the huge floating oil tank whats our friend up to even a landlubber like you ought to be able to guess hes patrolling the pipeline what the hell for you could replace a cut line in a day what would that get anybody its crazy you have to use crazy methods to deal with crazy people from all accounts lord worths enemies should be locked up for their own good for everybodys good worths band of cutthroats aboard this rig whos their leader giuseppe palermo that mobster so the noble lord along with all stair macloan his grand larceny is an associate of convicted felons you know him then yeah durand saw no point in elaborating upon the fact that he and palermo had spent two prison terms together i want to talk to him the talk was brief and onesided durand said weve got lord worths daughters prisoner were going to bring them toward the living quarters here but we dont want you taking our two aces away from us youll stay inside in your quarters if you dont youre gonna hear a lot of screaming and see pieces of fingers or ears dropped through your windows i hope you believe me palermo believed him palermo had a reputation for ruthlessness that matched durands but it couldnt begin to match durands unholy joy in sadism durand was perfectly capable of not only doing what he threatened but of deriving immense satisfaction in so doing palermo returned to his oriental quarters durand called up rindler on the walkietalkie and told them all to come across including campbell the pilot campbell was tough and resourceful and it was just possible that by standing up he could slip his manacled arms over the back of his seat step through them and take off whether he would have enough fuel for the return flight would be a problem for him even sea witch though he would almost certainly head not for florida but for the nearest spot on the mainland which would be due south of new orleans as the prisoners and guards disembarked from the helicopter durand said accommodations plenty there are spare rooms in the oriental quarters theres lord worths private suite lockups what do you mean this isnt a prison storerooms ones that can be locked from the outside yes durand looked at larsen consideringly youre being very cooperative larsen your reputation says otherwise two minutes walk around and you could confirm all im saying for yourself youd like to kill me wouldnt you larsen when the time is ripe yes but its not yet ripe even so durand produced a pistol stay about ten feet away you might be tempted to grab me and try to make the men let the girls go a tempting thought no larsen looked at him yearningly and said nothing the girls the pilots and their four escorts arrived durand said well now we gotta find some suitable overnight accommodation for you he led the way to the first of several storehouses and opened the door to reveal a room packed altstair maclean roofhigh with canned goods he shoved campbell inside locked the door and pocketed the key the next storehouse contained coils of rope a powerful smell of crude oil and an active scuttling population of those indestructible creatures cockroaches durand said to the two girls inside the girls took one shuddering look then turned away marina said we will not go inside that disgusting place kowenski said in a gently chiding voice which accorded ill with the colt he held in his hand do you know what this is rindler had a similar weapon trained on melinda both girls glanced briefly at each other and then in what was obviously a prepared and rehearsed movement walked toward the men with the guns seized the barrels with their right hands and hooked their right thumbs behind their trigger forefingers pulling the guns hard against themselves jesus christ durand was badly shaken he had run up against many situations in his life but this one lay far beyond his most remote conception you trying to commit suicide melinda said precisely her eyes never left rindlers youre lower than those horrible cockroaches in there you are vermin who are trying to destroy our father with us dead you wont have a single card left to play youre crazy simple plain crazy seawiteh maybe marina said but for crazy people our logic is pretty good with nothing to tie his hands you can imagine how our father will reactespecially since he and everyone else will believe that you murdered us he wont have to go to the law of courseyou simply have no idea what power a few billion dollars can bring to bear hell destroy you and all your people to the last man she looked at kowenski with contempt why dont you press the trigger no then let go your gun kowenski released his gun and rindler did the same and the girls dropped them to the deck melinda said my sister and i are taking a walk we will return when you have quarters prepared fitting for lord worths daughters durands face had definitely lost color and his voice was hoarse and not quite steady as he tried to regain a measure of authority so take your walk heffer go with them any trouble shoot them in the legs marina stooped picked up kowenskis colt walked up to heffer and rammed the muzzle into his left eye heffer recoiled ho wring in agony marina said fair deal you shoot me through the legnow i meanand til blow your brains out gods sake durands voice was almost imploring he was one step removed from wringing his hands somebodys got to go with you if ft alfstair maclean i youre out there on your own and in no danger palermos men will cut us to pieces what a perfectly splendid idea marina lowered the pistol and looked in distaste at heffer a rodentfaced creature of indeterminate age and nationality we see your point but thisthis animal is not to approach within ten yards of us at any time that is understood yes yes of course if they asked him for the moon durand would have somehow levitated himself and got it for them having overwhelmingly displayed what it was to have seventeen generations of highland aristocratic ancestry behind them the two girls walked away toward one of the triangular perimeters it was fully twenty yards before they both began at the same instant to tremble violently once started they could not control the trembling and they prayed that the following heffer could not notice it marinawhispered shakily would you do that again never never never fd die i think we came pretty close to it do you think that michael and john would be shaking like us after an experience like that no if theres any truth in what daddy hints theyd already be planning what to do next and durand and his obnoxious friends wouldnt be shaking either dead men dont shake very much marinas trembling turned into a genuine o seawitch shiver i only wish to god they were here right now they stopped ten feet short of the platform perimeter neither girl had a head for heights they turned and looked northeastward as the distant and muted roar of an aircraft engine came to their ears durand and larsen heard it at the same time they could see nothing because dusk had already fallen but neither man had any doubt as to the identity of the approaching helicopter and its occupants with some satisfaction durand said company this has to be lord worth where will they land the southeast helipad durand glanced across the platform to where the two girls were standing with heffer gun carried loosely in his right hand less than the regulation ten yards away satisfied durand picked up his machine pistol and said lets go and welcome his lordship aboard aaron come with us larsen said youd better hope lord worth proves more tractable than his daughters what do you mean larsen smiled in sardonic satisfaction you caught a couple of tigresses by the tails didnt you durand scowled and walked away followed by larsen and aaron the latter armed similarly to durand they reached the southeast helipad isi alistair maclean just as the north hudson helicopter touched down lord worth himself was the first out he stood at the foot of the steps and stared in disbelief at the armed men he said to larsen what in gods name goes on here durand said welcome aboard the seawitch lord worth you can regard me as your host and yourself as a guestan honored guest of course there has been a slight change of ownership tm afraid that this man herehis name is durand and i assume that he is one of cronkites lieutenants cronkite durand was jarred what do you know about cronkite i can hardly congratulate him on his choice of lieutenants when lord worth poured on his icy contempt he used a kingsized trowel do you think we are such fools as not to know who your employer is not that cronkite has long to live nor you either for that matter durand stirred uneasilylord worth sounded far too much like his daughters for his peace of mind lord worth directed his attention to larsen one assumes that this ruffian arrived with accomplices how many four four but with palermo and his men you have over twenty how is it possible durand was back on balance when he spoke it was with a slight if logical smugness we have something that larsen hasnt we have your daughters what was apparently pure shock rendered lord worth temporarily speechless then in a hoarse voice he said great god almighty my daughters lord worth could have had his oscar just for the asking youyou are the kidnaper fortunes of war sir it said much for lord worths aristocratic magnetism that even the most villainous eventually addressed him in respectful tones now if we could see the rest of the passengers mitchell and roomer descended in tan alpaca suits and hornrimmed glasses they were innocuousness personified lord worth said mitchell and roomer scientistsgeologists and seismologists he turned to mitchell and roomer and said dully theyre holding my daughters captive aboard the seawitch good god mitchell was properly shocked but surely this is the last place of course the unexpected keeping a couple of steps ahead of the opposition whatd you come here for to find new sources of oil we have a perfectly equipped laboratory here you could have saved your time can we search your bag and your friends alistair maclean have i any choice no go ahead aaron aaron carried out a quick examination of mitchells bag clothes some scientific books and scientific instruments is all dr greenshaw clambered down the ladder reached up and relieved the pilot of various bags and boxes durand looked at the door and said who the hell is he dr greenshaw lord worth said a highly respected doctor and surgeon we did expect a certain amount of violence aboard the seawitch we came prepared we do have a dispensary and small sick bay here another wasted trip we hold all the cards and violence is the last thing we expect well examine your equipment too doctor if you wish as a doctor i deal in life and not in death i have no concealed weapons the medical code forbids it greenshaw sighed please search but do not destroy durand pulled out his walkietalkie send one of palermos men across here with an electric trucktheres quite a bit of equipment to pick up he replaced his walkietalkie and looked at mitchell your hands are shaking why im a man of peace mitchell said he crossed his hands behind his back to conceal the tremor seawitch roomer the only man to recognize the signals licked his lips and looked at mitchell in exaggerated nervous apprehension durand said another hero i hate cowards mitchell brought his hands in front of him the tremor was still there durand stepped forward his right hand swinging back as if to strike mitchell openhanded then let his hand fall in disgust which was unwittingly the wisest thing he could have done durands mind was incapable of picking up any psychic signals had it been so attuned he could not have failed to hear the black wings of the bird of death flapping above his head the only person who derived any satisfaction carefully concealed from this vignette was larsen although he had talked to mitchell on the telephone he had never met himbut he had heard a great deal about him from lord worth more than enough to make him realize that mitchell would have reduced durand to mincemeat sooner than back down before him mitchell had taken only seconds to establish the role he wished to establishthat of the cowardly nonentity who could be safely and contemptuously ignored larsen who was no mean hand at taking care of people himself felt strangely comforted lord worth said may i see my daughters durand considered then nodded search him aaron alistalr maclean aaron carefully avoiding lord worths basilisk glare of icy outrage duly searched hes clean mr durand across there durand pointed through the gathering gloom by the side of the platform lord worth walked off without a word the others made their way toward the accommodation quarters as lord worth approached his daughters heffer barred his way where do you think youre going mister lord worth to you peasant heffer pulled out his walkietalkie mr durand theres a guy here durands voice crackled over the receiver thats lord worth hes been searched and hes got my permission to speak to his daughters lord worth plucked the walkietalkie from heffer and would you please instruct this individual to remain outside listening range you heard heffer the walkietalkie went dead the reunion between father and daughters was a tearful and impassioned one at least on the daughters side lord worth was all that a doting parent reunited with his kidnaped children should have been but his effusiveness was kept well under control marina was the first to notice this arent you glad to see us again daddy lord worth hugged them both and said simply you two are my whole life if you ithj sen witch dont know that by this time you will never know it youve never said that before even in the deepening dusk it was possible to see the sheen of tears in melindas eyes i did not think it necessary i thought you always knew perhaps im a remiss parent perhaps still too much the reserved highlander but all my billions arent worth a lock of your black hair marina or a lock of your red hair melinda titian daddy titian how often must i tell you melinda was openly crying now it was marina always the more shrewd and perceptive of the two who put her finger on it you arent surprised to see us daddy are you you knew we were here of course i knew how my agents lord worth said loftily lie thick upon the ground and what is going to happen now lord worth was frank im damned if i know we saw three other men come off the helicopter didnt recognize themgetting too dark one was a dr greenshaw excellent surgeon melinda said what do you want a surgeon for alistair dont be silly what does anyone want a surgeon for you think were going to hand over the seawitch on a platter and the other two you dont know them youve never heard of them and if you do meet them you will give no indication that you recognize them or have ever seen them before marina said michael and john yes rememberyouve never seen them before well remember the girls said almost in chorus their faces were transformed marina said but theyll be in great danger why are they here something to do i understand with thenstated intent of taking you back home howare they going to do that again lord worth was frank i dont know h they know they wouldnt tell me theyve become bossy very bossy watch me like a hawk wont even let me near my own blasted phone the girls refrained from smiling principally because lord worth didnt seem particularly perturbed mitchell especially seems in a very tetchy mood lord worth spoke with some relish near as a whisker killed durand inside the first minute would have too if you werent being held hostage well lets go to my suite ive been to washington and back long tiring day i need refreshment seawluh durand went into the radio room told the regular operator that his services would not be required until further notice and that he was to return to his quarters and remain there the operator left durand himself an expert radio operator raised the georgia within a minute and was speaking to cronkite thirty seconds later everything under control on the seawitch we have the two girls here and lord worth himself excellent cronkite was pleased everything was going his way but then he had expected nothing else lord worth bring anyone with him the pilot and three other people a doctor surgeon he says and he seems on the level worth seems to have expected some blood to be spilled ill check his credentials in florida in a few minutes also two techniciansseismologists or something like them genuine and harmlessthe sight of a machine pistol gives them st viruss dance theyre unarmed so no worries well three worth has a squad of about twenty men aboard they look like trained killers and im pretty sure theyre all exmilitary they have to be because of my second worryworth has eight dualpurpose antiaircraft guns bolted to the platform the hell he has yeahalso piles of mines on the sides of the alistair maclean platform now we know who heisted the mississippi naval arsenal last night and the third problem is that were far too thin on the ground theres only me and four others to watch everybody some of us have to sleep sometimes i need reinforcements and i need em fast youll have over twenty arriving at dawn tomorrow morning the relief rig crew are due in then a man named gregsonyoull recognize him by the biggest red beard you ever sawwill be in charge i cant wait that long i need reinforcements now you have your chopper on the georgia what do you think i carry on the georgia an army of reinforcements cronkite paused then went on reluctantly i can spare eight men no more they have radar aboard so they have radar what difference does it make youre hi command yeah mr cronkite but your own golden rulenever take a chance when you hear our helicopter has taken off neutralize it destroy the radar cabin no were going to want to use it when weve completely taken over the scanner will be on top of the drilling derrick right right its a simple mechanical job to stop it from turning all you need is someone with a wrench seawitch and a head for heights now tell me exactly where worths men are quartered gregson will need this information durand told him what he wanted to know and hung up the dispensarysick bay and the laboratory were next to each other mitchell and roomer were helping dr greenshaw unpack his very considerable amount of medical equipment they were understandably not unguarded but aaron and his schmeisser were on watch on the two outside doors and aaron was hardly in an alert or triggerready state of mind in fact he regarded his vigil as being close to pointless he had been present when the three men disembarked from the helicopter and had formed the same opinion of them as durand in the sick bay dr greenshaw upended and removed the false bottom of one of his medical supply boxes with a gingerly and patently nervous apprehension he took out two belt holsters two smith wessons two silencers and two spare magazines wordlessly mitchell and roomer buckled on the weaponry dr greenshaw a man as they were discovering of a genuinely devout turn of mind said i only hope no one discovers you wearing those pistols roomer said we appreciate your concern doctor but dont worry about us oi alistalr maelean i wasnt worrying about you dr greenshaw assumed his most somber expression a good christian can also pray for the souls of the ungodly a long distance away the meeting of ten was again assembled at lake tahoe at the former meeting the atmosphere had been hopeful forceful and determined the participants confident that things would go their way spuriously motivated by their expressed intent to avert a third world war on this evening the spiritif that was the wordof the meeting had changed about by degrees they were depressed vacillating uncertain and wholly lacking in confidence especially in view of the fact that their allegedly humanitarian attempts to prevent the outbreak of war seemed to be having precisely the opposite effect again as it was his holiday home benson was hosting the meeting but this time benson was also undoubtedly the man in charge opening the discussion he said gentlemen we are in trouble not just simple plain trouble but enormous trouble that could bring us all down it stems from two factswe underestimated lord worths extraordinary power and we overestimated cronkites ability to handle the situation with a suitable degree of discretion and tact i admit i was responsible for introducing cronkite to you but on the other hand you were unani sea witch mous in your belief that cronkite was the only man to handle the job and we were not aware that cronkites detestation of lord worth ran to the extent of a virulent and irresponsible hatred i have friends in the pentagon not important ones but ones that matter the pentagon normally like any other department of government leaks secrets like a broken sieve this time i had to pay twenty thousand dollars to a stenographer and the same to a cipher clerk which for a pair of comparatively lowly paid government employees represents a pretty fair return for a few hours work first everything is known about our previous meeting here every word and sentiment that was expressed and the identities of all of us benson paused and looked round the room partly to allow time for the damning enormity of this information to sink in partly to make it clear that he expected to be recompensed for his very considerable outlay mr a one of the vastly powerful arabian gulf potentates said i thought our security was one hundred per cent how could anyone have known of our presence no external agency was involved i have good friends in california intelligence their interest in us is zero nor was the fbi involved for that to have happened wed have had to commit some crime and then cross state lines allstuir m acl ean neither of those have we done and before we met last time i had an electronics expert in to check not only this room but the entire house for bugs there were none mr a said terhaps he planted a bug impossible apart from the fact that hes an old friend of immaculate reputation i was with him all the time a fact that did not prevent me from calling in a second expert patinos the venezuelan said we give you full marks for security that leaves only one possibility one of us here is a traitor yes who i have no idea we shall probably never know mr a stroked his beard mr corral here lives very close to lord worth no corral said thank you very much benson said intelligent men dont make so obvious a link as you said at our previous meeting fm the only person who had no declared interest in being here borosoff seemed quietly relaxed i could be your man its a point but one which i dont accept whether you are here to stir up trouble between the united states and russia may or may not be the case again it comes down to the factor of intelligence benson was being disarmingly frank you could be and probably are a soviet agent seawiteh but top agents are never caught in the role of agent provocateur i am not complimenting you on your unquestioned intelligence i prefer to rely on simple common sense benson who appeared to have developed a new maturity and authority looked around the company every word spoken here will doubtless be relayed to either lord worth or the state department it no longer matters we are here to set right any wrongs for which we may have beenhowever unwittingly i may sayresponsible we know that a russian missile naval craft and a russianbuilt cuban submarine are closing in on the seawitch we also know that a venezuelan destroyer is doing the same what you dont know is that countermeasures are being taken my informationand the source is impeccableis that lord worth was today closeted with benton the secretary of state in washington my further information is that benton was only partially convinced by lord worths suspicions he was unfortunately wholly convinced when the news came through of cronkites irresponsible folly in kidnaping lord worths two daughters as a result a united states cruiser and destroyer both armed with the most sophisticated weaponry have moved out into the gulf of mexico an american nuclear submarine is already patrolling those waters another american vessel is already shadowing your destroyer mr patinos your destroyer with its o alistalr maclean vastly inferior detecting equipment is wholly unaware of this additionally at a louisiana air base a squadron of supersonic fighterbombers is on instant alert the americans are no longer in any mood to play around my information is that they are prepared for a showdown and are prepared for the eyeballtoeyeball confrontation which john kennedy had with khrushchev over cuba the russians clearly would never risk a local nuclear confrontation where the hometerritory advantages are so overwhelmingly american neither side would dream of mounting a preemptive strike over the issue of a few pennies on a barrel of oil but if the hot line between washington and moscow begins to burn national prestige will make it difficult for either side to back down until they arrive at a facesaving formula which could take quite some time and would much worse generate overwhelming worldwide publicity this would inevitably involve us so i would advise you mr borosoff and mr patinos to call off your dogs of war before that hot line starts burning that way and only in that way can we survive with our good names left unbesmirched i blame neither of you gentlemen you may have given the nod to cronkite but you did not reckon on the possibility that cronkite would carry matters to such ridiculous lengths please please believe me that the ameri seawiteh cans will not hesitate to blast your ships out of the water oil ministers do not become oil ministers because they are mentally retarded patinos smiled a smile of wry resignation i do not relish the thought of personal ruin nor do i relish the thought of becoming a scapegoat for my government he looked across at borosoff we call off the dogs of war borosoff nodded back to their kennels and no alas i wish to return to my russia and this will give me great face for they will not have to lose face in the world mr a leaned back in his chair his relief was manifest well that would seem to cover that it covers most of it benson said but not all another very unpleasant and potentially terrifying crime occurred this afternoon i heard of it only an hour ago and it will be the hottest topic in the nation tonight i only hope to god that although we were in no way responsible for it we wont be implicated in it a place called netley rowan arsenal was broken into this afternoon its supposed to be just another arms depot insofar as the public is concerned and so mainly it is but its also a tnw arsenal tnw means tactical nuclear weapons two of them were stolen in the breakin and appear to have vanished without trace god above the expression and tone of the o maclean man from honduras accurately reflected the shocked feelings of all around the table cronkite id bet on it no proof naturally but who the hell else henderson said no disrespect to mr borosoff here but couldnt the russians say have been seeking a prototype benson looked as weary as his voice sounded the russians already have god knows how many of those things its public knowledge that they have thousands of them deployed along the border between the warsaw pact and nato countriesmany of them it is suspected more sophisticated than ours the russians need our tnws the way they need bows and arrows borosoff despite the anxiety he shared with the others permitted himself the ghost of a smile of complacency cronkite the mans running wild mr a said you think hes so totally crazy as to use a nuclear device against the seawitch i do not profess to understand the workings of an obviously diseased mind benson said hes capable of anything patinos said whats this weapon like i dont know i phoned the pentagon a very senior official there but although hes an old friend of mine he refused to release highly classified information all i know is that it can be used as a landbased time bombi suppose that in seawitch eludes the sea as wellor as an aircraft bomb it can only be used in a limited number of supersonic fighterbombers which will already i suppose be under the heaviest security guard ever which would strike me as a superfluous precaution as there is no chance that cronkite even with his obviously wide range of contacts could know anyone who could fly one of those planes so what happens i think wed better consult an astrologer on that one all i know is that cronkite has gone stark raving mad cronkite aboard the georgia would have thought the same of them he had a job to do and he was doing it to the best of his ability had he known of the possible withdrawal of the warships that had sailed from cuba and venezuela he would not have been unduly concerned he had had some vague idea that they might have been useful to him in some way but he had primarily wished to have them as a cover and a smokescreen cronkites vendetta against lord worth was a highly personal and extremely vindictive one and he wanted no other than himself to administer the coup de grace retribution exacted through the medium of other hands would not do at all meantime he was well content he was convinced that the seawitch was in his hands o alistair mactean come the dawn it would be doubly in his hands he knew of their defenses and radar the starlight under easton was waiting until full darkness before it moved hi for the initial attack and as rain had been falling steadily for some time now and the lowering sky blotted out the quartermoon it promised to be as nearly dark as it ever becomes at sea a message was brought to him from the radio office cronkite glanced at it briefly picked up the phone to the helipad and reached the pilot in his shelter ready to go wilson whenever you say mr cronkite then now cronkite closed a rheostat switch and a dull glow of light outlined the helipad just enough to let wilson make a clean takeoff the helicopter made a halfcircle switched on its landing light and made a smooth landing on the calm waters less than a hundred yards from the stationary georgia cronkite called the radar room you have him on the screen yes sir hes making an instrument approach on our radar let me know when hes about three miles out less than a minute later the operator gave him the word cronkite turned the rheostat to full and the helipad became brilliantly illuminated a minute later a helicopter landing lights on sea witch appeared from the north through the driving rain just over another minute later it touched down as delicately as a moth an understandable precaution by the pilot in view of the cargo he was carrying the fueling hoses were connected immediately the door opened and three men descendedthe alleged colonel farquharson lieutenant colonel dewings and major breckley who had been responsible for the netley rowan arsenal breakin they helped unload two large doublehanded and obviously very heavy suitcases cronkite with suitable admonitions as to delicacy in handling showed crew members where to stow the cases in shelter within ten minutes the helicopter was on its way back to the mainland five minutes after that the georgias own helicopter had returned and ail the helipad lights were switched off chapter jlt was due only to cruel ill luck and the extremely jittery state of durands nerves that john roomer and melinda worth found themselves the first patients in dr greenshaws sick bay durand was in a highly apprehensive state of mind a mood that transferred itself all too easily to his four subordinates although he held control of the seawitch he knew that his hold was a tenuous one he had not bargained on finding palermo and his cutthroats on board and even though he held the master keys to both the occidental and oriental quarters in his pocket the drilling crew was in the former quarters seawiteh palermo and his men in the latterhe was acutely aware that there were far too many windows in both quarters and he didnt have the men to cover every possible exit he had broadcast a message over the external loudspeaker that anyone found on the platform would be shot on sight and had two men on constant patrol round the oriental quartershe had no fear of the unarmed drillingrig crewand another two constantly patrolling the platform he had no fear of lord worth his seismologists and the girlsas sources of danger he held them in contempt besides they were unarmed even so the two men patrolling the platform had been instructed to do so in such a fashion as to make sure that at least one had an eye on the doors to the suite of lord worth the laboratory and the sick bay all three of which had intercommunicating doors no one inside those three places had heard the warning broadcastand this ironically because lord worth was not above indulging in what he regarded as the bare minimum of basic creature comforts oil rigs can be uncommonly noisy places and those quarters he had heavily insulated mitchell had been in his tiny cubicle of the laboratory at the time reading the complete plan of the layout of the seawitch over and over until he was certain that he could have found his way around the rig blindfolded this had taken him alistair maelean about twenty minutes it was in the fifth minute of his studying that the shots had been fired but again because of the soundproofing the sound had not reached him he had just put the plans away in a drawer when his door opened and marina entered she was whitefaced and shaking and her face was streaked with tears he put his arms round her and she grabbed him tightly why werent you there she sobbed why werent you there you could have stopped them you could have saved them mitchell took no time out to dwell upon the injustices of life he said gently stopped what saved who melinda and john theyve been terribly hurt how shot shot i didnt hear anything of course you didnt this area is all soundproofed thats why melinda and john didnt hear the broadcast warning broadcast warning tell it to me slowly so she told him as slowly and coherently as she could there had been such a warning but it had gone unheard in lord worths suite the rain had stopped at least temporarily and when mitchell had retired to study the plans melinda and roomer had elected to go for a stroll they had been wandering around the foot of the drill seawitch irtg rig where most of the lights had been turned off since durand had ordered the abandonment of drilling and it was there that they had been gunned down without warning terribly hurt you said how bad tm not sure dr greenshaw is operating in the sick bay im not a coward you know that but there was so much blood that i didnt want to look arrived in the sick bay mitchell could hardly blame her melinda and roomer lay in adjacent cots and both were saturated with blood melinda already had her left shoulder heavily bandaged roomer had bandages swathing his neck and dr greenshaw was working on his chest lord worth his face a mask of bitter fury was sitting in a chair durand his face a mask of nothingness was standing by the doorway mitchell looked speculatively at both then spoke to dr greenshaw what can you tell so far doctor would you listen to him roomers voice was a hoarse whisper and his face creased with nearagony never think of asking us how we feel in a minute doctor melindas left shoulder is bad tve extracted the bullet but she needs immediate surgery im a surgeon but im not an orthopedic surgeon and thats what she must have roomer hasnt been quite so lucky he got hit twice the alistair madman one through the neck missed his carotid artery by a whisker but the bullet passed straight through and theres no worry there the chest wound is serious not fatal but very serious the bullet struck the left lung no doubt about that but the internal bleeding isnt that much so i think its a nick no more the trouble is i think the bullet is lodged against the spine can he wiggle his toes roomer moaned my god what sympathy he can but the bullet should be removed as soon as possible i could do it but i have no xray equipment here ill give them both blood transfusions in a moment shouldnt they be flown to a hospital as soon as possible of course mitchell looked at durand well no but it wasnt their fault they didnt hear the warning tough theres no way ill fly them ashore think i want a battalion of u s marines out here in a few hours if they die itll be your fault everybodys got to die sometime durand left slamming the door behind him dear dear roomer tried to shake his head then winced at the pain in his neck he shouldnt have said that mitchell turned to lord worth you can be seawitch of great help sir your suite is in direct contact with the radio room can you hear what is being said in the radio room thats no problem two switches and i can hear both sides of any conversation either on the telephone earphones or wall receivers all rightgo and dont stop listening for a second he looked at the two patients on the cots well have them airborne for the hospital within a half hour how can that be possible i dont know mitchell sounded vague but well think of something lord worth left mitchell pulled out a slender pencil flashlight and started to flick it on and off in apparent aimlessness his complexion had gone pale and the hands that held the pencil light trembled slightly marina looked at him first uncomprehendingly then in dismay finally in something approaching contempt incredulously she said youre frightened your gun mitchell said to roomer when they went off for help i managed to drag myself a bit nearer the edge i unclipped the belt and threw the whole thing over the side good were still in the clear he seemed to become aware of the tremor in his hands put away his flash and thrust his hands into his pockets he said to melinda who shot you a pair of very unpleasant characters named air alistalr m aclean kowenski and rindler we had trouble with them before kowenski and rindler mitchell repeated he left the sick bay marina said half in sadness hah in bitterness my idol with the feet of clay roomer said huskily put out the light and then put out the light what did you say i didnt say it man named othello thats the trouble with you millionaires daughters illiterate first mitchell puts out the lights hes got cats eyes he can see in almost total darkness where an ordinary man is blind did you know that no gives him a tremendous advantage and then he puts out other lights i know what you mean and i dont believe you i saw him shaking ahh you dont deserve him she stared at him hi disbelief what did you say you heard me roomer sounded tired and the doctor was looking at him in disapproval he went on in a somber voice kowenski and rindler are dead men they have just minutes to live he loves melinda almost as much as he does you and ive been his closest friend and partner since we were kids mitchell looks after seawiteh his own he smiled faintly im afraid he takes care of things in a sort of final way but he was shaking her voice was now lacking in conviction he isnt afraid of anything that lives as for the shakinghes a throwback to the old scandinavian berserkers hes just trying to hold in his rage he usually smiles he smiled youre shaking now she said nothing roomer said theres a cupboard in the vestibule if theres anything in it bring it to me she looked at him uncertainly left and returned in a few minutes carrying a pair of shoes she held them at arms length and from the look of horror on her face might have been holding a cobra roomer said mitchells yes okay better return them hell be needing them pretty soon when she came back melinda said to her do you really think you could marry a man who kills people marina shivered and said nothing roomer said sardonically better than marrying a coward id say in the generator room mitchell found what he wanted right awaya circuit breaker marked deck lights he pulled the lever and stepped alistair maclean out onto the now darkened platform he waited a half minute until his eyes adjusted themselves to the darkness then moved in the direction of the derrick crane where he could hear two men cursing in far from muted voices he approached on soundless stockinged feet until he was less than two yards away still soundlessly he held his pencil flash on top of the barrel of the smith wesson and slid forward the flash switch the two men swung round in remarkably swift unison hands reaching for their guns mitchell said you know what this is dont you they knew the deepbluish sheen of a silencerequipped is not readily mistakable for a popgun their hands stopped reaching for their guns it was to say the least rather unnerving to see an illuminated silenced gun and nothing but blackness beyond it clasp your hands behind your necks turn round and start walking they walked until they could walk no more for the good reason that they had reached the end of the platform beyond that lay nothing but the foot drop to the gulf of mexico mitchell said keep your hands clasped and turn round they did so youre kowenski and rindler there was no reply youre the two who gunned down melinda and mr roomer seawiteh again there was no reply vocal cords can become paralyzed when the mind is possessed of the irrevocable certainty that one is but one step one second removed from eternity mitchell squeezed the trigger twice and was walking away before the dead men had hit the waters of the gulf he had taken only four steps when a flashlight beam struck him in the face well well if it isnt smartass mitchell the scared scientist mitchell couldnt see the man and the gun undoubtedly behind the flashlight but he had no difficulty in recognizing the voice of heifer the one with the sharp nose and ratlike teeth and carrying a silenced gun whatcha up to mr mitchell heffer had made the classic blunder of all incompetent wouldbe assassins he should have shot mitchell on sight and then asked the questions mitchell flicked on his pencil torch and spun it upward where it spiraled around like a demented firefly heifer would have been less than human not to have had the instinctive reaction of glancing upward as his subconscious mind speculated as to what the hell mitchell was up to a speculation of very brief duration indeed because heifer was dead before the flash fell back onto the platform mitchell picked up the flash still surprisingly working pocketed it then dragged heffer by the heels and rolled him off to join his friends at the bottom of the gulf he returned to the sickbay allstair maccean vestibule donned his shoes and entered the sick bay itself dr greenshaw had both his patients on blood transfusion roomer looked at his watch six minutes what took you so long a plainly unnerved marina looked at roomer half in disbelief half in stupefaction well im sorry mitchell actually managed to sound apologetic i had the misfortune to run into heifer on the way back you mean he had the misfortune to run into you and where are our friends im not rightly sure i understand roomer sounded sympathetic its hard to estimate the depth of the water out here i could find out but it hardly seems to matter dr greenshaw you have stretchers complete with straps and so forth greenshaw nodded get them ready let them stay where they are meantime can you carry on the blood transfusions in flight thats no problem i assume you want me to accompany them yes please i know its asking an awful lot but after youve handed them over to the competent medical authorities fd like you to return it will be a pleasure i am now in my seventieth year and i thought there was nothing fresh left in life for me to experience i was wrong marina stared at them in disbelief all three sea witch men seemed calm and relaxed melinda appeared to have dropped off into a comalike stupor but she was merely in fact under heavy sedation marina said with conviction youre all mad mitchell said thats what a lunatic asylum inmate says about the outside worldand he may well be right however thats hardly the point at issue you marina will be accompanying the others on the trip back to florida you will be perfectly safe thereyour father will see that the most massive security guard ever mounted will be there how splendid i love being made a fuss over being the center of attraction however mastermind theres just one small flaw in your reasoning im not going im staying with my father thats exactly the point im going to discuss with him now you mean youre going out to kill someone else mitchell held out his hands fingers splayed they could have been carved from marble later roomer said he appears to have some other things on his mind at the moment mitchell left marina turned furiously on roomer youre just as bad as he is im a sick man you mustnt upset me you and his berserker moods hes just a killer roomers face went very still you know i alistair maclean dont look forward to the prospect of having a mentally retarded person as a sisterinlaw she was shocked and the shock showed her voice was a whisper i dont really know you do i no were the men who walk down the dark side of the streets somebody has to look after the people on the dark side we do it do you know how much your father offered us to take you home roomer smiled tm afraid im not much good in that department at the moment but mike will take care of it how much did he offer you whatever we wanted in the world a million dollars to take you home a hundred million if wed asked for it sure how much did you ask for her face wasnt registering much in the way of expression roomer sighed poor mike to think that he regards you as the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow poor me too fm going to have to live with you too even at second hand lets be corny your father loves you we love you to pile cliche on cliche there are some things that cant be bought pearls beyond price dont make yourself an artificial pearl marina and dont ever insult us again that way but we have to live on something so well send him a bill for what ammunition expended she crossed to his cotside knelt and kissed seawitch him roomer seemed too weak to resist dr greenshaw was severe marina hes not only having a blood transfusion theres also the factor of blood pressure roomer said my blood pressure is registering no complaints she kissed him again is that apology enough roomer smiled and said nothing berserker you said can anyone stop him when hes like that can i no someday yes the one person is you yes yes you didnt no why they carried guns you carry guns yes but were not evil people who carry evil guns to do evil things thats all no he looked across at melinda you see please if kowenski and rindler hadnt been such damned lousy shots shed be dead so you let michael loose yes youre going to marry her yes have you asked her allstair maelean no you dont have to sisters talk mike i dont know john fm a running coward running scared well he kills ive killed hell kill aeain i dont know john he reached out took a lock of her gleaming black hair picked out a single thread that you mean yes i have to see she kicked off her highheeled shoes so much to learn sit she sat on his bed dr greeitshaw rolled his eyes heavenward she was wearing blue jeans and a white blouse roomer reached up and undid the top button of her blouse she looked at him and said nothing roomer said you do the rest navy or black jumper she was back in thirty seconds wearing a navy polo she looked inquiringly at roomer who nodded she left the sick bay in lord worths living room he and mitchell were seated in adjacent armchairs the wallspeakers were on when marina came in mitchell waved her to urgent silence scawlfch over the speakers durands unmistakable voice sounded testy all i know is that the deck lights went out some minutes ago and then came back on marina glanced at mitchell who nodded all the light you need to land have you neutralized the radar scanner yet marina had never heard the voice before but the tightening of lord worths lip showed that cronkites voice was no stranger to him we dont need to now it was your idea do it well leave in ten minutes then about fifteen minutes flying time well leave that mean youre coming too no ive more important things to do there was a click cronkite had ceased to transmit lord worth said uneasily i wonder what that devious devil means by that well just have to find out the hard way mitchell looked at marina where are your shoes she smiled sweetly im a quick study shoes make too much noise out on the platform youre not going out on any platform i am there are gaps in my education i want to see how killers operate mitchell said in irritation fm not going to kill anyone go get your bag packed youll be leaving soon fm not leaving why because i want to stay with daddyand with you dont you think thats natural youre leaving if i have to tie you up you cant tie my tongue up wouldnt the law just love to know where the guns stolen from the mississippi arsenal are lord worth looked slightly stunned youd do that to me your own father youd tie me up and force me aboard that helicopter your own daughter talk about logic mitchell shook his head lord worth seems to have fathered a nutcase if you think the wallspeakers crackled again well dont just hang around stop that radar how it was aaron and he sounded grieved do you expect me to climb that damned drilling rig dont be stupid go to the radar room theres a red lever switch just above the console pull it down that i can do aaron sounded relieved they heard the sound of a door closing mitchell kicked off his shoes turned off the lights in the living room and eased the door open a crack aaron his back already to them was heading for the radar room he reached it opened the door and passed inside mitchell moved after him pulling out his silenced gun and holding it in his left hand a soft voice behind him said i thought you were righthanded seawitch mitchell didnt even bother to curse he said in a resigned whisper i am aaron was just pulling the red lever when mitchell made his soundless entrance he said dont turn round aaron didnt turn round clasp your hands behind your neck then turn and come over here aaron turned mitchell dont try anything clever ive already had to kill three of your friends a fourth isnt going to give me a sleepless night stop right there and turn round again aaron did as he was told mitchell withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket the braided leather sap attached to his wrist by a thong was no more than five inches long but when it struck aaron with considerable force and accuracy above and behind the right ear it was apparent that five inches was quite long enough mitchell caught him as he fell and eased him te the deck did you have to do that marina choked and stopped speaking involuntarily as mitchells hand clamped itself none too gently over her mouth she flinched as he shook the sap before her eyes keep your voice down the whisper was intentionally savage he knelt over aaron removed and pocketed his gun did you have to do that she said in a low alistair maclonn voice you could have tied mm up and gagged him when i require advice from amateurs cqrne right to you i havent time for games hell just have a halfhour peaceful rest and then all hell need is an aspirin and now durand why fool im getting tired of people calling me fool john just called me that he also said i was mentally retarded and an artificial pearl no shrewder judge of character than old john mitchell said approvingly if aaron doesnt return durand will come looking for him then hell get on the radiophone and stop the helicopter flight well thats what you want isnt it no he switched off the light and walked away marina following mitchell stopped outside the entrance to lord worths sitting room get inside youre both an irritation and a liability i cant function properly with you around heroines i can do without i promise you i wont say a word i promise he caught her by the arm and thrust her forcibly inside lord worth looked up in mild seawitch surprise mitchell said i will hold you personally responsible lord worth if you let this pesky daughter of yours outside that door again also im dimming the deck lights anybody moving around the platform will be shot thats mypromise and youd better believe it this is no place for children who want to play games the door closed behind him well marina sat down and gripped her hands together what kind of husband do you think fie would make a perfectly splendid one i should imagine look my dear one of mitchelts outstanding assets is a hairtrigger reaction you blunt it and you know damn well how he feels about you your presence just constitutes an additional worry at a time when he can least afford either a wife doesnt accompany her husband down a coal mine or on a wartime bombing mission and mitchell is much more of a loner than such people are she attempted something between a glower and a scowl but her beautiful face really wasnt made for it so she settled for a rueful smile rose and replenished his glass of malt whisky mitchell removed the gun and two large keys from the pockets of an unconscious durand made his way to the main entrance to the oriental quarters opened the door and switched on the corridor lights alistair maelean commander larsen he called out palermo doors opened and the two men were with him in a few seconds larsen said mitchell what the hell are you doing here just a harmless seismologist taking a stroll but didnt you hear the broadcast warning anyone on the platform will be shot on sight thats past one piece of bad news two of good bad news first roomer and miss melinda didnt hear the warningthose quarters are soundinsulated so they took a walk both were hurt badly melinda has a shattered left shoulder roomer was shot through the neck and chest the doctor thinks the bullet is lodged against his spine weve got to get them to the hospital and quick whos lord worths personal pilot chambers larsen said get one of your men to have him refuel his machine now the good news durand is in the radio room his number two guy named aaron is in the radar room both are unconscious he looked at palermo when they come toitll be some time yetcan you have them looked after with loving care and attention our pleasure larsen said durand had three other men theyre dead you yes sn witch we didnt hear any shooting mitchell gave them a brief sight of his silenced larsen looked thoughtful lord worth has talked about you i used to think he was exaggerating the other bit of good news cronkite is sending some reinforcements by helicopternot many i believe eight or nineand they should be taking off about now a fifteenminute flight i gather so i think cronkites boat is somewhere just below the horizon below our radar sweep palermo brightened we blast this chopper out of the sky my first thought i must admit but lets try to play it smart and put him off his guardlets let them land then take them well make their leader report to cronkite that everythings okay what if he wont or tries to warn him well write out his script if he changes one word fll shoot him silencer cronkite wont hear it he might hear the guy scream when a slug enters the base of your skull and travels upward at fortyfive degrees you dont scream very much you mean youd kill him while not exactly incredulous larsen was obviously taken aback yes then wed line up number two we shouldnt have too much trouble with him alistair maelean larsen said with some feeling when lord worth talked about you he didnt tell me the half of it another thing i want that helicopter well fake a story that the engine failed above the pad and it crashlanded and will take several hours to repair its always handy to have another helicopter around but more important i want to deprive cronkite of the use of his he looked at palermo i take it that the reception committee can be safely left in your hands it sure can any suggestions well i doubt that i need to lecture an expert like you you know me i used to be a cop in any case the rig is loaded with portable searchlights theyll head for the administration buildings id stay in hiding switch off the deck lights and then turn on the searchlights when theyre say thirty yards away theyll be blinded and wont be able to see you you cant count on what nutcases like thatll do til bet you can mitchell smiled briefly at him cop to crook he said to larsen i have a feeling that lord worth would like to confer with his rig boss yes they walked away as palermo was already giving rapid instructions to his men lord worth know what youre up to seawiteh t havent had time anyway i wouldnt tell lord worth how to make a billion out of oil good point they stopped briefly by the radio room larsen gazed at the crumpled form of durand half in appreciation half in regret what a beautiful sight wish it had been me though ill bet durandwhen he wakes updoesnt plastic surgeons come high they made their next brief stop at the sick bay larsen looked at a still comatose melinda and a wideawake roomer and his massive fists clenched roomer smiled i know but youre too late how deeps the water here nine hundred feet then youd need a diving bell to get your hands round the throats of those responsible and how are things with you commander larsen you can see how things are with us ive been resting mitchell has been more active besides the three men at the bottom of the gulf hes also deprived me of the pleasure of beating the hell out of durand aaron isnt feeling too well either roomer said apologetically he doesnt go in much for diplomacy so the seawitch is in our hands for the moment for the moment do you expect a man like cronkite to give up so kes lost five men and is probably about s allntair to lose another eight or nine whats that for a man with ten million to play around with and hes got his personal vendetta against lord worth if he has to cripple or even destroy the seawitch including everybody aboardwell it isnt going to bother cronkites conscience for long he turned to dr greenshaw i think its time you got busy with the stretchers can you spare four of your drilling crew commander to help transfer them to the stretchers and then across to the helicopter im afraid john youre going to have some unpleasant company on the trip durand and aaron tied up like chickens of course well thank you very much i canoccasionallybe as leery as you i wouldnt put it past cronkite to get aboard the seawitch how i havent the faintest idea but with a highly devious mind a driven man can accomplish most anything if he succeeded i dont want durand and aaron blowing the whistle on me i want to stay an inconspicuous and harmless seismologist larsen gave a few orders on the phone then he and mitchell went through to lord worths room lord worth was on the phone listening and scowling marina looked at mitchell with an expression as forbidding as her fathers i suppose youve been uttering the platform with a few more dead men you do me a grave injustice theres no one seawltek left to kill she gave what might have been a tiny shudder and looked away larsen said the ship is in our hands miss marina were expecting a little more trouble in about ten minutes but we can take care of that lord worth replaced his receiver whats that cronkite is sending some reinforcements by helicopter not manyeight or nine they wont have a chance hes under the impression that durand is still in charge here i take it hes not hes unconscious and tied up so is aaron a yearning look came over lord worths face is cronkite coming with them no how very unfortunate and ive just had some more bad news the torbello has broken down sabotage no the main fuelsupply line to its engine has fractured just a temporary stop though it may take some hours to repair but theres no cause for worry and halfhourly reports on the state of repairs should be forthcoming another disturbing point had arisen lord worth disclosed that no major marineinsurance companies or lloyds of london had ever heard of the existence of the tiburon the fact was less than surprising if one knew of mulhooneys renaming exploitshammond to tiburon to z alistalr maclean georgia the vessel had virtually ceased to exist even more disturbing however was the fact that the marine gulf corporation had reported the disappearance of its seismological survey vessel from freeport it was called the hammond the u s navy had two points of cold comfort to offer what the united states did with its obsolete submarines was to scrap them or sell them to foreign governments none had ever fallen into the hands of commercial companies or private individuals nor were there any cousteautype submersibles along the gulf coast the telephone bell jangled lord worth switched on the wall receivers the radio officer was succinct helicopter flying low due northwest five miles out well now larsen said this should provide a diversion coming mitchell in a minute i have a little note to write remember the note of course larsen left mitchell penned a brief note in neat printed script that left no room for misinterpretation folded it in his pocket and went to the door lord worth said mind if i come along well there wont be any danger but i think youd do better to listen for messages from radar radio sonar and so forth agreed and hi call up the secretary to see seawiteh what luck hes had in hauling those damned warships off my back marina said sweetly if theres no danger fra coming with you no you have a very limited vocabulary mr mitchell instead of trying to be a heroine you might try the florence nightingale bitthere are two very sick people through there who need their hands held youre much too bossy michael as they say a male chauvinist pig could you imagine me marrying a person like you your imagination is your own business besides ive never asked you to he left well she looked suspiciously at her father but lord worth had his risibility under complete control he picked up a phone and asked that the christmas tree be opened and the exploratory drilling restarted the helicopter was making its landing approach as mitchell joined larsen and palermo and his men in the deep shadows of the accommodation area the platform light had been dimmed but the helipad was brightly illuminated palermo had six portable searchlights in position he nodded to mitchell then made his un alistata maclean hurried way to the pad he was carrying an envelope in his hand the helicopter touched down the door opened and men with a discouraging assortment of automatic weapons started to disembark palermo said im marino whos in charge here me mortensen he was a bulky young man in battle fatigues looking more like a bright young lieutenant than the thug he undoubtedly was i thought durand was in charge here he is right now hes having a talk with lord worth hes waiting for you in worths quarters why are the deck lights so dim voltage drop being fixed the landing pads have their own generators he pointed over there mortensen nodded and led his eight men away palermo said be with you in a minute fve got a private message for the pilot from cronkite palermo climbed up into the helicopter he greeted the pilot and said i got a message here for you from cronkite the pilot registered a degree of surprise i was told to fly straight back wont be long seems cronkite is anxious to see worth and his daughters the pilot grinned and took the envelope from palermo he opened it examined both sides of a blank sheet of paper and said what gives a jo seawitch this palermo showed him a gun about the size of a small cannon dont be a dead hero the platform lights went out and six searchlights came on larsens stentorian voice carried clearly throw down your guns you havent got a chance one of mortensens men suicidally thought different he flung himself to the platform deck loosed off a burst of submachine fire and successfully killed one of the searchlights if he felt any sense of gratification it must have been the shortest on record for he was dead before the shattered glass stopped tinkling down on the platform the other eight men threw down their guns palermo sighed he said to the pilot see dead heroes are no good to anyone come on eight of the nine men including the pilot were shepherded into a windowless storeroom and locked inside the ninth mortensen was taken to the radio room where he was shortly joined by mitchell for the occasion mitchell had changed into a boiler suit and makeshift hood which not only effectively masked his face but also muffled his voice he had no wish to be identified he produced the paper on which he had made notes screwed the muzzle of his into the base of mortensens neck told him to contact cronkite and read out the message and that the slightest deviation from the script would mean a altotalr maclean shattered brain mortensen was no fool and in his peculiar line of trade he had looked into the face of death more than once he made the contact said all was well that he and durand were in complete control of the seawitch but that it might be several hours before the helicopter could return as lastminute engine failure had damaged the undercarriage cronkite seemed reasonably satisfied and hung up when larsen and mitchell returned to lord worths cabin the latter seemed in a more cheerful frame of mind the pentagon had reported that the two naval vessels from cuba and the one from venezuela were stopped in the water and appeared to be waiting instructions the torbello was on its way again and was expected to arrive in galveston in ninety minutes lord worth might have felt less satisfied if hed known that the torbello shaking hi every rivet seam and plate was several hundred miles from galveston traveling southwest in calm seas mulhooney was in no mood to hang around marina said accusingly i heard shots being fired out there just warning shots in the air mitchell said scares the hell out of people you made them all prisoner lord worth said irritably dont talk nonsense now do be quiet the commander and i have important matters to discuss seawitch well leave mitchell said he looked at marina come onlets see the patients off they followed the two stretchers out to the helicopter they were accompanied by durand and aaronboth with their hands tied behind their backs and on a nineinch hobbledr greenshaw and one of palermos men a menacing individual with a sawedoff shotgun who was to ride guard on the captives until they reached the mainland mitchell said to marina last chance no were going to make a great couple mitchell said gloomily monosyllabic yet they said their goodbyes watched the helicopter lift off and made their way back to lord worths quarters both worth and larsen were on separate lines and from the expressions on their faces it was clear that they were less happy with life than they might have been both men were trying with zero effect to obtain some additional tankerage there were in fact some halfdozen idle tankers on the south and east coasts in the ton range but all belonged to the major oil companies who would have gone to the stake before chartering any of their vessels to the north hudson oil company the nearest tankers of the required tonnage were either in britain norway or the mediterranean and to have brought them across would have involved an intolerable loss of time not to say moneythis last matter lying very close to lord worths heart he and larsen had even considered bringing one of their supertankers into service but had decided against it because of the tankers huge carrying capacity the loss in revenue would have been unbearably highand what had happened to the crusader might happen to a supertanker true they were insured at lloyds but that august firms marineaccident investigators were notoriously if justifiably cagey prudent and cautious men and although they invariably settled any genuine claim they tended to deliberate at length before making any final decision another call came through from the torbello on course its estimated time of arrival in galveston was one hour lord worth said gloomily that they had at least two tankers in operation they would just have to step up their already crowded schedules one half hour later another message came through from the tanker one half hour to galveston lord worth might have felt less assured had he known that now that dark had fallen the starlight leaving the georgia where it was had already moved away in the direction of the seawitch its engines running on its electrical batteries its chances of sonar detection by the seawitch were regarded as extremely small it carried with it highly skilled divers and an un seawitch pleasant assortment of mines limpet mines and amatol beehives all of which could be activated by remote radioactive control yet another half hour passed before the welcome news came through that the tanker torbello was safely berthed in galveston lord worth informed larsen he intended to make an immediate voicelink call to the port authorities in galveston to ensure the fastest turnaround ever money no object he got his voice link in just one minutethe lord worths of this world are never kept waiting when he made his customary peremptory demands the harbormaster expressed a considerable degree of surprise i really dont know what youre talking about sir goddam it i always know what im talking about not in this case lord worth im afraid youve been misinformed or hoaxed the torbello has not arrived but dammit ive just heard one moment please the moment passed into about thirty during which mitchell thoughtfully brought lord worth a glass of scotch which he halfconsumed at one gulp then the voice came through again bad news theres not only no sign of your all stair maelean tanker but our radar scanners show no signs of any vessel of that size within a radius of forty miles then what the devil can have happened to her i was speaking to her only two or three minutes ago on her own call sign yes dammit then obviously shes in no trouble lord worth hung up without as much as a courtesy thank you he glowered at larsen and mitchell as if what had happened had been their fault he said at length i can only conclude that the captain of the torbello has gone off his rocker mitchell said and i conclude that hes under lock and key aboard his own ship lord worth was heavily ironic in addition to your many other accomplishments youve now become psychic your torbello has been hijacked hijacked hijacked now youve gone off your rocker who ever heard of a tanker being hijacked who ever heard of a jumbo jet being hijacked until the first one was after what happened to the crusader in galveston the captain of the torbello would have been extremely leery of being approached much less boarded by any other vessel unless it were a craft with respectability beyond question the only two such types ft scan itch of craft are naval or coast guard weve heard that the marine gulf corporations survey vessel has been stolen a lot of those survey vessels are excoast guard with landing space for a helicopter to carry out seismological pattern bombing that ship was called the hammond with your connections you could find out about it in minutes lord worth did find out in minutes he said so youre right he was too dumbfounded even to apologize and this of course was the tiburon that cronkite sailed from galveston god only knows what name it goes under now what next i wonder mitchell said a call from cronkite id guess what would he call me for some tough demands id say i dont know lord worth was nothing if not resilient he had powerful and influential friends he called an admiral in naval headquarters in washington and demanded that an airsea search unit be dispatched immediately to the scene the navy apologetically said that they would have to obtain the permission of the commanderinchief that is the president the president he knew would profess a profound if polite degree of disinterest neither he nor congress had any reason to love the oil companies who had so frequently flouted themwhich was less than fair to lord worth who had never flouted anyone in wash allstalr maelcam ington in his life more the search almost certainly lay outside their jurisdictional waters besides it was raining in the gulf and black as the pit and though their radar might well pick up a hundred ships in the area visual identification would be impossible he tried the cia then disinterest was even more profound in the several years past they had had their fingers badly burned in public and all their spare time was devoted to licking their wounds the fbi curtly reminded him that their activities were purely internal and that anyway they got seasick whenever they ventured on water lord worth considered making an appeal to the un but was dissuaded by larsen and mitehell not only would the arab states venezuela nigeria every communist country and what now went by the name of the third worldand they held the vast majority of votes hi the un veto any such suggestion the un had no legal power to initiate any such action apart from that by that time the entire un complex were probably hi bed anyway for once in his life lord worth appeared to be at a loss life it appeared could hold no more for him lord worth was discovering that upon occasion he could be as fallible as the next man a voiceover call came through it was as mitchell had predicted it would be cronkite he was glad to inform lord worth that there was seawiteh no cause for concern over the torbello as she was in safe and sound hands where had his daughter not been present lord worth would undoubtedly have qualified his question with a few choice adjectives i prefer not to specify exactly enough to say that she is securely anchored in the territorial waters of a central american country it is my intention to dispose of this oil to this very poor and oildeficient countryhe did not mention that it was his intention to sell it at half price which would bring in a few acceptable hundred thousands of dollarsthen take the tanker out to sea and sink it unless of course unless what lord worth asked his voice had assumed a peculiar hoarseness unless you close down the christmas tree on the seawiteh and immediately stop all pumping and drilling fool hows that your thugs have already attended to that havent they told you i want proof i want mortensen lord worth said wearily hold on well get him mitchell went to fetch him by the time he returned overalled and masked mortensen had been thoroughly briefed he confirmed to cronkite that all pumping and drilling had stopped cronkite expressed his satisfaction and the radio alistair maclean link went dead mitchell removed the from below mortensens ear and two of palermos men took him from the room mitchell took off his hood and marina looked at him with a mixture of horror and incredulity she whispered you were ready to kill him not at all i was going to pat him on the head and tell him what a good boy he was i asked you to get off this rig o chapter worth had barely begun to wipe his brow when two men hurried into the room one was palermo and the other was one of the rig crew simpson whose duty it was to monitor the sensory instruments attached to the platforms legs and the tensioning anchor cables he was obviously in a state of considerable agitation lord worth said what fresh horror does fate hold in store for us now somebody below the rig sir my instruments have gone a bit haywire some object almost certainly metallic is ia intermittent contact with the western leg ari alistair maclean there can be no doubt about this simpson shook his head seems damnably odd that cronkite would try to bring down the seawitch with his own men on board mitchell said maybe he doesnt want to bring it down just damage the leg enough to destroy the buoyancy in the leg and the adjacent members and tilt the seawitch so the drill and pumphug mechanisms dont work maybe anything or maybe he would be prepared to sacrifice his own men to get you he turned to palermo i know youve got scuba equipment aboard show me they left marina said i suppose hes off to murder someone else hes not really human is he lord worth looked at her without enthusiasm if you call being inhuman wanting to see that you dont die then hes inhuman theres only one person aboard this rig he really cares for and you damned well know it i never thought fd be ashamed of a daughter of mine palermo had in fact two trained scuba divers with him but mitchell chose only one to accompany him palermo was not a man to be easily impressed but he had seen enough of mitchell not to question his judgment in remarkably quick time mitchell and the other man who went by the name of sawyers were dressed in scuba outfits and were equipped with reloadable compressedair harpoon guns and sheath knives seawitefe they were lowered to the water by the only available means on such a giant tlpa wiremesh cage attached to the boom of the derrick crane at water level they opened the hinged door dived and swam to the giant western leg simpson had made no mistake they were indeed at work down there two of them attached by airlines and cables to the shadowy outline of a vessel some twenty feet above them both wore powerful headlamps they were energetically engaged in attaching limpet mines conventional magnetic mines and wraparound rolls of beehive amatol to the enormous leg they had enough explosives there mitchell figured to bring down the eiffel tower maybe cronkite did intend to destroy the leg that cronkite was unhinged seemed more probable than not the two saboteurs were not only energetically engaged in their task they were so exclusively preoccupied with it that they failed to notice the stealthy approach of mitchell and sawyers the two scuba divers pressed their masks together looked into each others eyesthere was sufficient reflected light from the other divers to allow them to do thisand nodded simultaneously not much given to squeamishness where potential killers were concerned they harpooned the two saboteurs through their backs in both cases death was instantaneous mitchell and sawyers reloaded their compressedair harpoons then for alistair macl an good measure sliced their two victims breathing tubes which also contained the communication wires on the starlight easton and his crew were instantly aware that something had gone drastically wrong the dead men were pulled up the harpoons still imbedded in their backs and as the corpses were being hauled over the gunwales two of the crew cried out in agony mitchell and sawyers had surfaced and picked off two more targets whether either had been mortally or grievously injured was impossible to say but far more than enough had happened for easton to take off at speed this time on his much faster diesels the engines were admittedly noisy but the darkness was so intense that it was impossible for the alerted gunners on the platform to obtain an accurate fix on them the two scuba divers their own headlights now switched on swam down to the spot where the mines and explosives had been attached to the legs there were time fuses attached to both mines and explosives those they detached and let fall to the bottom of the ocean for good measure they also removed the detonators the explosives now harmless they unwound and let them follow the time fuses the mines they prudently left where they were both men were explosives experts but not deepwater explosives experts mines as many ghosts can attest can be sea witch very tricky and unpredictable they consist of tnt amatol or some such conventional explosive as the main charge in their central tube they have a primer which may consist of one of a variety of slowburning explosives and fitted to the top of the primer is a traveling detonator activated by sea pressure which usually consists of seventyseven grains of fulminate of mercury even with this detonator removed the primer can still detonate under immense pressure neither diver had any wish to blow up the piledriven anchors or the tensioning cables attached to the anchors via the derrick crane they made their way back to the platform and reported to the radio room they had to wait for some time before making their report for lord worth was in a far from amicable telephone conversation with cronkite marina sat apart her hands clenched and her normally tanned face a grayish color she looked at mitchell then averted her eyes as if she never wished to set eyes on him again which at the moment she probably didnt cronkite was furious you murderous bastard worth he was clearly unaware that he was talking in the presence of ladies three of my men dead harpooned through the back involuntarily marina looked at mitchell again mitchell had the impression that he was either a monster from outer space or from the nethermost depths at any rate a monster s all stair maclean lord worth was no less furious it would be a pleasure to repeat the processwith you as the central figure this time cronkite choked then said with what might have been truth my intention was just temporarily to incapacitate the seawitch without harming anyone aboard but if you want to play it rough youll have to find a new seawitch in twentyfour hours thats if youre fortunate enough to survive im going to blast you out of the water lord worth was calmer now it would be interesting to know how youre going to achieve that my information is that your warships have been ordered back to base theres more than one way of blasting you out of the water cronkite sounded very sure of himself in the meantime im going to offload the torbellos oil then sink it in point of fact cronkite had no intention of sinking the tanker the torbello was a panamanian registered tanker and cronkite was not lacking in panamanian friends a tanker could be easily disposed of for a very considerable sum the conversation if such an acrimonious exchange could be so called ended abruptly mitchell said one things for sure cronkite is a fluent liar hes nowhere near central america not with that kind of reception and we heard him talking to his friend durand he elected not to come on that helicopter flight seawitch which lasted only fifteen minutes hes lying out there somewhere just over the horizon lord worth said how did things go down there you heard what cronkite said there was no trouble on our part do you expect more yeah cronkite sounds too damn confident for me how do you think itll come your guess is as good as mine he might even try the same thing again lord worth was incredulous after what happened to him he may be counting on the unexpected one thing tm sure of if he does try the same again hell use different tactics im sure he wont try an air or submarine approach if for no other reason than that he doesnthe canthave skilled men so i dont think youll need your radar or sonar watchers tonight in any case your radio operator may need a restafter all hes got an alarm callup in his cabin td keep simpson on duty though just in case our friends try for one of the legs again palermo said but theyd be waiting this time theyd be operating close to the surface theyd have armed guards waiting to protect the divers maybe even infrared searchlights that we couldnt see from the platform you and sawyers were lucky the first time and luck depends on sur all stair maclean prise but there wouldnt be any surprise this time we dont need luck lord worth wouldnt have had all those depth charges stolen and brought aboard unless one of your men is an expert in depth charges youve got such a man yeah palermo eyed him speculatively cronin expetty officer why he could arrange the detonator setting so that thedepth charge would explode immediately or soon after hitting the water i guess so again why we roll three depth charges along the platform to within say twentyfive yards of each of the legs your friend cronin could advise us on this my distance could be wrong if simpson detects anything on his sensors we just push one of the depth charges over the side the blast effect should have no effect on the leg i doubt if the boat with the divers would get anything more than a hard shaking but for divers in the water the concussive shock effects could hardly miss being fatal palermo looked at him with cold appraising eyes for a man supposed to be on the side of the law mitchell youre the most coldblooded bastard fve ever met if you want to die just say so youd find it a bit uncomfortable nine hundred feet down in the gulf i suggest you get cronin and a couple of your men and get going on the depth charges sea witch mitchell followed to watch palermo cronin and two of their men at work cronin agreed with mitchelts estimate of placing the depth charges twentyfive yards from the legs as he stood there marina came up to him she said more men are going to die arent they michael i hope not but you are getting ready to kill arent you im getting ready to survive im getting ready for all of us to survive she took his arm do you like killing no then how come youre so good at it somebody has to be for the good of mankind i suppose look you dont have to talk to me he paused and went on slowly cops kill soldiers kill airmen kill they dont have to like it in the first world war a guy named marshal foch got to be the roost decorated soldier of the war for being responsible for the deaths of a million men the fact that most of them were his own men would seem to be beside the point i dont hunt i dont shoot game i dont even fish i mean i like lamb as much as the next man but i wouldnt put a hook in ones throat and drag it around a field for half an hour before it dies from agony and exhaustion all i do is exterminate vermin to me all crooks armed or not are vermin alistalr maclean is that why you and john got fired from the police do i have to tell you that have you ever killed what you what i would call a good person no but unless you shut up in spite of everything i think i might still marry you ive never asked you well what are you waiting for mitchell sighed then smiled marina worth would you do me the honor behind them lord worth coughed marina swung round daddy she said you have a genius for turning up at the wrong moment lord worth was mild the right moment i would have said my unreserved congratulations he looked at mitchell well you certainly took your time about it everything shipshape and secured for the night as far as i can guess at what goes on in cronkites mind my confidence in you my boy is total well its bed for mei feel perhaps not unaccountably extremely tired marina said me too well goodnight fiance she kissed him lightly and left with her father for once lord worths confidence in mitchell was slightly misplaced the latter had made a mistake though a completely unwitting one in seawftch sending the radio officer off duty for had that officer remained on duty he would undoubtedly have picked up the news flash about the theft of the nuclear weapons from the netley rowan arsenal mitchell could not have failed to put two and two together during the third hour of lord worths conscienceuntroubled sleep mulhooney had been extremely active he had discharged his fifty thousand tons of oil and taken the torbello well outto sea far over the horizon he returned later with two companions in the ships only motorized lifeboat with the sad news that in the sinking of the tanker a shattering explosion had occurred which had decimated his crew they three were the only survivors the decimated crew were at that moment taking the torbello south to panama the official condolences were widespread apparently sincere and wholly hypocritical when a tanker blows up its motorized lifeboat does not survive intact the republic had no diplomatic relations with the united states and the only things they would cheerfully have extradited to that country were cholera and the bubonic plague a private jet awaited the three at the tiny airport passports duly stamped mulhooney and his friends filed a flight plan for guatemala some hours later they arrived at the houston international airport with much of the ten mil allstair madean lion dollars still remaining at his disposal cronkite was not the man to worry about incidental expenses mulhooney and his friends immediately hired a longrange helicopter and set out for the gulf in the fourth hour of his sleep which had remained undisturbed by the sound of a considerable underwater explosion lord worth was unpleasantly awakened by a call from a seethingly mad cronkite who accused him of killing two more of his men and warned that he was going to extract a fearful vengeance lord worth hung up without bothering to reply sent for mitchell and learned that cronkite had indeed made another attempt to sabotage the western leg the depth charge had apparently done everything expected of it for their searchlights had picked up the bodies of two divers floating on the surface the craft that had been carrying them could not have been seriously damaged for they had heard the sound of its diesels starting up instead of making a straight escape it had disappeared under the rig and by the time they had crossed to the other side of the seawitch it was long gone into the darkness and rain lord worth smiled happily and went back to sleep in the fifth hour of his sleep he would not have been smiling quite so happily if he had been aware of certain strange activities that were tak a seawitch ing place in a remote louisiana motel one exclusively owned by lord worth himself here it was that the seawitchs relief crews spent their time off in the strictest seclusion in addition to abundant food drink films tv and a highclass bordello it offered every amenity offduty oilrig men could ever have wished for not that any of them would have wanted to leave the compound gates anyway nine out of ten of them were wanted by the law and total privacy was a paramount requirement the intruders some twenty in all arrived in the middle of the night they were led by a man named gregson of all cronkites associates he was by far the most dangerous and lethal and was possessed of the morality and instincts of a ferdelance with a toothache the motel staff were all asleep and were chloroformed before they had any opportunity of regaining consciousness the rig relief crew also were all asleep but in a somewhat different fashion and for different reasons liquor is forbidden on oil rigs and the relief crews on the night before returning to duty generally made the best of their last chance their dormant states ranged from the merely befuddled to the paralytic the rounding up of them most of whom remained still asleep on their feet took no more than five minutes the only two relatively sober members of the relief crew tried to offer resistance gregson with a aliatalr maelean seawitefa silenced beretta gunned them down as if they had been wild dogs the captives were transported in a completely standard albeit temporarily purloined moving van to an abandoned and very isolated warehouse on the outskirts of town somewhat less than salubrious it was perfectly fitted for gregsons purpose the prisoners were neither bound nor gagged which would have been pointless in the presence of two armed guards who carried the customary intimidating machine carbines in point of fact the carbines too were superfluous the besotted captives had already drifted off into a dreamless slumber it was in the sixth hour of lord worths equally dreamless slumber that gregson and his men lifted off in one of lord worths helicopters the two pilots had been reluctant to accept them as passengers but schmeissers are powerfully persuasive agents it was in the seventh hour of lord worths slumber that mulhooney and his two colleagues touched down on the empty helipad of the georgia as cronkites own helicopter was temporarily marooned on the seawitch he had no compunction in impounding both the helicopter and its hapless pilot at almost exactly the same moment another helicopter touched down on the seawitch and a solitary passenger and pilot emerged the passenger was dr greenshaw and he looked and was a very tired elderly man he went straight to the sick bay and without even trying to remove his clothes lay down on one of the cots and composed himself for sleep he should he supposed have reported to lord worth that his daughter melinda and john roomer were in good hands and good shape but good news could wait on the eighth hour with the dawn in the sky lord worth a man who enjoyed his sleep awoke stretched himself luxuriously pulled on his splendidly embroidered dressing gown and strolled out onto the platform the rain had stopped the sun was tipping the horizon and there was every promise of a beautiful day to come privately congratulating himself on his prescience that no trouble would occur during the night he retired to his quarters to perform his customary and leisurely morning ablutions lord worths selfcongratulations on his prescience were entirely premature fifteen minutes earlier the radio operator newly returned to duty had picked up a news broadcast that he didnt like at all and gone straight to mitchelts room like every man on board even including larsen o alistair macilean and palermo he knew that the man to contact in an emergency was mitchell the thought of alerting lord worth never entered his head he found mitchell shaving mitchell looked tiredless than surprising as he had spent most of the night awake mitchell said no more trouble i hope i dont know he handed mitchell a strip of teletype it read two tactical nuclear weapons stolen from the netley rowan arsenal yesterday afternoon intelligence suspects they are being flown or helicoptered south over gulf of mexico to an unknown destination a worldwide alert has been issued anyone able to provide information should jesus get hold of this arsenal any way you can use lord worths name be with you in a minute mitchell was with him in half a minute the operator said im through already not much cooperation though give me that phone my names mitchell whos speaking please colonel pryce the tone wasnt exactly distant just a senior officer talking to a civilian i work for lord worth you can check that with the fort lauderdale police the pentagon or the secretary of state he said to the operator but loudly enough that pryce could hear get lord worth here i dont care if hes in ms seawiteh damned bath just get him here now back on the phone he said colonel pryce an officer of your grade should know that lord worths daughters have been kidnaped i was hired to recover them and i did so more important this oil rig the seawitch is now under threat of destruction two attempts have already been made they were unsuccessful the pentagon will confirm that theyve stopped three foreign warships headed here for the purpose of destroying the seawitch i believe those nukes weapons are heading this way i want full information about them and til warn you that worth will interpret any failure to provide this information as a gross dereliction of duty and you know the clout that lord worth has there was a far from subtle change in colonel pryces tone its quite unnecessary to threaten me just a minute lord worths just arrived mitchell gave a brief resume of his phone conversation making sure that pryce could hear every word nuclear bloody bombs thats why cronkite said he could blast us out of the water lord worth snatched the phone from mitchell worth here i have a hotline to the secretary of state dr benton i could patch him in in fifteen seconds do you want me to do that that will not be necessary lord worth zt alistair maclean then give us a detailed description of those damned things and tell us how they work pryce almost eagerly gave the description it was almost precisely similar to the one that captain martin had given to the bogus colonel farquharson but martin was a new officer and shaky on his details the nuclear devicesyou can hardly call them bombsare probably twice as effective as he said they took the wrong type those devices have no black button to shut off in emergency and they have a ninetyminute setting not sixty and they can be radioactivated something complicated i mean a vhp number or something of the kind something very uncomplicated you cant expect a soldier in the heat of battle to remember abstruse numbers its simply a pearshaped device with a plastic seal strip that off and turn a black switch through three hundred and sixty degrees its important to remember that turning this switch off will deactivate the detonating mechanism in the device it can be turned on again at any time if it should be used against us we have a huge oilstorage tank nearby wouldnt this cause a massive oil slick siroil is by nature combustible and much more easily vaporized than steel thank you seems to me you need a squadron of super seawiiek sonic fighterbombers out there ill relay the request but theyll have to get pentagon permission first thank you again lord worth and mitchell left for the formers quarters lord worth said two things were only assuming although it would be dangerous not to assume that those damned things are meant for us besides if we keep our radar sonar and sensory posts manned i dont see how cronkite could approach and deliver them its hard to see how but then its harder to figure out that bastards turn of mind from lord worths helicopter gregson made contact with the georgia were fifteen miles out cronkite himself replied well be airborne in ten a wall radio crackled in lord worths room helicopter approaching from the northeast no sweat relief crew lord worth had gone back to his shower when the relief helicopter touched down mitchell was in his laboratory looking very professional in his white coat and glasses dr greenshaw was still asleep apart from gagging and manacling the pilots the helicopter passengers had offered them no violence they disembarked in quiet and orderly alistair maelean fashion the drill duty crew observed their arrival without any particular interest they had been welltrained to mind their own business and had highly personal reasons for not fraternizing with unknowns and the new arrivals were unknowns off the coast lord worth owned no fewer than nine oil rigsall legally leased and paid for and for reasons best known to his devious self he was in the habit of regularly rotating his drill crews the new arrivals carried the standard shoulderslung clothesbags those bags did indeed contain a minimal amount of clothes but not clothing designed to be worn the clothes were there merely to conceal and muffle the shape of the machine pistols and other more deadly weapons in the bags thanks to the instructions he had received from cronkite via durand gregson knew exactly where to go he noted the presence of two idly patrolling guards and marked them down for death he led his men to the oriental quarters where they laid their bags on the platform and unzipped them windows were smashed and what followed was sheer savage massacre within half a dozen seconds of machinegun fire bazooka fire and incinerating flamethrowers all of which had been preceded by a flurry of teargas bombs all screaming inside had ceased the two advancing guards were mown down even as they drew their seawitek guns the only survivor was larsen who had been in his own private room in the back palermo and all his men were dead figures appeared almost at the same instant from the quarters at the end of the block soundproofed though those quarters were the noise outside had been too penetrating not to be heard there were four of themtwo men in white coats a man in a japanese kimono and a blackhaired guard in a wrap one of gregsons men fired twice at the nearest whitecoated figure and mitchell staggered and fell backward to the deck gregson brutally smashed the wrist of the man who had fired who screamed in agony as the gun fell from his shattered hand you bastard idiot gregsons voice was as vicious as his appearance the hard men only mr cronkite said gregson was nothing if not organized he detailed five groups of two men one group herded the drillingrig crew into the occidental quarters the second third and fourth went respectively to the sensory room the sonar room and the radar room there they tied up but did not otherwise harm the operators before they riddled all the equipment with a burst of machinegun bullets for all practical purposes the seawitch was now blind deaf and benumbed the fifth group went to the radio room where the operator was tied up but his equipment left intact o alistair maelean dr greenshaw approached gregson you are the leader yes tm a doctor he nodded to mitchell whose white coat accentuated the stains fcf his blood and was rolling about in a convincing manner marina bending over him with bitter tears rolling down her cheeks hes hurt bad i must take him into the sick bay and patch him up we got no quarrel with you gregson said which was unwittingly the most foolish remark hed ever made dr greenshaw helped the weak and staggering mitchell into the sick bay where the door closed behind him he made an immediate and remarkable recovery marina stared at him in astonishment then in something approaching relieved ire why you deceiving thats no way to talk to a wounded man he was pulling off his white coat coat and shirt tve never seen you cry before makes you look even more beautiful and thats real blood he turned to dr greenshaw superficial wound on the left shoulder a scratch on the right forearm deadeye dick himself now do a real good job on me doc right arm bandaged from elbow to wrist left arm bandaged from shoulder to above the elbow with a great big sling marina even ravishing beauties like you carry face powder i hope youre no exception sea wit eh not yet mollified she said stiffly i have some baby powder she added nastily get it please five minutes later mitchell had been rendered into the epitome of the walking wounded his right arm was heavily bandaged and his left arm was swathed in white from shoulder to wrist the sling was voluminous his face was very pale he left for his room and returned a few seconds later where have you been she asked suspiciously he reached inside the depths of the sling and pulled out his silenced fully loaded he returned it to its hiding place where it was quite invisible never give up do you her voice held a curious mixture of awe and bitterness not when im about to be vaporized dr greenshaw stared at him what do you mean our friend cronkite has heisted a couple of tactical nuclear weapons he plans to finish off the seawitch in fourth of july style he should be here about now now doc i want you to do something for me take the biggest medical bag you have and tell gregson that it is your humanitarian duty to go into the occidental quarters to help any of the dying or if necessary put them out of their agony i know theyve got a fair supply of hand grenades in there i want some alistair maelean no sooner said than done god you look awful destroys my faith in myself as a doctor they went outside cronkites helicopter was indeed just touching down cronkite himself was the first out followed by mulhooney the three bogus officers who had stolen the nuclear weapons the commandeered pilot and lastly easton easton was the unknown quantity mitchell did not appreciate it at the time but eastons starlight had been so badly damaged by the depth charge that it was no longer serviceable less than four miles away what appeared to be a coast guard cutter was heading straight for the seawitch it required no guessing to realize that this was the missing hammond the infamous tiburon the present georgia dr greenshaw approached gregson td like to have a look at what youve left of those quarters maybe theres someone still alive in there gregson pointed to an iron door tm more interested in whos in there spicerthis to one of his mena bazooka shot at that lock thats hardly necessary greenshaw said mildly a knock from me is all thats needed thats commander larsen the boss of the oil rig hes no enemy of yours he just sleeps here because he likes his privacy dr greenshaw knocked commander larsen ifs okay its me greenshaw come on out if you dont seawitch therere some people whore going to blast your door down and you with it come on man there was the turning of a heavy key and larsen emerged he looked dazed almost shellshocked as well he might he said what the hell goes on youve been taken over friend gregson said larsen was dressed greenshaw was pleased to note in a voluminous lumberjacket cinched at the waist search him they searched and found nothing wheres scoffield larsen said greenshaw said in the other quarters he should be okay palermo dead and all his men at least i think so im just going to have a look stooping his shoulders to look more nearly eighty than seventy dr greenshaw shambled along the shattered corridor but he could have saved himself the trouble of acting gregson had just met cronkite outside the doorway and the two men were talking in animated and clearly selfcongratulatory terms after the first few steps greenshaw realized that there could be nobody left alive in that charnel house those who were dead were very dead indeed most of them destroyed beyond recognition either cut up by machinegun fire shattered by bazookas or shriveled by the fiame alistair maeleaa throwers but he did find the primary reason of his visita box of hand grenades in prime condition and a couple of schmeisser subautomatics fully loaded a few of the grenades he stuffed into the bottom of his medical bag he peered out one of the shattered windows at the back and found the area below in deep shadow he carefully lowered some grenades to the platform and the two schmeissers beside them then he made his way outside again it was apparent that cronkite and lord worth had already met although the meeting could not have been a normal one lord worth was lying apparently senseless on his back blood flowing from smashed lips and apparently broken nose while both cheeks were badly bruised marina was bending over him daubing at his wounds with a flimsy handkerchief cronkite his face unmarked but his knuckles bleeding had apparently for the moment at least lost interest in lord worth no doubt waiting until lord worth had regained full consciousness before starting in on him again lord worth whispered between smashed lips sorry my darling sorry my beloved my fault and all my fault the end of the road yes her voice was as low as his own but strangely there were no tears in her eyes but not for us not while michael is alive lord worth looked at michael through rapidly closing eyes what can a cripple like that do sea witch she said quietly but with utter conviction hell kill cronkite and his whole mob he tried to smile through his smashed lips i thought you hated killing not vermin not people who do things like this to you mitchell spoke quietly to dr greenshaw then both men approached cronkite and gregson who broke off what appeared to be either a discussion or an argument dr greenshaw said youve done your damn murderous work all too well gregson theres hardly a soul hi there even recognizable as a human being cronkite said whos he a doctor cronkite looked at mitchell who was looking worse by the minute and this a scientist shot by mistake hes in great pain greenshaw said fve no xray equipment but i suspect the arms broken just below the shoulder cronkite was almost jovial the joviality of a man now almost detached from reality an hour from now he wont be feeling a thing greenshaw said wearily i dont know what you mean i want to take him back to the sick bay and give him a painkilling injection why sure i want everyone to be fully prepared for whats about to happen and whats that alistair maclean later later greenshaw and the unsteady mitchell moved off they reached the sick bay passed inside went through the opposite side and made their unobserved way to the radio room greenshaw stood guard just inside the door while mitchell ignoring the bound operator went straight to the transceiver he raised the roamer inside twenty seconds give me captain conde speaking on your next circuit out to the oil tank get around behind it then head south at full speed the seawitch has been taken over but im sure theres nobody here who can operate the antiaircraft guns stop at twenty miles and issue a general warning to all ships and aircraft not to approach within twenty miles of the seawitch you have its coordinates yes but why because theres going to be a mighty big bang christs sake dont argue dont argue about what a voice behind mitchell said mitchell turned round slowly the man behind the pistol was smiling a smile that somehow lacked a genuine warmth greenshaw had been pushed to one side and the gun moved in a slow arc covering them both i got a hunch gregsoa would like to see you both seawiteh mitchell rose turned halfstaggered and clutched his right forearm inside the sling greenshaw said sharply gods sake man cant you see hes ill the man glanced at greenshaw for just a second but a second was all that mitchell required the bullet from the silenced took the gunman through the heart mitchell peered through the doorway there was a fair degree of shadow there no one in sight and the edge of the platform not more than twenty feet away a few seconds later the dead man vanished over the edge mitchell and greenshaw returned to the main body of the company via the sick bay cronkite and gregson were still in deep discussion larsen stood some distance apart apparently in a state of profound dejection greenshaw approached him and said quietly how do you feel how would you feel if you knew they intended to kill us all youll feel better soon round the back of the building when you get the chance youll find some hand grenades which should rest comfortably inside that lumberjacket of yours youll also find two loaded schmeissers i have a few grenades in my bag here and mitchell has his inside his sling larsen took care not to show his feelings he looked as morose as ever all he said was boy oh boy oh boy alistalr maelean lord worth was on his feet now supported by his daughter mitchell joined them how do you feel lord worth mouthed his words with understandable bitterness im in great shape youll feel better soon he lowered his voice and spoke to marina when i give the word say you want to go to the ladies room but dont go there go to the generator room youll see a red lever there marked deck lights pull it down after you count twenty throw it back on again cronkite and gregson appeared to have finished their discussion from cronkites smile it appeared that his view had prevailed lord worth marina larsen greenshaw and mitchell stood together a forlorn and huddled group facing them were the ranks of cronkite mulhooney easton and the bogus colonel farquharson lieutenantcolonel dewings major breckley gregson and his killers a formidable group and armed to the teeth cronkite spoke to a man by his side check the man lifted a walkietalkie spoke into it and nodded he said to cronkite charges secured in position excellent teh them to go due north for twenty miles and stay there this was done unfortunately for cronkite his view to the west was blocked by the shattered building behind him and he could not see that the roomer was already proceeding steadily to the south o scawiteh cronkite smiled well worth its the end of the road for both you and the seawitch he dug into a pocket and produced a black pearshaped metal container this is a radioactive detonating device note this small switch here its supposed to be good for sixty minutes but i have already run off ten minutes of it fifty more minutes and poof the seawitch you worth and everyone aboard will be vaporized nobodys going to feel a thing i assure you you mean you intend to kill all my innocent employees aboard the rig cronkite you are stark raving mad never saner cant have any witnesses left to identify us then we destroy two of the helicopters cripple your derrick crane smash your radio room and take off in the other two helicopters you could of course figure on jumping into the gulf but your chances of survival would be about the same as a suicide jumping off the golden gate bridge mitchell nudged marina she said in a faint voice may i go to the ladies room cronkite was joviality itself course but make it snappy fifteen seconds later the deck lights went out in the end it was mitchell with his extraordinary capacity to see in the dark who ran round the corner of the shattered building retrieved the two schmeissershe didnt bother about the grenadesreturned and thrust one alistair maclean into larsens hands in eight seconds two men with submachine guns can achieve an extraordinary amount of carnage larsen was firing blind but mitchell could see and pick out his targets they were helped in a most haphazard fashion by dr greenshaw who flung grenades at random inflicting even more damage on the already shattered building but not actually injuring anyone the lights came on again there were still seven people left alivecronkite mulhooney easton gregson and three of his men to those seven mitchell said all right drop your guns shattered and stunned though the survivors were they still had enough wits left to comply at once marina arrived back and was promptly sick in a very unladylike fashion mitchell put down his schmeisser and advanced on cronkite give me that detonating device cronkite removed it slowly from his pocket and lifted his arm preparatory to throwing it over the side whatever else it would have meant the destruction of the seawitch cronkite screamed in agony as the bullet from mitchelts shattered his right elbow mitchell caught the detonating device even before it could reach the deck he said to larsen are there two absolutely seawitch secure places with no windows and iron doors which can be locked without any possibility of opening them from the inside just two safe as fort knox vaults along here search these guys and search them thoroughly make sure they havent even got a penknife larsen searched not even a penknife he led them to a steelreinforced celllike structure and he and mitchell ushered them inside in spite of his agony cronkite said youre not going to leave us in here for gods sake same as you were going to leave us mitchell paused then added soothingly as you said you wont feel a thing he closed the door doublelocked it and put the key in his pocket he said to larsen the other cell along here this is madness lord worths voice was almost a shout the seawitch is safe now why in gods name destroy it mitchell ignored him he glanced at the timing device on the detonator twentynine minutes to go wed better move he placed the device on the floor of the cell locked the door and sent the key spinning far out over the gulf get the men out of the occidental buildings and out of the sensory radar sonar and radio rooms and make sure that all the helicopter pilots are safe he glaaced at his watch twentyfive minutes alistair maelean everyone moved with alacrity except for lord worth who merely stood with a stunned look on his face larsen said do we need this mad rush mitchell said mildly how do we know that the settings on that detonator are accurate the mad rush redoubled itself thirteen minutes before the deadline the last of the helicopters took off and headed south the first to land on the roomers helipad held mitchell larsen lord worth and his daughter in addition to the doctor and several rig men while the other helicopters still hovered overhead they were still only about fourteen miles south of the seawitch which was as far as the roamer had succeeded in getting but mitchell reckoned the margin of safety more than sufficient he spoke to conde who assured him that every vessel and aircraft had been warned to keep as far away as possible from the danger area when the seawitch blew up dead on schedule it did so with a spectacular effect that would have satisfied even the most ghoulish there was even a miniature mushroom cloud such as the public had become accustomed to in the photographs of detonating atom bombs seventeen seconds later those on the roamer heard the thunderclap of sound and shortly afterward a series of miniature but harmless tidal waves rocked but did not unduly disturb the roamer seawlteh after mitchell had told conde to broadcast the news to all aircraft and shipping he turned to find a stonyfaced marina confronting him well youve lost daddy his seawitch i do hope youre satisfied with yourself my my how bitter we are yes its a satisfactory job even if i have to say it myself obviously nobody else is going to why why why every man who died there was a murderer some of them mass murderers they might have got away to countries with no extradition treaties with us even if they were caught their cases might have dragged on for years it would have been very difficult to get proof and of course parole after a few years this way we know theyll never kill again and it was worth it to destroy daddys pride and joy listen stupid my fatherinlawtobe is that hell never be she was glaring at him so okay the old pirate is almost as big a crook as any of them he associated with and hired for lethal purposes known criminals he broke into two federal arsenals and mounted the equipment on the seawitch if the seawitch had survived federal investigators would have been aboard in an hour or so hed have got at least fifteen to twenty years hi prison and hed probably have died in prison now her eyes were wide with fear and understanding but now every last bit of evidence is at the bottom of the gulf nothing can ever be traced against him thats really why you vaporized the seawitch he eyed her affectionately why should i admit anything to an exfiancee mrs michael mitchell she mused i suppose i could go through life with a worse name
